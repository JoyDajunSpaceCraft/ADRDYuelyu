How do you deal with somebody who's always been abusive, but it's only gotten worse since the illness started?
my dad has always had a temper. he's always been angry. he's always been an emotionally and verbally abusive to my mom.edit: i realize now that i'm ranting and venting more than i might actually asking a question. i'm sorry. not a lot of people you can talk to about this sort of thingbut it didn't used to be that bad. he kept himself in check. throughout most of my life i didn't even realize how much of an asshole he was until i was in my mid 20sbut now that he has early onset alzheimer's, it's amplified all of his worst qualities. angry all of the time about things that don't matter. and then once he starts on a tangent, he starts talking in circles, and he's yelling about things that don't make sense, and he usually forgets what he was angry about in the first place but he still continues to be angry.he's not far enough along for us to put him into some kind of care home. and even if he was, they probably kick him out for being abusive to the staff.my mom should have divorced him and left him decades ago. but now it feels too late. part of it's the guilt. she doesn't want to leave somebody who's dealing with something he can't help. she'd feel like a terrible person for abandoning someone in need. and he has no friends. and his family doesn't like him, none of  his sister would take him in.and because he doesn't have any other support, anywhere else to go, i'm convinced that a restraining order won't be enough. he'll forget and keep showing up at the house anyway.she can't afford to just pack up and leave him. even though that's probably the best and only option.i've seen so many stories of people losing a family member to alzheimer's. somebody tragic stories of people talking about how they're watching their loved ones slip away. and it's heartbreaking. but that is not been my experience at all. this asshole has become an incredible burden.i mean, i'm damn near 40 and i'm still living with my parents. i moved back in after his first heart attack to help him out. but before things got stable enough for me to move out again, that's when his alzheimer's started showing signs. and now i just don't feel safe leaving her alone with him.tl;dr, how do you deal with someone with alzheimer's when they're alzheimer's amplifies all of their worst qualities to the point where you wish they would just fucking go away?

Update to my post; moved my dad in to Memory care
quick update to my [previous post]( about whether to tell my dad about moving in to memory care. we decided to not talk to him about it as previous conversations about his need for care never went well. we were scheduled to move my dad on thursday and on tuesday i told my mom i thought my dad seemed dehydrated. wednesday morning he has more concerning symptoms but all in line with dehydration. mom had the mobile nurses come by and they confirm dehydration and do an iv as well as recommending an er visit to rule out heart problems (another story but my dad has been to the er about 12 times in the past year for 'chest pain'; his dr has run the gamut of tests and assured us his heart is strong). we declined as he perked up a lot after the fluids.i showed up thursday morning and my dad asks me if he heard what happened to him yesterday. i said no, wanting to see what he remembered. he told me he had a stroke so i ran with it. i let him know that mom and i'd talked about it, talked about how wonderful the nurses were and how they loved him so much they wanted to see him again! (keeping things light and positive). i said that we were going to take him for more testing and it would be overnight at least so they can monitor him and make sure he's ok after the stroke. dad forgot about this story when we needed to leave about an  hour later. i recommended he bring a book to keep himself occupied since the testing would take a while and he didn't remember why we were leaving. but he was relaxed and not anxious about any of this.we pulled up to the facility, they greeted us at the door (dad did not realize where he was), my dad introduced himself (he'd met the facility folks several times prior) and they welcomed him inside saying there were a lot of people they were excited to introduce him to.we got a quick update about an hour later that he was doing well and that he loved the cat i got him (we had to put down his sickly cat last summer so i picked up one of those therapy cats that looked just like his old cat). i asked the facility to be sure the cat was on his bed (his sickly cat never left the bed) as we were not allowed in the facility to get his room ready. i'd spent the past two weeks dropping off all this stuff so they could get the room ready.got a brief update from them yesterday on his first 24 hours and they still said everything was good and that my dad realized the cat is mechanical but loves it anyway. phew. i'm hoping his days continue to go well. he is in quarantine there for 14 days which bums me out but i understand it. we can visit through the window in the 14 days and then beyond that time, it's outside behind plexiglass. they have not told us yet that they recommend a window visit. i'm doing my best to encourage my mom that they are professionals and know exactly how to deal with all this. we've both been pretty up and down emotionally. it's really hard despite knowing this is what's best for him.turned out to be not so quick an update...thanks for reading.

Is my grandmother showing early signs of Alzheimer’s Disease?
my grandma recently turned 84. she has been a strong-willed, smart, and independent woman for years and still is to this day. she raised seven children and went through a troublesome marriage for years. it’s fair to say she’s been through hell and back. she’s one of my role models and i hope i can be as good of a person as she is one day. however, in recent years, especially the last few, my family and i have noticed a slip in memory and very slight personality changes. most of these things are small and not significant. in the past year, these things have slowly become more noticeable. i do not live far away from my grandmother and am with her almost everyday for hours at a time. (i’m still in school) i’m really grateful to be able to be around her often because it’s a blessing for any elderly person to have company. when i’m talking with her, i never notice a large difference from how she’s been for years. she rarely asks me a question twice... the exception may be if she asks where our cats are. i may let one outside and a few minutes later she will be unsure of where it is. she has had me help with writing out bills/important forms for the past 2 years...but could still do it herself if she needed to do so. i do notice that it takes her longer to think of the right words to use or to describe what she’s talking about. she also occasionally forgets to take her “morning” medication and will end up taking it around noon or 1:00. but this doesn’t happen all the time. she doesn’t use technology besides tv. i’ve noticed she sometimes struggles to use the same remote she’s used for the past ten years. not with changing the channel or anything, just turning it on and off. we have to use multiple buttons to get everyone off. she rarely ever calls people on the house phone unless they call her and she can easily find the missed calls. i think she has slowly developed issues with organization for awhile now, she receives so much mail and can almost never sort through it all. i feel like any issues she has relate to short-term memory though.she is a very active lady. it’s not an uncommon occurrence to see her outside working in flowers or the garden. this was the case this past summer too. she doesn’t get lost or become disoriented while out in public. we haven’t been in stores much since covid but when we do go she doesn’t act any different than she did before. but she rarely goes alone and hasn’t for years. i have no idea if she would still be able to drive and direct herself. (she was never one that went out everyday anyway. ) when she is with me, she knows where we are in town and doesn’t act confused. she still does dishes, laundry, etc.(she has lost an interest in cooking for a long time now. i wouldn’t contribute that to memory, even when i was younger and she was in her early to mid-70s she claimed “i cooked for years with my kids, it isn’t much fun no more” and would laugh. nonetheless, she still makes soup or easy to make items.) i hate to write so much, but i promise i am getting to where i begin to have real concerns...in late 2019, my grandmother had a knee replacement after suffering with knee pain for years. it would hurt for her to walk, and it was a relief for her to get the surgery. (i’m so thankful she got it before covid, because she almost postponed until the spring.) she recovered with no issue and walks perfectly now. but before surgery, she would get her hair done once a week. she used to paint her nails often. and she would always try to wear “pretty” outfits. after the surgery and since the pandemic began, i’ve noticed a decline. she just seems sad and doesn’t seem to be her old self. (she has suffered from depression in the past) i know the pandemic has been hard on almost everyone, but i just have a weird feeling that my grandmother has begun to lose hope and will never be the same. when talking with her recently, she expressed some concern about her memory when i asked. and she even went as far to say, “i know i probably have alzheimer’s or am developing it. but i can’t sit and fret about it everyday. there’s nothing i can do, so i’d rather not discuss it.” when i pressed further about why she has lost hope, she said that she feels like “she goes backwards instead of forward” and that it “doesn’t matter anyway” because “no one comes to visit.” she is very aware of the pandemic and has taken all precautions...but our family did visit more in the summer and fall. i know the winter has been bad with covid..but we did have a few small get-togethers individually socially distanced. she’s always been a people person and i think seeing almost no one besides me has taken a toll. she doesn’t seem to struggle with personal hygiene. she can’t easily take baths or showers anymore because of balance and other issues. she can take a bath or shower if someone is here, and i usually am. but i know she fears falling otherwise. so, she usually bathes at the sink. i will add that she hates to wash her hair...and i don’t think it has anything to do with her forgetting about it. she has always had her hair styled and curled with hairspray. in the past year, she hasn’t had her weekly appointments and only goes maybe once every month or 2 months to get it cut. the risk of covid is an issue, and she doesn’t want to get out as much...i understand that. but it’s also a depression issue i feel like too. she still wears appropriate clothing and matches with the season. she just lacks motivation more so now. and she has had a yearly health checkup in recent months, no concerns were ever brought to anyone else. i know her provider has asked about memory before and has given her small “written tasks.” so she must be okay if no health professional has large concerns?... she still gets dressed up and does everything like she used to when she *has* too. but discretionary events never seem to interest her and she will try to get out of them if she can.the most concerning thing probably happened in the past few weeks. we live in a rural area so we have a field and an empty house next door and there are some vehicles left behind... a few days ago, my grandmother claimed there were people in the vehicle “a woman with sunglasses” and when we had snow “there were people up in the field.” there are trees and bushes so i’m wondering if it is a vision issue partly. (i hope) she has had cataract surgery and has a prism in her glasses so she won’t see double (the issue is mostly when she drives.) but she was very adamant about it and no one was actually there. she understood after i explained to her but has brought it up again since. every time it’s the same “woman” but even my grandma is starting to realize no one is there. because she doesn’t “move around” apparently... this issue has happened no where else. when we were out in public she didn’t complain once about seeing something that wasn’t there. so i’m hoping that’s just a vision thing 🤞🏻 and for further reference, my great grandmother (her mother) had alzheimer’s for many years and finally reached the point where she could no longer do basic functions. (eat, drink, etc.) she was 86. my grandmother was the primary caregiver for her so she has told me many stories. i hate to write all of that and not be concise and clear about what her symptoms are...but it’s not one thing or another and i can’t really summarize without explaining personal stories. if you read this, thank you and i’m sorry for taking sooo long. i personally feel like my grandma is probably developing mild/early alzheimer’s. i would just like reassurance if any can be given. it scares me to death that she may have this awful disease. but i’m also still very thankful that she is still largely the same person i have always known. she has lived 84 long years and i pray she has many more. i’m so blessed that i have been able to live close to her and spend time with her more than almost anyone in the family. and i find peace knowing that she will have people no matter the  outcome. thank you again for reading!

My father's timeline of Alzheimer's progression. What stage is my father's Alzheimer's at?
2014-2015 (73/74 years old): father's alzheimer was starting to be more prominent. it starts when he's talking to people, he'd keep repeating what he's saying. 2016 (75 years): he starts forgetting where is he going when driving. like, he would leave from point a to point b, and while on the road, he'd forget where is he going for point b is, and eventually ends up going back to point a. one time, he was going somewhere that's only a 30-minute drive from our house. while on the road, he forgot, he went into circles, and six hours later, he thankfully made it back home.2018 (77 years): he started to forget how to go back to the house from our yard/garden. you'd have to guide him. he used to water the whole yard, but around this time, unless you guide him, he'd only water one area.2019 (78 years): he started to forget how to go from one place in the house to another. let's say how to go to the bathroom from the living, or going to his bedroom. also, this is around the time that you have to give his medicine to him, as he cannot take it by himself. 2020 (79 years), you had start guiding him with personal hygiene, and when taking a shower. you have to make sure he actually gets in the shower, that he actually uses the soap and shampoo, and you have to pick out the clothes he's gonna wear, and set it on the counter. though, he still knows how to put clothes on. he also started losing his perception of time. when he wakes up from an afternoon nap, he thinks it's morning. or he'd wake up my mom in the middle of the night, as he thinks it's already morning. he would wonder out of his air conditioned room, to go some other part of the house, would sit down, and complain that it's hot. i would bring him back to the room. a couple minutes later, he'd do this again. he would also ask where my mother is, i give him an answer. then 30 seconds later, he'd ask the same question again. 2021: about a month or two ago, he's having trouble when you give him a command. let's say if you want him to flick a light switch.   based on the timeline above, what stage is my father at? and how long is this going to last before advancing to the next? also, i've read that people with alzheimer's would live about 8-10 years, or if they're lucky, up to 20 years. how long do you think my father is going to live?i would like to apologize for the dumb questions. i am just curious. especially, when dealing with this everyday. thanks.

Where do I start? My Dad is showing signs but resistant to help. He would be the third generation during my lifetime.
my 70 yo dad had a recent episode of delusion, saying things that were paranoid and somewhat incoherent. my stepmom said it’s the only one he’s ever had. she recorded it because it was so unusual for him. he was calm and very sweet but tearful and scared. i’ve never heard anything more heartbreaking.my uncle thinks it’s possibly drug related, dad admits to using speed occasionally. we live in the midwest. he has had a small stroke several years ago. this just complicates everything. stepmom also has a history of drug use, is a hoarder and not the most stable support system. but she did call me so i’m grateful she was there. before this he’s been shown signs of more than normal forgetfulness. forgetting names and names of objects. he says it’s the common things he forgets and has limited short term memory. he just saw the dr. last week and was told that’s just age but i think i need to push him to let me go with him. he said he’s concerned but doesn’t think anything can be done.he’s always been introvert, working on cars in his shop most of his day. and nights. i’ve just let him be and happy when we do connect. but the last two years he has not returned calls. isolating more than normal. he’s not exactly himself. he’s still sweet and loving but just not... it’s hard to say exactly. where do i start? ask him to make an appointment with his regular doctor and go with him to express our concerns? would it be terrible to call stepmoms daughter and ask her to help her mom clean the house? i’d help too. i doubt stepmom will be open to the idea. it’s a bigger deal than just a deep clean but i know it’s affecting his depression because he’s talked about hating it and how it’s ruined his house.

Fast mental decline due to covid-19 in mother with Alzheimer's
my mother was officially diagnosed with alzheimer's just over 2 years ago. my dad passed away in 2014 and my mom lived alone in an appartment within walking distance from myself and my sister. while we noticed a gradual decline my mom still had a great quality of life. she spent 4 days a week at daycare in a nursing home, which she loved. they went on daytrips, shopping, to a garden center or the market and even to the christmas circus in 2019. my mom no longer cooked but still managed to prepare microwave meals. she couldn't do a weekly grocery shop so i did that for her. she forgot to clean but she got a cleaning help 3 hours a week. and while we mourned the mother we were slowly losing, we still had her around and were still able to visit and have a chat.two weeks ago wednesday the nursing home called to tell me my mother was short of breath and was running a mild fever and i had to come get her. my sister was able to get her tested that evening and the next day we got the result that she tested positive for corona.we have no clue where she got it. could be anywhere, since my mom never remembered to wash her hands regularly.from wednesday to monday my sister and i visited her several times a day each to care for her. we were given a huge box with protective gear to use on ourself but it wasn't enough since last week my sister got sick and tested positive, and in turn infected her husband and youngest teen son, oldest son still pending. i've been tested 3 times now, all negative.anyway, my mom had high fevers for days and eventually breathing got even more difficult and on monday our family doctor decided to send her to the hospital for oxygen and fluids. it was decided by a doctor there that my mom wouldn't be sent to the icu should her condition worsen, because she wouldn't be able to go through the rehabilitation process following intubation because of her alzheimer's. we agreed with that. she was allowed 1 visitor once a day and since my sister was sick i was in and out of the hospital all week. at first she was very ill, and we realized there was a very large chance covid might kill her. my mom is 77, has survived cancer and is a smoker. but what do you know, fysically she recovered somewhat. she still was weak and needed some oxygen but the fever passed and she seemed to do better.on monday i got some videochats going with some of her cousins whom she's always been close with. and while she was convinced she wasn't sick and she didn't have a clue where she was, she was still able to have a chat and she was lively. untill she wasn't. over the past week her alzheimer's seems to have progressed a year's worth or even more. she no longer understands where she is or why, she didn't recognize her own brother when he visited, she had a huge problem talking and forming coherent sentences, and worst of all, she was no longer able to swallow food or water.this afternoon we had a talk with the doctor there (my sister via video chat since she is still too sick to travel, no matter how much she wanted to be there), and we all concluded that my mom's quality of life was no longer there and that there was no hope of that improving in any significant way.the only solution was giving her food through a tube up her nose but she keeps pulling out her oxygen so we doubt she would accept such a thing, not to mention that it would only prolong her suffering at this point. so we have decided, with the agreement of the doctor, to seize all attempts at feeding her.this afternoon, right before the meeting with the doctor, her condition had worsened so much i was genuinely convinced for a second that i had entered the wrong room, because i didn't recognize her. she did still recognize me for a moment, mask and all, and whispered my name but that is the only coherent thing she said.i am still in shock how fast this virus has turned my mom into an advanced stage alzheimer's patient. how she went from still living on her own to no longer being able to speak and swallow in the span of two weeks. since the start of this pandemic my sister and i have been very worried about my mom catching the corona virus because she's such a high risk case, but we never could have imagined how this horrible virus could end things for my mom.i'm still mostly in shock. tomorrow we're talking with the hospital to get her out of there, maybe to a hospice or even back to her home since she is now officially corona free, so we can make her final days more comfortabele, since that is all we can do now, aside from waiting for the end.

Am I horrible for considering divorce?
my husband has been going through so much lately. a year and a half ago he went through a deep depression. he told me he wanted a divorce yet has no recollection of saying that now. then started saying he wanted to separate to collect his thoughts. he’s been a very angry person and horrible to me for close to two years. he constantly insults me. last july unbeknownst to me, he rented an apartment two hours away on the beach. well he was talking about getting away for a couple weeks or months, he signed a year lease. i’ve seen him on a few occasions but it’s always on his terms. he says now and this is not about divorce but just figuring life out. it’s been six months. he’s in therapy and i am in therapy. he said that we will do therapy together once he is out but he keeps pushing back on that. this is the thing, he has alzheimer’s on both sides of his family. i just started thinking that his irritability and depression could be an early onset symptom. i haven’t said this to him but did express my concern and did ask him to do a ct scan and see a doctor yet he refuses. other than the depression and irritability he has no other symptoms. there’s no memory loss or anything like that. i love him so much but he’s been horrible to me for so long. a small example of this is just last week when i visited he asked me what i wanted for breakfast (he was cooking). i said “what are my options?” he said “i asked you what you wanted. make a decision.” he is constantly negative towards me like this. i have been very supportive but struggling lately.

TLDR : I cured my dementia (not CLICKBAIT)
hey there everyone. my name is mustafa and i'm 23. 6 months ago i was on the verge of ending my life .at a very young age where everyone is striving and working hard for a better life. unfortunately for me everything went on pause in 2018 i got diagnosed with osteoarthritis aka (disk degeneration)that's where i had to be friend chronic pain..my past 2.5 years was filled with so much pain that i lost everything in my life.my relationships went down hill , my finances were all spent on finding a cure , uni failed me since i was not able to study due to pain and so much more i sucked it all up cuz i was told there's nothing you can do about it just like alzheimer's. anyways 2020 march arrives and that's when sh*t hits the fan and got fired my job at a restaurant because i forget alot of orders and instructions that i've been given.i realized my brain is not working right. it's like i have conversation with someone in the next minute or two i realize i would forget 90% of what we talked about. let alone just that i couldn't perform normal calculations in my head . man that felt so weird coming from someone who has graduated from a levels 5 years ago with straight up a's and b's.long story short i went through different doctors trying to find what's going on and i would always make sure i'd have my phone recorder on cuz the next minute i'd step out i'd legit forget what they just told me.after weeks of visits i knew that there no hope for me man . literally every doctor said something .i got diagnosed with adhd , depression , anxiety.and the one i hated the most was "oh i think it's all in your head". yes sure...i tried all the meds from adderall to anti depressants you name it. they just threw pills week after week. hoping one day i come by and talk about how they helped me..unfortunately none did.i wanted to see how bad my brain was so  i found a test called moca.i think alot of you should know what this is . it's a test doctors put people on if they have cognitive decline. no doctor wanted to test me out or do a scan on my brain so i did the test on my own and my score was literally 5/30. man i knew life was over for me and my parents would have to go through this with me as well which was horrifying.time was passing by and things getting worse day by day for some reason i'd be staring at the window for no reason for minutes.days pass and weird words come out of my mouth and i'd stutter trying to put one sentence together. i think it's called aphasia.i know i'm talking so much about my symptoms but i'm trying to show you how bad my case is. but you might wonder how the hell am i typing this entire post if i had dementia..i'll gladly explain and it's why i'm putting this out.6 months ago that's when i was at rock bottom i discovered a book called "the end of alzheimer's" by dr dale bredesen.i was so desperate that if someone told me the cure is to eat a plate of shit . i would do it regardless if it's true or not. it's called desperation for a solution.anyways dr dale details everything a person needs to know about this disease but not just that. he's been able to reverse his clients cognitive decline with a protocol that he has extensively put out in his book .i was skeptical but i wanted something that gives me hope so i decided to follow.  jesus man 6 months in and i swear on my mom's life that it f*cking works.i have recently done the cognitive test and my moca score was 30/30.i'm able to remember conversations , my vocabulary increased , aphasia is vanishing , i can understand movies and so much more..i highly recommend anyone who's watching a loved one die day by day to give this book a shot or hell maybe you yourself are experiencing symptoms of memory loss too . there's hope for everyone no matter how far they are ...i'm not the first one who has come back to life but in the book he shares different stories of his clients who show obvious results and they have gone back to normal life..i feel sad at time i walk by a nursing home next to my house and i see a bunch of elderly probably with severe alzheimer's stuck where they are and never get to truely come back to life just like i did.anyways for me it's been 6 months and i can't say i'm fully back 100% to where i was but jesus i'm so happy things turned around when it seemed impossible..it's a journey and it takes times i can't imagine the how my next years will be. i'm looking forward to uni again 😊yeah and also i forgot to mention that my chronic pain has subsided . i finally live a pain free life. i swear the only reason i posted this is so that someone reads this and hopefully gives the book a shot . we all know how hopeless it is to hear someone go through dementia. if you got any question i'll gladly answer ☺️

hey there everyone. my name is mustafa and i'm 23. 6 months ago i was on the verge of ending my life .at a very young age where everyone is striving and working hard for a better life. unfortunately for me everything went on pause in 2018 i got diagnosed with osteoarthritis aka (disk degeneration)that's where i had to be friend chronic pain..my past 2.5 years was filled with so much pain that i lost everything in my life.my relationships went down hill , my finances were all spent on finding a cure , uni failed me since i was not able to study due to pain and so much more i sucked it all up cuz i was told there's nothing you can do about it just like alzheimer's. anyways 2020 march arrives and that's when sh*t hits the fan and got fired my job at a restaurant because i forget alot of orders and instructions that i've been given.i realized my brain is not working right. it's like i have conversation with someone in the next minute or two i realize i would forget 90% of what we talked about. let alone just that i couldn't perform normal calculations in my head . man that felt so weird coming from someone who has graduated from a levels 5 years ago with straight up a's and b's.long story short i went through different doctors trying to find what's going on and i would always make sure i'd have my phone recorder on cuz the next minute i'd step out i'd legit forget what they just told me.after weeks of visits i knew that there no hope for me man . literally every doctor said something .i got diagnosed with adhd , depression , anxiety.and the one i hated the most was "oh i think it's all in your head". yes sure...i tried all the meds from adderall to anti depressants you name it. they just threw pills week after week. hoping one day i come by and talk about how they helped me..unfortunately none did.i wanted to see how bad my brain was so  i found a test called moca.i think alot of you should know what this is . it's a test doctors put people on if they have cognitive decline. no doctor wanted to test me out or do a scan on my brain so i did the test on my own and my score was literally 5/30. man i knew life was over for me and my parents would have to go through this with me as well which was horrifying.time was passing by and things getting worse day by day for some reason i'd be staring at the window for no reason for minutes.days pass and weird words come out of my mouth and i'd stutter trying to put one sentence together. i think it's called aphasia.i know i'm talking so much about my symptoms but i'm trying to show you how bad my case is. but you might wonder how the hell am i typing this entire post if i had dementia..i'll gladly explain and it's why i'm putting this out.6 months ago that's when i was at rock bottom i discovered a book called "the end of alzheimer's" by dr dale bredesen.i was so desperate that if someone told me the cure is to eat a plate of shit . i would do it regardless if it's true or not. it's called desperation for a solution.anyways dr dale details everything a person needs to know about this disease but not just that. he's been able to reverse his clients cognitive decline with a protocol that he has extensively put out in his book .i was skeptical but i wanted something that gives me hope so i decided to follow.  jesus man 6 months in and i swear on my mom's life that it f*cking works.i have recently done the cognitive test and my moca score was 30/30.i'm able to remember conversations , my vocabulary increased , aphasia is vanishing , i can understand movies and so much more..i highly recommend anyone who's watching a loved one die day by day to give this book a shot or hell maybe you yourself are experiencing symptoms of memory loss too . there's hope for everyone no matter how far they are ...i'm not the first one who has come back to life but in the book he shares different stories of his clients who show obvious results and they have gone back to normal life..i feel sad at time i walk by a nursing home next to my house and i see a bunch of elderly probably with severe alzheimer's stuck where they are and never get to truely come back to life just like i did.anyways for me it's been 6 months and i can't say i'm fully back 100% to where i was but jesus i'm so happy things turned around when it seemed impossible..it's a journey and it takes times i can't imagine the how my next years will be. i'm looking forward to uni again 😊yeah and also i forgot to mention that my chronic pain has subsided . i finally live a pain free life. i swear the only reason i posted this is so that someone reads this and hopefully gives the book a shot . we all know how hopeless it is to hear someone go through dementia. if you got any question i'll gladly answer ☺️

And I love her. A rant about my grandmother.
she gave me the best advices, "don't drink from someone else's cup" "if you ever feel uncomfortable about something, leave, you answer to no one about your life", and i could go on forever. she always hugged me, talked to me, we used to go on trips, she's a catholic and i would travel with her to aparecida do norte, a very important place for catholics in brazil. she bought me biggest ice cream a child could eat. "don't tell your father, he wouldn't understand". when i came out and introduced my first girlfriend she asked "does she treat you nice? do you like her? so i like her", the best food ever, e v e r. i miss her food everyday hahahashe's been diagnosed with alzheimer for 16 years now. and now at its late stage i stay with her almost everyday because this young lady likes to walk around, hates to drink water at all costs and can't eat alone. sometimes she forgets who i am, sometimes she is angry that i'm here "taking away her freedom", sometimes she thinks i'm her nurse, but i know who she is. i know what she means to me. when she's angry and very rude to me i tell myself "she's not angry with me she's at a tough situation." i tell this to myself over and over, so i'm not personally affected. but yeah sometimes i get sad. today she's in a great mood, singing, fooling around, stealing fruits from the neighbor's tree, and i love her. i love her everyday. every time. when i'm upset, when she's difficult, when she's ok, anytime. i love my grandma. i'm writing this here because i wish my feelings stayed somewhere concrete. thank you for reading this, know that this community means a lot to me. 💜

Possible early stages of Alzheimer's
as my dad sits at the hospital waiting for an mri, i wonder if the eventual diagnose will be alzheimer's.  my dad is 80 and has never routinely seen a doctor.  he only goes when he has injured himself or is very sick.  last week my mom called because she had called 911 due to my dad falling and not being able to stand.  paramedics used a portable ekg machine to check his heart, checked his other vitals, as well as checked his blood sugar.  everything came back fine.  after a while he seemed ok and the paramedics left.  2 days later it happened again.  this time they took him by ambulance to the hospital where they did more test, including a cat scan, x-ray, and another ekg.  due to covid, we weren't able to be with him in the er, which frustrated the hell out of my mom and i.  the doctor called after a couple of hours and said that everything came back fine, except his blood alcohol was at .075.  the doctor attributed his steadiness to the alcohol.  my mom believed the doctor, but i did not.  i picked him up and brought him back to their home.  immediately, my narcissist mom told him that he has to quit drinking bla bla bla.  shortly after, he began to tell us that his legs have felt "wobbly" during the day, at night, in the morning etc.  i knew this wasn't drunkiness causing this issue.  since neither of them have primary care physicians, i told them they need to get some asap.  however, i wasn't naive and knew the chances of getting one quickly was near impossible.  yesterday morning i spoke with my mom to see if she had called the doctor i recommended and she had not.  she told me that dad woke up early this morning and was confused at where the bathroom was.  she helped him to the bathroom and then he couldn't figure out where the bedroom was (they sleep in different rooms).  it was odd.  over the last 10 years he has been forgetting things.  he also has a history of retelling the same stories from the past.  unfortunately, both his mom &amp; dad died of alzheimer's in their 80's.  the last week or so mom says he has been forgetting a lot. one other detail.....he still works full time!  we have tried to get him to retire, but he doesn't want to and my mom seems like she doesn't really want him to.  in my conversation with my mom she said he was still wobbly.  i asked if she had called the doctor i recommended and she said that she hadn't yet.  i decided to call for them and they told me the soonest they could see him would be december 14th.  the nurse i spoke to recommend i take him back to the er, but explain to them that he can't speak for himself so i can stay with them and explain to the doctors what is going on.  being with him all day yesterday, i feel like i'm losing my dad.  he seems weak and slow to do certain task....like undressing himself, peeing, etc.  i feared this would happen because it happened to his parents and i think it's happening to his brother and sister as well.  since i had a lot of time yesterday in the waiting room, i decided to pull my dad's credit since my mom has a history of obtaining credit cards under his name and emotionally spending.  i confronted her about it 10 years ago and told my dad.  they filed bankruptcy 20 years ago and then lost their house 10 years ago.  i knew my mom was still up to her ways, but i didn't realize how bad it was.  i was trying to figure out why she has been so hesitant about him retiring and why she said they would have to move somewhere cheaper since they would bring in about $3k a month in social security.  well, to my surprise they have $35k in credit card debt.  i added the 21 accounts and the min payments alone are almost $1100 a month, which explains why my mom has been scared about my dad retiring.  i'm afraid after what is going on that he will have to retire because i don't think he should be driving with his current condition.this all happened so fast and i'm sorry to ramble.  my sister's live 6 &amp; 12 hours away and i live 10 min away.  obviously, i am the one right now that needs to be there for them.  in addition to all of this, their townhome is 2 stories and the bathroom is on the second story.  i'm looking for a different apartment that is single level and need to get them in that yesterday.with wobbly legs and forgetting small things that happened 10 min ago, but remembering things that may have happened 2 days ago, could this be a sign of alzheimer's?thank you

Looking for Dad
my father is not missing.  but that's not the reality that my mother lives in.we started noticing little issues with mom's memory in the first part of this year.  by october we had documented a couple of pages of little incidents of repetition in conversation and forgotten details.  any one on its own could be dismissed, but all together... then she started struggling at work.  within a three week span we went from talking her into seeing a doctor, to a diagnosis of early onset alzheimer's &amp; forced early retirement from a 27 year career. all by her 59th birthday at the end of october this year.dad has been amazing through all of this. coordinating doctors visits, getting her through a retirement process, disability, getting her legal documents updated, and getting her interviews with clinical trials.  but she's lost him.  it started with little spells in conversation.  4 over the course of 5 weeks.  dad suddenly wasn't her husband anymore.  he was someone else in her husband's skin.  dad would walk away from her for a few minutes, then come back and she'd ask him where he'd been all day.  two weeks ago a spell started and never ended.  mom lives in an alternate reality now, where there's a strange man in her husband's skin.  the strange man is sometimes an asshole plotting to sell her husband's tractor &amp; their house.  most of the time he's a very nice man who she's been friends with for years and takes care of her.  they would make a perfect couple.  all of these different men work at the same place my father, drive the same work van, even has the same name.  she recognizes her husband in photos from my wedding 3 years ago.  she doesn't recognize her husband when he gets home from work or cooks her dinner.  mom sends my sister and i messages, asking if we've seen dad and when he'll be home.  she hasn't seen her husband in weeks, and every time she calls his phone (when she can remember how to find her speed dial) she gets one of the impostors or her new boyfriend.  i wish she could come back to the reality we tell her about.  the one where her husband will be home from work soon. this is the most brutal thing this disease could have done to either of them.  i cannot imagine the depth of his heartbreak. or hers missing her husband of 40 years, the man who is living with her and taking care of her.  i wish it were my face that she didn't recognize.  my sister has told me she'd prefer it were either of us instead of dad.  but that's not the reality that we live in.

Need tools, advice for Grandma with fast advancing Alzheimers
hi everyone.just like the title says, i'm looking for some tools and advice to helping, redirecting, and calming my grandma. she was officially diagnosed with alzheimer's several years ago. at first, i think most of us were in denial, but as the disease progressed, we came to terms with the fact that it had taken hold of her. earlier on, it was easily dismissable things, like misplacing items, or forgetting if she had said something to someone. later, it became telling the same thing multiple times in a conversation.now, it has progressed so much, she's more often "lost" than she is lucid. it seems like, within the past few months, her disease has revved up and progressed much faster than it had previously. she doesn't remember where she keeps her dishes. she'll put the cups in the drawer with the casserole dishes. you'll be engaged in a conversation with her when she'll suddenly walk off and wander around. she's confused so much of the time. it's gotten to the point where she can't remember many of my family members' names. she refers to my grandpa (her husband) as "this guy", and often doesn't realize who he is, or where she is.every morning, my grandpa has to walk around and show her pictures on the wall to bring her back and help her feel comfortable and recognize that she's in her home, however, it's not working like it used to. last week, my grandma was distraught and called my dad, angry and asking him when he was coming home. she thinks he's still a teenager, not a grown man. then, the other night, my grandma woke up, walked out into the garage, came back inside, and asked, scared, and angry who the man was in her bed. she wouldn't accept that it was her husband, so my grandpa moved out onto the couch. later that night, she came back out and asked him if he was coming to bed, as she forgot what had just happened. things are being put in motion to get her into a home. grandpa has been an absolute saint with her, but it's too much. i want to know what are some things that i can do when i am around to keep her occupied and happy. puzzles, coloring, etc. how can i calm her down when she gets confused or if it escalates, how do i redirect her attention to something that will keep her calm? she has been such a wonderful grandma to me. it breaks my heart to watch this disease slowly chip away at her. i want to be for her, everything she has been for me. any advice is truly appreciated.&amp;#x200b;tl;dr: this disease has progressed to the point where she is often confused, doesn't recognize her husband, and is upset. what tools or advice can i use to keep her happy and occupied?

Grandma is obsessed with her "kids" who are never here
this had been going on for over a year, but it gets worse now too. my grandmother raised 4 daughters, then 2 grandchildren, i'm one of them. she keeps asking where are her kids, usually she means her grandkids. she doesn't names. sometimes it's just a girl (me) or my brother. other times it's the boys, etc. when we can't produce them she wants up call the cops/law/authority. she seems to have forgotten 911 and can't find a phone for the police number.we tried telling her they were young adults, already graduated high school. we'd try her they can't visit because of covid-19. sometimes that would work, but usually she doesn't even believe that they are old enough to be in elementary school. we used to say they were with their mother, but that stressed her out. turns out saying they are with their father, would calm her. she usually turns that into her children's father, her ex-husband, having the kids and she doesn't worry as much. on friday when she was asking, we said the kids are with their dad for the weekend. now she is saying it's been 100 years since she's seen the kids. and she keeps asking to go get them. come later today or tomorrow, i don't know what to tell her. she's already not fully believing me when i tell her the kids are with their dad. unfortunately, i'm the only one that lives with her, and other family work or live further away and can't visit. we do a lot of phone calls as distraction, but that only works if she's in the mood to talk. and that usually only delays her asking about the kids. television rarely holds her interest anymore.she takes aricept/donepezil. for about a month earlier this year, she was in buspirone for anxiety, but that made her teary when she's not a crier and didn't help the anxiety, worry or paranoia.since i give her her medications, i worry about her not trusting me and try to watch what i say. it had happened a few times that she refused to take pills. or she's good my mother once told her that the kids' dad took them and moved to another away. my grandma remembered that got a while and was upset that she's never see them again.this was a bit of a ramble, but i don't know what to tell my grandmother when she keeps asking about her kids. they are in their 40s, i'm one of them, but she thinks there's 2 of us named goudakayak. she wants the little one.

Been a long time coming.
i've lurked here quite a bit over the last few years. it's been about 8 years since i first began suspecting that my dad was showing symptoms of alzheimer's. i worked with him full time and as much as he tried to convince me otherwise, i knew there was something more going on than just simple disorganization and stress induced forgetfulness. my husband and i moved away in 2012 and i no longer worked for my dad, however we frequently had conversations on the phone or on facetime. i remember in 2015 my one year old son tripped and fell, scraping his face. my dad and i had a long heartfelt talk about how scary it is to be a parent and see your kids hurt. sometimes when he is busy with work you can tell when he's only half paying attention and not absorbing what you're saying. this was not one of those times. i had his full attention. i cried. he soothed me. i sent a picture later that day of the scrape on my son's face and i received a panicked message back from him. "what is that rash? you need to go to the doctor!!" he thought the scrape was a rash. he had forgotten the conversation. i called him back alarmed asking if he had forgotten about the conversation we had. he got angry at me and said he had a lot of stressors happening with his business and he can't possibly remember anything. the conversation was short. i was upset. he was angry. i never mentioned it again, but at that time i knew with 100% certainty that there was something severely wrong, and that it was almost certainly alzheimer's. there have been more stories similar to the last one, some more severe than others. forgetting that i was pregnant with a baby boy in 2017 and asking my older son if he was excited for his baby sister. getting lost, forgetting things. his girlfriend brought some alarming behaviours to my attention including not paying government debt that he was being chased for, and dropping the ball on many of his business projects with customers frequently  upset with him. i already grieved this years ago. i felt the pain, i accepted it, i moved on as best as i could. i did my best to get him to go for testing but i realized that my mental health was more important than fighting a battle i had no chance at winning. so i let it be. finally his girlfriend convinced him to go to the doctor's about a year ago and they started the testing process. last week he was diagnosed. i thought i was prepared for this, however i was not. i am currently trudging through the depths of despair as my three year old has been battling an aggressive form of leukemia since january and i just don't have the capacity to handle any more tragedy in my life. i feel like i am spiraling with grief. i need my dad. i am his spitting image, inside and out. he is the only person who understands (understood) the way my mind works and always gave the best advice and the kind of support that would make me feel like i could conquer anything. the past months dealing with my son, i haven't called my dad nearly as much as i should have, as i would only get frustrated with his repeated questions about my son's treatments and his inability to understand the answers i gave. i knew this was not his fault but it's hard enough digesting this information on my own, let alone having to repeat it multiple times in different ways when i don't want to talk about it at all.i have been so mean to him. i have been so unaccommodating. i haven't been there through the hardest moments of his life. and now he has been diagnosed with a terminal illness. i'm not sure of the point of this post. i just need to get some weight off my chest. i have been so absorbed in my son, his treatments, and living in constant fear of what might happen to him. and now i know, beyond a doubt, that i am going to lose my dad in the most cruel and heartbreaking way imaginable.he is 59 years old, so this is early onset. he is one of seven kids. one other has already been diagnosed, and another one is showing symptoms. so that’s at least 3/7, all under 65. my dad's grandfather had alzheimer's as well (he died at 75) so this is very clearly genetic. so on top of all of the above, i am also terrified for my own life, and that of my children. i am just so sad, and so scared.

What are some things I should do with my dad while he still remembers who I am?
i study in a foreign country (in spain), but i'm at home (in florida) for the summer, and i might stay longer because all my classes are online now.my dad has lost his ability to do most basic tasks but he is still himself, he still knows who i am, he still remembers a lot of details from his life. i only come home once a year so i see his decline in "jumps." he is worse than he was last year.he doesn't recognize objects, he can't find his way around the house, and i guess his short-term memory is off. he can't remember things like whether he had breakfast. sometimes he tries to pour himself a cup of water but he's holding the cup upside down and the water splashes all over the kitchen. he urinates all over the bathroom floor because he can't find the toilet. he can't dress himself. he can't use his computer or smartphone, which was always an issue even when he was younger but now he really can't do basic things. i taught him how to listen to the bbc world service, npr, and audiobooks on youtube, which he enjoys and he can sort of do it but he often needs help. he has a lot of difficulty using his phone.he wanted to write about his experiences during his career (he was an attorney and he participated in fighting for civil rights in the 1960s) but i'm not sure if he's still capable of writing a coherent book. it's sort of a tragedy that he can't write his experiences. he sort of can, but he keeps printing out the same three pages over and over again, and he set it to size 20 font and the whole project is becoming an incoherent disaster.my mother is angry with him because when my father was young and strong, he tended towards the abusive side. my mother wanted to divorce him in recent years, but now she has to stay with him because he never bought any kind of medical insurance and there is no one else in the world who will take care of him. my mom works in medicine and she stays home now due to corona (both of my parents are in the highest-risk group) so she takes care of my father all day, including preparing meals and helping him get dressed, but sometimes she is very impatient with him, especially when he does things she told him not to do, or when he doesn't do things she told him to do. my dad was always bad at following basic directions and he often made a lot of poor decisions, so my mom still has a lot of resentment from decades of fights. my mom has always had a short temper, and really both of them contributed to making the house a toxic place over the years. it's one of the reasons why i left, but not the only reason. (i really wanted to live in a place with public transport, pedestrian life, and cold weather.)a lot of my father's mind is still intact. he knows who he is, he knows who my mom is, he knows who i am, and he knows that i am here. he knows that i'm living abroad. there is still a lot of him left. he knows what's going on around him, to an extent. he likes bbc podcasts and he follows along. we went to the supermarket and came home and he remembered details of what we did at the supermarket (he found it impressive that i knew how to buy food).my parents' house has been overly cluttered with shit, and i convinced my mom to give a lot of shit to goodwill. most of the shit was random gifts from random people - glass tigers, giant miniature sailboats, metal apples on metal plates, wooden russian spoons, a large yellow vase with red chinese dragons (this object was very expensive and had been important to my father's mother), little sculptures, decorated plates and bowls, all kinds of *objects* from all over the world that people brought to us without asking and expected us to keep forever. every solid surface in the house was covered with this garbage. *expensive* garbage, but garbage nonetheless. the dining room table, the desks, the kitchen counter, the shelves, the dressers, everywhere was covered in stupid objects. thirty years of accumulated garbage ate up all the space, collected dust, cluttered the house. we spent the past two weeks collecting all this garbage into plastic boxes and dumping it off at goodwill. my dad wanted to participate in this cleaning project, but he really couldn't. he kept doing bizarre things like brushing the floor with a small brush instead of using a broom. we have one room that's full of books (which we're mostly planning to give away) and he started cleaning that floor with a wet mop, which was damaging the books. we told him to stop, because first we would take the books to some library and *then* we would clean the floor, but he angrily insisted to do it anyway because "oh i won't damage the books." the thing is, my dad was already like that when his brain was working. he would often do things that made sense to absolutely nobody but him, and he would fight you if you tried to interfere. it's one of the reasons my mom wanted to leave him. in my opinion, he had undiagnosed asperger's syndrome, because in the wikipedia entry for asperger's it describes my dad's personality a lot. as it turned out, he had no idea that he was using a wet mop (because he insisted it was dry), so i replaced it with a dry broom and he just kept sweeping.there are some objects that my dad would not want to throw away, like the large yellow vase from china, or a sprawling set of ancient wine glasses we never use, or a heavy crystal-glass bowl that was a wedding gift from some cousin, but he wasn't really capable of recognizing that we were getting rid of those objects. he just went along with it.i also found something which i thought was sort of incredible - a diary kept by my dad's mother during the years 1929 to 1933, when she was age 19 to 23. my dad asked what it was and i told him, i said "it's a diary from [her name] from 1929 to 1933," and he said, "oh wow! i want to read it!" but then i guess he forgot about it five minutes later. it had been in the garage, sitting in humidity and heat, so i brought it to my room and read it. i can't say it was that interesting - she visited cleveland and new york, and she was in love with some guy named ray who is almost certainly dead - but having a 90-year-old diary from a deceased relative written when she was almost younger than the dog is quite remarkable. (the dog has also gotten really old and she doesn't like to play anymore.)there are a lot of little things that are getting worse. in 2015 my dad couldn't find his way to an elevator in a small hotel. now he can't recognize cabinets that he built himself twenty years ago. or he'll hold up an object that's very obviously a simple object like a cup and ask what it is. my mom installed some hooks in the bathroom for holding towels and he ripped them off the walls because he thought they were door handles for a cabinet that didn't exist.i've been staying home because i don't want to collect corona and bring it home, but last night i went out with one of my childhood friends, mike, and we sat at an outdoor table at a taco restaurant. he knows my dad. i told him what was going on, and mike said, "he's going to start forgetting who you are." that comment sort of caught me off guard, because i guess it didn't occur to me that it will get worse. it didn't occur to me that it's sort of a big deal that my dad still knows who i am and that i am here.i sort of avoid my parents, especially my dad, when i am home, because old habits die hard. he needs a lot of attention (even when his brain worked he needed a lot of attention) so i tended to stay in my room with the door closed, and now as an adult i'm doing the same thing. i feel like i am wasting this valuable time while my dad's brain is still working at the level that it is.i didn't expect to write this many paragraphs, i thought this would be a short post. but anyway i guess i would like to spend some more time with my dad, but i don't really know how because whenever i'm in his presence i feel overwhelmingly driven to go back to my room and sit in bed and browse instagram or some such stupid bullshit. i guess i'd like to know what are some things i can do during this early stage while he's still there. like how can i take advantage of this time.

Nana's dog is grossly obese, how can I help her?
**tldr:** my nana's dog is morbidly obese. nana is in denial of it and feeds her probably 6-10x the amount of food she should be having, not including chocolate and food from her own plate. really need some advice on how to help the dog. hello reddit,my nana has suffered from alzheimers for roughly 5 years now, and she's aggressively in denial about it- even when face-to-face with the doctor who diagnosed her, she refused to accept that her memory is declining (this is relevant later). my grandad was still alive when we first suspected something was up, he was extremely supportive and understanding but he eventually grew resentful and he and my nana frequently upset eachother. my mum (their daughter), had the idea to get them a dog to give them something to care for and hopefully improve their communications with eachother. she discussed the idea with both of them and agreed that, should anything happen to them, my mum would take the dog and care for her. at first, the dog was a lifesaver and they both seemed so much happier. unfortunately last year we lost my grandad, and my nana has become extremely attached to the dog as she now lives alone. however, due to her alzheimers, she overfeeds the dog so excessively the poor thing is now entirely unrecognisable from when we first got her. she's a shih-tzu, so she came to us a fairly small dog. she's now so grossly obese she can't urinate or defecate without covering herself in waste, she's basically immobile, and she just looks so uncomfortable in any position she sits/lies in. also, we've noticed lumps of fat clustered around her chest, i can't imagine it would be helpful to take her to a vet at this stage for investigation as she's so fat it must be extremely difficult to palpate/she can't be healthy enough to have a general anesthetic. my nana refuses to admit her dog is overweight, i genuinely can't tell if it's because she lives with her and therefore can't notice a difference or if it's embarrassment. she will insist it's the dog's fur making her appear larger than she actually is- i've tried showing her pictures of the dog when we first got her to compare, and pointing out her weight after she's just been cut but she won't hear it. we've tried gently approaching the fact that she is overfeeding her because she's forgotten that she's already fed her, but nana gets so defensive and becomes upset that we thinks she's crazy. this post is getting long so i'm going to summarise what we've noticed her doing:* nana feeds the dog off of her own plate- we've caught her feeding the dog an entire pizza before * nana buys a new crate of dog food every week and always asks us to pick up more for her as she's ran out (that's 40 pouches of food in under a week, so roughly 6 pouches of food per day)* nana gives her dog treats for literally anything, she's gone outside? treat. she's not barked at the postman? treat. she believes she hasn't given her a treat in a while? treat* whatever my nana eats, the dog eats. i'm talking anything. chocolate, toast, crisps, pizza, you name it. i've had heated arguments with her when i've caught her taking a bite of chocolate and giving half to the dogwe've tried taking the dog away, nana actually tripped over her a few months ago and broke her hip. while she was in hospital and recovering, the dog stayed with us for approximately 2 months. she seemed so much happier, our house was a fat camp for her. she was walked twice a day, no treats, and a normal amount of food per day. she lost so much weight. but nana wouldn't forget about her and eventually we had to give her back, she's put all the weight back on and more. i'm sorry this became so long. i'm just totally out of options and lost for what to do here. the poor dog is my nana's lifeline as i know she hates living alone, but i feel like the only member of my family to recognise this as animal abuse. any advice/similar experiences would be hugely appreciated, i feel like i've already failed the poor dog and god only knows how many health issues she must have/be developing already. thanks so much

**tldr:** my nana's dog is morbidly obese. nana is in denial of it and feeds her probably 6-10x the amount of food she should be having, not including chocolate and food from her own plate. really need some advice on how to help the dog. hello reddit,my nana has suffered from alzheimers for roughly 5 years now, and she's aggressively in denial about it- even when face-to-face with the doctor who diagnosed her, she refused to accept that her memory is declining (this is relevant later). my grandad was still alive when we first suspected something was up, he was extremely supportive and understanding but he eventually grew resentful and he and my nana frequently upset eachother. my mum (their daughter), had the idea to get them a dog to give them something to care for and hopefully improve their communications with eachother. she discussed the idea with both of them and agreed that, should anything happen to them, my mum would take the dog and care for her. at first, the dog was a lifesaver and they both seemed so much happier. unfortunately last year we lost my grandad, and my nana has become extremely attached to the dog as she now lives alone. however, due to her alzheimers, she overfeeds the dog so excessively the poor thing is now entirely unrecognisable from when we first got her. she's a shih-tzu, so she came to us a fairly small dog. she's now so grossly obese she can't urinate or defecate without covering herself in waste, she's basically immobile, and she just looks so uncomfortable in any position she sits/lies in. also, we've noticed lumps of fat clustered around her chest, i can't imagine it would be helpful to take her to a vet at this stage for investigation as she's so fat it must be extremely difficult to palpate/she can't be healthy enough to have a general anesthetic. my nana refuses to admit her dog is overweight, i genuinely can't tell if it's because she lives with her and therefore can't notice a difference or if it's embarrassment. she will insist it's the dog's fur making her appear larger than she actually is- i've tried showing her pictures of the dog when we first got her to compare, and pointing out her weight after she's just been cut but she won't hear it. we've tried gently approaching the fact that she is overfeeding her because she's forgotten that she's already fed her, but nana gets so defensive and becomes upset that we thinks she's crazy. this post is getting long so i'm going to summarise what we've noticed her doing:* nana feeds the dog off of her own plate- we've caught her feeding the dog an entire pizza before * nana buys a new crate of dog food every week and always asks us to pick up more for her as she's ran out (that's 40 pouches of food in under a week, so roughly 6 pouches of food per day)* nana gives her dog treats for literally anything, she's gone outside? treat. she's not barked at the postman? treat. she believes she hasn't given her a treat in a while? treat* whatever my nana eats, the dog eats. i'm talking anything. chocolate, toast, crisps, pizza, you name it. i've had heated arguments with her when i've caught her taking a bite of chocolate and giving half to the dogwe've tried taking the dog away, nana actually tripped over her a few months ago and broke her hip. while she was in hospital and recovering, the dog stayed with us for approximately 2 months. she seemed so much happier, our house was a fat camp for her. she was walked twice a day, no treats, and a normal amount of food per day. she lost so much weight. but nana wouldn't forget about her and eventually we had to give her back, she's put all the weight back on and more. i'm sorry this became so long. i'm just totally out of options and lost for what to do here. the poor dog is my nana's lifeline as i know she hates living alone, but i feel like the only member of my family to recognise this as animal abuse. any advice/similar experiences would be hugely appreciated, i feel like i've already failed the poor dog and god only knows how many health issues she must have/be developing already. thanks so much

Brutal treatment of my wife
my mother-in-law has this dreaded disease and she opted to go to assisted living in a rage, some years ago. she got tired of us asking her if she was alright because of how much she was struggling with everything. before that she had been living with us and getting progressively worse, not eating on her own, just laying about and very fixated on things she wanted us to do or get for her. my wife mentioned how needy she was to her mom one day and her mom flipped and started calling assisted living places on her own.now, she's been there for several years, in a very good place and they are great with her. she gets her diet needs seen to, gets her meds (this was a big issue when with us, she would forget and double up or just not take them) and they have all kinds of stuff for her to do, even in the pandemic.all the time, still, she calls and says that she thinks that she can go live in the houses on the property, where older folks live without assistance. she misses cooking, being free to do what she wants, etc.she keeps saying that she's in prison and that my wife put her there. these outbursts are happening more and more.this time, she wants a new chair, so my brother-in-law opted to buy her one. he's been researching it but apparently taking too long. so she (mil) calls my wife and asks what's taking so long. then she goes into her routine about how she can be living in unassisted housing and that the doctor said she's fine to do that.aside: when she was diagnosed, and then rediagnosed there were about 10 years in between. when we got the official diagnosis, it was recommended that we move her, because it would get harder and harder for her. she thinks every time she goes to get a physical that she's being reevaluated and rediagnosed and if she gets some answers right on her test it means that she doesn't need to be in assisted living, anymore.back to our regular story:so she calls my wife and blasts her because she doesn't know or care about how bad she's been getting and my wife takes it personally. basically neither of her siblings answer when she calls or do much to help. mil takes it out on us and lately, she's been brutal. she called one day while we were driving back from helping move one of our kids and since we were almost having fun, she belted out one of her classics about how we could have fun and she was stuck in prison.once in a while, her being upset, especially in this new and dreaded pandemic, i get it. you feel cooped up, and we do too. but turning her rage on the one daughter that does everything, and being so brutal and making it as though we've had her incarcerated is awful. my wife feels the guilt. she knows her mom needs to be in there. she can't do her own meds, she can't remember anything. she gets fixated on certain things (chair) she can remember and then harps on it to anyone who will listen. but my wife just feels so bad and so, she takes it personally. she knows her mom has to be there, but she can't just let it bounce off and ignore it or hang up.i feel helpless to help her, because for me, it would be different. i won't put up with that shit. i will tell it like it is and that's maybe mean or cruel. when she was with us and would harp on something, i would keep a tally and show her: "you've asked me about this 7 times, today." she'd get abashed and stop for a while. it wasn't to be mean, but it helped both of us.i suggested printing out the doctor's ruling that says she  needs to be there (assisted living) and having it framed and when her mom freaks out, show it to her, like some dick version of the notebook.i just get so tired of her being treated this way when she's done so much.

My Grandma Keeps Calling Me with Conspiracy Theories About my Parents
my grandma lives alone with her sister in a house. they are both in their 90's, but everyone has been unable to make them consider a nursing home. they do okay on their own, surprisingly. no major incidents except some driving problems which helped us convince her not to drive anymore. unfortunately, the past year or so, we've all noticed a significant decline in her mental functions. her memory is bad. she misplaces things, forgets words, and oftentimes struggles to keep up with a conversation. she finally got a diagnosis of alzheimer's which was quite disheartening to all of us but at least confirmation of what we were seeing. the doctor has shared these findings with her, but she is by and large in denial of the problems. she thinks the diagnosis is part of a plot. she thinks she is fine, and refuses any kinds of medication. her sister has is not helping, claiming that she sees no issues and oftentimes just jumping into onto the side of my grandmother in even the most minor disagreements. i guess siblings really are for life!she is a remarkably intelligent woman and frankly one of my heroes. she is a true example of a strong woman. the flip-side of this is how stubborn and aggressive she is. i've seen how she fights them every time they try to make decisions for her. it oftentimes has felt to me that she will disagree with someone just to be the one making the decisions, arguing points that don't make sense just to win. alzheimer's has just made this that much worse, now becoming mixed into with a combination of paranoia, anger, and fear.lately, she's taken to calling me and telling me her conspiracy theories about my parents. some are quite sinister...that they want to kill her and take her money. others are somewhat benign...my dad comes over to mess with her plumbing so she'll be forced to move out. all of it is hard for me. i try to not say i believe her conspiracies but also just reassure her. "i'm going to take care of you no matter what." and "don't worry, i'm looking out for you. whatever happens, you're going to be safe." and so on. that being said, sometimes these answers do not satisfy her. she wants me to agree that these conspiracies are happening and i just try to change the subject but she's very forceful. a few times i've had to tell her that i think she's being cared for. it's easier if i agree with her, but i don't want to feed her delusions.i'm only 30 and work a lot. she calls me quite often these days just looking for reassurance. i've read many patients find themselves alone and not being listened to when they get alzheimer's because peopel just can't handle the pain of the discussion but i'm trying to just pick up no matter what unless i'm at work or asleep. i just love her so much and i don't want her to feel alone or scared. she is very religious and although i'm not in church much anymore i just try to pray with her whenever i can. it always makes her feel better and cry.i don't know why i'm writing this, maybe just wanting to share my story and hear i'm not alone. it's so tough to get her calls and see the woman i've known my whole life fall apart. i can't even imagine how my mom feels...anyways thanks for reading.

My dad doesn't remember to take his meds, can't get him into neurologist either
my dad is 61 and he has been showing signs of memory loss for the last couple of years. he lives alone and i live in another state. i went to visit him recently. he is working and owns his own business, but got let go of a major contract a year ago. i'm starting to worry about him and his abilities to take care of himself, but he's pretty prideful and not open with his finances at all. i know he doesn't have a 401k and has limited savings.anyways, in february this year i took him to see his primary care doctor, and they did a cognitive test which consisted of asking him questions like "where are you right now?", "what year is it?", etc. he got most of these correct because he isn't senile. however, they told him to repeat back 3 words, they asked him a minute later and he couldn't remember any of them. he is aware of where he is, who people are, etc. but his short-term memory is awful. my grandma passed away from alzheimer's when she was in her 80's, so i know this runs in my family. the primary care doctor didn't want to run further tests, but she agreed to prescribe him aricept and send a referral to a neurologist for further testing. i finally convinced him to pick the aricept up from the pharmacy. but, i just asked if he's been taking his memory medicine and he just said, "i'm not on those now. i need to call the doc. i'll do that". which is great but i don't think he will remember to call, he forgets everything. i can call to remind him but it's just becoming to get a bit overwhelming. i'm worried about him, and we haven't been able to really have an open conversation about his memory and he doesn't communicate. he likes to pretend he has everything under control, if that makes sense. it's been a few months and an uphill battle to even get an appointment for a neurologist, too. the one place in town that takes his insurance is booked and hasn't even gotten his referral scanned in and it seems like we are no where near getting in for an appointment. has anyone had this issue? also, does anyone have any tips for taking care of a parent when you live out of state? i want to visit more but it's just been hard, especially since covid hit. i went to visit him last weekend even though i probably shouldn't have risked it? idk.

I need to ask for help figuring this all out.
so. everything is falling apart currently, and was even before the covid-19. i am 99.99% sure my husband has alzheimers. he refuses to go to a doctor for a "checkup" and i don't know how to bring it up with him in a straightforward way because it is his greatest fear and i am terrified. he has in the past always said if he gets alzheimers he will kill himself.his father died of alzheimers and his older brother is about 4 years into alzheimers. about 8 months ago he retired and was home full-time with me. i work from home and have a disability, i am much younger than he is. i'm in my mid thirties. we have a 4 year old child with some sort of emotional/sensory issue we are currently getting a diagnosis for. after he retired i thought he was entering a depression, which i know is common when retiring. at first i made sure to force him out and about with me, window shopping or to a restaurant for lunch, hiking, etc. but then over the next few months i started noticing things. here's a general list, every day he does maybe 5-10 things that are abnormal:- forgets the bank cards- forgets the pin numbers for them. sometimes he calls me three times in a row at the store at the cash register and i tell him the pin each time before he can get it right. same pin he's used forever.- gets confused where familiar stores are- gets lost in parking lots finding the car even if it is close to the door- can't solve a problem/find a solution to simple things- is doing the dishes differently, had never done them that way in 6 years.- suddenly can't see well, eye exam says his eyes are fine- can hear but not understand what is being said. i have to repeat slowly every time.- hangs up laundry in the wrong spots, i find my clothes in our daughters room, i find my clothes in strange places, he hangs up pajamas with shirts- leaves cupboard doors open- does odd things when cooking, almost caught the stove on fire one day when he put a pan filled with oil in the oven. takes him 45 minutes to coom scrambled eggs and makes mistakes. i have to supervise cooking now.- doesn't flush the toilet, leaves the door open, pees around the bathroom floor and doesn't seem to notice- unable to put any visual artwork or puzzle type things together even when just shown how (as in shown the exact piece and where)- gets very irritable especially in the evenings, can't handle any noise/activity- says he is going to go do something in the house yet 15 minutes later is elsewhere and i have to remind him he was going to do that thing- can't notice if i am in distress due to my disability and need help, i can be literally sitting beside him and pushing him for help, he has no idea. he gets sucked into the tv and is unaware of everything else going on.- makes strange decisions. for example we had an important appointment over skype with someone. he then sits on the floor like a child staring at the screen as if that is normal and i have to tell him to come sit in a chair. - i can give him specific step-by-step instructions or a list with detailed easy instructions and he gets very confused and needs help the entire time.- puts things in the wrong places (kitchen, etc)- leaves things all over the place and doesn't notice them after. i have to go around picking everything up.- mistook a strange child as a relativeanyway a lot of other things.with my daughter home and him home i am at a loss and frankly near a breaking point. someone please give me input/advice.

Unending Anger and Violence
what do you do, or can you do, when the alzheimer’s sufferer has no emotion but anger and eventually fits of rage with violence? is there any kind of emergency placement or help? it is gettting to the point where dad and i cannot take care of her and we are starting to fear for safety of everyone.background: mom is entering the latter stages of the disease. she has forgotten who i am (her son) and thinks i am her sister. she cannot converse with people, though she can speak tons of words, because she cannot comprehend sentences well enough to formulate a response that makes sense. any conversational topic is met with hostility. ask her how she is doing, she will retort with something nonsensical and get angry. she doesn’t have good hygiene; poor teeth brushing and showering is basically splashing water on herself. she cannot dress herself successfully. she cannot prepare food and struggles to eat things correctly (dexterity issues). she also often says people are trying to make her fat, but she is 5’4” and maybe 110 pounds. has lost probably 30 pounds in last year.she spends most of her waking hours talking to herself loudly. her self talk makes her angry. as if she is arguing with someone all the time who isn’t there. when she gets out of the shower the fact she is wet makes her angry. if you try to help her get ready in the morning, she gets angry. if you bring her food, she gets angry. if you bring her her pills, she gets angry. when she goes to doctors for various visits, she treats the doctors in the worst ways with attitude and language. christmas was awful, as you’d hand her a gift and she’d throw it across the room, going back to talking to whatever demon haunts her mind.a year ago, she was cooperative and knew who people were. she could have good days, smile, tell people she loved them. she could dress herself, but belts and drawstrings became problematic. she seemed to welcome help. but since last september the started having vivid hallucinations and started talking to herself more and more.neurologist prescribed some very small dose of something given to schizophrenics to try to reduce the hostility. recently had us up the dosage since she wouldn’t ever go to sleep and would spend hours at night talking to herself in bed. she’d wake early as well and not nap.cannot get through to her because literally everything is responded to in hostility. she frequently gets into violent fits of rage, throwing punches, kicks, grabs, pinches, and pushes. you get to a point where you walk away but if she follows you almost have to restrain her. just at about the end of our own rope and don’t know where to turn.

I AM NOT sure what to do with my dad's what seems early stage of Alzheimers, leading me to great frustration!
okay, i am really fighting hard to cope with my dad's early stage of alzheimer's. it isn't that bad compared to others. but, my dad keeps forgetting minor things, to a point where now it's costing me and my family money (more on that later). and on top of that, my dad is a really stubborn guy. i can say both those two don't make a good mix from my experience.due to his condition, he can't exactly maintain a steady job. so its pretty much my mom and me being the primary provider for now. my dad who works in it still gets jobs here and there, but its more contract-based, and mostly lasts 3 months.now, let me get to the part where it's costing our family money.but, let me first say this.. like i said before, my dad's condition isn't that bad, and i feel really bad for him. but,  its coming to a point of just pure frustration for me at least on my part.coming to a point where our house kitchen was almost fully burned down twice. once was our stove being totaled, 2nd time half the kitchen was burned down, and my dad was told by my mom multiple times to not use the stovetop, but did it anyways.now when it comes to whatever is left in our family savings just about a month ago my dad lost 1grand due to some miss placement of his certain investments that he can't remember. my dad didn't give me enough details because of his stubbornness. i could easily come up with couple of pages to what else my dad lost money-wise, and important items like a passport to his driver license due to this condition, but what happened in the last week or two kinda made me lost my anger.and today.... well... i almost lost it today where i had to walk out the house cause of how angry i got. today my mom left about 80dollars in front of my door to do some grocery shopping. i was sick all day, and was in my room just resting.as of right now, my parents is in the process of selling our house, so my dad can sorta retire and not worry about any debts, and of course, it will help his medical situation. that being said, we kinda hired these handymans to repair certain parts of our house in order to put it in the market so it can sell for a better price.so long story short, my mom left money for me to which my dad kept the money in front of my door and of course my dad not walking with these handymen, and forgetting that my dad left cash in front my door, like 100% for sure these crooks/handyman took the money, who i didn't know was going to show up today.i mean... i know it's only $80dollars, but just something triggered in me that got me really frustrated at my dad, when you also add all the incidents he did in the past. i had to walk outside just to vent my frustration cause of what my dad did. it was just one too many incidents that caused me to kinda lose my anger.another reason why i lost my anger today, cause just last week my dad gave someone $100 something dollars to replace our mid size fridge at our basement, to which my dad gave it to this one handyman who ofcourse didn't show up with our replacement fridge. this didn't have to do with his mental condition (or maybe it kinda does), but just adds up when my dad makes all these decisions combine with his alzheimers.my mom keeps telling my dad to be more careful with our financial situation, but he keeps forgetting minor and simple things, which causes our family to lose money. like i feel bad for my dad, but same time really frustrated cause he just won't listen most of the time.not sure what else to do, cause i know alzheimers is nothing you can solve in one day, but not sure if there are some sorta routines or medication. i know my dad takes some sorta medication, but ofcourse he won't give me the details.but, as of right now, i am kinda losing it. cause mom does make more money than me, and she works in the child daycare field. her, health isn't doing any better due to her age catching up. but, seeing money being lost by my dad, that's being hard-earned by mom is really hard to see. my dad didn't lose like all our savings or anything like that. but, just these incidents kinda adds up and doesn't make our already financial situation any easier.i thank you for reading this lengthy help i guess you can say. not sure if there is some sorta help group of sort that can help my dad's routine on not forgetting things and i guess not being stubborn is another source of method to fix i guess. but, just really hard to cope with, especially when my parents are in a tough financial situation.

Could it be something else than early signs of Alzheimer’s?
my mother is 70 and has recently been forgetting things (recent memories mainly) for the mast year and a half and it’s getting worse. here’s a little bit of context :-she has diabetes type 2 (since she was 50-55yo), that is treated with metformin. her diabetes acts up sometimes but it never got too bad. although recently (last month) she had to start taking metformin in the evening too. -she had half of her thyroid removed 10 or 15 years ago. she’s been taking levothyroxine since then. it’s quite stable now even though she had some troubles with the new formula for a while. she still has mild hypothyroidism sometimes but never anything serious.-she had breast cancer in 2012 but it has been successfully removed with surgery. she then had to go through radiotherapy and take meds (don’t know what) for 5 years. -she’s also treated for osteoporosis with prolia every 6 months and vitamin d. **-she’s been having bad insomnia for a year and a half now. memory loss and anxiety started at the same time.** she will basically sleep quite late, around midnight and she’ll wake up between 2 and 4 am. she then usually manages to sleep some more between 7 and 10am. so yeah, she now forget a lot of things. mainly content of conversations that happened recently. any new information is quite hard to remember. or at least the details of that information, for example she’ll remember that my sister who lives far is coming for the holidays but she’ll forget when exactly and will ask over and over again. she also find things confusing. things that she would understand before, like some settings on the tv etc. it generally takes way more time to explain things and we actually have to explain things over and over again. the weirdest thing happened recently. she’s muslim and prays 5 times a day. she always has and she’s always used the same calendar to know at what time she has to pray as there are no muezzins where we live. she’s never had any problem with that but recently after coming back from a trip to visit her family in algeria (where there are muezzins and where she didn’t have to use a calendar), she started doubting the calendar. she now thinks it’s inaccurate and she’s really anxious about it. she asked me and my sister to check several times that it was ok and prayed accordingly. she then asked almost everyone around her who told her the same thing. and last week she asked me and my sisters again but she still doubts for some reason and feel bad about it. or yesterday she said that « from now on until march the days will keep getting shorter ». i had to explain several times that the winter solstice was december 21 and that it was the opposite until june 21. she knows that she’s forgetting more and more things. she notices all those changes and is frustrated and when i ask her for example why she feels that way about the calendar she’ll tell me something she always says now : « i don’t know, i don’t feel right, there’s something wrong with me ». she of course told all this to her doctors but so far she’s got no answers at all and is still waiting for an appointment with a specialist. my question is : could it be something else than dementia/alzheimers? could it be the lack of sleep?could it be just a symptom of her other conditions or a side effect of her medicines? (sorry if it’s not clear/concise. it’s super stressful...)

my grandma just passed away
she had alzheimer’s for the past 5ish years and the decline has been fast and heartbreaking to watch. she lost so much weight. there was a time where she would scream in agony all day. she couldn’t do anything for herself and towards the end she even forgot how to eat, drink water, walk.even though it has been five years, it feels like it all happened so fast. i remember one day she was telling my dad how she had been driving her car and somehow ended up in the middle of nowhere. and at the time, no one thought anything of it really. but after that, things subtly and gradually got worse. she would forget how to use a tv remote, forget where things were. and eventually she got diagnosed and i still didn’t really take it seriously. all old people forget stuff. but it just got worse and worse. she started to forget who my grandad was and would be aggressive towards him, she started having seizures...it’s like my grandma was 3 different people. there’s the grandma i grew up with who was an intelligent, streetwise, quick witted lady who was the centre of our family, the glue that held us all together. then there is her as the alzheimer’s was in the early stage, the goofy, adorable, silly grandma who always thought our front step was a huge drop when it was actually tiny and giggled at silly nursery rhymes. then there was her at the late stage, an unrecognisable shell. she spent the last year of her life sat in a chair, a far off glassy look in her eye, being completely reliant on other people. i had started university by then and so i wasn’t around much. but if i’m being honest, i didn’t visit her enough. my grandad and my aunt and my cousins all had a role in taking care of her and when i was there, i felt like a spare part, useless. i was only close to my grandma, i wasn’t close to any of them and i’m a quiet person by nature, so i wouldn’t ever really have much to say. when i was there i felt so out of place...it’s so odd to feel that way when surrounded by family. as if the situation wasn’t depressing enough. not to mention it simply caused me so much pain to watch her suffer the way she did, to see her dignity taken away as people helped her use the bathroom, to see her slipping away. sometimes she would sit and just sob in agony. and that broke me completely. i think i mourned her death long before it happened. she’d been gone a long time, her physical body just had to catch up. i’m angry that this disease exists and there are so many scumbags who will continue to roam the earth in perfect health while my beautiful grandma won’t. i am trying to hold onto the precious memories i have with her before this disease got her. i never want to forget the songs she would sing to me, the sound of her laugh, the way she would always tell me my eyes are bigger than my belly when i couldn’t finish my dinner, her beautiful smile, the way she smelt when she would hug me, the way she could fix anything, the stories she told me, the way she would always say “goodnight, god bless and remember those three little words: i love you” as she tucked me into bed. no one will ever be able to fathom how much i loved her and how much i still do. i would give anything to hug my grandma one last time. i hope that one day i will get to do just that. goodnight god bless grandma, remember those three little words: i love you.

I think my dad may have early onset Alzheimers
i'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but i'm not sure where else to ask for help. i believe my father may have early onset alzheimers. he is 61 and his mother had alzheimers when she was in her early 80's before she passed. he has been drinking beer/smoking pot on a daily basis for most of his life so i feel that may have something to do with it but i'm not entirely sure.he has been having problems with his memory for a few years now but lately he has really been scaring our family. i've looked up some symptoms of eoa and it doesn't seem like he has many of them but his forgetfulness is on another level. he will ask the same question several times. for example, when he got home today he had asked me if i had fed our dogs. i told him yes. he then asks my mom the same question multiple times to "make sure." my mom gets annoyed after a while and says "do you realize you've asked me that five times?" and tells him how odd that is of him. after my mom had already made a big deal about it i hear him in the kitchen feeding the dogs. i go confront him and ask him if he remembers us telling him five times that they've already been fed. he says yes but no one gave him an answer. he does things like this on a daily basis.we got into an argument yesterday and already talked about it and he just randomly comes up to me and brings it up again. i tell him all of my points again from before and he acts like he can't believe what he's hearing like it's the first time we argued about it.does this sound like alzheimers?? he does things like this all the time. we all try to tell him that his behavior is really scaring us but he laughs it off and acts like we're crazy for thinking that about him. i've tried talking to him about going to see a doctor and he gets super defensive and he doesn't believe his memory is bad at all. i feel really hopeless because he refuses to listen to any of us and i don't think there's anything else i can do. my mom blames it on his drinking which he also refuses to acknowledge is a problem. how can i get him to acknowledge any of this? it really scares me thinking that he may end up as bad as his mother was towards the end of her life and he is only in his early 60's.

Handling a big move -- venting, worrying
my mother, 82, was recently diagnosed with alzheimer's, though has been showing increasing memory problems for several years and has been on a steeper downhill slide the last four months. she's currently living in the "independent living" area in an excellent retirement community where the residents and staff know her and care about her. later this week we are moving her to a new facility where she will be in assisted living, with memory care available when she needs it.i'm her son, 64, and i am her agent under her power of attorney, which was authorized by the written opinion of her doctor. my mom has a very controlling personality. for the most part, she has used her powers for good, planning carefully for her future. she has long term care insurance and enough money in her investments to last her for many, many years. but now, of course, she's resisting my taking control of her finances (she has forgotten many times to pay bills, her rent, etc) and is absolutely against moving. her current facility has been doing what they can within their legal power (we are in washington, where there are strict laws governing what the differences are between independent and assisted living) to keep her safe while we find new housing, but there is really no choice now that we have a new home for her. she has to move. we've talked about it many times over the past few weeks. as expected, every conversation about her moving is the same conversation, because she can't remember what we've talked about in the past. she continually surprised by the fact that she can't stay where she is (they can't provide the level of care she needs). she asks over and over about the new rent, and where the money is coming from, why she has to move when she's happy where she is. her arguments and questions are always the same. it's almost like a script, and have no idea how to get ahead of it, if i even can. i tell her over and over -- sometimes several times in the same conversation -- where the money is coming from, that it's hers, and it's being used exclusively for her (though, to be honest, i've been a co-signer on her bank accounts for over a decade, long before dementia was an issue for her...so i could legally use it for anything i want, but morally...no, it's hers). as much as i am able i keep my patience, answer her questions and explain the circumstances as if it's the first time i'm hearing her questions and giving her the answers.i dread the next week, as we pack and move, and the weeks after as she gets used to her new home (or doesn't, as the case may be). i love my mom, and i hate having to defy her. i'm afraid of her taking a walk in the next few days and getting lost, as she has a couple times lately (not seriously lost...not yet). since she's in independent living at the moment, the staff can't legally stop her from leaving. but i'm afraid she'll get it into her head to walk away as a deliberate act against the control i've had to take over her life. or she could write me a letter revoking the power of attorney, which is one of the provisions of the poa. i doubt she'll remember she can do that (though i've reminded her of it a couple of times), or won't be able to think through the decision and the act to do it. and if somehow she does, with the new lease having been signed and move-out notices given, i have no idea what i would need to do next. i know this is probably an old story. everyone's alzheimer's journey is different, they tell me, but the broad strokes are much the same. and i know in my head what i'm doing is right for her. but she also makes me doubt it. i'm a pretty empathetic person, but i have a hard time empathizing with her, seeing things through her eyes, because her memory problems are foreign to me, especially since she's been so logical and thought so correctly for my whole life.i wish i could *feel* i'm doing things right. i know i'm doing the best i can. no one among her friends or family is opposing my decisions except my mom, but i'm also the only one making decisions.so i had to vent.

Finding a doctor for my Grandma
i moved away from my family for college and ended staying thousands of miles away to start my career. my family called to inform me that my 83 year old grandmother who i'm very close with had a sudden change in her mental state. she's has been getting slightly forgetful in the last few years, but she's recently called the police 4+ times claiming there was a break in and things were stolen. all the items were found in odd places in her house, so now she's convinced someone broke in and moved them. i dropped everything and flew to her to make sure she was safe and assess the situation. she's normal most of the time, but gets bouts of paranoia and delusions. i took her to her primary to check for a possible uti and to address her oxybutinyn perscriptions (side effects can be hallucinations and delusions). doctor wrote off my concerns about the meds, claiming he also takes them and they are fine. i had to fight to get the urine testing for a possible uti, which was supposedly negative. he excused himself quickly to see other patients. i discreetly spoke to the ma's (i hate to belittle my sweet grandmother) about her delusions, they seemed concerned and wrote down my concerns and said the doctor would call me later. he indeed called and told me that those were reasons to be concerned, but followed up with "i understand your concern, but not sure how i'm supposed to fit in here?" im not a doctor! i assumed these were things her doctor should be aware of and perhaps would like to monitor or even refer me to a neurologist. he offered no advice other than "put her in a home". please tell me there are more constructive, helpful doctor's out there! i have no idea if she has dementia, alzheimer's, or some other issue causing this. i have put my day to day life on hold to help my grandma (which i am very happy to do if she needs me) but i can't come to a solution if i don't even know what exactly or roughly what i'm dealing with. this is the hardest thing i have ever dealt with. i cry every time i talk about her symptoms to anyone, it breaks my heart to know my grandma is scared and confused. any advice is greatly appreciated.

Experiences/Finding Aides for multi-lingual families?
i saw bits here and there of people observing a large variety of manifestations, but i wanted to reach out anyway and ask about what you or people around you experienced with your loved one(s) who were multi-lingual. my (30f) mother (56) is from seoul and lived in korea, moved to germany after having studied the language for many years, and then moved to the u.s. after marrying my father (55, who is german). she is (was?) trilingual. it's been about two years since the onset of noticeable symptoms-- she still has a rudimentary grasp of english and can interact with other english-speakers, though not with fluid conversation. her german grammar is still very good, though she'll forget the word for something pretty often. her go-to for the past several months has been korean. unless someone addresses her in a different language, she'll speak only korean. she doesn't seem to be aware of it and often speaks korean to people who don't know or understand it (for instance, the german side of my family). has anyone experienced something similar? if yes, were you able to help them keep up with other languages? i'm a little worried for a number of reasons. my father's korean is not great. mine is better, but i'm not fluent (i can ask her what she needs/what's wrong/the basics, but i can't engage in meaningful conversation; i am fluent in german, however). i'm worried she might regress completely and i think we're reaching a point where my father will need assistance. i'm wondering if i should start looking for a korean-speaking home aide? or could it help her to keep being around english-speakers?also, a bigger question i've been wanting to ask is where to start looking for someone who can provide assistance? she needs almost constant supervision at this point and even though my father is able to do almost all his work from home, i don't think this is sustainable in the long-term. he's only 55 and although i think he has the means to retire, it wouldn't be the most comfortable life for the two of them. i am not in a geographical position (i live 600 miles away and cannot leave my current city) or financial one to assistance, unfortunately. any stories or advice would be so helpful. thanks in advance to everyone on this sub, just for reading. it helps so much knowing that one is not alone.

My dad is becoming angrier and angrier, to the point where we are worried about his own safety
he hasn't had an official diagnosis yet. but we see the signs early onset alzheimer's. just like his mother, my grandma, before she got really bad.if you didn't know him you probably wouldn't notice yet. but living with him, it's hard not to see it. and i feel guilty saying this but he's becoming harder and harder to live with.i know there's a lot about it that he just can't help. but i also know that he was an asshole long before this. we didn't realize how bad it was until after he stopped working and he was home all the time. his temper is becoming more irrational, and his tantrums are lasting longer. he punched a hole in the wall last month.he's forgetful about everything. he always was, because he just never cared enough to pay attention. but now when he forgets something he gets angry at us as if it was our fault for not telling him or correcting him because he just won't admit that he's in the wrong or that he has a problem.i'm not sure exactly what to say or how to say it. i'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this in. but my mom's biggest fear is that he'll get in an accident while driving. to be honest that was always how to fix your keyboard eventually died. even before this. he's always been a bit of an aggressive driver. but even more so now that he gets so easily confused about where he's going while driving. getting confused and getting angry about being confused can easily cause him to make reckless choices.i don't believe he should be driving at all anymore. but i can't stop him. he's too big, too loud, too aggressive deal with and say no to. and my mom always gives in. some days she gives in as if she's been in an abusive marriage her whole life doesn't have the strength or confidence to stop him.how do you control the 300-pound asshole who acts like and entitled privileged 5 year old with no empathy for anyone else around them?

My mother (f66) is in denial - no one sees things - except me - Does she have it?
i noticed things a long time ago. we're talking when i was visiting europe, the person i was staying with wanted to visit norway. i told my mother this a few times over a week. next thing you know, she's asking me, "did you guys go to finland?" i told her no. she told me it's because my grandmother was finnish, and it confused her.&amp;#x200b;not a big deal. weird, but nothing crazy.&amp;#x200b;then the paint. she painted the outer border of the house. she told me a while back about this, she talks to a lot of relatives, etc. anyways, she asked me what i think of it, i told her she already told me. whatever, again, weird. but see? she's also told relatives. so, just mixing things up.&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;now, comes more weird events. like telling me a story about the bank. two hours later, i bring up that same topic she told me - she claims it was the day before. she has no recollection of our conversation. big. red. flag. i cry and fret, and she's acting like it's totally nothing.&amp;#x200b;things like, come over to my new apartment - i just vacuumed, and i want to know if it smells better. 15 minutes later, we're driving in her car on the way to my apartment, she asks, "so, how did the new vacuum work?" i stared at her, asking if she recalled our previous conversation. no recollection.&amp;#x200b;now, this year was enormous stress-wise. that or she was genuinely tired. genuinely. &amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;again, would sleep and stress cause genuine memory loss? if you think about if from your own point of view, being the age you're at right now - would you think stress or lack of sleep would cause total memory loss?&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;few days ago, i was telling her how one of my clients has a really sweet bichon dog, she dresses her up in sweaters - it's adorable. few seconds later, she asks, "what breed is she?" i stop, and repeat, "bichon.... do you remember me saying that?" she claims it was because i was closing the silverware drawer as i was talking, but i can't remember. &amp;#x200b;also, i'm sure i told her about my friend getting married. i told her again, she says, "what, she got married? :o" i said, yes, remember me tell you? "no, you said she was thinking about it."&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;hahaha... i'm laughing in frustration. my family sees absolutely nothing. it's not obvious to a point where mistakes are being made everyday. she still knows where she places things, she can pay her bills, she takes care of herself. she has never gotten lost. &amp;#x200b;it's just..... strange. memory lapses. which could be attributed with stress and anxiety. but it's extremely concerning. &amp;#x200b;my family - has basically convinced her, that i'm crazy. i need councelling (this has been eating me up. i have spent a year and a half - depressed - because i don't want to lose my mom. i lost my father four years ago. i have physically aged, that, plus i have someone close who is dealing with spinal cancer) &amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;anyways, relatives tell her to tell me to take a hike. don't listen to your daughter, she needs help. which, yeah, i do.&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;but i am almost convinced she has a type of dementia. she is adament that there is absolutely nothing wrong. she's not in denial - she truly believes she is fine. same with every single relative who knows her. i guess i'm just very aware.&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;so, i guess my questions are:&amp;#x200b;\- do you think she's showing signs?\- and how the hell can i get her to a doctor?&amp;#x200b;i have tried, but she is digging in her heels every which way i try my best to pull her. &amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;this is coming froma

Need some advice for dealing with a difficult parent with Alzheimer’s and the power dynamic that my parents had that is now working against starting the care my Mom needs.
to being with my mother was diagnosed with dementia (probably alzheimer’s from having a grand-mother go through it but getting her to go back to the doctors has been difficult) about six months ago.  at that time they called us and told us what was going on and that they would like us to move home (we live about a 14 hour drive away from them at the moment) and build an extra house on their property to be able to help my father out with the long term care that my mother will require.  me and my wife agreed and made plans to move back home in about 2 months from that time.  we decided with my father that we would take what is my mothers workshop (she does crafts for a living) and use that to live in while the house was being built.  at first this was fine, then as things started coming out of the shop my mothers attitude changed and became aggressive towards my father about the changes being done.  it finally came to a crashing halt about a month before we were set to move back in a phone call that had my father just say forget the whole thing.  luckily my wife could rescind her notice to her work and we hadn’t given notice to where we rent but it was still a bit jarring to say the least.fast forward to this last week back home visiting them.  my mother is farther along than i realized from the phone conversations i’ve been having with her.  she repeats herself sometimes within just minutes of saying something and forgets she’s the one that came up with certain ideas just earlier in the day.  she’s always had a problem with not letting go of the past and complaining a lot but now with alzheimer’s its gone to a whole new level.  it’s like all the crappiest things that ever happened to her is on constant rewind in her head.  this of course has not helped my parents relationship.  my father has always kind of just let my mother be in charge and given her a bit of a wide-berth on anything she had an issue with.  so now that dynamic between them is keeping us from going forward with any real help for them.  he needs help because he cant leave her alone and no one is there to really help him.  i’m an only child and they really don’t have anyone else to lean on for help.  even if he could find someone to come sit with her so he could get some time away she would just hold it over is head that he left her for how ever long before the next thing happens that bothers her.  i see this already aging him (he’s 73) and its not even been a year yet.  my mother can be a very sweet person but she had a difficult childhood and tends to linger on the negatives and isn’t able to move on or fully forgive.  so here’s my dilemma.  me, my wife and my father all want us living next to them to be able to help him moving forward with her.  my wife has medical assistant training and worked in a nursing home for years so she has hands on experience with this.  we’ve been renting for years and we’ve already been looking into buying a house so being able to build a house for us on my childhood homestead which me and my wife love would be nice.  also being able to help my mother through this would be rewarding for myself.  my mother has and even is at times on board with all of this, until she’s sat and worried about it so much that she freaks out on my father about it, and then when it gets to the nuclear level he caves.  me and my wife have i think been able to finally get him to see that he needs to take the wheel and make some hard decisions even when there is going to be a fight involved at some point.  he agrees but to be honest i’m not sure if i can fully trust him on it since he always does cave in the end, its what happened six months ago and i don’t know if he’ll do it again when push comes to shove.so now the question is how do we get her onboard with this.  my father needs it to happen so i don’t end up losing him from the stress alone and we need to have some stability in knowing how to plan our lives moving forward.  the plan is as of now for us to move back home in may and start building a house on their property close enough to their house to help but not so close as to be in their way.  the idea of changing any part of their house always ends in her freaking out eventually about it, even if it was originally her idea.  for right now i convinced my father to take my mother out of the discussion process of this as it seems giving her any information to dwell on usually leads to her worrying about it until she lays into him about it.  we don’t want to just surprise her with it but i’m also not sure how to approach it in a positive way but with the understanding that this isn’t really a decision she can veto.  if anyone has any suggestions or best practices in dealing with maybe something similar to my situation i am all ears.  i looked up a lot of best practices but those are more general and i’m in need of a bit of nuance.  any help would be much appreciated.

I try not to think about it
and now i feel guilty. my sister has progressive alzheimer's. she and i have been very close for all our lives, even though she is 15 years older than i. her son, my dear nephew, passed 3 years ago from lung cancer, just at the time her disease was becoming evident. it was a 2 year struggle for me, dealing with her by myself. i moved her and her entire household twice. i sold her home and her car. i packed all of her things, weeded them out, and moved her into a small room in a group home with her cat. i pay her rent from her social security and pension. she is in good hands with 24-hour medical care.when she was well, i spoke to her every day on the phone. her husband died in 2001 and after that i began to call her every day to check on her, and then it became a habit. at first, when she moved into the home, i called her every day, but then it turned into a battle of her wanting to know when she could go home. it became easier for all involved for me not to call her every day. i still go over there at least once a week to visit her. she's forgetting everything about her life, but thankfully she still knows me. and thankfully she has forgotten that she's lost her son.but here is what's troubling me. i find myself thinking of her less often during the day. the first time i moved her into a independent living place, i didn't realize that she needed more than that. i called her literally 7 times a day. i had an alarm on my phone. i would remind her to wait to go to the dining room until i called her to take her blood sugar and give herself insulin. i would call her at night and ask her to take a shower before bed. i hated going to her place because it smelled bad. i didn't realize she wasn't taking care of herself, as far as bathroom and bathing habits go, and that she was hiding dirty clothes. i didn't realize what a relief it would be when i moved her into a home with 24 hour care.i don't feel guilty about it. i am so happy that she is safe, and being cared for by people who have the knowledge to take care of her properly and give her her medicine and all that.i feel guilty, because i think of her far less often than i used to. she is not the person i used to know, but she's still my beloved sister. she's going away from me, and i know that. she doesn't know how much time has passed. every time i visit her she thinks it's the first day she's been there, and she's been there for well over a year. i feel like i've given up something. i'm not in charge of her care anymore, really, and i don't talk to her every day.i know that she is leaving me, and my belief in the afterlife gives me comfort and i am not totally stressed about that. i wonder why i don't think of her as often.

Looking for advice on how to leave my grandma without hurting her
my family is visiting my grandmother who’s at a relatively severe stage of dementia. it’s in a different country than we live in, and her primary caretaker is her husband who is approaching 90 years old. they refuse to seek any outside help, which might partly be a cultural thing. anyways my grandma is very very attached to me. she doesn’t really know who i am most of the time but she feels a sense of closeness and always looks for me around the house. whenever someone reminds me that i’m the little kid she always talks about, she asks why they didn’t tell her before. she’s at a point where our conversations are just about 5 of the same repeated questions over and over again, and there is no lasting short term memory. she even has photos of me covering her entire bedroom but when i’m sitting there with her, she points them out to me and tells me about the little girl in the pictures. sometimes she thinks i’m a boy too. that being said, my sister was here before i was and had to leave early. when my sister left, my grandma took it very hard. she didn’t understand why no one told her she was leaving because she forgot every few minutes, and then after she left she cried for hours but couldn’t really remember why until someone reminded her. i’ve suggested not asking her to remember things or reminding her of specific events but i don’t know if that’s a good idea either. we aren’t really familiar with what to do in this scenario because the culture in this country is a bit against admitting the need for help and my grandparents are very old fashioned and strong headed. i’m going to be leaving in a couple days. she’s been asking everyday when i’m leaving and is shocked that it’s coming so soon, to the point where she does cry or get so upset she can’t eat. my mother and i are relatively positive that this will be the last time we see her alive, because her condition has deteriorated so quickly and she has days where it seems like she’s pretty close to the end. she has a rocky relationship with my mom and pretty often accuses her of really really weird things and thinks she is here as a spy or a kidnapper, which is really hard on my mom too. on the other hand, she is completely obsessed with me but kinda doesn’t really know who i am at the same time, if that makes any sense at all. long story short, i really really need advice. i’m scared of leaving and making my grandma feel terrible and then not remember why she’s feeling that way. i don’t want to put this burden exclusively on my grandfather, who is very very clearly worn out as it is. when i’m out of the house doing other things for a couple hours, my grandma notices that there’s an empty space and asks when i’m going to be back (sort of) but when my sister left, she completely forgot about it a day later. i do feel as though my grandmother is more deeply attached to me though, honestly speaking. how do i leave to go home without putting anyone through any pain and suffering? i’ve been here for a couple weeks already but she has no memory of it. i don’t want her to feel a sense of loss without understanding why, but i’m scared it’s inevitable. any suggestions or advice??

Dad worsening, work suffering.
my dad has been getting worse, fast.  i see him every other week, and every time it's like a kick in the teeth. it's getting to the point where its impacting my job, i can't focus on work for like a week and a half after i see him - so i have about 3 good days where i'm getting stuff done.  my boss has been understanding, and i've been honest about it, but still, this is not a good trend.  i've started taking more time off to try and recover faster, in the hopes that it'll help.  this gets honest and a little dark, if you're in a bad place might want to skip reading further.&amp;#x200b;saw dad last week, and am surprisingly okay today, but i still chose to take the day off anyways. glad i did, i realized that i'm feeling better than i usually would because he's doing worse, and - dark as it is - it felt like the end was in sight. it doesn't seem like an infinity of sadness anymore, i'm starting to see the end signs, where he's forgetting my mother and his home, starting to forget what things are. it isn't him anymore, more than ever before.  so depressing that that is what makes me feel better.  but really, instead of feeling like torture to watch my father disappear before my eyes, it was just a chore entertaining a stranger with a mental handicap wearing my dad's body.  &amp;#x200b;the only distressing part of it was when he started panicking because he was confused. he went to the bathroom and came out in a tizzy holding a few squares of toilet paper. he didn't know what they were or what to do with them, and couldn't be redirected; i spent about a half hour talking him down from his panic and reassuring him that everything is okay.  that was pretty horrible. mom says next time, there's a cabinet full of benzo's, i should just drug him so he'll calm down.   i'm pretty proud that i was able to bring him down from it, that he still trusts me enough that he let me - and afterward he thanked me for it - but i will probably just go for the drugs next time and let him sleep it off.  oh hey there's the tears about how awful it was.  i dunno why i've been kinda blank about it until just this moment. i don't know if that's more grief, or maybe i really am doing better.&amp;#x200b;i don't really have any questions, guess i'm just looking for solidarity. i know my partner thinks i'm taking this way too hard, more than i should. anybody else finding that dealing with a loved one with alzheimers is messing with your ability to life?

Holding vigil for my father
six months ago my father (age 76) was diagnosed with moderate-to-severe alzheimer's.  the guy was a brilliant man with a master's degree in biology, who spent a really successful career as a real estate agent for an oil company.  he gifted me with a great head for math and a love of science -- some of my best memories of him were when he showed me jupiter and saturn through his back yard telescope.that man literally gave me the universe, and he also gave me a sense of my own place in the working world.  important context, my biological parents divorced when i was two years old, and i was raised by my mother and stepfather.  the most significant time i spent with my bio father was a summer that i worked as an intern at his company in another state, and that's when i kind of sensed that i had a future in the corporate world.  and it's worked out exactly that way.  he worked 35 years in his company, surviving a spinoff and a buyout that had him moving states more than once, but by the end of his career he was literally the only person left from his original department from 35 years before.  i've always felt that was something to aspire to, and as of this writing i've made it through 17 years, 4 promotions, a merger and a reorganization at my own company, where i recently survived a layoff.  i credit my father for showing what that kind of work ethic looks like in the corporate world.so i knew something was off over the holidays last year when he started inventing memories that i knew never existed.  like for example, i mentioned that i'd been called for jury duty, and he started talking about his own jury duty experiences, in places i know he's never lived.  he's brought up celebrities from the 60s and 70s who he shared a beer with -- people like elvis, and the bee gees, and willie nelson -- all those stories are false but they are based on a true story he told me years ago, when he really *did* share a beer with harry belafonte.  so that was the beginning when i knew things were wrong.he got diagnosed and the whole family is adjusting to the new reality.  but this weekend there was an escalation.for the last three years, he and my stepmother have been the owners of a jack russell terrier.  one of the ways we've been trying to support him during the development of his condition is that we've allowed him to take the dog on walks.  most of the time he's "present" enough to stay within his neighborhood, but twice now he's gotten lost and wandered several miles away from home before being found and brought back.we've made arrangements to keep him tracked through geofencing on his phone, and for the most part that's worked.until saturday when he forgot to take his phone with him.  he ended up about 4 miles away from home, lost and confused, at which point the dog keeled over from heatstroke.the police found him, looking confused, not really sure where he was and not knowing how to deal with the situation.  he didn't have his id on him and he didn't remember his address, but he was present enough to direct the police back to his house.  they also took the dog in to the local humane society, but it wasn't enough.  the dog died.the dog's death is everybody's wake-up call.  he now needs more help than we can give him where he's at now.i don't know why i'm writing this, necessarily, except just looking for a support system of random reddit strangers.  i'm heartbroken at what the world is losing in this process, and i hope i can find a way to help make his transition better.

I need to get this of my chest
hello! i know this is a support group and usually people give advice about this disease and how to cope. i can't give advice today (we still don't know how to cope), but i want to share a new face of this disease. one i live with every day for some years now and i have not seen others talk about yet.&amp;#x200b;usually, when searching for any news or information on dementia or alzheimer's, i find health department sites or doctor's blogs or psychiatric doctor's blogs, or as on this site, regular people trying to spread positivism and support each other. the advice is valid for the incipient stages of dementia. for someone like my nana who is 9 years in, that advice is useless. currently she can no longer live by herself. in my country the nursing homes have a bad habit or drugging the patients  (to keep them calm and obedient) until they're vegetables drooling in a chair or their bed (plus they die quicker this way). because of this my family has decided to bring my grandmother in with us, and take care of her at home. &amp;#x200b;my nana has a weird case of dementia. she has no idea where she is (the fact that she's at our house) and she's convinced she's back at her old job, the one she had in her youth. she no longer recognizes us as her family, not in real life nor in photos. she has a vague concept of her estranged family and how they have "abandoned her", even if we see her daily (we live together).  these 2 symptoms are very common, however her reactions are not.&amp;#x200b;my nana is convinced that we are her interns (at her old job) so no matter what we tell her, that we're her family, we show her pictures of all of us with her from our youth to this past year, she will deliberately lie and fake a memory recovery. the moment the person she was talking to leaves the room for a moment and returns (in which time she forgets ever speaking with that person), she starts laughing and "spreads the latest office gossip": "did you hear that bitch how she was pretending to be my daughter and how she tortured me with pictures and the lies she tells about my so-called family, if i even have such a thing. she want to "get rid" of me...(is what my nana will say)&amp;#x200b;she has a big blank in her memory. at times she remembers that she has a family other times she thinks she's in her 30's, but **she recognizes and remembers my mother** as "the bad bitch" that always likes to pick on her. she recognize me by name and face as the poor unfortunate intern also being bullied by my mother. to escape my mother's "wrath" when she is taking care of my grandmother, like feeding her or bathing her- activities which my nana hates with every pore of her being, my grandma fakes ailment. she fake cries and screams and yells for the police, she has yelled rape and tried to fake sue my mother several times (it has become a sad dark inside joke, be careful what you do or i'll sue). she has tried to teach me to do the same. to manipulate the "bitch" and force her to leave us alone. even if, for the time being, she trusts me, she is trapped in this fake world she made up in her mind and any information that she finds ludicrous, like us being family, she accuses us of being insane. she refuses to bathe, to eat or to take medicine. if we give her a pill she screams "murder". after a bath comes a shower of cussing and damning and "suing" .&amp;#x200b;since she started living with us (not being able to take car of herself), she became more unhygienic, she spits, cusses like a storm, has become evil (she brakes things on purpose to spite us and is happy about her accomplishments- she thinks this is a form of karma) . taking care of her is a nightmare! &amp;#x200b;all the post, the sites everything i've seen online talk about "keeping their dignity" and try to convince them to give some sort or incentive to cooperate...i have not seen a single piece of advice on how not to have a brain stroke when finding my nana drawing flowers on the bathroom mirror with feces.  how to keep your head and your depression calm when on a daily basis your family member/parent (whome you love dearly) cusses you out and damns your entire family (in a very biblical way. dementia has not affected her creativity).you give them food and after chewing a couple of times they decide to spit it back on the plate or on the floor. how to avoid an ailment from all the toxic fumes you've ingested cleaning her room and the rest of the house from the times she decided not to go to the toilet and just do it there and cover it with a towel, no one will know.&amp;#x200b;i need some advice/help/support  with this window of dementia! how not to lose my mind while taking care of the person i love! i need anger management advice on how not to go crazy when she brakes things or takes in vain all i do for her. because she will continue spitting her food, behave in an unhygienic way (trying to not make it to graphic), all the while pulling my mothers hair and screaming because my mom happens to wash her. god forbid' we use soap on a daily basis! (why do dementia patients hate cleanliness?)when i see posts like "keep their dignity" it make my blood boil! i'll admit it works for people in the first 3-4 years of this disease i'm not a hypocrite, but my nana has no dignity left! she's the worse kind of spoiled brat that you can imagine (and i say this with love because we care about her a lot!) she's lost all contact with hygiene and she likes it that way, she enjoys manipulating and lying to us to get her agenda. she refuses to leave her room, she just wants to be left alone with her mess. i need to see some advice on dealing with advanced stages of dementia. and if there is none, i at least want to post this "lovely picture". because there are many faces of alzheimer's.&amp;#x200b;i love my grandmother very much, she's the person who was always there to help raise me. she has taken great care and provided very much love to us all, and seeing her in this destructive way is killing us all...very slowly. my mother has already started having fizical issues because of the stress and daily torture. and putting her in a home in not an option, it's also very expensive. &amp;#x200b;thank you for reading!i hope i shed a different light on this issue.

so a little bit of a background: my grandmother is 89 years old and unfortunately has this terrible disease. she was able to live by herself pretty normally up until about the last year. this past christmas, on christmas day to be exact, she passed out in her front doorway when a family member was picking her up for christmas lunch at our house, and cut her hand. my cousin, who is luckily a doctor, was also at our house so he checked her out after she arrived and fixed her cut up. on that day, my mother decided that it would be best if she just went ahead and moved in with us. we have had a bedroom prepared in our house for her to move in for well over a year at this point, but my grandmother had always been too stubborn to actually move in. my dad works full time. my mom is a stay at home mother—she has full time custody over my 5 year old nephew, so my parents are raising a small child that permanently lives at our house. the disease has made my once sweet grandmother very argumentative and somewhat mean. this has started to take a toll on the entire family, especially the 5 year old. he is now too afraid to sleep in his own room due to her wandering during the night. my mother gives my grandmother all of her medicine throughout the day and helps her to shower. my grandmother can still go to the bathroom on her own (as long as we use one of the toilet chairs that sits over the toilet) and she can still feed herself and even walk up and down steps. it has just gotten to the point where my parents feel like they are not equipped to be her sole caregivers. it is having an extremely negative effect on the 5 year old, and my mom is barely able to even leave the house to get in carline to pick him up from school. we simply cannot afford a nursing home. but we also cannot have her stay with us at our home for much longer. even when we just go along with what she says to try to avoid arguments, she gets aggravated anyways and walks around slamming doors. she forgets where she is at numerous times a day, and calls my nephew “that girl” and keeps asking where “her” parents are and why they are not here. it is just a terrible situation all around. my parents are curious as to if we could set up hospice for her at her own house. would she even qualify since she is not incontinent, can still walk and feed herself without choking, and can still speak (even though the main thing she says throughout the day is “i’m confused only because i’m out of my routine”)? would this be a good idea? we want to care for her but we just cannot do it anymore and it is not okay to put my nephew through something so traumatic every single day. pros? cons? i’ve read online that a patient with alzheimer’s being considered for hospice must have a life expectancy of 6 months or less. is this correct? if she gets denied for hospice care, what in the world can we do? sorry this post got so long. any advice would be greatly appreciated by my entire family.

Being lost without her second half while being apart for an extended time
about a year and a half ago my nani was diagnosed with mci and it is getting worse, especially since my grandpa is at the hospital due to an ulcer and the flu. she normally get confused, forgets names or what she has to do, and is incapable of doing a lot of things on her own. so, my grandpa, a doting husband to her for over 63 years, is an immense help to her to reassure and calm her down. now that he's recovering in the hospital, she has gotten even worse and my family, who has been taking turns staying over at their house and driving her to the hospital to visit, are becoming frustrated and on edge. yesterday evening and today i had her it feels like she gets worse as the day progresses. she almost attacked my uncle and his wife because she didn't like the was looking. i took her home and she was fine, but had a night scare where she wanted to know where her husband was. the morning was better, she woke up early and got dressed all by herself and i warmed up her food and made sure she took her medication. we played monopoly and listened to old music, she cried a bit about grandpa and i sometimes had to remind her which token she had (her forgetting where she's at in the game is common for me now whenever we play as of lately). all hit the fan when my other aunt came to help us run errands and visit grandpa. she could not remember her own daughter and kept asking who we were and where we're going for today. at the hospital, she started off fine talking to grandpa and we even started watching a movie. when we ordered food for grandpa, we asked if she wanted anything off the guest menu and she said she was good until they came with the food and she wondered why she did not get any jello. it was then that we took her for lunch in the cafeteria, but she was reluctant to go. on walk and elevator ride back to his hospital room, she would become very confused of where she was. back in the room, she would get bored easily and kept asking the doctors and nurses if he'd be released soon (like today or tomorrow) even though they told her that they still needed to run tests to make sure he was 100% ok before they let his leave. she also refused to wear her protective mask that was required for his room and would have it part way on claiming that it was too hot when she had it on fully. when i was relieved of my turn for the day, my sister and mother took her on and said she was even worse than she has been so far. she took a long time to get into her pjs and she was extremely irritated. then she thought that grandpa was having an affair with the day nurse because she was helping him and checking his vitals, which was a step up from her thinking that he passed way in the hospital from the two nights prior. she's asleep right now, but i've been checking up on my sister to see how she's doing in case she wakes up; neither of us can sleep even though we are exhausted.her memory has been getting so bad and her mood flips faster than i've ever seen, that it is putting a lot of stress on an already stressful situation. my family, my uncle,and aunt spend more time with them than my other aunt, so she hadn't experienced how she acts on a day-to-day basis. i'm spending more time worrying about her at home and what she might do to herself or others than my grandpa in the hospital. they never leave each others sides and my nani has always been the relying on him for everything, so i can't imagine what she is going through right now. but, i just needed to vent after the events that transpired over the past few days and thank you for listening to me ramble.

How the heck can I help?
oh boy. a little background: my mother-in-law has early-onset and is well into the moderate stage. she lives with my father-in-law, doesn't drive, and they seem to be getting by. i know my fil is frustrated a lot of the time and has expressed that he is struggling emotionally, but he refuses to seek any help whatsoever. they do own a house in a senior community, and i believe he's spoken with the folks there but i'm not sure what about. there are two problems: first and foremost, he's honestly kinda mean to my mil. he's not abusive, but he does things like... if she repeats a question, he will answer it **and** tell her that he had just told her the answer 10 minutes ago. she always likes to carry an umbrella with her, even if it isn't raining (but let's be real - i live in the pacific northwest, it could rain any time) but he won't let her have one anymore because she's forgotten two at a sporting event. and he lets her know why he won't let her have the umbrella every time. then she gets frustrated with him and yells at him, and he turns around and vents to my husband and brothers-in-law.second, his only coping mechanism is to "vent" to his sons via text message about "how bad she is" and how unhappy he is. my husband is struggling to cope with his mom's declining function, and i don't feel like this situation is helping. i am totally empathetic toward my fil, i couldn't begin to fathom what he is going through and i want to do everything that i can to help him. but every time we share links or information with him, it hits a brick wall. he won't even watch teepa! teepa is amazing! why won't he even try to make their lives better or easier? i'm in occupational therapy school, i have an idea of the services that are out there and i know how to help support them! but he refuses. what the heck is this? denial? this has been going on for 6 years! any help?

85 y/o dad w Alz doesn’t want to stay home but gets lost
he’s always done exactly what he wants to do, regardless of what anyone else thinks. was never able to sit still, always had to keep moving and that hasn’t changed. staying at home = “being in prison”. he’s in fantastic physical shape (walks 10k+ every day). he’s usually ok if he stays in the suburb where he lives, but sometimes ventures further out and gets lost. ends up taking buses around the larger city with no idea where he is (and sometimes where he’s going). he lives on his own. i can only see him once a week, and don’t always manage that.  (he’s ok with taking medications as long as i put them on the “nighttime” or “morning” shelf. he feeds himself, that’s ok. can bathe himself. all of which means he’s not eligible for a care home or assistance from the government.) we could arrange a ride in theory - except he forgets our instructions or decides he doesn’t want to wait. i mean he rarely communicates his plans anyway, he’s used to doing what he wants when he wants. so what happens is when he gets lost, i end up chasing him all over town based on very unclear information on his location. (he might not know cross streets or which bus he’s on.) i don’t drive by the way so this happens on transit or via uber. i have siblings in the area but they refuse to help. they think a) he’s just being a jerk or b) he’s fine because he’s always been fine (he’s not). even if i arranged things to live with him, i couldnt stay with him all day and i couldn’t lock him up. so what do you do?! we’re getting him a flip phone with gps, and a medic alert bracelet. beyond that, what can we do to keep him safe? (that ideally doesn’t involve me chasing him all over town on buses? he loves to get around on sundays especially when service is the worst.)

Looking for advice
i'm sorry if this isn't the appropriate place for this but i don't know what else to do.&amp;#x200b;my father is only 58 years old and has clear signs of dementia. his cognitive tests have him operating at around 1/6 of a normal adult. his next doctor appointment will be the one to tell us definitively (hopefully) of what kind of degenerative disease he has. he was always the smartest man i've ever known, and has been the best father anyone in the world could have asked for. this deterioration has happened so fast, and for the first couple years i played it off as if it was nothing. it has gotten to the point he can't work anymore (as of 4/5 months ago, he hid it from me) and now will tell me the same thing over and over in conversations. &amp;#x200b;my grandfather died of alzheimers, and we kept him on every med we could until he was just a skeleton laying in bed. he was a great man too, and i learned then not to correct forgetfulness but reassure that it's okay and just be there. i had a very hard time handling that, i was 19. i'm 30 now and i don't know how to reconcile this happening to both the male figures in my life. i try not to get snappy with my dad but it kills me so bad that he was the sharpest man i've ever known and i can't seem to accept that he's going like this. &amp;#x200b;my mother called me today and told me it was time to have the family conversation between my father, my brother, her and myself about what we want to do. whether we want to pursue the best and clearest diagnosis so we can medicate him accordingly and prolong his life the longest or if we stop putting him through these cognitive trials that clearly distress the fuck out of him and just be there for him.&amp;#x200b;i live in reno, nv. my parents are in northern nh near the canadian border, and my brother is just south of them. my dad was born in california and in his coherency talks about missing it. so i've planned to move them out to truckee ca and for myself to move up too and be there to help physically and financially. after my mother and i spoke today i called my brother to talk to him about the situation. because my fathers dementia has progressed so fast and nobody is prepared for this he (my brother) was a total mess on the phone. i'm the youngest in the family but i've always been the stone for everyone else. i told him that he has the rest of his life to cry about this, but right now he needs to be strong. and that i love him and i'll always be there for him. we got off the phone with him still in tears. &amp;#x200b;i'm flying back next week to sit down with my dad and talk about this. and i don't know how  to do this. i've never thought about my father dying until recently. but if these tests make him so uncomfortable and feel so bad, do i encourage him to keep going so he can be put on a medication regiment to make him waste away like my grandfather? or how do i let him know that it's okay for him to take no more tests? &amp;#x200b;i love him so much, this is absolutely killing me to write. i'm so emotionally drained from today i don't even know if this was coherent, and i'm sorry if it wasn't or i offended anybody here. i just need him to know that i'll be here for him forever, and i'll be with him through anything no matter what happens and that no matter what it's okay.&amp;#x200b;i'm not trying to say that him dying is okay and i don't know how to make him know i'll be with him for ever no matter what happens. &amp;#x200b;i don't want my dad to die and it's fucking killing me.

Asking for help how to treat a neighbor of mine.
so there is this rude old woman who has serious alzheimer´s and lives a few houses next to me. just for clarification, we have a front yard which is also secured with a pretty old door, but not very safe. she once came to us, asking for help because her tv was broken. when me and my dad, who is an electrical engineer wanted to help her, we came home to her house and checked the tv out. it was almost brand new and nothing was wrong with it. she couldn´t even tell us what was wrong with it and apparently a few children were playing around with it. from neighbors we heard that there were some children at her house, deckades ago. here comes the weird part. she came to our house after that incident too. for half a dozen times, telling us the same thing over and over again. at that point it became a bit annoying and she broke into our property too, manipulating the front door which she knew how to do. we told her family members who are well aware what the problem is but they can´t send her to a facility because she does not approve of it. &amp;#x200b;recently, there was another incident when she came to my dad and told him to wire some money over to the chimney sweeper who had done some stuff for her. we told her family members to do that for her. during that incident, she also was on our property and forgot her cane. my dad later brought her the cane and handed it to her. she now already came back three times, telling my dad that that was her father´s cane and we still have her cane, that she left here, which is not true. she also appears to be increasingly aggressive and therefore dangerous. &amp;#x200b;earlier we had also found out, that there were incidents with our neighbors too, where she claimed that they stole her jewelery, which she probably stashed somewhere she can´t find it. we are very concerned, because one other guy, who my father knows was jailed because he was not intelligent enough to harrass a police officer who was searching his house. some lady with alzheimer´s had told the police that there were drugs in his house.&amp;#x200b;it seems that this situation of us is getting out of hand, do you have any tips for me and my family how to handle this, we actually dont want her to contact us ever again, but she always forgets it.

I was a young caregiver.
i know this is long, but i felt compelled to write about my experience. i grew up surrounded by alzheimers. my grandfather, grandmother and aunt all had it and died from it by the time i was 15. shortly after they died, my mother was diagnosed with early onset alzheimers. i was 16. she was 48, but had been exhibiting symptoms for many years earlier. she declined rapidly, but since she was so young she remained relatively healthy otherwise and lived for another 5 years after her diagnosis. my father worked anywhere between 80-100 hours in a week, so my sister and i became the primary caregivers for our mother, taking turns going to school. it was absolute torture watching her decline and we had no help from any adults. we didn’t know what we were doing. we were living in the u.s. at the time (my mother was dual canadian (french) and american my father norwegian), and there was no help from the government. my mother was too young to apply for medicare or receive social security benefits, and did not validate for help from hospice because patients must be imminently dying. care homes were too expensive and we had no family near us, so my sister and i were truly alone. it was too complicated to move back to canada or norway for other reasons. our roles switched, we becoming like parents and her becoming like a child. it was like watching her die a little bit every day, but there was no closure because we watched her forget us, become confused, suffer, lose weight, look like death all while living. i started wishing she would die, so i could mourn her. it’s been 5 years since she passed, but i can still see the skin of her face pushed up against her bones, the look in her eyes as she would stutter, the stiffness of her limbs as she would shuffle her feet endlessly around our kitchen. she would not sit down. just walk in circles all day and into the night even in the days before her death. we would have to sleep on the floor of her bedroom through the night to make sure she wouldn’t walk off somewhere and hurt herself. i don’t think i slept for those 5 years we were taking care of her. i still have a hard time sleeping. giving her showers were always awful. i can’t stand the smell of bleach any longer because she would often end up pooping everywhere in the shower and we would have to clean the tile with it after we had rinsed her of it. she fell one time while i made her breakfast, and i can still hear the crack of her skull on the hardwood floor and the confusion in her eyes from the shock of it. everytime we would go to hospital or email her doctors they would tell is there was nothing they could do for us. we had emailed her primary doctor and she told us ‘what do you want me to do? she’s terminal anyway.’ the lack of care on her part was horrendous. she had written my mother off completely, which i can understand to an extent because she was terminal, but she could have at least helped her to die in dignity. we tried our best. we always put her in clean diapers, fed her what she would eat, brushed her hair, kept her warm, cleaned her, did what we could, but we were not doctors. three days before she passed we had noticed she had stopped pooping or eating. we took her to hospital and she weighed 30 kg (roughly 65 lbs). they gave her fluids and helped to remove the poop from her bowels. she looked so much more comfortable afterwards. as we were leaving, i helped her into the car and she looked me in the eye more coherently than she had in years and told me ‘thank you’. i think about that sometimes, that perhaps if we were able to have given her better care she would not have declined so horribly. i knew when it was her time. i watched my grandparents and my cousin take their last breaths as well, so it was familiar to me. i thought i was ready for her to pass away, but i wasn’t. it’s odd how you’re alive until your dead even if the person is not wholly there. it’s like life no matter how feeble gives hope and there’s a finality that hits so strongly when death finally comes. i don’t remember my mother before she was sick. i can only see her in death or when she was sick. the desperation and confusion in her eyes haunt me. sometimes i wonder if she was in there understanding everything, but not able to communicate. i try not to think on it. after she passed there was an emptiness and a freedom i was not ready for. i had experienced something many adults, especially my age, had not and there was no one to talk to. i had no friends and could not relate to people. my sister and i had been completely isolated other than classes and each other, and we went straight to and then home. at my mother’s funeral, her siblings and their spouses were all together for the first time in years. they wanted a picture together. it hurt because my mother was not there and then they did not invite my father to be in the picture. i started crying and my cousin asked me why i was. he couldn’t even understand that it might be because we were at my mother’s funeral. he said that she had been sick for a while and that it was expected. i still can’t make sense of that. i left the morning after her funeral til norway. i went alone. i was supposed to reconnect with family while there, but instead i went off on my own, finished university, and kept to myself. when i started working my coworkers would make fun of me calling me grandma because i was so out of touch with everything. it hurt every time because i wanted to go out and drink, make friends, have meaningful relationships, try out this thing called ‘sex’, and just live the life of a young 20-something, but i couldn’t relate to anyone and i had way too many things going on in my head. it took 3 years, but i eventually did come out of my shell. i began to confront it instead of trying to pretend none of it happened. i joined an orchestra and made friends, even found a boyfriend, who i love very much and is very supportive. it’s odd to think of myself even 2 years ago and see how far i’ve come in healing. i’m proud of myself. i still have never met anyone who has experienced what i have other than my sister. i don’t like to talk about it often because even though i have close caring relationships with people now it’s hard for them to understand, and it hurts to see them not be able to. i don’t blame them for that. it’s not their fault. i just can’t make sense of what happened. it feels like a completely different life. like a nightmare. it’s not as bad as it was. grief doesn’t grip me every day, but every once in a while an expression on someone’s face, a sound or smell will suck me right back into it, and i’m right back to taking care of my mother again. i just wish i could remember her before.

Worried my grandma is showing symptoms of Alzheimer’s
hey all,sorry in advance this post is going to be rather long. honestly i just want to know whether her behaviours are a cause for concern and if there’s anything i can do to help her (obviously besides a visit to the doctor which we are planning to do it’s just tricky as my mum works full time and i don’t own a car) my grandma lives with me and my mum and recently i’ve noticed she’s deteriorated a lot. she’s been on a downward spiral ever since she moved in with us (around 2 years ago now) before she came here she lived in a flat alone and would cook for herself and was pretty independent for her age, she wouldn’t leave the house alone due to arthritis but other than that she was doing well. but as soon as she moved in here she became very dependant on us, during the week while my mum works i stay at home to bring her food and drink and make sure she’s okay, she has a carer that will come and help her wash and dress but other than that me and my mum are the ones who care for her the majority of the time. recently i’ve noticed her memory has gotten worse, she has a chair with a remote that operates a leg rest and helps her to stand up. it started off with small things like a couple times she mistook it for her tv remote and would try and use it to operate her tv, but now she forgets her chair even has a leg rest and when she does she can’t figure out what button to press despite it having pictures for each function. she has poor circulation and bad arthritis and finds elevating her legs eases the pain so recently when ive gone to check on her more often than not her legs are down and she’s in a lot of discomfort and i have to remind her that she can elevate her legs. she’s also been saying a lot of things that don’t make much sense. a most recent example was that i came home from being out and she called me over and told me that i had a missed phone call. i had my mobile with me and had no missed calls but she said it was on her phone, which makes no sense as i’ve never given out her number or associated it with my name. i asked who it was and she said the hairdresser (which again makes no sense as our hairdresser doesn’t have her number) so i asked if it was our regular hairdresser and she said no it was someone else (we only have one hairdresser and she works alone) so unless she misheard the caller or something i’m not sure where that came from. i’ve also noticed she will get confused mid-sentence and start talking about something else which makes our conversations tricky. i always try to humour her and not point it out as she gets very depressed when she realises she’s forgotten something or isn’t making sense. my last concern is she’s forgetting names of family members, the other day she couldn’t recall the name of my uncle (her son)’s wife who he’s been married to for over 30 years. she’s expressed fear in the past that she’s losing her memory and i’ve always tried to reassure her and at that time it was only minor things but now i’m very concerned because these changes have occurred very suddenly and seem to be getting worse. me and my mum have talked about it and we agree she needs to see a doctor and we are trying to formulate a plan to get her there as she doesn’t like to leave the house and has missed her passed few appointments and other planned outings because of this. (i suspect she could be agoraphobic)i just wondered if there’s anything i can do to help her with her memory? i’m thinking of making her a sort of cheat sheet for when she’s forgotten how to use her chair and tv remote for when i’m not around to help. she’s also going away for a week to visit some other relatives which always does her good but she forgot about it until we reminded her this evening and she’s gotten in a state because she doesn’t want to go (she always enjoys herself when she’s there and it’s both good for her and us if i’m honest) so i wondered if there was anything i could prepare while she’s away? obviously our main focus is getting her to the doctors asap but i just wanted some advice on what i might be able to do for her in the meantime? thank you in advance

(i suspect she could be agoraphobic)i just wondered if there’s anything i can do to help her with her memory? i’m thinking of making her a sort of cheat sheet for when she’s forgotten how to use her chair and tv remote for when i’m not around to help. she’s also going away for a week to visit some other relatives which always does her good but she forgot about it until we reminded her this evening and she’s gotten in a state because she doesn’t want to go (she always enjoys herself when she’s there and it’s both good for her and us if i’m honest) so i wondered if there was anything i could prepare while she’s away? obviously our main focus is getting her to the doctors asap but i just wanted some advice on what i might be able to do for her in the meantime? thank you in advance

Worried about my mom
i posted about her previously. it can be found here: to give an update since i posted that she had been doing really well! my anxiety had gone away and everything until last week. her work sent her home because they want her to have a medical evaluation.  we were all completely blindsided by this because back in january my sister talked to my moms boss who said she was doing better and that he was refreshing her in different departments. my moms co-worker had even told my sister one day at lunch that my mom was doing so good and back to herself. even though she still struggles with the headaches, anxiety, stress, depression, and pain from both fibromyalgia and injuries from an automobile accident that she was in back in the 80s. anyways we got her into the doctor right away. her doctor works in the same hospital my mom worked at so of course my mom was an absolute wreck anxiety, stress, depression wise. her doctor did the mmse test on her and she got a 23/30. last year it was 26/30 that she got. the thing is when she has anxiety really bad she does get very forgetful. the next day she went to her neurologist and my sister is less than thrilled with him. he did the mmse score and my mom was doing good at first but then she looked at my sister and the dr kicked my sister out of the room bc he thought my sister was going to help her but she wasn’t my mom just looked at her. so that puts my moms anxiety through the roof and she didn’t do so good. doctor said he could tell the stress and anxiety was getting to her. he upped her depakote said that would help with memory and headaches then said he’d see her back in two months. my sister was pissed off so she got a different referral. i’ve been a wreck but my sister said she she thinks the anxiety and all the pain my mom is in plus being depressed is what effects her memory. she thinks the fibro plays a big part in it. i think my mom is pretty much going to go into retirement. she is 58 years old. as for her memory loss it’s more short term than anything else. she’s had no personality changes, behavioral changes, getting lost, anything like that. i guess she asked for help on something at work and the 2nd command went to hr. i just feel so bad for my mom. she down about her job.we keep telling her she’s better off that she can enjoy her grandkids and stuff. i’m going to have a niece in august. she had bad anxiety on friday that caused her to forget she talked to my aunt.  when she’s relaxed she different. yeah she sometimes asks the same thing over. the thing is if she study’s it she remembers it. she told me everything her hit her and said she had a bad day. like i said the anxiety really does effect her to the point she has trouble getting out we got her into a neurologist do that appt is on april 1. do you guys have any insight on this i’m just making myself sick over it and i feel bad bc then my mom worries about me?

I’m afraid it’s coming and fast
so we’ve had concerns in my family about my now 67 year old mother for a long time. she moved to the countryside with my father in law few years ago and he passed from cancer suddenly since, which leaves my mother completely alone in a big house in the countryside. for a while, we’ve been worried about her ability to fall for scans easily, overspending, mistakes and little things forgotten, but it took a turn for the worst. she has had a first doctor appointment and they established she had a degenerative disease. she will have the results of the bigger tests they did for alzheimer on jan 15th. i live abroad so i saw her in june last. she is now a totally different person. she who was doing crosswords and sudoku almost compulsively has now stopped doing those. she is very quiet, looks for her words very often, she forgets things and i have to repeat them to her many times. i was with her in the city and she gave me the paper to pick our christmas logs from the bakery while she was at the hairdresser and asked me to pick her after an hour but she was there only for 30 min, apparently left the hairdresser without informing me, tried to pick the logs on her own without the paper, then erred in the street looking for me. she looks constantly anxious and like a deer in headlights. this is heartbreaking, and i’ll leave again soon... i don’t know what to do nor what to hope for. she was so strong, so smart, so active, a rock for me. now i fear this is the last christmas we’ll spend in this house. things seem to worsen so fast i don’t know what to do. her fear has always been to have alzheimer. this seems so unfair. i don’t know how to react, what to expect or what would be the best course of action. soon we’ll have the results of course. but i’m so scared and devastated. that’s it. i just wanted to share my feelings as i’m at loss. thanks for listening.

Worried about my mom (signs?)
&amp;#x200b;65 years old&amp;#x200b;she didn't know how to spell a word in scrabble, i forget which one. but it was on the easy side. \*\* weird&amp;#x200b;mixing names with a piano teacher and another music teacher. \*\* weird (only did this once)&amp;#x200b;she tells stories/events over. not in the same day though. she says it has to do with telling her friends too, and forgetting who she told what to. maybe two weeks later kinda thing. this does not happen all the time.&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;once forgot wallet/sunglasses at a grocery store. the lady at the till had to remind her. (only happened twice)&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;forgot sunglasses at walmart, found they were missing. (was putting on new sunglasses, placed the ones she has on a shelf) realized they were lost, went back to where they were, they were stolen.&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;mispronunciation word, saying it with a question mark. mausoleum. "mausoleeni?" \*\* weird&amp;#x200b;marriage certificate nowhere to be found. ((claims she accidentally threw it out))&amp;#x200b;how do you spell "they" is it "thy?" (then she laughed at herself and figured it out) \*\* weird&amp;#x200b;is "gotten" a word? ((genuinely wondering. like honestly, is it an actual correct word?))i believe we were playing scrabble))&amp;#x200b;didn't know where dairy queen was, but then figured it out. (she was thinking of a different restaurant)&amp;#x200b;handed her her purse and she grabbed it from outside. less than 15 minutes later, she asked where her purse was... ((she was busy with gardening)) i told her i gave it to her. &amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;with computer, touched screen like it was an ipad, kept doing that. pressing the "next" button on the screen, instead of clicking with mouse. ((she is constantly texting in her phone, or using the laptop, and zooming into the picture by zooming in with the finger pad))&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;forgotten beer, but remembered, and drove back to get it.&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;misspelled grocery as in, "grocerery" ((realized she misspelled it, but didn't want to cross it out))&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;misspelled, "adjustment - ajustment" (claims she had always spelled it this way)&amp;#x200b;misspelled vinegar -"vinigar" (but i found spelling mistakes back in 2015. bowl was spelled bowel, and she claims she always spelled adjustment, "ajustment" she always mixed the two spellings up))&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;picked me up at airport, but thought it was a friday or saturday. ((because of an 8 hour time difference. she claims we were both trying to decide the time... though she obviously picked me up.))&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;forgot that she already told me before my vacation about how she previously shown me the paint job she did on the house. ((after i told her, she remembered she told me))&amp;#x200b;told her the possibility of visiting norway. week later, she thought i said i was going to finland... ((she blamed it on the fact of how grandma dot's family was from finland))&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;we were on our way to trosachs, she missed the turn off... we were all talking.&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;nov. thought friday was saturday on friday. she didn't sleep well at all, and couldn't think if the restaurant beside the co-op gas station -- pumpjacks. then on saturday, she thought it was friday. unsure if she was tired or not. claims she wasn't.&amp;#x200b;wear her heart on her .... "arm" (instead of sleeve)&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;dec. she was flustered, dirt had fallen everywhere from a plant, she was upset, and called the dust pan, "grab the shovel" -- later on remembering the word for dustpan.&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;lost the grocery list even before going grocery shopping. unsure of where she put it. but she remembered everything (supposedly) except for sandwich bags.&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;recycling bin... i think she might have put it out two days or s day out earlier. unsure if she thought it was thursday or not. the things is the schedule here specially for december, has changed. &amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;i had to remind her i was working on saturday. (she claims she straight away remembered) and said, "oh shit..." angrily. because of the fact, that my shift starts at 4:30 in the morning, and ends, 11:00am that day.&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;sorry for the long post. should i be worried?&amp;#x200b;thank you.

((because of an 8 hour time difference. she claims we were both trying to decide the time... though she obviously picked me up.))&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;forgot that she already told me before my vacation about how she previously shown me the paint job she did on the house. ((after i told her, she remembered she told me))&amp;#x200b;told her the possibility of visiting norway. week later, she thought i said i was going to finland... ((she blamed it on the fact of how grandma dot's family was from finland))&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;we were on our way to trosachs, she missed the turn off... we were all talking.&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;nov. thought friday was saturday on friday. she didn't sleep well at all, and couldn't think if the restaurant beside the co-op gas station -- pumpjacks. then on saturday, she thought it was friday. unsure if she was tired or not. claims she wasn't.&amp;#x200b;wear her heart on her .... "arm" (instead of sleeve)&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;dec. she was flustered, dirt had fallen everywhere from a plant, she was upset, and called the dust pan, "grab the shovel" -- later on remembering the word for dustpan.&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;lost the grocery list even before going grocery shopping. unsure of where she put it. but she remembered everything (supposedly) except for sandwich bags.&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;recycling bin... i think she might have put it out two days or s day out earlier. unsure if she thought it was thursday or not. the things is the schedule here specially for december, has changed. &amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;i had to remind her i was working on saturday. (she claims she straight away remembered) and said, "oh shit..." angrily. because of the fact, that my shift starts at 4:30 in the morning, and ends, 11:00am that day.&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;sorry for the long post. should i be worried?&amp;#x200b;thank you.

So, how awesome is it being a caretaker...
i've been perusing this sub for awhile but i don't ever see what i came for, namely sons or daughters who've had a fuckin pin put in their awesome lives so they can just wither and die in their thirties along with their mom.  i tried to swallow a bottle of alprazolam last night and my husband choked them out of me (guess choked me out would be the correct nomenclature) and then punched me in the eye.  that was new.  so now i guess i have to pretend to be the chick that walks into walls if i decide to leave the house.  probably won't.i'm an only child and my mom had me in her forties.  she was extraordinary.  her life was a goddamn dream.  grew up in a house that's now a museum.  the stables are now a restaurant for some reason.  swiss boarding school, dalliances with current world leaders, summers on onassis' private island and a 65' schooner as a wedding present.  mom also had a gift for leadership.  she owned the best restaurant  in a state renowned for  its food.  i never once saw her get frustrated with any of her employees and she never that i remember, was frustrated with me or said anything to make me feel bad about myself.  this is why it hurts so much.  i look around and all i see are pictures of my parents smoking joints with famous people of the 70's like fucking rockstars or on their giant ass boat with the tie-dyed sails or riding around drunk on my grandfather's racehorses on his damn plantation and i can't help but note that my life is over.  i don't need to have that extreme, however, my husband and i used to really enjoy our life.  we're not rich like my parents but we didn't care.  we had an awesome bohemian lifestyle and these pictures are mocking me.  my sweet, lovely mom has become someone i don't recognize.  the person that allowed me to do primal scream therapy (self diagnosed ) on boring car trips now hurls terrible expletives at our three year old when she makes any noise.  when i try to bathe her she is frightened to the point of violence.  this beautiful debutante who went to finishing school walks around the house dropping turds out of her pajama pants as a daily occurrence.  my dad refuses to believe this is happening and i just weep, like daily so my husband  picks them up.  he also gets her out of the tub when i manage to convince her to get in.  my dad is also losing it.  i've been taking him to a spate of neurological appointments lately.  he's convinced it's "alzheimer's by osmosis."  ok dad.  he's as depressed as i am but he would never admit it.  is someone that you once loved, worshipped, adored still the same person when they daily insult you, yell at your baby who you named after her but yet she's never said her name, leave pieces of shit wiped toilet paper on the kitchen counter multiple times a day, just be terribly rude to absolutely everyone 80 percent of the time?

My Mom's Memory Issues?
hi everyone, this may be a long post but i'm curious your take on my mom. so i'm 34 years old and my mom is 58. she was in a car accident a few years before i was born which caused her to have several broken bones. years after i was born she was put on pain medication by her previous primary care doctor to help with the pain from the accident. they had her on hydrocodone(i think it was that) and a fetanyl patch. my moms suffers from anxiety and depression. she has lost several family in the past 11 years. first her mother in 2007, then her father in law(my grandfather), then her husband(my dad), then she lost her own father in 2016, and her grandmother in 2017. in feb 2016 the months before her dad passed away she was taken off everything by her current primary care doctor because the fetanyl overdosed her accidentally. we were glad she was taken off this stuff because we noticed it made her out of it and have memory issues. i mean we all know pain medicine can cause memory issues. my mom was also diagnosed with two auto immunte disorders - fibromyalgia and scerloderma. my aunt i think my mom was on the pain medicine including the patch for 10+ years before her current primary doctor(she wasn't the one who put my mom on it btw) took her off it. anyways she still has short term memory issues.  my sister, aunts, and i were concerned about alzheimers but she her primary care doctor, neurologist, and even my therapist who my mom also goes to doesn't think these memory issues line up with that. my mom is a medical technologist in the local hospital. she still goes to work every day, never has any issues finding her way or getting lost that sort of thing. the memory issues are more of like her forgetting appointments, or she'll ask the same thing over again(i think she does this to retain the info), or like repeating herself, sometimes confusion. the primary care dr and neurologist seem to think its medication related. my mom also gets really bad headaches and the neuro put her on a new medication (depakote) to help with that which she says they have gotten better. she was on lyrica and tramadol this past year because in the past two years her left shoulder has given her issues. she's gone through two rotaor cuffs sugery's that have failed and now can't get at replacement until she turns 60. so like i said she is in a lot of pain. my sister thinks she's doing better and reminds me that now that sh'es not on any pain medication that it will take time to see changes and also that shes in a lot of pain which can interfere with concentration.&amp;#x200b;i have had so much anxiety about this.  i just want to know what you guys think? i've been reading posts on here reading others stories and it doesn't seem like those who had early on-set are the same of what my mom is going through. any insight would be helpful. my mom and i saw the therapist yesterday. therapist told me my mom seemed reserved like she didn't want to talk much because she was afraid she'd say something wrong and then worry the therapist. my mom said she was right about that. i want to be positive for her you know? but i'm just worried.

Help with decisions regarding my Grandmother
she is 81 and is early stages of alzheimer’s, but it’s progressing and now i’m worried. my mom passed last year and was the one who took care of things, so it’s now me and my aunt.  we’re both unsure how to handle things.  my aunt was made power of attorney, and i have power of her finances and am added to her accounts.  anyway, her short term memory is completely shot.  she lives alone.  and, she’s been selling her land to relatives at a discount because she doesn’t think we’lol want to deal with it.  my aunt and i are the beneficiaries and worried these relatives are taking advantage.  she has just told me she’s trying to seek her remaining land and house now.  she has 100 or so acres and has told a relative she’d sell it to him for $5 or $10.  this is where i grew up and hoped to keep the land and not ever sell it.  even if i convince her to not do it, she forgets and tells me 10 minutes later she’s selling it to the relative.  we’ve told the relative to not buy it, at least not for that amount when it’s worth so much more (more like $4k per acre). my aunt is asking me what we should do.  what do we do to take these decisions out of her hands and make her beneficiaries the decision-makers?  and, do i need to think about where she should live soon?  this has all been too much, and i tend to just pretend it’s not really happening.  i wish my mom was still around.  she’s been giving lots of money to people, too...church, police officer organization, schools, etc.  so i feel like it’s time to get some control over this.  i think i’m afraid to upset her.

[Update] Anger and Confusion
i decided that it would probably be a good idea to update my experiences since my last post [here](i'll try to keep this one relatively short compared to my last post, but i wanted to address somethings that you guys have suggested and ask a few more questions.first of all, his psychiatrist had prescribed him small dosages of an anti psychotic to administer to him 4 times throughout the day. we realized this was too small at first because it was not working at all. the psychiatrist then upped the dosage and said to give him two full pills twice a day. this had minimal effect. three days ago my dad had the worst aggressive/confusion episode yet, which lasted a little over an hour. my mom was home during this and had filmed some of it (we don't want any abuse allegations when they want to know why his face has bruises), but for the most part she attempted to help me control him. it did not work. i tried taking some of the advice of talking to him calmly, and we administered some ativan at the start of his episode, but it had no effect until we gave him a second one about 50 minutes into the episode. during this episode he was crying, hitting himself, getting in our faces and screaming at us, hitting his head on the fireplace and the doors, banging on the windows screaming for help, etc. i'm sure some of you have been through this before, so i won't get into too much detail. towards the end of his episode, he started screaming and asking us who we were, which i took as a very bad sign and i think it confirmed my suspicions that it was not a uti (he gets tested for one later, i'll get into that). while he was anxiously walking around looking for things to hit his head on, he tripped over a small box on the ground and fell on his side. while he fell he was crying and just muttering "ow, ow". it broke my heart. my poor younger brother later saw the video and also couldn't stand it. that whole event was too much, too sad, too painful to watch or even think about. that he could be in even more pain than he already was. that he just wanted to feel safe and secure, but i had no way to give that to him.my mom and i resolved to get him committed to a geriatric psych ward the next day. after taking him to the hospital and going through the routine tests, he went through a small episode in which a cop had to come in and restrain him to administer another anti psychotic. we then waited in the er for roughly 10 hours for them to get a bed ready, filled out the paper work and for the first time in awhile, were able to leave without having to worry about how he was going to be at home the next day. also they did a uti check, ct scan of his head (to make sure he didn't injure his head i guess), and some blood tests, all came back as healthy.the next day, my mom and i were pretty much on speaker phone talking to neurologists, nurses, doctors, social workers, etc. for a good while. they confirmed that this aggression is likely due to the disease and had asked if we thought about having him placed in a nursing home.we've wanted to put him in a home for some time now, but the spend down system really, really terrifies my mom. she says we will not have enough money for the mortgage if we lose his checks every month. to make matters worse, one of the social workers who has experience with spend down told her that they only examine money coming in and will look at both incomes, meaning that my mom's income may also be limited if we go through with this. her sister told her to forget it, but i told her she needs to talk to our attorney (which the caregiver said was one of the best elder law attorneys in the area) i told her i can't keep "living" like this and basically begged her to talk to the attorney, but i have a bad feeling she won't. i have no idea how a modern society like the us, can have no social safety nets for people dealing with this. if we spend down and limit our income we can't afford our mortgage. if we don't spend down, i can't even get a job to help my mom pay for it anyway. this is all at the state level too, which apparently, according to the social worker, means that we cannot fight this in a court.

my mother (let's call her bonnie tifftaff) died of alzheimer's almost seven months ago.   yesterday, i was digging through mom's car and cleaning it out before selling it. i found an old notepad, with a page full of nonsensical scribblings that she had made when she was about stage 6. what follows are her writing: at the time she wrote these "notes," i remember i was talking with her about taking her to see her friend peggy.  she occasionally switched from print to cursive while writing this, so *italics* = cursive.  &gt;delaedlassas. for "for comportort!!!! she wansts for eachuurt by comentanyour.    &gt;  &gt;please weather come to our peggg to clear maxacleadararre.    &gt;  &gt;*bonnie tifftaff*     &gt;  &gt;bonnie tifftaff.   there are more notes on the same page, written in different ink. i guess that she brought this notepad into her car during one of her dementia episodes, in which she would imagine some infuriating or terrifying scenario involving my dad, prompting her to storm out of the house, climb into her car, and try to drive away; we hid her keys and removed the battery, so she would generally sit and cry in frustration for a few minutes, then forget what she was mad about and come back inside.   i suspect that while writing these notes, she was flashing back to when she worked as a shot nurse and would write down info about the companies she would be giving flu shots at, as some of the words sort of look like client names. much more switching from print to cursive in this note.  &gt;made: firsting driver &amp; platded the same drivevide withe day.    &gt;  &gt;barenen with *use* of todays work @ itiswanted to get to get work, is &amp; save thebnnie tifftefne.    &gt;  &gt;differen is difference to ~~b~~ *best before. may they they bay with these plurilaiveres. thank them. hop the plate is stell is still tolagary todaywaiz!*i'm almost to the point of being able to remember her vividly as she was, instead of what she turned into, so finding these notes was heartbreaking and dug up some bitter memories. but it also gave some insight as to how muddled her mind was; even when she managed to write something remotely recognizable, she appeared to change thoughts mid-sentence, and even mid-word. she couldn't formulate a clear thought, and what little thought was formed could not be held onto.

New information on Alzheimer's
my mom died of dementia.  unless an autopsy is done there's no way to determine whether the dementia was alzheimers or not but in any case, what causes dementia, alzheimers or not, is a build up of beta-amyloid protein deposits along with fibrous tangles, also of protein, which inhibit neuron communication.  just out of the blue, in listening to a video related to another subject, mention was made by stamets of the ability of lion's mane mushroom  to dissolve the plaques and restore normal brain function.  what?  looking into it further, i found there is a lot of information on the subject on the internet, much of it also by stamets and others involved with the studies.  naturally the ama and fda don't know anything about it so don't go trying to get your doctors to verify or confirm anything - they haven't a clue.  do your own research.  there's plenty of information from reliable sources.  make your own decisions based on whether the information makes sense to you, but dig into it.  it just might make all the difference in the world.  had i known any of this while my mom was going downhill you can bet i would have put her on these natural remedies.  as it was, i did the best i could to see that she spent her last year or two of dementia-related strokes in her own home, in her own bed, with her cats and familiar surroundings.  private nurses.  she was 85 so she had a full life but it's a bit depressing to now know i might have been able to turn the situation around.  before the strokes started, her behavior had been very dementia related relating to her financial and personal decisions.  if i had known any of this new information, i would not have hesitated to give it a try.  this is the video where i first came across the information but there are other videos devoted entirely to the subject and with more detail.  in this video it is only mentioned about two-thirds of the way through.  it's a starting point for you.  forget the "fda and ama approved" studies and medications, none of which get anyone anywhere.those who have the intelligence and willingness to consider new information, take note.  it just might turn an ordeal into a relatively happy ending.

Mom's memory is going... and I'm not sure Dad can handle it
my mother has always been a pretty assertive person -- i've seen her ask to speak to the manager at various stages throughout my life. for a long time, she ran her own company in new york city, but she is now retired upstate with my dad. both of them spent their entire lives in the city, and living upstate in the woods full time has been an adjustment. to make things even more difficult, my mother has suffered from depression for years, and was actually committed to a hospital for observation a few years back. her memory has been deteriorating for years and the electroshock treatments she received during her stay in the hospital may have made this worse. she is currently taking a good deal of medication to help with depression and increasing memory loss.her memory has been deteriorating for years, and my dad has been there for her all the way through. the doctors don’t think it’s alzheimer's or dementia, but the symptoms match -- she will repeat stories multiple times, sometimes within a few minutes  -- “did you hear about what happened to kevin?” over and over again. and when you mention that we already discussed something, she will sometimes apologize or laugh it off, but other times she can fly into a rage or feel sorry for herself, like “i guess i’m just an idiot then, huh??”unfortunately, things have gotten so bad that conversations have become difficult -- her short term memory seems nearly gone, and a conversation can go in 2-4 minute loops indefinitely. she can still take a shopping list, drive to the supermarket, buy all the groceries, and come home and cook dinner, but new memories don’t seem to stick, and because she doesn’t remember all the stuff she is forgetting, it’s not always so easy to convince her that her condition is getting worse, or that she can’t be in charge of planning a birthday party because she’s going to end up emailing people about their rsvps over and over and over again.i think it’s very frustrating and scary for her, but she sometimes handles it incredibly poorly. she’ll down two vodkas or smoke a joint, forget everything that happened that day, pick fights, yell at my dad, storm off, or worse -- my dad said she even got angry and basically took a swing at him. and when she knows she misbehaved, her regret is fleeting. even if she understands why her conduct hurt my feelings or my dad's, within a few minutes she'll be defending herself, demanding that we explain _exactly_ what she did, denying she did anything wrong, or accusing everyone of ganging up on her. i know this happens because she's frustrated, or because she’s not even sure what she did, but it’s really taking a toll on my dad. he’s in the woods, getting yelled at, trying to calm her down, being blamed for “lack of patience”, just because he blows up after being patient _all day_. at this point, i’m not sure my dad is capable of caring for her on his own. she is belligerent, constantly arguing with him, and honestly not that nice to him sometimes. he’s retired and they should be relaxing, but it feels like she needs more help than he can or should be responsible for. i don’t really know what to do. she seems too capable to be in assisted living or anything like that, but i also don’t really think having a caretaker there is going to help -- it’s just going to be another person witnessing her outbursts and rage. maybe she needs new doctors? or maybe there are better coping mechanisms for her and my dad? ultimately, i think acceptance on both of their parts will go a long way -- he needs to stop losing his patience with her and accept that she is different from how she used to be, and she needs to accept that we all love her, but that her condition means things have changed. it’s just hard to get her to accept anything when the conversation you just had is completely forgotten 4 minutes later. advice, or advice about where to post this kind of thing on reddit much appreciate. tia.

Grandma won't eat
for the last several months, my 82 year old grandma refuses to eat. she has lost so much weight her pants keep falling down her hips. every single day it's such a struggle to get her to eat anything i just feel like crying sometimes.at breakfast, we give her a muffin or some toast with jam. she eats maybe half and hides the rest. we keep finding bits of half eaten muffin and bread all over the place. at lunch she says she's not hungry, that she'd rather tear out her eyes than eat, and plays with her food and swirls it around her plate and then declares she doesn't want anymore when she didn't even take a bite. after much prodding, we get her to eat, except not really. she just chews and chews and chews and then spits it out and never actually eats anything. the rest she tries to sneak to the dog. at dinner we repeat the same routine. when we insist, she gets angry at yells at us to shut up and leave her alone and acts like us wanting her to eat is because we just want to find a reason to get mad at her.i am at my wit's end. we've taken her to the doctor, there's no physical reason for her loss of appetite. i've looked up psychological reasons, but that's not it either. she never eats alone. my grandpa and myself always eat with her. my sister often joins us as well. she always has company. we try all sorts of different foods. the easiest thing to get her to eat is sweets but even that she's starting to leave.what gets me the most is that, if we take her out to eat, she'll devour the food. it doesn't have to be anywhere fancy, just as long as she's out of the house. we take her to a diner, she'll eat and ask for seconds. we took her to my sister's boyfriend's house for christmas lunch, she wouldn't stop eating.the only thing i can think of is that she's bored of being in the house. sometimes she forgets it's her house, maybe that's why, but most of the time she's aware. the problem is we can't afford to be taking her out to eat for every single meal. we've tried picnics where we bring food from home, but it doesn't work. she acts bored and won't eat. maybe it's the cooking she doesn't like, but it's the type of food she always ate and used to enjoy, and we've tried all sorts of different foods. if we bring take out she won't eat it either.i've tried asking her if she doesn't like the food or if she's bored of being in the house. i can't get an answer. she gets mad at me and tells me to shut up and stop pestering her and that she just doesn't want to eat. it's not like she stays locked in the house all day, we do take her out, but as soon as she's back home, she forgets she was out... i just don't know what else to do. i feel like i'm being forced to watch her starve herself to death.

Any advice/kind words appreciated!
hi all, thanks for everything on this sub. been reading a lot of helpful stuff. so my mom has been losing her short term memory for a little over a year now. a few months back she started having episodes where her entire left side would feel numb, and she would lose some muscle control. a couple of er visits confirmed it was not a stroke, we tried to follow up with mri’s, but she can’t handle them at all. a visit to a neurologist resulted in the need for more tests, and the doc said he thinks it could be something neurodegenerative, but no solid diagnosis yet. he prescribed 5mg of haloperidol twice a day, which seems to have done wonders for the episodes she was having.two weeks ago, my father died unexpectedly. he felt sick for a couple of days, then collapsed on his way back home from the store just across the street from their house. i am completely devastated, and feel totally lost without him, just on a personal level- but he was also my mother’s caregiver, more than we realized until he was gone. it turns out he was keeping quiet about how bad her memory and understanding was getting. without him now, my brothers, sister and i are finding out how badly she needs care. her long term memory is fine, in fact she’s pulling out stories we’ve never heard before from 30, 40 years ago that check out. her short term is declining though- she doesn’t remember why she’s taking the haloperidol, doesn’t remember the trips to the er. she doesn’t remember what day of the week it is, and forgets entire recent conversations frequently.a major issue with getting her the care she needs is her immigration status- she’s not a legal resident. in fact, i just found out two months ago that she and my father were never actually married. the house is totally paid off, and her name is on the title, so there’s that- but it seems like she’s entitled to nothing else at all. my siblings and i are able to pool together money every month to keep the taxes, insurance and utilities paid, and maybe pay someone out of pocket for some time with her every day- we still haven’t done the real math, but the ballpark figures seem manageable. i guess what i am looking for here is any sort of advice or information- how would i even start to get help for my mom? we’re in ny. i’m not sure yet if it would be feasible for her to stay home, my sister and i are taking turns spending the night there with her and leaving for work in the morning. the first two days were rough, she took the wrong amount of medication the first day, so from now on we know she’s only to take pills when we give them to her. we are planning on shutting off the stovetop and getting her a microwave (although she always hated microwaves, which is why she doesn’t have one already.)

My mother things she has beginning stages of Alzheimers, or something related but my stepfather isn't doing anything about it, and they are both not doing anything to address it . I don't know how to get her to go to a doctor.
my mother is 65. she has told me herself for about 10 years that she thinks she is getting alzheimer's, or something like it. she feels like she is losing herself. we have some family history of i guess what you would call dementia, but mostly after people had suffered from strokes. my mother has degrees in psychology and computer science. she is a smart lady who had a great career. but, she has changed.my mother repeats herself--a lot. she will say the same thing over and over in an hour, a week, a month. it's like a record that skipping. we always tell her, "yes, you just said that." she has been doing this for a few years now. she gets stuck in a loop, sometimes for hours or days at a time repeating the same stories that catch her fancy. she loses things and forgets things. but, she seems otherwise pretty functional and serves as a chairperson for a really big non profit. she writes emails and gives speeches and seems ok with a lot of responsibility. she watches jeopardy and does pretty well. but, then in day to day interactions, she falls into that skipped record pattern again of repeating herself over and over like she doesn't remember what she just said. if you tell her something new, it's like she isn't paying attention. she replaces what you just said with another memory. i can say, "mom, i just got a promotion at work." she will say, "that's nice. i am working on this project." not in a narcissistic kind of way. it's like she isn't processing anything i just said. she will ask me, "how's work?" i say, remember, i got a promotion? she says, "oh yes, you did say that. did i tell you about my project?" yes, mom, you did--several times. 15 minutes later she asks, "how's work?" me: i got a promotion. her: that's great. i am working on this project. and so it repeats.and, she is really moody. she goes from happy to angry in a heartbeat, and then back to happy again. the smallest thing will set her off. she can remember things from years ago in great detail, but not remember what you told her an hour ago.she also drinks quite a bit. she's not an alcoholic, maybe 4 drinks a day. but she has a cocktail at 4 pm and has a few glasses of wine after that until bed. she's not getting hammered, but it's enough to make her "jolly". i wonder if she isn't drinking to cover up her memory lapses. it certainly doesn't help. and it could explain some of the moodiness.she also used to have a job as an executive in computer programming, but she quit to stay home and take care of my brother and never really got back into the workforce. as a woman in her 50's, i am sure it was hard to try to go back to the technology field. i know that staying at home made her skills in the tech field obsolete. she tried to go back to grad school but quit for various excuses. i don't think her pride could handle going back and not being the best against 25 year olds. and, i think that she had a problem memorizing the work for the classes. so, she just started staying at home more and more, and she wilted. so, i don't know if this is just a case of depression. and my stepfather doesn't help. he covers for her and enables her. he works long hours but still comes home and makes her dinner. i have tried to ask him, "don't you think that maybe there is a problem with mom's memory? have you tried taking her to a doctor?"  of course he isn't going to ask his wife, "do you think you have early onset alzheimers?" and i can't ask her. but, she thinks she does.i know this sounds like a depressed older middle aged lady who drinks a bit too much, doesn't listen to other people and maybe needs a hobby. but, my mother has changed.

my grandfather and his partner (they are not married, and she is not my grandmother) both have alzheimer's, albeit different forms. in her case, she spends most of her days sleeping, and also wets herself all the time. my grandfather can keep the house clean, but cannot answer questions, says "thing" for pretty much everything and ignores hunger. currently, he has a driver's licence, but his doctor refuses to allow him to get a new one. this is kind of a big deal, because he lives in a town where everything is pretty far, and it is somewhat needed, because he doesn't remember the name of his bank.they are currently followed by a social worker (i live in québec, canada), and she's doing nothing because my grandfather is clean. for example, she noted that their kitchen is really clean, but that's normal, because he forgot that he's hungry and doesn't eat for days. his fridge is empty. she notes that his partner doesn't make trouble, but that's because all she does is sleep all day long. my grandfather is the primary caregiver for her, and refuses to allow anyone else help her because of his pride. he also gets really angry whenever someone suggests help/that he has alzheimer too.the social worker doesn't want to do anything about it ― "technically". all she does is offer help. we + my grandfather tells her that his partner wets her bed every day, and nobody cleans it, so the solution is when it gets too wet, she goes to the second bedroom until that one is too wet, where she goes back to the first room. she was also hospitalized for a while ― we're not allowed to know the details, because we're not blood-related to her and she's not married to my grandfather. her side of her family is pretty much non-existant, so we're the only ones who can offer help for her, but we cannot know anything about it. my grandfather claims that she was hospitalized because she didn't leave her bed for 3 days straight, but he also claims that she's 27. we also don't know for how long she stayed at the hospital nor why she was allowed to go back home. we have no idea of the condition of their bedrooms because they get angry when we want to go upstairs, and the social worker wants to respect their wishes, but we believe that there might be maggots.the social worker told us that it was our job to feed them and help them, suggesting that we should buy them meals that we could bring to them every week-end, and they will send a helper to heat the meals. now... i 1) don't have the money for a taxi for 2x90min drive weekly (neither do i have the time...) 2) my grandfather has a lot of money. while we understand that social workers are overloaded and that yes, family should help... it's just not an option. nobody in our family can afford to just quit their job so that my grandfather's partner doesn't spend her days sleeping in her excretions and force them to sit down and eat. my uncle is especially upset at the suggestion that he should pay for their meals when they had always been ungrateful to us, to the point that they would get upset when we didn't feel happy when their holidays gifts were a bag of chips or a tube of jam they got for free. now i know that we sound heartless... especially since it's money issues, but is the only option left for us is to wait for them to die? the social worker does acknowledge that my grandfather is melting, as he's now about 145 lbs for around 6' at 80y.o., she does know that they most likely don't take their medicine, as the helper just gives it to my grandfather and leaves, since his partner is always sleeping (she also told us that the helper sometimes forgets to deliver the medicine to their house). she's aware that his partner spent probably around a month in the hospital because she's always in bed, she did hear in our presence that his partner sleeps in her own pee for around 20h daily, but because my grandfather refuses help, she doesn't do anything.(as for the money issues; my grandfather is so rich, he pays $100 daily to have someone open the tv for him.)what can we possibly do? is there really no options as long as my grandfather refuses any help?

my grandfather and his partner (they are not married, and she is not my grandmother) both have alzheimer's, albeit different forms. in her case, she spends most of her days sleeping, and also wets herself all the time. my grandfather can keep the house clean, but cannot answer questions, says "thing" for pretty much everything and ignores hunger. currently, he has a driver's licence, but his doctor refuses to allow him to get a new one. this is kind of a big deal, because he lives in a town where everything is pretty far, and it is somewhat needed, because he doesn't remember the name of his bank.they are currently followed by a social worker (i live in québec, canada), and she's doing nothing because my grandfather is clean. for example, she noted that their kitchen is really clean, but that's normal, because he forgot that he's hungry and doesn't eat for days. his fridge is empty. she notes that his partner doesn't make trouble, but that's because all she does is sleep all day long. my grandfather is the primary caregiver for her, and refuses to allow anyone else help her because of his pride. he also gets really angry whenever someone suggests help/that he has alzheimer too.the social worker doesn't want to do anything about it ― "technically". all she does is offer help. we + my grandfather tells her that his partner wets her bed every day, and nobody cleans it, so the solution is when it gets too wet, she goes to the second bedroom until that one is too wet, where she goes back to the first room. she was also hospitalized for a while ― we're not allowed to know the details, because we're not blood-related to her and she's not married to my grandfather. her side of her family is pretty much non-existant, so we're the only ones who can offer help for her, but we cannot know anything about it. my grandfather claims that she was hospitalized because she didn't leave her bed for 3 days straight, but he also claims that she's 27. we also don't know for how long she stayed at the hospital nor why she was allowed to go back home. we have no idea of the condition of their bedrooms because they get angry when we want to go upstairs, and the social worker wants to respect their wishes, but we believe that there might be maggots.the social worker told us that it was our job to feed them and help them, suggesting that we should buy them meals that we could bring to them every week-end, and they will send a helper to heat the meals. now... i 1) don't have the money for a taxi for 2x90min drive weekly (neither do i have the time...) 2) my grandfather has a lot of money. while we understand that social workers are overloaded and that yes, family should help... it's just not an option. nobody in our family can afford to just quit their job so that my grandfather's partner doesn't spend her days sleeping in her excretions and force them to sit down and eat. my uncle is especially upset at the suggestion that he should pay for their meals when they had always been ungrateful to us, to the point that they would get upset when we didn't feel happy when their holidays gifts were a bag of chips or a tube of jam they got for free. now i know that we sound heartless... especially since it's money issues, but is the only option left for us is to wait for them to die? the social worker does acknowledge that my grandfather is melting, as he's now about 145 lbs for around 6' at 80y.o., she does know that they most likely don't take their medicine, as the helper just gives it to my grandfather and leaves, since his partner is always sleeping (she also told us that the helper sometimes forgets to deliver the medicine to their house). she's aware that his partner spent probably around a month in the hospital because she's always in bed, she did hear in our presence that his partner sleeps in her own pee for around 20h daily, but because my grandfather refuses help, she doesn't do anything.(as for the money issues; my grandfather is so rich, he pays $100 daily to have someone open the tv for him.)what can we possibly do? is there really no options as long as my grandfather refuses any help?

It’s still hard when they’re gone, but it gets a bit easier...
it’s now been a full year and some hours since mama passed. at 3:43 pm this day last year, her sweet soul left us. i’d count the minutes that first week. i’d count the hours after the first month. then, the 4th of every month was ‘x’ amount of months. before then, though, it’d felt like i’d already lost her a thousand times; when she was first diagnosed. every time she forgot how to turn off a lamp. every time she told me she was scared and she wanted it to be over. every time i thought about what she saw trapped inside her own mind. every time i see my friends with their moms, and the friendship that formed between them once they became adults. when i witnessed her first seizure she’d ever had. when she forgot my baby blanket was my baby blanket. when she cried because she wanted to go home, but she was at home. when she’d sound like herself when she laughed, but couldn’t speak.i think of her every day, and if i let myself, i’d cry, too. i think of all the bad things i did or said to her, all the moments i made her cry because i didn’t understand or was too young and hormone driven. i also think about her laugh and her humor, how she’d embarrass me, but looking back on it, i wouldn’t be embarrassed now at all, if she were to do the same things today. i always thought of her as ‘mom’ and not as (married name redacted), formerly (maiden name redacted), and the whole person she was before i existed. i wish i could learn more of who she was before me, and before her disease. i feel i’ve missed out and have lost a part of me that i can never recover, memories and moments that could be recounted to me, if only she were here. she was a beautiful human, with a beautiful spirit that drew others to her. her love for me, our family, and her friends, will live on through us all. i think of that every day, too. it hurts, has always hurt from the beginning of this awful experience, but it gets a bit easier to remember the better times as life goes on. she’d want us all to be happy, and thankful for our time with her, so i’ll try to remember that most. it’s hard, but i’ll try, for her.

I wasnt ready
i cant sleep abd i need to write this out. i wasn't ready for my dad to not recognize me. he's forgotten my name in the past but he always remembered that i was his daughter. he didnt today. we were sitting outside and mom asked him who i was and he didn't know. i always talk about the little adjustments you have to make as your loved one gets worse. i've done ok. but this one cut me to my core. i knew it was coming.  its inevitable. its a fact but damn it. i wasn't ready. i always try to tell myself that's its going to be ok. but, its not going to be ok is it? we all know what is going to happen. i've educate myself. i know the stages, ive watched the documentaries, ive read the books....but i was not ready.i've been sitting on the edge of my bed for a while now.  i've cried for about 50 mins and done the stupid rocking myself back and forth in efforts to comfort myself.  where do i go from here? my thoughts run to upping my anxiety meds, cry in my mother's arms, post vague rants on facebook, depress friends with the tearful story about my situation or pop a xanax and sleep. i don't know.  i guess.... accept it and move on. they say you shouldn't worry about what you can't control but lord that is so difficult. i have 0 control over what is happening with my dad. god dammit i was not ready.

I set myself up for failure today
⚠️ warning: this story involves poop💩so my woes of today, as they often do, began yesterday.  yesterday i was tired.  that tired that is as much mental exhaustion as physical.  i have not been practicing good self care and it's catching up to me.  so i called in a favor and swapped a caregiver for the afternoon/ evening rather than helping me the following morning.  we had a dermatologist appointment the next day mid morning so the caregiver was happy to get more hours today than she could get tomorrow.  i spent the entire time sleeping as well as most of the evening.  it was amazing. the most sleep at one time that i have had in months.  in the exhaustion i forgot to set an alarm for the morning.  i normally don't need an alarm and i tend to set them up as more of a reminder than anything but my sleep of the dead had other ideas.  i wake up at 7am, an hour and a half before my so's dermatologist appointment. i think oh i really should reschedule that but it's with the va and takes weeks sometimes a month to get in and there is a scary looking spot that needs to be checked, so instead i rush into the shower and rush my so through his.  he is unhappy at being rushed and confused by it.  i have no one to blame but myself and alzheimer's so i soldier on.  as we are late i toss an ensure in the car for him to hold him over and resolve to have brunch after the appointment.  before leaving the house i ask my so if he needs the toilet, he replied "no", this is his stock reply to this question and has no basis in reality but because i'm late i accept it as reality.  on the drive (which takes about 30 min) he spills the ensure all over me.  again had i woken up early as usual it would all be fine, oh well.  i clean up as b st i can using wet wipes from the accident bag i carry in the car (has bathroom accident supplies for my so) and tuck it into the bag of the wheelchair we use when we have to go to the va (it's a massive complex that is built up over time so you occasionally have to go from building to building and it's a bit much for him).  we make it and check in at the kiosk about 3 mins before his appointment time, and sit down for the inevitable wait.  just as i'm starting to force myself to relax my so tells me he needs the toilet.  after finding the closest unoccupied toilet i get him settled.  after what feels like ages he says "i guess i don't need to go".  i'm sure at this point that they have called his name and we have missed the appointment and will have to repeat this process again soon, so i'm still rushing like an idiot and accept that it was a false alarm though he does not have these frequently.  he stands so i can help him get his pants up and he has a sudden bowl movement that is mostly liquid.  directly in to his diaper and the inside of his pants.  i sigh and think to myself "if only i had set an alarm this would have happened at home".  i charge in wipes at the ready (what was left after vainly using them to clean ensure off myself in the parking lot) and have with the use of the bathroom paper towels, wipes, have made things look more or less okay.  nothing is visible from the outside, and the smell is as gone as possible even though i catch a whiff of it now and then.  we leave the toilet and just as i sit down in the waiting room they call us back and we have a mostly uneventful visit to the dermatologist scheduling a follow up to check on the few spots he burned off and orders to keep on eye on the one that is concerning.  as we leave the va i let out a sigh of relief.  i pulled it off, even with oversleeping and a bathroom disaster i managed to forge ahead. i'm not having a bad day, i'm having a kickass day! i stop at starbucks and get my so a frappachino because he loves them and he has had a stressful morning too.  i pull in the drive and decide to check the mailbox before heading in the house.  i run into a neighbor along the way.  they type of neighbor you waive at but rarely have a "real" discussion with, but i like her well enough.  we chat and exchange niceties and then she says "i think you have something on you, maybe it's mud".  i look down and i have a splash of poop down the leg of my pants and shoe.  shin to floor unmistakable poop, we live in the desert and it hasn't rained since july.  both of us know the score but she is nice enough to call it mud.  i was so worried about cleaning him, i didn't notice or check myself.  i sat through the doctor appointment, wandered through the va, walked around starbucks and the neighborhood with poop down my leg😫.   even with more rest than i've had in months i'm walking around in a fog deep enough that i didn't notice this. of course i get us inside and showered again and get some food into us and things seem better.  i think i've learned some lessons out of this. 1. don't fight it, if things go wrong cancel. you will be happier in the long run. 2. one days rest does not make up for months of abusing yourself.  3. be mindful of splash-back

Is my father gonna be okay?
this is gonna be a long post but i have been worried and freaking out for the past few months and i needed to ask somewhere about this...i am worried my dad might be developing eoa. i have been thinking about this since around the fall of 2016.my dad just turned 78. he had me when he was 59 so i grew up with an old father compared to the average kids my age. but i never had an issue with him. he was very healthy and active, and while his fitness and strength have declined over the years, he lives happily every day and has had very few health issues since i was born. he is an everyday smoker by the way.he is the youngest of five brothers (actually, six, one of them passed away very young). of the other four, two have alzheimer's and two are healthy. also, one of his cousins, who also had alzheimer's, just passed away.i have never felt any issues with my dad's mental health until very recently, when i saw somethings that disturbed me. however, upon looking on the internet signs of early onset ad, it seems like many different pages have the very same text which lists ten symptoms and describes them in a rather ambiguous and extreme way. let me explain this: one of the "early signs to look for" often found in these articles is "misplacing objects", and it uses the example of a person placing a watch in the freezer. well, my dad does not do such things, but he sure has been losing a lot of stuff recently or forgetting where he left it around the house (we are talking normal places to put those things here).anyway, since these articles seem pretty vague to me, i wanted the opinion of others based on what i've recently observed:this year my dad divorced my mom after a lot of fights, but honestly, mainly due to his fault. he had just been very careless about his family and often insulting, and despite there is a lot to talk about this, he simply took his things in anger and left the house rather than talking about it. also: when trying to talk to him about an issue or a disagreement, once he faces facts or opinions that he dislikes, he just gets very annoyed and refuses to talk, or leaves very angry.these last months, he seems to forget he says some things. for example, i am with him and he tells me about how he saw a friend of ours recently. later that day, say five or six hours later on another conversation he tells me the same thing. this only happens once or twice until he eventually moves on, but it happens almost on a daily basis.my dad has always had a "unique" temper. he is proactive and happy but can always turn very angry quickly because of a fight or things that bother him. it's always been that way. but recently, it happens way way more often. if i disagree with him on something and he argue about it he usually gets mad about it (i have bad nerves and get very heated up when i argue with people). so we just stop talking to each other. but what surprises me the most is that a couple of hours later he will just call me in a friendly way and almost ignore the fact that we just had a very bad fight, he just says "forget it" and moves on way quicker than he would in the past.he also tends to forget where he leaves his things more often.due to this divorce i mentioned, he's grown more suspicious of my mother (although he's always been a bit like that). in consequence, he often changes all of his passwords, pins...etc only to forget them later in a month or two. he changes them so often he has a mess of passwords in his head now.we usually talk about the past, when i was a kid, when he was single and stuff. he remembers every single detail, and we talk about that without a problem. but it´s the short term things he forgets. he also confuses the date, say it's wednesday, but he will ask me: is it tuesday or wednseday today? this happens to me too, but not as often as to him.i am just scared and afraid this might be the beginning of the worst times of my life. i love my dad. both of my uncles that have alzheimers are in a very bad state and i would hate to see my dad like that someday. please be totally honest and tell me if you think this is normal aging or ad.

A Gift from My Grandfather
some background: my grandfather was diagnosed with alzheimer's a few years ago. he still remembers family, and he tells stories often, but forgets things like when he last ate, where his room is, etc. basically, he doesn't retain short-term memories. one interesting result of this was that a few months ago, he took a butterfly decoration from my mother's garden and put it on our mantel. when my mother later asked what it was doing there, he said he had bought it sometime ago, and had put it up for decoration. arguing is often pointless, and this was harmless, so none of us tried to tell him any different. since then, it's become a story he's told me a good few times - about how he bought it, even though it was expensive. it was the last one there, and a lady tried to buy it off of him, but he refused and brought it home. that's the story he tells me, and i listened every time, because the way he spoke of it and looked at it made it sound like it was precious to him. nothing had ever really come of it, except a few laughs among the rest of my family when i would recite what he told me. today, however, he told me something that through me for a loop - he said he was giving it to me. he explained it to me like one would a child - he told me that when he left, he might forget to take it with him, and that if he did, that i should have it, and not let anyone take it from me. at first, i was caught off guard and a bit concerned - where was he planning on going? but as the night continued, he told me that same thing a few times until once he made a motion with he hands when was talking about leaving - up, towards the sky. it was then that i realized that he was telling me that he wanted me to keep it when he passed away. he said he had had that butterfly there for a long time, and he would be satisfied knowing it was in my care, and that i shouldn't let anyone take it from me. i had to excuse myself after this, because i was on the brink of tears. i was so touched, even though i knew it was something from the backyard, because i had known that he had come to think of it as something important to him. when i had collected myself, i came back, and when he told me again that he wanted me to have it, i properly thanked him. he told me to take it to my room, so now it's sitting on my nightstand as a reminder of this moment. i know he might forget what he did tonight, but i never will. i wanted to share this on here because i know it can be hard, very hard, to watch and care for someone with alzheimer's, but this reminded me of why we were doing it. it was a moment that touched my heart. he was not perfect, but he was a good man, and even despite this disease, he still is.tl;dr - my grandfather took a butterfly decoration from the backyard, said he bought it a long time ago, and as time went by, he became emotionally attached to it. tonight he told me that he wanted me to have it, so that when he passed away he knew it would be in good hands. it brought me to tears.

Does this sound like early onset Alzheimer's?
i've been having some arguments with my mom the last year or so (she's 62 &amp; 1/2), but we've always had a difficult relationship. there's been little things like she'll insist "i never said that" to things she's definitely told me about an issue she's apparently flip flopped on. i've chalked it up to her normal bullshit. yeah, okay, "you never said that" /s. then when we were rehashing an often retold family story of when i broke my leg as a child, she was suddenly shocked and said "your dad was there?! i never knew!" but the thing is my dad was abusive and that memory was pivotal in my development. he wasn't the focus of the story, and it's possible i glossed over the details over the years.. but it's odd. in the story i was calling out for his help before i fell onto cement from 15 feet, and he actually immediately left because he didn't want to get into trouble for being there in the first place. there have been other stories i've told her about my dad and she just shakes her head saying if she knew any of it she would have done more... but the thing is i was a vocal child. i'm pretty certain i told her then, and have told her repeatedly since of what went on. but i was thinking maybe it's a deflection tactic, or maybe she's flipped into denial. who knows.on our skype calls she rehashes the same things again and again. bullshit gossip about her sister and extended family that there's been no update on in at least 6 months (she believes her sister has early onset alzheimer's or done brain damage from an accident), the garden, and whatever poison fox news is feeding her now. i get that she doesn't have much going for her and doesn't have a lot to talk about, so i just humor it all.then this last week my brother and sister in law were planning on going over to dinner at her house, but due to the recent heat wave and her having no ac they decided to do it at their house where their infant would b be most comfortable. all of this was discussed over text. an hour after she was supposed to come over they finally called her and she kept insisting they were supposed to go over to her house. my sil kept giving her an easy out, saying there must have been a miscommunication. instead of taking the out my mom kept circling it, insisting somehow it was my brothers fault, citing that he was supposed to come last week but didn't because they were out of town (which is irrelevant)? my brother got so mad he ended up not going over at all, but my sister in law went with my nephew. as they were leaving my mom told her "oh! you forgot your purse!" and my sil replied, "no i didn't?" and my mother insisted she did and went back in to get it. see, the thing is, my sister hasn't carried a purse since having the baby. she just socks her wallet in the diaper bag. my mom came out of the house holding *her own purse that she's owned for 10 years, filled with her wallet and everything* in front of her by the handles gingerly, you know, as you would hold someone else's purse, and she tried to put it in my sister's trunk. sil was kind of stunned and said, uh, that's actually your purse? then my mom looked stunned and said "oh! it must have looked doesn't because you moved it." my sister did not move my mom's purse, they weren't anywhere near it for the 30 minute dinner. my sister in law said as much and then my mom said the baby must have knocked it over at least... except he didn't. baby was no where near the purse. the other thing is this purse is black, my mom is very particular about purses and shopped for it for four years. my sister in law has opposite taste, her purses are designer, bright colors like coral or teal, white with multicolor print soho bags. my sister in law was telling me how everything is someone else's fault with my mom, which is honestly how she's always been, but this feels different.i can't get over the purse thing, that's freaking weird. i've thought maybe it was dehydration? but i called my mom who says she drinks three of these water bottles my husband got her for christmas every day, but only before 3pm "otherwise she's going to the bathroom all night" (her words). i've thought maybe it was blood sugar related, she was waiting to eat for my brother to get there and was doing yard work outside in the meanwhile. she hate, hate, hates doctors. proudly proclaims how she hasn't been to a doctor in 10 years, she thinks they're just money sucking vacuums that don't actually do anything and will tell you whatever to get a profit on getting you medicated. she thinks counselors are only for "crazy people". she's so stubborn, will not budge an inch if you begged &amp; pleaded, screamed at her, cut contact, bribed her, even for the most simple benign requests. she will make every excise in the book not to exercise (it rains too much, it's dangerous, she has allergies, it gets dark too early and she wears glasses and could trip!!). i have never once gotten her to do something she doesn't want to do, doesn't matter what it is.i don't know. thoughts? i'm going to have a hell of a time trying to get a diagnosis if it is.

What steps do I need to take as a caregiver at the beginning of this long journey?
i'm 24, currently live with just my grandparents, and my grandma is at the beginning stages of alzheimer's. she's in her mid 70s, repeats questions/statements, forgets what she's talking about mid-sentence, illogical conversations, walks into rooms and doesn't remember why, and worst of all has very frequent mood swings and outbursts. very likely sundowners as she will start yelling and throwing things around sunset. she always had depression and has a terrible habit of blaming and nagging my grandfather about everything. she was diagnosed about two years ago and takes aricept but i don't think it has any effect. &amp;nbsp;just today she broke her first bowl by throwing it against the sink, and for the first time refused to take her medication. she used to cook dinner for the whole family for decades but since last year, my grandfather has been taking care of everything. she will still go into the kitchen and start yelling and nitpicking at him for very minor and sometimes nonsensical reasons. for example, not wiping the stove while he's cooking at the same time or for using the wrong type of napkin. she literally looks for things to nitpick or makes something up to yell at him about. this behavior is normal though, as i've witnessed it my entire life, but it's several times worse now that she repeatedly verbally abuses my grandfather over the same thing multiple times a day/every day and completely lacks the cognition to reason through any conversation.&amp;nbsp;today, she picked up a pot lid and handed it to my grandfather for no reason while he was cooking. he didn't see or hear her so she throws it against the stove, frightening everyone. i removed her from the kitchen. she comes back and starts washing the dishes on her own and starts yelling about how she has to do everything in the house (we tell her frequently not to do many things around the house including washing the dishes, taking out the trash, etc), and breaks the bowl. after dinner i handed her some stomach medication and she threw it down the sink, saying she's almost going to die anyway. &amp;nbsp;anyway, tonight's episode was the worst and that's why i wanted to let it out and make a post. **my goal right now is to start a conversation with the rest of the family about what to do going forward and what sort of topics or options we need to explore in that conversation.** the question that comes to mind is - what are the next steps in preparation for long term care? i'm talking about legal things like wills, power of attorney?, anything that may need to be done while she is still "there". and i think we'll need a caretaker later on since my job keeps me out of the house 12 hours a day and my grandfather is getting old himself, though still mentally sharp. he's not going to be able to take care of her if she goes into the advanced stages. what are some options - in-home nurse? long-term care facility? at what point will she need to go under their care? she's still able to take care of herself right now, but i'm planning several years down the line and i'm totally clueless about where to begin. i'd like to do as much as i can to help, but since i'm at the start of my career and the lack of family availability in the area, it doesn't seem to be a feasible thing to do when she progresses into the advanced stages. i know it's a full-time job to be a caregiver and i wouldn't know what to do if it gets to that point. also any advice on these emotional outbursts would be appreciated. her whole life she was the caretaker of the family and refused to let anyone help her, but now i know she means well but she simply can't do it and she is reacting badly to that. thank you

Worried for my mother
hey guys! i'm not sure if any of you can help, but i'm worried for my mom. i think she might be showing signs of alzheimers, but i'm not exactly sure.she is currently 52 years old and has fibromyalgia which, by the way, i have researched and it seems like it's still unknown whether it's real or not. lately she's been forgetting things. they're little, but i've been noticing it. whenever she forgets something she just blames "fibro fog". it's basically her scapegoat at this point for when she can't think of something right away.anyways, just a bit of back story. i am one of 3 siblings, and my parents are divorced. so as of right now, it's me, my mom, and my brother and sister living in a house together. my two siblings have jobs, and my mom does not as she was recently fired in january. i'm with her all day as i graduated from high school early and are waiting to go to college in the fall.now on to why i might think she has alzheimers. one of the first examples that is the most prevalent is that she frequently gets me and my siblings' names mixed up. she gets it after a second or two like she just misspoke, but i think this is worth mentioning just in case.in addition to this, i'm repeating my conversations with her quite a bit. i'll tell her something in the morning, then by night time i'll be telling her again. then again the next day.another small thing i noticed. our mom does all of our laundry because she doesn't trust us not to mess something up. because of this, she ends up sorting our clothes for us and has been doing this all our lives. she is also there whenever we buy clothes, and she is often the one to just buy clothes for us on her own. lately though she's been mixing up our clothing and asking me what's mine and what isn't. she's never done this before, so it raised a red flag.she also can never remember times or days no matter how much you repeat them. for instance, my brother has had the same work schedule for about a year and she still can't remember it. she also has to pick him up from work every single day, because she is the nobly one with a car in my family.just a specific example that has happened just this past week involves movie titles. she's been looking for a certain couple of movies for about a month now but can never remember the title correctly. we've told her the correct title every time, but she can never remember.she also will often not be able to finish her sentences. she'll have to wait a couple seconds before she gets her bearings again, and even then her sentences are full of mistakes and she mispronounces simple words occasionally. keep in mind the only language we speak is english. but all she ever says for all of these instances is "it's my fibro fog".if it matters, he father had alzheimers before he passed away about a year ago. i'm not sure if that gives her a predisposition to it or not!i'd bring it up to her, but i think it's a sensitive topic for her since her father passed fairly recently and also around the same time as her mom. i also feel like she might laugh and just tell me she's fine and that it's fibro fog, yet again.we are also not a family that goes to the doctor for a regular check up or anything. we normally only go if something is wrong, so she probably won't be going anytime soon.thank you for reading and helping! sorry for the long post, i'm just worried and wanted to include as much as possible.

hey reddit,i got the call i’ve been dreading.  a friend in my hometown called and explained that several people at my mother’s workplace are worried about her, followed by a couple specific examples of confusion and forgetfulness.  i’ve had my suspicions as well, but told myself i would wait for a specific event before acting.  and now, i think the time has finally come for the torch to be passed on to me.alzheimer’s is no stranger to my family.  both of my grandparents had the disease (her parents), and several of her brothers and sisters have it currently or have passed from it.  for fifteen years she sacrificed, along with the rest of the family, to care for her parents.  they were both kept at home from diagnosis to death.  i grew up in the middle of all of this and know well how this disease progresses.  so, i guess i want to get thoughts, opinions and ideas from the hive mind on my next steps.first, i need to talk with her.  she has made a couple of comments about “not being like she once was” and is taking a supplement that is supposed to improve brain clarity.  i think she is aware that there has been some cognitive decline, and with her extensive history in taking care of her parents/siblings, i believe she will be open to this conversation.  i have a call into a local memory care clinic for information, but i’m not sure if we need a referral from her primary care provider before i can make an appointment.  second, she is still working.  she is 67, so i think the time has come to have a conversation about retirement.  she is still high functioning, though i’ve noticed a decline in understanding layered ideas and processes with progressive steps.  for example, teaching her how to use a new oven and microwave a month ago was difficult for her.  (as i write this, more and more example are cropping up that i have apparently compartmentalized, which is making me feeling even guiltier.)  her co-workers have noticed things like her being confused and forgetful.  this has apparently gotten worse in the last few weeks.third, driving.  her siblings live in a town 30 miles over and she travels there two to three times a week.  that is originally her hometown.  she has no family in the town she currently lives in, but it’s a small town and people help take care of their own there, to an extent.  when is time to call it quits on driving?  fourth, finances.  she has very little money, maybe a net worth of a 100k.  and the money she has, she ends up giving a significant portion away to charity.  she literally gets 10-15 pieces of mail a day from charities asking for money.  she is donating $300+ dollars a month to any number of charities (i made the mistake of looking at her monthly bank statement that was sitting out one night).  i brought up her giving, indirectly, and she told me she is only giving $20-30 a month.  though she did agree to be more mindful of her giving and acknowledged that there were a lot of scams out there.  this was probably four months ago, and i dropped it because it is her money and i don’t want to feel like i’m overstepping/micromanaging.  i haven’t looked at a statement since so i don’t know if it has continued or not.  do i talk to her about becoming her durable power of attorney and restricting these financial behaviors?  do i just let it ride?  i feel like either way, i am going to lose.  i suppose that’s the over-arching theme in alzheimer’s, isn’t it?  doesn’t matter what you do.  you lose.fifth, living arrangement.  i have a decent job, and i can support her through most things.  but i don’t make enough to pay a $3500 - $6000 / month for assisted living.  i’m not sure what her social security check will end up being.  her home is paid off, so we are only on the hook for food, taxes, utilities and maintenance.  i can easily subsidize those.  she could come live with my fiancé and me, but that takes her away from everything she has ever known, plus i worry about the strain of her living with us on our relationship.  i am thinking, at least for the time being, about hiring someone to swing by a few times a week and check in on her, buy her groceries, etc.  she is still capable.  any thoughts or ideas on this?my mother has never been married and i [32m] am the only child and live 2 hours away.  i don’t know if i am in denial on her actual condition or if i’m overreacting.  i don’t know a lot of things.  i was prepared for some feelings in this, but i was not prepared for the amount of selfishness, anger, and guilt that i am now experiencing.  selfishness in my personal life.  selfishness in my career.  i know the toll that this has on families.  i’ve lived it.  taking care of my grandparents consumed her life for fifteen years, and now, ten years later, she is subject to the same path.   i am angry.  i am angry that a good woman, a strong woman, is slowly being erased by this damned disease.  i feel guilty about not being there for her more in the past.  i feel helpless and guilty in knowing how the story ends, but only being the starting line.  i am heartbroken for her to have to suffer through this.  she has already offered up so much to the alzheimer’s gods, and now they are demanding her life.  she doesn’t deserve this.  she has paid her dues.  done her time.  without question.  without regret.i’m sorry if this post is a mess.  i needed to write this.  i know all of you caretakers and family members out there have sacrificed so much yourselves and i am not in a unique situation.  i think i just need to know you are out there, and what you did at the start of your journey.  my fiancé and family are great, and very supportive.  i know i am not alone in this, but i feel all the responsibility acutely.  i very much appreciate any feedback you can provide.  i have already talked with, and received information from, alz.org and plan on talking with mom friday.  from there, scheduling a visit with a physician, getting rx meds, etc.  after that, who knows?  here we go!edit:  you guys are awesome.  thank you so much for the advice and support.

Possible Alz presenting rapidly in a loved one. Not sure what to do.
i'm 23 and i live with my grandparents. my grandfather is in his 80's and my grandmother in her 60's. grandad has had a pretty tough time - he was in a major accident about 30-odd years ago and has been (for want of a better word) crippled ever since.  this has meant he's been on super strong painkillers ever since, as long as i can remember he's had trouble with names and places but never has this been anything particularly worrying. my grandmother says he's always been fairly vacant, even before the accident. but earlier this year he stated he didn't want to drive anymore. he said he didn't feel safe driving  (he's always been confident; was a lorry driver prior to his accident). other things have been more common too; he stated walking to the front of the house before remembering the kitchen was moved to the back at least 20 years ago. he forgot where his clothes were, which door the bathroom was through. but more recently (this weekend) he's told us that he can't read anymore. he starts reading a line and then gets lost and forgets where he was. we've suggested audio books might help. he loves reafing and its painful to see this taken from me. although i've been begging my grandmother to get him to the doctors for months now this has made it more real and i'm terrified. can anyone give me any advice on what i should do or how i can help him? my father is in the navy and was away when i was growong up, while mum worked grandad basically raised me. i feel selfish for being so devastated about this but it feels so unfair for him and i hate it. edit: thanks for the advice everyone, i appreciate knowing that people are out there who understand what i'm going through here. we have an appointment scheduled for him now but the soonest we could make it is the 9th january. some days are definitely worse than others but the less stressed we are seen to be the better he seems to be, for now.again: thank you so much everyone. i hope i won't be back to seek further support but i am not getting my hopes up too much, i don't want to be unrealistic &lt;3

Lost my mom at 25. I am here to help.
this is a story about my depression, what caused it, and how i am working to conquer it.  bear with me. it's pretty elaborate.  i am posting this in several subreddits so it might feel somewhat broad, but i want to help as many people as i can.i am 30. i started smoking weed when i was 13. it started innocently, like most of us. in today's culture it's pretty difficult not to be a little curious as to what it feels like to be high if you have never done it before. when i started, it wasn't nearly as accepted as it is today, so i could only imagine how the kids feel today.i was expelled from high school my freshman year in only the first week for possession, which pretty much sent my depression into a downward spiral. people think they're fixing the system by "getting rid" of the bad kids, by throwing them in alternative school or whatever your county may have, but really all it did was put me in a room full of kids who abused drugs. i was extremely depressed: none of my friends' parents would let them talk to me anymore, my parents were extremely disappointed, and i pretty much squandered every chance of getting into a good school. this lead to suicidal tendencies and a depression that would lead well into my twenties.i had older parents, and my mom was diagnosed with early-onset alzheimer's disease while i was in high school. i was 16. i was really embarrassed by this in a weird way: she would forget my friends' names, she would say really off-the-wall shit, or she would ask us about things that didn't happen or things that happened a long time ago in her childhood. because of this, i didn't let anyone into my house and never had friends over. years later, my psychologist friend helped me understand that ultimately this is because i was trying to protect her, because i didn't want people to think she was stupid or to embarrass her. admittedly, it was a little selfish, too.weed, alcohol, and drugs became my best friends, and i stopped hanging out with the kids that were clearly destined for success, and started hanging out with the "bad kids", similar to those from that school i went to, who were abusing drugs and alcohol just like me. if anyone says that weed is not a gateway drug, they're wrong. ultimately my weed use connected me with people who used lsd, xanax, vicodin, oxycontin, percocet, valium, klonopin, cocaine, mushrooms, dmt...pretty much you name it. and i wanted all of it, and in excess. i wanted to be numb.my mom's health continued to deteriorate, and when i was 18 my dad had a heart attack, a stroke, and had an aneurysm on his aorta. i was delivering pizzas at domino's while taking care of him.my older brother and i were forced to put my mother in a nursing home. before she was really sick, she told me that if she ever got a point where she couldn't take care of herself, then i needed to put her in a home. so that's what we did, and it's a decision i still struggle with to this day.this whole time, i was heavily abusing alcohol and drugs. i had developed a painkiller addiction and was taking up to 10 percocets a day, and was hanging on by a thread. i overdosed several times. i was smoking an 8th a day of weed. i was drinking whiskey by the fifth. amazingly, i got straight a's at a local community college while dealing with all of this. i was studying art and loved to draw and just being creative in general. but man...i loved to be messed up.a week before i was going to university, my dad passed away. he was my best friend and is still the person i have been able to connect with the most in life. my family was extremely poor because of all the illness, and the bank repossessed my family's house. at 22, i was homeless, i had a drug addiction, i was an alcoholic, and the only family i had was my brother who was in the navy in japan.i tried to tough it out and do the right thing and go to school anyways like i know he would want me to do. i moved into the dorms at 22 because i had nowhere else to live. i barely left my dorm room, didn't talk to anyone about what i was going through, and was drinking and smoking weed heavily every day. i had a few friends, i guess, but it was only friends that would drink with me. we never talked about what i was going through.the first semester i got all a's, but the second semester i pretty much stopped going. this is probably the lowest point in my life. i failed almost every class. i was forced to drop out, but at the same time, there was a tinge of hope: i played guitar in a band with some friends and it was actually have some success. i met an amazing girl named amber, and things seemed to be on the come-up, at least emotionally.just as things were getting better, i got the phone call that my mom was about to pass away. i went and saw her in the home one last time. amber had become concerned with my drug abuse and alcoholism, and flew me to live with my brother in virginia while he was stationed in norfolk. my brother had married a woman from japan. she wasn't very understanding: ultimately, she kicked me out of the house after a month because i wasn't going to get a job. i went and stayed with some friends of my family a couple of hours away, where i stayed sober for an entire week and tried to pull myself together. ultimately i went back to amber.at this point i was 25, i was in debt over $20,000 from school, i had no parents, no money, no house, no car. i was started smoking weed and drinking again. but amber still believed in me. she saw the person that i really was beneath the veil of alcohol and drug abuse, someone that i myself barely knew was there. after she received her degrees in psychology and music, we moved down to florida where she was from.my time in florida has been pretty good, honestly. i have grown a lot as a man since i was 25. i learned to program in php and started a career building custom wordpress themes for small businesses. i now own my own business, and even though i still struggle and don't make a ton of cash, i am so proud that i am even here and still trying.i have been alcohol-free for a month, narcotic-free for several years, and haven't smoked weed in about 10 days. it's funny to me that weed has been the last thing to go, and i will be honest, i am having a harder time not smoking weed than anything else i have had to deal with. i am reading tony robbins' book awaken the giant within, which is helping me challenge my core beliefs about myself and to rewire all of the negativity i have had my entire adult life.i proposed to amber a couple of months ago and she said "yes!", which was and still is the greatest feeling in the world.i am posting this because i want to help. if you are depressed, or are abusing drugs or alcohol, or one of your parents has cancer, or one of them has alzheimer's, or you are feeling alone...i can tell you from the bottom of my heart that things are going to get better and things will be okay. i truly love you, and i don't say that as a shrink or a counselor: i say that because i have been there, and i needed someone to tell me that really badly some days.  i still deal with the regret of leaving my mom in that home.if you need me, i want you to find a way to message me right now. let's figure it out. i will gladly do anything i can to help you figure things out, even if it's just listening. at this point in my life, i feel there's very little i can't handle or conquer. i know i can help you.thanks to anyone who reads. this is been very helpful to me this morning.j

Needing advice... (very long, I apologize)
it's become increasingly apparent that my mother is exhibiting signs of dementia. some background: 63yo, married to my father since 1972, had a previous marriage and a child she put up for adoption around 1970. her parents died at 68 (father) and 62 (mother) supposedly of heart disease, but it's unknown is this is true.she's exhibited bizarre behavior since i was in high school (10+ years ago) but it has ramped up extremely in the last few years. she's always been extremely paranoid - she used to read my emails and listen into my phone calls when i was in high school because she was so paranoid that i was "against her". (i was a pretty model child - nhs, band, quiz bowl captain, worked 20+ hours/week, etc).i remember in high school that she had so many medications. xanax, trazodone, risperdone, paxil, elavil... it just seemed like a lot. after i started working in pharmacy i realized that she was pretty snowed with meds. she's always been a little peculiar - my brother in law describes it as making up stories in her head and then completely, 100% believing them. one example i can remember is her completely believing my nephew's birthday party was in their neighboring town, only to arrive at their empty house because they were in our town, and had even sent us invitations describing such.i left for college and moved 3+ hours away. just before graduation, my parents informed me that mom had breast cancer. stage 1, grade 4. she had a lumpectomy, several rounds of chemo, and 6 weeks of radiation. she remained her peculiar self, but nothing alarming. she suffered neuropathy in her feet and through the years has fallen frequently.the past year has been... different. i guess the most alarming situations have been away from home, involved in the planning of my wedding. every time i've met my parents (i live in the capital of our state, they live 2+ hours away, pretty rural), my mother has been completely thrown. she doesn't know where she is (adamant that i live on the same street as my sister, 45 minutes away), that my wedding date was on the 17th (it was the 14th, we actually had a small argument because she couldn't accept that she didn't know my wedding date), etc.the night before my wedding was a nightmare. the rehearsal was at the church at 4:30, and i asked my parents to be at my house at 3 as i had tons of stuff to do. at 1:30 my mom called from her cell phone (more on that later) saying they were minutes away from my house and... she forgot pants, other than the jeans she was wearing. could i take her shopping? she was very angry that i simply didn't have time to take her to the mall and that i suggested she borrow a pair of my pants, a size larger, same inseam. she was mortified that she was wearing a size 10 instead of a size 8. this consumed her focus for the rest of the night. she kept obviously hiking them up, "holding" them up (even though with a shirt over them it couldn't be noticed), anything to draw attention the fact that they were too big.she kept arguing that she and dad could find the church just fine. i asked her for directions. she gave me interstate exits and streets that don't exist. dad tried to calm her down and assure her that going with us was the best plan of action.we arrived at the church, and upon exiting the car, she lost control of her bowels. i had no idea that she needed to use the restroom, or i'd have had her go before we left. she didn't indicate anything to anybody except my father and me. luckily the church was unlocked and she was able to go in and clean herself up.leaving the church, i noticed her walking out with my sister's purse. i asked her where hers was, and she said she didn't bring it. we got about 7 miles away, nearly to our restaurant for our rehearsal dinner, when she announced that she'd left her purse at the church. it was rush hour traffic at this time and my husband, a very patient person, nearly lost it. i called the contact person of the church who happened to be locking up, asked him to search for it, and he didn't find it. she then claimed that she didn't bring it. i knew she was lying and trying to save face, seeing how upset my husband was.the next morning, she was supposed to arrive at my house for hair at 7:45. at 8, i tried to call her cell. at this moment, i knew she had left her purse at the church the night before, and had a sneaking suspicion that she'd hidden it in the church basement. it turns out i was right. she turns off her phone when she's not using it, defeating the purpose of having a cell phone to begin with. she also had not informed dad that she was paying for makeup - so i had to take my already very angry father to the atm to withdraw cash that he didn't know he needed to replace. it was then that he admitted that mom has been "slipping mentally", and that he didn't know what to do.long story short, we made it through the wedding. the other day, however, i found out that the morning after the wedding, at 6am, my father awoke in the hotel room and couldn't find mom. he searched every floor of the hotel (thinking she forgot the room number), only to be alerted by my sister's kids that she was sitting in their car, in the parking lot, in her pajamas. it's unknown how long she was out there, because she denies it happened.in the past week she's told us that she fell the night of the wedding and broke her nose. she has no bruising, no black eyes, no clearly bent nose, etc. we think she's using the "fall" to excuse her grandchildren finding her in her car at 6am in her pajamas in an unfamiliar parking lot. she's also claimed that she has a "brain bleed"... but she's at home. we know it's bs. she also had no idea i was turning 30 this week. i confronted my father about it this weekend and he laughed it off (his coping mechanism). he thinks it's nothing and doesn't see the dangerous implications (what happens when she goes out to the car, starts it, and leaves the garage door down?), etc. in conclusion, my sister and i feel that we've exhausted options - dad laughs it off, our aunt makes excuses for her, and we know that she will get mad as hell if we imply anything wrong. is it ethically/morally wrong for us to contact her physician directly and describe what's happening? i know he can't tell us anything about her care, but are we right in at least informing him of what she'll never tell him herself? is this really normal behavior for a 63 year old? are we overreacting?please help. :( i'm sorry this is so long, but it really helps to vent.

Just a long sad rant. I guess I could use some support.
to be honest, the fact that my grandma can't recognize me anymore doesn't upset me. it upsets my family when she can't remember who they are, but it never bothers me. and she practically raised me so it's not for a lack of caring. i feel like nobody believes me when i say that. but what does bother me, what i can't get out of my head, is the look a terror in her eyes when she forgets where she is and doesn't feel safe. or when she reaches out for my hand and begs me to stay with her until she can go home, and i stay as long as i can until she falls asleep, but i know she'll wake up and i won't be there to keep holding her hand. and it tears me apart when she can't remember if my grandpa is alive or not and we lie and tell her he's okay because it's wrong to have her relive that moment again and again. i don't care if i ever have my old grandma back, the one who tied ribbons in my hair before school, and helped me with my homework each afternoon, and always had time for me to talk to her, and to listen even when i was away at college. i love my grandma the same now as i always did and even if she can never love me the same way she used to. but i hate how this disease makes her so scared. i hate how each time i leave her, i know she would feel better if i had stayed to reassure her, and i hate how it upended her world that she spent so long creating for herself and instead transplanted her into this terrifying, foreign one without ever asking for permission. i cry because i'm scared her last days will be terrifying for her. i don't care if she can't remember me. but i hate that she is so afraid now. i'm trying to sleep but all i can think about is her nervous hands and the panic in her voice. she loved me so much and she doesn't deserve this. that's what i hate. that's why i cry at night. none of my friends understand that. they all just think that not remembering who i am is the worst part of it all. maybe you guys could relate. i just feel so empty lately.

Should I/How do I get my extremely short tempered, stubborn and proud dad to get diagnosed?
my dad is 70. he almost definitely has undiagnosed alz. he has a very strong family history of it. he started showing signs about 3 years ago but it wasn't that bad so my family and i have ignored it and also have probably been in denial about it too. however now it is much more noticeable. he has always been a rather angry and stubborn person, but it seems the alz has only made these characteristics worse. he is particularly nasty to my mother when he has forgotten something. so, what can we do? i don't believe he is in any danger, he doesn't live by himself and he doesn't need any help with activities of daily living yet. my family and i believe if we confront him about this, he will just blow up at us and storm out. i also think that by now, he must have noticed his memory going and hasn't done anything about it himself. my mum hasn't wanted him to get diagnosed yet because she doesn't want him to lose his drivers' licence. i agree that losing that independence would be devastating for him and he is fine to drive at the moment. however when then do we decide that he can't drive any more? when he goes missing one day? he also doesn't seem to be able to handle any amount of alcohol any more. he gets pass-out drunk so quickly. but if mum says anything to him about not drinking, he either snaps at her or just ignores it.mum also wants to move to a smaller house for when they get older and wants to do this now, before he won't remember the new house. no surprises for guessing that dad is completely opposed to this idea. my sister and i are willing to support our mum with talking to dad about this, but neither of us have any idea how/when to mention any of this, and also what to suggest as a starting point for dealing with it. he still has so many days that are almost normal and sometimes i wonder if it would be worth mentioning it at all yet. but if we don't do it now, i don't think it will get any easier. any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Living with a grandfather with Alzheimer's; any advice would be greatly appreciated.
my so and i moved in with his grandparents, as his grandmother was a fall-risk and would get up 11+ times, and his grandfather has rapidly increasing alzheimer's. a few weeks after we moved in, grandma was moved permanently to a nursing home, so that she could be with doctors and nurses should she fall (which has already happened at the nursing home, though she's okay). the same week, rosetta (the lady who has been coming to take care of them for years) had to get surgery and was on medical leave. pop was initially confused about why kev and i were there, but over rosetta's leave, he was used to us being there and happy to hear that we were returning after work. rosetta came back on monday, and all of the progress we had made was gone. he no longer remembers who kevin and i are, and is often angry at the fact that we are. he doesn't remember giving us permission to stay with him and constantly tells rosetta that he doesn't know why we're here, and that we didn't ask. the effects of this week have been difficult for kevin and i, as we struggle with pop who remembers nothing more than five or ten minutes beforehand. he's currently on the list to move into the same nursing home as his wife, in the memory department. until then, he fights with us for no reason, calling us "pieces of shit". i'm at a loss of what to do. we have posted notes around the house, detailing what's going on. yet he still gets angry when he sees us, and is depressed each night when rosetta leaves. he used to be such a happy man, always smiling and laughing. he showed so much love towards kevin and i. and then rosetta came back. the only theory we have so far is that having rosetta back is putting him in the mindset of him, his wife, and rosetta at home together. we don't know what to do. i know not to take it personally, as it's the alzheimer's. honestly, if you read all of this, thank you. but what i'm really hoping to get out of this is more understanding on this disease and if there is anything that i can do to help him during this complicated time. tldr: my boyfriend and i are staying with his grandfather with alzheimer's. after a few months of his nursing aid away on medical leave, pop began remembering that his wife is in the nursing home and was happy that we were staying with him. on return of the aid, he's forgotten everything and is often angry or depressed. any advice on living with someone with alzheimer's would be greatly appreciated.

My mom is showing symptoms of Alzheimers while having stage 4 lung cancer. Need Guidance!
a little background about me before i get into the sad stuff.  my name is michael and i'm a single 35 year old guy that has joint custody of twin 10 year old boys.  i am in college full time online while working as an intern for a respected it company while working a part time evening job as well (60 hours a week just working, 85 a week with college).  ok, so my mother is an intelligent and loving woman who has had lung cancer going on 9 years now.  her lung cancer is at the later stages and she doesn't want any more treatment.  she has had half her lung already cut off, went through chemo and vows to never go through it again.  she has gone through experimental treatments and it made her miserable.  she wants to finish out her life happy, lucid, and fighting the cancer on her own terms. now she is showing signs of alzheimers and she is forgetting everything.  she still has her intelligence and is fully functional, but now she forgets everything that is short term.  she doesn't see the problem.  to make things worse her mother (my grandma) has stage 4 alzheimers and doesn't even know how to eat anymore much less ever even say two words to anyone.  my mother doesn't want to go through this.  she explained to me once that she doesn't want to get scanned due to shes already terminal and doesn't want to know if she has alzheimers.  she is retired but her health insurance is going to 700 dollars in december from 300 dollars.  we can't afford any assisted care.  we got her will started along with a living will.  we have taken care of the power of attorney.  what else can i do to help her through this process?  do i ask her to get tested?  we've taken over her finances because she hasn't paid them in two months due to forgetting.  she still currently drives, but now is starting to get lost easily.   she is 56 years old currently.  any guidance on how i can help her?  what other important things am i forgetting?  how do i be supportive and ask  the family to be supportive at such an early stage?  nobody is even aware she is having a problem.  is it too soon to talk to her friends and family?  any guidance or advice would truly be helpful!thanks for listening/reading!

Monsters
you're gone. but you're still here.you're here. but you have gone to a place where you are fighting. but it's a fight you cannot win. it's a fight we cannot help you win. it's a fight we are losing as well. where we are losing you.we are losing you to a vicious monster.the monster which makes you forget. the monster which is changing you.which is changing your personality, your intellect and every other thing you stood for.a monster which is degenerating your brain to the brain of a child.a 79 year old child.i'm trying to console myself with the idea that the one thing we, as grown ups always regret we lost, our child within, you are about to get back.but who am i kidding.there's nothing soothing about this monster. no good part nor does it have a better side.the only resemblance of a child i recognise in you is the part where you behave as a child, because the monster has taken away your ability to express yourself in a different way.you simply cannot understand anymore why things are happening to you.what is happening around you.what is happening?so you cry.like a child. like a 7 year old child.and this monster makes us respond to you as if you are a child. we use our friendly voice. we try to comfort you. we distract you. we dry your tears. we try to make you understand that there's no need to cry.you're crying but what are you really trying to express?i understand that you are crying because you feel helpless. because you do not know what to do.and so do we. cry. feel helpless.don't know what to do.you still know who i am.but i know that the monster will take this away as well.i'm trying to stare this monster in the face with all my fears and shouting at itwhat are you waiting for?why don't you take all of him?you already took away a proud man.you took away a husband. a father. a granddad.his ability to remember.his ability to remember what he wants to say. what he was saying. and why he was saying it.by now he doesn't remember why he started a conversation, let alone how to finish it.his ability to do things. even the simplest things. play cards. play games. play guitar. do groceries. cook. count. write. how to dress himself, although he fought a very long and a very good fight there.you took away his memories.the very short ones flew out of the window like this.the longer term ones, now,like that to.you're taking away his definition.you're taking away his dignity.you're giving him in returnangerconfusionembarrassmentanxietylonelinessyou are making him feel lost.it just doesn't matter how hard we try to find him. try to bring him back. even if he has to borrow our memory. but we are lost together with him.if you are not taking him away in one go, please take him to a place where he doesn't have to feel like that anymore. take him to that void of emptiness where there are no memories of what has been.just don't let him hang around like this.don't let him be stuck between nothing and something.an undefinable anything.let him please find that place where the sky is blue, clouds are slowly drifting by and where blue birds sing.let us know that there is some sort of redemption while losing so much. show us.reassure us of his acceptance of his loss.our loss.but maybe you just did.is that what you tried to show me this evening? just before i left to go home and kissed him goodnight?i acted silly, trying to make him laugh, in the same way as he did when i was a child.you made him give me, an almost empty look. and you made him ask me, why are you doing this?i said; "because this is what you thought me dad, you always did this when i was a child."and you replied;"what has been has been."and right there i could feel it. i could feel you. more present then ever before. you stared straight into my eyes. my mind. my heart.monsters.

A Bit Worried About My Mother. Am I Just Being Paranoid?
hey guys,like the title says, i'm kinda concerned about my mom. just to mention off the bat - she's 56, turning 57 in september. i've been noticing a few things over the past several months. for one, she will somewhat frequently forget where she placed her car keys. i'm home from college over the summer, and we go somewhere together maybe twice a week, and up to three or so times a month she will be completely unable to find her car keys for up to ten minutes. this is despite the fact that she has a regular place where she puts them.secondly, she will often initiate the same conversation many times. we talk a lot in the car, and she will start telling me the same things she already has again. by this, i don't mean she's just re-telling me something, or she just happened to forget she told me this one time (i do this myself), but i mean she will repeatedly start talking about the same exact thing upwards of *ten* times within a short time-span, speaking as if she's *literally never had the conversation with me before*. now of course, i can forgive anyone for starting the same conversation two, or maybe even three times spaced apart, but i'm talking the exact same conversation ten or more times, with her thinking she's never told me before, within just a couple months. when i inform her that we've been over it multiple times, she brushes it off and continues. third, she will often change details of her stories. again, she will often start the same conversation multiple times, and occasionally, when she tells me something, she will change a detail. for example, she told me in the car that she had driven around the *outskirts* of new york city, but she **specifically** mentioned she had never actually driven or been right in new york city. then, she started telling me this again a couple weeks later, but *this* time she was saying she *had* driven right into new york, and she was telling me about how crazy the traffic was there. i was confused as hell, because as many people have told me, i have a very good memory for remembering small details in the medium term, and i told her she specifically told me she had never ever driven into, or been in new york. she just said i remembered wrong, but it drove me crazy, because i really strongly remembered that she had never been in new york city proper. then again, soon after, she was telling me about this yet again, and once more, she said she had *never* driven into or been in new york. again, i reminded her that this was the second time that she had changed the story, but she brushed it off again. and of course, soon after yet again, she was telling me this story, and this time, she *had* driven into and been in new york - which has remained the "official" story ever since. is it just me, or do you would think that being in a city like new york multiple times within the past couple decades is something you'd remember, right??now obviously, i could have remembered wrong the second time she told me, but we had this conversation *four* times, and i remembered her telling me something different each time - and i have a decent memory. it's near impossible for me to mishear or misinterpret something four times like that.this is pretty much everything i have been noticing about my mom over the past several months. that and her short term memory is noticeably poor.so do you guys think this might be the early stages of alzheimer's, or am i just being paranoid? i guess the reason i'm so concerned is that my mom had a work friend who passed away from alzheimer's about a year ago, and she was *younger* than my mom - she was in her early fifties, and i guess that kind of 'tuned me in' to alzheimer's.thanks in advance

A few things I have would ask for them
having dealt with others in the same situation, and as i start to experience some of the issues, for your mothers, fathers, loved ones, i would ask this...don't correct me every time i say something wrong.  "-i never liked that jenny girl off from big bang."  "thats penny, dear!".  let's think about this.  so i got it wrong.  do you get what i'm trying to impart? are you keeping me grounded in reality because i have been corrected on a fictional characters name?  most likely i know i messed something up and i will mull it over later. plus she always treated leon like crap!  (you are tempted to correct me, i know you are!)if i'm quiet, it may be because i'm protecting  my pride.  this may be personal to me, but i feel as if my breaks are getting weak.  those thoughts you think but would never say, i say.  my verbal breaks are not as good.  so please forgive if i'm quiet.  it's easier to stop something without any built up momentum.  if you ask me what's on my mind, most likely it's nothing.... and it's a good feeling!give me a place of safety, a place where i can make mistakes.  i'm on guard everywhere else, i want a place i can let my defenses down.  as of right now i'm still capable enough to do a little wood working.  the shop is my place.  i'm used to being a proactive adult making all my own decisions. let me make a few mistakes. give me a place where you won't mother hen me too much.  so i may have to face not being king of the castle, just let me be the duke of the shop.  or den.  or garage. and let's keep it that way, so we won't argue or discuss deep things here, we have the rest of the world for that.understand if i get overly consumed with a hobby or pass time.  i'm dealing with this as best i can and on a 24 hour a day basis, so excuse me if i have a little escape from reality with reading or making something.  folks say that keeping your mind active helps.  and even more important, experts agree that not giving me grief about it is good for your health. if i get mad, it isn't at you.  as i said before, my breaks are slipping. that means emotional breaks.  i may get mad at the circumstance, frustrated by failing often, but not really at you. think about it.  when you are a little kid, you dream of growing up.  you have your first case of puppy love, you learn the freedom that comes with driving.  people start treating you as an adult.  you have a relationship, a love, someone with whom you share your life, the warmth of your bed.  you have kids, they look up at you in awe. your the go to person for fixing things in life.  now, reverse all that.  your kids start looking at you strangely, you are not the person they come to with their problems.  you learn you can't drive and are dependent on others to get out sometimes.  no one else is sleeping with you, no warmth on that cold night.  you forget the love of your life.  we are somewhere on this road map right now, facing the end of the line.so what i am saying is please understand if i get depressed or frustrated now and then. it's not your job to keep me from dealing with it. all i ask you is to understand.  but on the other hand, don't let me take you for granted.  you may occasionally have to lay some rules down.  i don't want beat you down.all comments are welcome. i would like to stimulate some discussion here.

How to help someone with Alzheimers move to a new environment?
i am sad to share my family's story with this subreddit, but perhaps someone here can give some ideas to help my grandpa that we haven't thought of yet. i am doing anything and everything i can think of to ease his transition. tl;dr - my grandfather is transitioning from his life-long home to a va resort (he served in world war ii) in a few weeks. we have introduced the idea to him but he is adamant about not going, even though in his 60s-70s he bragged about going and what a blast it would be. he has been deemed incompetent by 2 different psychologists and all the legal paperwork is in place for him to go. how do we convince him? how do we get him there safely? my grandpa is 91. he has been falling deeper and deeper into alzheimers for several years now. all of his siblings had it, and longevity runs in his family. my grandmother has gone above and beyond her physical, mental and emotional capabilities, along with help from my parents, my aunt and uncle and myself to have him live at home as long as possible. to be brief: his instability (physically and mentally) will end up seriously injuring or killing both of them if we don't intervene soon. so my uncle, my mother and i have met with my grandmother multiple times and have found an appropriate va home for him, and relatively close to all of us (only an hour away). actually, it is a resort. once he gets there, he will love it. the problem is convincing him and physically getting him there. i work in a care giving field - i am the only one in my family with this type of experience. i pushed the issue of grandpa moving out of the house. i have worked in adult family homes (group home) and residential facilities for young people with disabilities. so i get somewhat how these systems work, in that he has a social worker, he has rights, he has protections and all these good supports. i have even offered to be his 'case manager' of sorts. i would be the first person in line to go to bat to defend his rights. i am not as familiar with the va but have talked with some veteran friends about it and am trying to learn more. working in care giving, i also clearly see where he and my grandmothers safety is in jeopardy every day with risks of falls (he falls dead weight and pulls people down with him), periods of delusion, he doesn't know where he is or what he's doing, he thinks he's in a time from the past. we have found firearms hidden away....we thought we had found them all (and they've been confiscated and stored safely). working with people with disabilities, i understand that my grandpa cannot control all his thoughts, or his body, or his temper all the time. i am trying to learn as much about alzheimers as i can. i go between my love of my grandparents, to looking at their life together objectively as a case manager. so in the next few weeks, we will get the call he can enroll in the va home. i don't know how my mother and uncle (his children) are physically going to get him into the car. do we tell him we are going on an outing, then drive to the va resort? do we tell him where we are going and hope he goes? what if he doesn't? do we get some sort of transport assistance? we know this - my grandmother is not going when we initially take him because he will verbally berate her and blame everything on her, she is an easy target and a soft spoken person. he will be angry. he will probably cry. he is one of the most stubborn human beings i have ever met, even before alzheimers set in. i don't want him to be hurt, i am worried he will feel betrayed by all of us. all of us together cannot take care of his medical needs because we are not nurses or doctors. i have talked to my mother and uncle and reminded them that grandpa may be scared, he may forget what we tell him, we have to be very careful how we approach this. they are wracking their brains and are not sure how to be empathetic but also assertive. if anyone has any experience with this, or knows if the va offers transport, or even volunteers who transport....it might help my family to have a 3rd party involved. i thought about calling his social worker but i don't have their name yet, and i don't know if i have permission to share information, i'd probably have to have grandma sign off on that. anyway, i appreciate anyone who even takes time to read this. it has been so very, very hard on my family, but we are doing our best to try and keep everyone safe.

i'm worried about my father and i was wondering whether anyone, in hindsight can remember if someone who turned out to have alzheimers exhibited similar symptoms early on. i live far away from my parents so i only see them once or twice a year, though last year it was a bit more due to the birth of their first grandchild. my dad was always forgetful but it is getting worse: driving to work in slippers is the running joke in the family. he was also susceptible to conspiracy theories etc. but his views have become more extreme and to be honest what prompted this post was a downright rude comment he made to me completely out of the blue. i know that early dementia issues can bring on personality changes that can be aggressive. basically, my mom asked whether i had any movies on my laptop she could watch. he said that she shouldn't watch them because they were ideologically flawed and show lack of discerning and educated thought (i happen to be well educated and very well read, which he should well know, and yes, i do think). basically wtf? presumably he assumed they were a jane austen-esque costume drama… which is certainly something i would watch but is by far not the only thing i would watch and also, what's wrong with something that promotes moderation, politeness, independence in women and a belief in something better (it's ok guys, i totally get why it's not everyone's cup of tea). but this has actually been the undercurrent for the last year at least: i'm poisoning my child by giving him cooked food, women can't drive, popular culture is poison designed to enslave the masses (if he actually stopped to look at me he would know that i'm far from "following" the pop culture), his attitude to homosexuality is worse than victorian (hugely embarrassing and infuriating, and i'm the one that has been brainwashed),racist comments, etc. etc. very extreme views that he actually voices! he always had a superiority complex but it's more pronounced and he is so ill informed on certain absolute opinions he proclaims but nothing will sway him. now he is an intelligent man, he does love his family but there is a profound lack of respect for anything other than his own opinion that was at least not as obvious before, if it was there. so i was wondering whether this lack of inhibition, i suppose, is something that coupled with slowly failing memory could be an early sign of something like alzheimers, or is he just being an arrogant so and so. i need to decide how to handle these comments, if it's an illness, letting them slide is the obvious route. if not, he needs to know that it's no ok to say that to anyone. as my son grows older those are not the attitudes i want him to be around so my dad is shooting himself in the foot if it's a conscious thing. if it looks like early dementia then any tips for handling this stage would be appreciated. thanks for any insights.

Hospice or Geriatric Physician?
i don't know what to do and would like some advice or experiences or...honestly, any help at all would be very welcomed.  sorry for the tl/dr; no matter how much i try to shorten it, this post is still huge.some basic info: me, 55yo, never married, no partner, no kids, no siblings, father and step-father both dead. mom and i live together. 1 aunt, 80yo, lives 5 minutes away but has her own health problems and is available only once in a while. i stopped working in 18 or 19 to take care of mom full time, since she had started calling me in a panic at work to come home, or the tv didn't work, or whatever. i worked at amazon warehouse, for the curious.mom, 87. 1 sister. no friends. nobody but me. mom has had memory/behavioral/dementia-like symptoms since around 2014 or 2015. her doctor has been 100% useless; no matter how many times and in how many ways i'd tell her this is not normal for my mom, she'd say 'it's just normal aging, do puzzles, get exercise".  no matter how much i begged, pleaded, demanded, or cried, mom would not see a different doctor. nor did she like to take pills \*at all\* (except for tranquilizers, those she takes with gusto). so when her doctor took me seriously for once and gave us samples of a dementia drug to try, mom refused to take the pills saying they were too big. fast forward to this year, feb or march. mom had very bad cold symptoms, her sinus stuffed with pain, runny nose (but no fever or cough).  slowly she stops eating. i'm getting worried, trying to give her ensure shakes, anything i can get in her. she's visibly losing weight, so off we go back to her doctor. doc says "it's normal to be losing weight when you don't move around much" and "she probably had covid." she mentioned hospice or visiting nurse.  i said we would think about it.her behavior is deteriorating, she is more confused, she stops putting on her housedress and stays in her nightgown. a call to the dr. about these things leads to another mention of hospice. dr. sends a prescription, i get the calls and make an appointment in a few days. surprise! mom starts to eat again. i cancelled the hospice.next time i call the dr., it's because mom is coming upstairs, waking me up 3-4 times a night saying she can't sleep. dr says she cannot prescribe things like benzos or anything to help her sleep  because of the fall risk associated with it and hospice is the way to go since she's lost about 8 pounds in 1 month. again, i engage with hospice. they come for a month. the nurse is very nice although i don't know if she has much experience with dementia patients because she seemed flummoxed for medication and wanted to give her ambien. i kind of hedged about it and mentioned trazodone (mentioned by several frends of mine with family in the same situation). between her, me, and the pharmacy, we get info, plus we discuss tramadol. we work out something with both meds that helps some. the whole time though, mom 100000% hates anyone coming to the house. the nurse came once a week but mom refused anyone else, especially the hha. again, my begging, pleading, yelling, and crying have no effect. i took her off hospice after a month because the stress of struggling with her all the time was killing me.  her doctor insists on seeing mom every 3 months because she's now on xanax (prn), trazodone (1 qhs), and tramadol (1 if she wakes up at night), and the last time we saw the dr she was adamant that she really should not be prescribing these things because they're hospice meds. she tried to give mom a talking to about letting hospice in to take care of her, and it kind of turned into a frustrated shouting match between me and the dr taking turns yelling at each other and mom. it was kind of a clusterfuck tbh.the last week or so i believe she is becoming incontinent. her confusion, especially in the morning, is getting worse and i'm starting to worry again. sometimes she doesn't know how to go to the bathroom or where it is..sometimes she's ok. a lot of the time i have to sit with her at night until she falls asleep. she's becoming childlike especially at night. the bathroom and sleep seem to be her biggest stressors.  after discussing with her several times (mom forgets everything in about 30 seconds) she finally agreed to see my doctor, who takes her time, is very thorough, and whom i love.surprise! a letter came in the mail saturday that my doctor is no longer practicing here and has 'moved on' to another position. fml.so! after all that huge post, here is my question:\- do i engage with dr. ugh and try to get mom back on hospice? she is steady at 108lbs right now, same as when hospice left, so i don't know if it's useless to even bother since she hasn't lost any more weight. the hospice website does say a reason for them to approve is "needs assistance with some activities of daily living: (eating, bathing, getting dressed, walking, getting out of bed)", mom refuses to wash or bathe and never gets dressed, but she had these problems before, too, and the nurse said weight loss had to be the reason for hospice.\-or-\- do i call a doctor who specializes in geriatrics, see if i can get an appointment some time this year, then if i do, exhaust the both of us to try to get her dressed and out of the house, to maybe find something to help her ( and me) sleep, and try and get her calm and more stable mentally? i'm alone, i don't know what to do. i asked my cousin who is a sensible sort and she said she'd take mom to my doctor. now that my doctor's no longer in the picture...is it wise to take her to a stranger neither me nor mom have been to before? any advice is greatly appreciated 🙏  i'm at my wit's end.

This disease sucks!!
i came here a while ago. my (48f)mom (73)had a seizure 11/21. moved to rehab 12/21. we've gotten to a point where she doesn't understand what you tell her and her words are all over the place. hallucinations. she walks all day. like from 6am-4-5pm. she's never been officially diagnosed but last year they said it was alcohol induced dementia. she saw a neurologist that sent her for labs that found syphilis (no idea where that came from or why he tested her for it) but nothing since. rehab sucked. she was too active for them so they found her an independent living place after determining she was fine to live on her own. well 3 weeks after, she walked away. 4hrs and 15 blocks, police and all that we found her safe. 2 weeks later, she did it again so of course they decided she couldn't stay. so back home with me she came. i'm currently on fmla although i still work from home a few hours a day and she drives me absolutely crazy while doing so. i'm a scheduler so as i'm asking patients questions, she's answering or just staring at me. she was originally only prescribed celexa for the depression and in hopes of slowing her down. no luck there. she takes 3 trazadone at bed and sometimes she'd still be up late or early the next morning just wandering the house. she was prescribed seroquel after i made a plea to the neurologist because i couldn't take it. she's now at half at midday and a whole at night. she's like a baby that fights their sleep. at one point, she was peeing in the corner of her room although there's a portable commode right across from her bed. she changes shoes multiple times a day and most times ends up with 2 different shoes on. i've had to collect shoes just to keep her safe because shoes were everywhere. she hadn't showered in who knows how long but i finally got her in a few weeks ago. normally she just tells me she did already or she washed up and i just don't have the energy to add to my stress. she has no health issues but constant pain that the drs attribute to alcohol withdrawal. she's literally like a zombie but will not sit still unless i sit right next to her. i'm in group therapy, individual therapy, support groups but none of their suggestions really help. i find myself so frustrated with her but i know it's not her. we've always been close but this has taken that away. she even forgot my birthday. that was probably the worse day of this whole ordeal. it's just me. my brother has always held resentment for my mom and frequently goes no contact. he visited her in the hospital and that's been it. he told me he had to work a lot of overtime so he's just tired. that was 7 months ago. now his children and his girlfriend have decided to follow his foolishness so i'm all that's left.if i've learned nothing, it's to definitely plan for your future because had my mom made better choices, her situation would be better. no retirement, no savings, nothing but 1k a month. thankfully we'd moved her in with us 5yrs ago because there was no way she could afford anything on her own. oh, my stepfather lives in our in-law unit, he's an alcoholic and has dementia as well as probably some other mental issue that's never been diagnosed. my mom is 16yrs older and basically took care of him. if we don't fix his plate, he won't eat. he's not working after multiple strokes and vertigo and now dementia. double the fun. next week i guess i'll start the process for her to get on the medi-cal approved waiting list for the one memory care facility in our area. obviously just for shits and giggles because she'll probably die before she gets in. or i will.sorry, just needed to get this out.hugs to all of you going through this 🤗

I am very worried about my landlord's cognitive ability
my landlord, a woman in her mid-50s, seems to be experiencing cognitive decline. before may she was in turkey and rented all bedrooms out and i had more than one roommate as a result. one of them was a surgeon, who frequently complained to me that the landlord always forgot what she said previously and changed her opinions day by day. the surgeon eventually found another place and moved out. initially, i didn't take this seriously and thought it was just a breakdown of the landlord-tenant relationship. after my landlord came back to england in may, there were only two lodgers on the property (she lives in the house since then), her daughter and me. i've observed several weird things about her:1. she seems to be almost tech-illiterate. i have been her free tech support since she came back, so often that it's making me annoyed. however, the family is full of apple users and all but one device are apple products, which is a tv set. as someone who has been using windows pcs and android smart devices all the time, i'll say they have the largest number of apple device collections in a private setting i have ever seen. this includes a good old macbook a1342 that fell into abandonment because its white plastic case is broken. my landlord also has a master's degree from a bangladeshi university (she is of bangladeshi ancestry) and furthered her studies in the uk as well, although all of these events happened more than twenty years ago. i think it is almost impossible for a person with such a background to be tech-illiterate.2. an even stranger thing is a few weeks ago, she asked me how many is 20% of a number in thousands (6920? i can't remember the exact number but it must have been an integer of 4 digits). 3. she claimed that several things have been lost from her house and suspected the first tenant (the surgeon i mentioned above) stole them. yet, i don't even know which things she was talking about.4. when a new potential lodger asked her for information about the location, she could answer basic questions like the way to the nearby supermarket and how long it takes to walk there from home, so she asked me to answer these questions on her behalf. i said, "i thought you should know this better than me because this is your house." 5. she wore her top inside out at home twice since june and seemed never have noticed until i told her.6. she asked me to pay the rent in advance, usually a few days before the day i should do so. this happened twice and she said she had run out of money and needed my money quickly. i have no idea if this is true or not. 7. the largest red flag happened last night. i just fired my employer (not related, but you can see me complaining about chaotic management in the company in another post on a different subreddit) and was letting my cvs fly everywhere on recruitment websites for a whole day in my bedroom, with the door closed all the time. when i opened the door to get food to eat from the fridge, i smelt gas. i rushed to the kitchen and told my landlord about the dangerous odour, and discovered that she didn't turn off one of the four stoves after cooking! i've lived with old people for some time (my own parents, who had me in their 40s) and i know what is normal and what is not. my mother, who will turn 66 in november, never has these things. she does occasionally have trouble finding the right word and finds it more difficult to concentrate compared to when she still had her periods. once she walked out of a department store and got one step in the wrong direction to home and said "damned i got the wrong way" and it only happened once. recently, she told me through the video chat that my father (who will celebrate his 70th birthday next month) was misplacing the vegetables he bought a moment ago! my mother's trouble is obviously just getting old. the things happening to my landlord is certainly not, and they are coming too early. i don't know if i should talk to her daughter about these abnormal signs and ask her to see her gp? because i am not a family member, perhaps someone who is will be better for this task.

Dad constantly repeats the same things…
my dad will be 71 later this month and he was officially diagnosed with dementia mid last year. his neurologist believes it was due to a silent stroke that happened at some point based on his mri and ct scans. he retired early last year and that’s when my mom and i noticed the signs. he was forgetting things and became more anxious. he worked as a deputy building inspector and architect. his job required him to renew his licenses which entailed studying for tests and memorizing codes. we just can’t believe that a man who used his mind so much now can’t remember if went on his morning walk or not. anytime something out of his usual routine happens, he becomes paranoid. for example, before we officially knew he had dementia he got a traffic ticket. he was so scared that he would be thrown in jail. we tried explaining that it was just a stop sign ticket and we would pay it and nothing will happen. he wouldn’t let it go. finally once the ticket was posted online and i showed him the receipt and he calmed down. for the past several months he’s been calling his old coworker over 10 times a day. he forgets he called so he calls over and over again and brings up things that they talked about years ago thinking it’s recent. my mom reached out to his friend and the friend said he realized there was something happening with his memory and he doesn’t have the heart to block his number. another event happened a few weeks ago when a construction worker he worked with at a job site called to ask my dad for advice regarding some licenses he tested for and what my dad would suggest he do next job wise. after the call, my dad kept asking us why he called and he was afraid he called because maybe he did something wrong at work. he’s been asking this question non-stop for several weeks now. i just don’t know what to do. my mom is trying her best, but she’s human and she can only take so much. i’m 3 months pregnant after going through ivf treatments and a hell of a year so we’re just feeling defeated. any advice would he appreciated.

Lying to a person with Dementia
&amp;#x200b;dementia symptoms are caused by brain damage caused by disease or injury. it becomes more difficult or impossible to store new memories or access old ones as brain cells die. dementia can strike suddenly after a stroke or a head injury. it frequently manifests slowly as a result of conditions such as alzheimer's or parkinson's disease. the majority of dementia causes are irreversible. there are many times when people with dementia experience paranoia in their daily lives. this could be about their residence, possession of their belongings, or recognition of their loved ones. in those moments of doubt and confusion, the primary caregiver's first response is usually to tell them the whole truth.**lying to a person with dementia: whole truths and lies** offering people with dementia the whole truth can be a terrifying experience for them. a loving act that awakens them to their condition and surroundings can frequently result in sudden shock, trauma, and helplessness. in such cases, many people choose to lie and pretend that there is no difference in the person's behavior in their daily life.**caregiver response** a critical element of caring for someone with dementia is communication when they experience a different reality from their families, particularly as the condition progresses with their age. this turns out to be one of the most challenging phases of the state and can be particularly difficult to manage by the primary caregiver. take, for instance, a situation when someone living with dementia forgets the loss of their loved one and repeatedly brings their name up with an urge to meet them.  in this situation, a primary caregiver can either tell them the whole truth-"*the person has sadly passed*." or lie and distract them from this particular person ", *the person is busy right now*". in both these cases, the primary caregiver puts themselves and the loved one in a precarious position which affects the health and wellbeing of both. it is also essential to understand that regardless of their cognitive condition, people with dementia are functioning and capable humans; knowing their life story, state of mind, and needs are equally important before choosing to lie or being honest with them. in the process of caring for people with dementia, primary caregivers often make sense of these instances and adapt to the best of their potential.**is lying okay?**however, they forget about people close to the one suffering who may or may not have responded to their shift in time, their unfounded suspicions, and general paranoia during this process. while these differences in approach become apparent over time, most people choose to stay on the caregiver spectrum, which progresses from 'whole-truth telling' to 'looking for alternative meaning,' 'distracting,' 'going along with,' and finally 'lying.'one argument against lying is that it endangers freedom by distorting your loved ones' ability to make decisions. it is critical to remember that decision-making becomes more difficult with age.**note to caregivers**while there is no one-size-fits-all model for caregiver response, there are a few things to keep in mind when dealing with someone who has dementia.* take some time to reflect on the significance of the loved one's reality.* take a flexible, empathetic, and tailored approach to telling the truth.* avoid environmental deception.* keep track of responses that work well with the person and share them with others who are close to them.it is natural to feel overwhelmed when faced with the choice between lies and truth. it is recommended that you consult with a trained mental health professional in order to help your loved one and yourself understand and adjust to living with the condition in the future.

New to this
hi all. i care deeply for someone who i believe may have dementia. his doctor doesn't take it serious. at first, it was silly little things that could be explained. he wouldn't wash all the soap off of the dish before putting it away. then he would argue about it or "oh i didn't clean that dish" and deny it even though i just saw him. then it got worse. he would leave the door unlocked, left his keys in the door as well. he will wander and say he's just taking his time. he can't remember where he went, why he went there, or which way he came from. often, he goes to the store and forgets why. sometimes he doesn't even make it to the store. he stands there with his eyes closed and sways side to side. has anyone else experienced this?? it scares me so much. i know self care is important when caring for people with dementia, but i don't know how to relax when every thought is about keeping him safe. his kids are not in the picture, so there no help there. his family doesn't care either. i tried reaching out to both. his landlord keeps trying to force him to sign a lease for an illegal apartment that he currently lives in. they come by and harass us almost every day. all the stress is getting to me and i'm so sick that i really do need to go to the doctor. that's who this person was for me. my everything. he took me to the doctors, kept me safe, made sure nobody hurt me. i'm trying to do the same. i love this person, and its hurting me to see him like this. i don't really know what i wrote this post for. i just need advice on what to do i guess. but i really appreciate that this place exists. i don't have family or friends to lean on. my 2 dependents rely on me and i rely on him. i'm so scared of us being separated. he always told me he was afraid of being put in a home. i don't want to hurt him. i don't want to be away from him. we are so close that we both get sick when the other does. we can literally be in different places and still get sick at the same time. that's how we know when to call one another. he's been there for me since my father died. he kept us fed, clothed and roof over our head. i cant just leave him like this. i know there has to be a cure or something to at least make it slow down. i'm losing my best friend and its killing me. he's the only adult figure i have in my life. the only person i trust. i'm scared the person i love doesn't exist anymore, and that this is the rest of our life. i don't know whether to try to talk to him about dementia when he's constant because i don't wanna make him go loopy again. i know this is a lot of rambling but thank you for letting me post. knowing this place exists makes me feel the tiniest bit less alone. i just can't stop crying. i don't wanna lose him.

My Grandmother's Dementia
i hope this is welcome here. the truth is, even though i'm an adult i don't think there's much i can do about my grandmother's dementia. i live on the other side of the country and have no legal sway. but after i've told the story, if anyone has any advice on how i could sway my aunt or mom, i'd love it. sorry, in advance, for the wall of text.i've known my grandmother had dementia for at least 3 years. my mom only *finally* admitted it a couple months ago. my mom has had it in her head that her mom *couldn't* get dementia because "it doesn't run in the family" and that it also meant that *she* couldn't get dementia, and all the advice i was giving about dementia protective actions were unnecessary (i'm a therapist and worked in a psychiatric hospital that, among other things, ran groups for seniors and i've always felt like it was better to "plan for the worst" about this kind of thing). well, my grandmother won't accept in home care unless she doesn't have to pay for it and they don't make her change anything about her life, she's verbally and (i assume) physically abusive to my aunt, who lives close, frequently gives away or looses things and then forgets and believes she's been robbed, ended up in the hospital because she couldn't remember what day it was and took too much medication, can't keep track of how long ago letters were sent or received, becomes extremely angry or extremely distressed to the point it bothers the neighbors or she's calling my aunt in the middle of the night wanting to die, and, most recently, forgot the squirrel she's been insisting on feeding for the last year or so. she no longer cooks except in the microwave, is basically blind, doesn't leave her home because she gets so confused and frightened, but is so mean? angry? paranoid? narcissistic? that she won't let any of her kids move in with her to help and won't move willingly?she's 89 and has always been a nasty abusive angry person. she apparently never wanted to have children but, as part of a religion where that wasn't an option as a woman, she had 5. my mom and aunt admit that she clearly is not able to take care of herself but they both say "she doesn't want to move!" when i point out that she needs a nursing home. she lives in a house that, with this market, is worth close to half a million dollars as is, and could pay for her care for years. my aunt would have to make an appointment with my grandmother's doctor and see him when she wasn't present because every time she's tried to talk to the doctor about the issues when my grandmother is present she just starts screaming that she's a liar and storms out. the doctor has noticed the decline and most recently suggested a transition to a nursing home, which my grandmother dismissed, so i think that might be a good route. my aunt says it's too stressful (she had a heart attack about 10 months ago, which she contributed to being the primary caretaker for her mother).my mother has said recently that she wishes her mother would give covid and die as that would be easier than trying to get/make her to go to a nursing home. my sister and i were quite shocked at this statement. i genuinely don't understand how my mom and aunt still see their mother as some kind of vengeful god who they can't contradict or go against lest they face *the consequences*. they've also voiced fears that the nursing home staff would "find out what mom is really like" and that she might hit the staff or refuse to take visitors and then the staff would have to deal with her all on their own. i can only assume this comes from a lifetime of feeling like they had to hide my grandmother's behavior, but it's now a harm to them *and* her. my biggest concern, i guess, is that my grandmother will end up taking measures to end her own life the way her ex-husband, my grandfather did. that seems like such a terrible miserable way to go, even for a terrible miserable person. and, i think my uncle is going to swoop in and try to claim ownership of the house, or claim that he deserves most of the profit from selling it, if it's not used for my grandmother, and he's so aggressive that my mom and aunt might just let him do it so as to "not make things worse."

Mom won't stay seated, can't get a diagnosis
my sisters and i are at a loss. after multiple falls and fractures, my mother cannot stand safely on her own, let alone walk, even with a walker. she and my stepfather moved to a nice assisted living place. she just presses a button on a pendant and someone is there, usually within five minutes. however, she doesn't remember that she can't stand or walk. she's strong enough to get up enough to fall. we remind her. she argues, says she gets up on her own all of the time. we insist she request help. she says her husband can help. he can't, and he reminds her. the same fight, several times a day.we put up signs. she doesn't understand them. she has gotten up from the toilet several times, only to fall, because she forgot to call out to the person standing just outside the door. she eventually capitulates when we remind her, but my stepfather is exhausted. he has a part-time job he can work from home, but she needs constant monitoring. he's going to lose it. we're working on getting respite care for him, but he needs to get out on a regular basis. we are helping them with the assisted living costs, but we can't afford to pay someone to babysit her for 20 hours a week. we are exploring adult daycare, but we don't have affordable transportation, even if we could get her there and afford it. other than this, my mother is mostly pleasant for now. the assisting living staff love her; she's incredibly charming. the meltdowns are increasing, but they're still infrequent. does anyone have ideas? separately, after a two-hour meeting, the neurologist is continuing with a diagnosis of "mild cognitive decline", at least until she has another cpt and neuropsychological profile, which won't happen until november. he didn't prescribe any memory drugs; one of them helped her mother. i don't know if this is normal or if we should push. this was his first meeting with her.

My grandma has gotten progressively worse over the last year
late last year, my family made the decision that my grandma would move in with me, my mom and my dad. when my grandpa died, my mom made a promise to him that my grandma would never end up in an assisted living facility. in some way, i don't blame my grandpa; they don't have a sparkling reputation, especially in my area, but i acknowledge the benefit of having a schedule, and for the most part, caretakers that have to pass some sort of background check and competency check to care for the patients. our biggest concern, as a family, was my grandma's safety. she is still pretty feisty at 82, quick on her feet, and she's the type of patient that would very easily slip through the doors because she's so mobile. but, as this subreddit suggests, her cognitive abilities are not where they need to be in order to live independently. there is some resentment from that. my grandma lived on her own for 20 years before ever having to have someone help care for her. the foods she likes are bad for her. i try to practice moderation with her, and she mostly responds to it well, but we have our moments of disagreement. she isn't able to spend money as freely as she used to because her poa (her son) has enforced spending limits on her account. we have to reason with her if we're out shopping because of her hoarding tendencies. my aunt took her out last week and she bought four comforters. my aunt did not stop my grandma for some reason -- i was able to take them back to the store without my grandma even noticing (*thankfully*). perhaps the most troubling thing is my grandma's growing verbal abuse. it's been directed at me a handful of times. i have worked with the elderly before and know that it's an unfortunate side effect of the disease, and it's mostly born out of fear and anxiety. my mom is a sweet woman who, in all honesty, is not prepared for the scale of things to come. my grandma will openly berate her and talk down to her. i have had to step in and remind my grandma the things she saying are hurtful; i'm often met with a blank stare. the subject quickly changes, and it's forgotten about by her. earlier tonight, my grandma told my uncle she would "knock \[his\] teeth down his throat" because she didn't like him swearing. he is an easygoing guy and didn't take her threat seriously, but knowing the loss of inhibition that comes along with the disease, i have to wonder if these threats will materialize sooner rather than later. i am sacrificing a lot to help my parents - my mom especially - to navigate through my grandma's diagnosis. i have sat down with her and tried to explain to her what the next few years will entail, and my mom doesn't seem to understand. i might as well be talking to a brick wall. she is taking things personally and internalizing it all. i'm worried for both my grandma and my mom, and i'm concerned my mom's mental health will suffer greatly as a result. at the same time, my mom would never have a peaceful night's sleep knowing my grandma was in an assisted living facility. i have a background in healthcare and i'm in pursuit of a nursing degree, but any helpful advice, especially anything i can share with my mom, is welcome.

Is this dementia and what kind is most likely.
hello.i need help/advice as i experience something odd and have a hard time managing it.my mother experience rapid cognitive and motor decline. she is not diagnosed with dementia, but i'm pretty sure that is the case. two months ago she used to be well. even taking care of grandkids. some forgetness and lack of motivation, not cleaning the house, not switching appliances off and letting the fridge open over the last year.however, 1 month ago she became less talkative. she fainted on street and went to emergency. nothing showed on cat scan and bloodwork. she is different since. hand and feet movements became very very slow without tremors. experienced neurologist checked her and attributed the condition to her age - 72. however this doesn't explain the decline happening over 2 monts. currently, she is unable to get out of bed or walk over a feet away. she sleeps all day long. no facial expressions. difficulty chewing, but swallowing looks good. she's only capable of eating ice cream.question is if this is dementia? what kind is it? what stage is the one i describe?been reading lots lately. no page suggest dementia developing over such short time. some pages suggest lowy body as cognitive issues preceded motor issues with 1 year. but 90 percent of patients experience hallucinations which she doesn't.case in short. 1 year of mild cognitive issues. 2 months ago, worsening of cognition. 1 month ago - fainting. appearance of motor issues. worsening of the conditions to the point of needing permanent nursing.

so. i am a post-graduate student in a university town in the uk, and in order to save money, a year ago, i moved in to lodge with a lady with dementia we'll call sylvia. she is still relatively young, under 70, but unfortunately got dealt the shit hand of developing a slowly advancing front-temporal dementia about five years ago. in exchange for cheap rent, i help her out a bit, make sure she's eating and share my cooking, keep her some company, take care of her cat, and make sure she doesn't blow up the house with the gas-cooker etc. etc. etc. she also gets carers to come in during the day when i'm usually away. the living situation isn't completely without it's stresses - but neither without it's joys, and i'm quite attached to sylvia by now.every dementia patient is different. in many ways sylvia is lucky.physically sylvia is in excellent shape and doesn't even need to take any medication. gets around the house and likes to make endless cups of coffee and eat ridiculous amounts of jam toast. she is usually always in a good mood (can get irritated tho if she feels she's being "babied" or "restricted" too much), not paranoid or scared. no clear delusions/hallucinations. has never forgotten who somebody is. surprisingly well-working memory still in some contexts, even short-term; like, she remembered what my friend who visited 6 months ago was wearing when i myself would have absolutely no chance of remembering that??? you can let her be by herself for fairly long stretches of time still without worrying she'll do something dangerous to herself or others. doesn't need help with personal hygiene or eating. really enjoys people. she still goes by herself to shop for treats in a local sainsbury's. in general, i feel like she has a pretty good quality of life, and has no major obstacles that would stop her from enjoying it to the fullest. however, she is a dementia patient, and this comes obvious pretty quickly when you talk to her. her speech is the main thing that has suffered; some days you can actually get fairly normal and lucid conversations out of her. but, lot of the time she mixes words and names, comes up with just weird warbled/blurred versions ("shitchven" for "kitchen"), has to pause to search for words. often it's not quite clear if she understands what you say to her, because she will reply with something completely unrelated. but, with some patience, you can still communicate with her and even have whole conversations.sylvia also does just odd, odd things; like, tries to feed her cat jam toast or cereal. would only eat endless sugary treats if somebody didn't put proper meals in front of her. puts on incredibly strange outfits; different paired shoes, two skirts over a pair of trousers. doesn't really have understanding of social cues and "normality"; like, will get overtly excited to chat to strangers on the street. can't really comprehend any conceptions of time anymore. can't use gadgets like phone or microwave. she gets weirdly obsessed or fixated about one item for long periods of time. doesn't quite have a grasp of reality on some things; like, her son mentioned they should take a trip to france in the future, and she spent the next three months packing for france and saying she needs to go heathrow soon and just couldn't take it in that the trip wasn't actually happening anytime soon.  so, overall, when you first meet sylvia she comes across as bat-shit crazy to be honest, and you wouldn't be able to tell that she is still coping with many things independently pretty well. she loves to take walks and will go for short 15-30 min walks now that the weather is good. she's never had any trouble finding home or been confused where she is; her memory simply isn't affected like that by the disease, so far at least.  *but*. recently, we've had a lot of run-ins with the police and complaining neighbours. because, you know, she looks like a dementia patient. for example, in one week, the police brought her home twice, because she was out for a walk wearing a dressing gown (over her normal clothes - not just the dressing gown!) and people got worried and called the police. and i get it, you know? i appreciate people are worried and care for fellow citizens. if i saw someone like sylvia on the street, who spoke like sylvia does, i'd probably call the police as well to make sure she isn't a dementia patient on the run. but what i do not get is how quickly these strangers feel like they need to start lecturing me (or her sons) about dementia and telling me how she should be cared for. the second time the police got incredibly angry with me and started questioning why she doesn't have someone watching her 24/7. she wasn't harming anyone - only wearing a dressing gown on the street outside her home? the police just wouldn't accept that she is perfectly safe taking a 15 minute walk outside, and that she's never had any problem finding home. "yes but dementia patients often forget where they are and might walk miles and miles and get lost....." "it's a progressing disease, you never know when she might hurt herself..." "she should be in a home if you can't watch her all the time..."we've also had lots of well-meaning emails from neighbours in the community, worried because sylvia is seen outside in her weird outfits. "why is she out by herself?". most of these people are quite happy once they hear there are people who care and are keeping and eye on sylvia. but lots of them don't. e.g. one of sylvia's "friends", who lives just down the street, ran into sylvia in the street for the first time in a long time. she was just shocked how sylvia isn't watched all the time. now she's launched a campaign of battering me and her sons with emails how "worried" she is about sylvia and how we are not taking her disease seriously, she needs more carers, she needs to be in a home. strange how all this worry and care, and deep understanding of sylvia's needs, suddenly rose up during a 15 minute run-in, as she hasn't visited sylvia even once during the whole year i've lived here...i know dementia. i specifically know sylvia's dementia in great detail. i've lived with her for a year. i deal with the painful risks vs. benefits balances of looking after a dementia patient all the time. and we've agreed that so far, we don't feel like there's any great need to worry for her safety when she goes for her short walks or grocery trips by herself. she benefits from the exercise. she benefits from the sense of some freedom and independence. the only other alternative would be to move her into a care home - which isn't necessarily the "safer" option. she might just get really depressed outside of her own home. the care and food in the home that she can afford might be abysmal. lots of dementia patients deteriorate very quickly when you move them out of home. i mean we *could* lock her up now because of the fear that any day could be the first day when she won't be able to find her way back home - but is that sort of 100% security really worth losing all the things that still make her life still worth living? we think about these sort of things all the time! i just feel like... underneath all this well-meaning neighbourly worry about a dementia patient, is actually just fear of getting older, and being different and unwell. people just don't *want* to see a person in a dressing gown on their street, because it makes them uncomfortable to have to see that dementia exists and what old age does to people. they want them out of their sight, out of their mind. people want to feel like *they're* the good person who *truly* care, when they step in and tell us what sylvia needs after a 15-minute conversation with her - instead of, you know, actually trying to listen to us who know her and who've spent a lot time thinking what she needs to make the illness tolerable and to advance as slowly as possible. isn't there an alternative world where we try to deal with dementia as a community? everyone tolerates and accepts that you know, sylvia sometimes wears a dressing gown outside, because she has dementia. let's be happy that the exercise helps her and the walks make her happy. maybe, instead of trying to pressure us to get her out of your sight, you could e.g. promise to keep an eye out and let us know if she's doing something truly concerning and out-of-norm (for *her*). is this a really crazy dream?***sorry, this turned out to be rather long rant, maybe just needed to vent. don't know if i'm looking for advice, or similar experiences, or what. but sometimes feels good to just rant a bit!

Is this what its like to be the parent to a mentally disabled child
ive basically just finished removing the final potential danger issues from the house, man apparently also i just finished forgetting how to talk too. today i found my grandad what i can only describe as trying to shank our table, i just kinda stood there and watched him try and yea stab a table. it was only a cutlery knife and well even the actual 'sharp' knives are incredibly blunt anyway. he perfectly fine, cant really say the same for the table though, that now needs a bit of revarnishing. now anything with a pointy end has been hidden, 90% of them are just shoved in storage, the rest however are in measuring cups in a cupboard which is obviously the most logical place to store knives. the kettle base is in a mixing bowl on top of a fridge. and the toaster in the front room. i just live this strange life of everything being in the strangest of places, if anyone ever comes over its like how am i meant to explain we store our tea bags behind a microwave without sounding insane.   my cousin is heavily autistic, not like youd notice something was a bit different in a conversation level but stuck in nappies until the age of \~7 level. ive always kinda had a hard time actually imagining what it would be like to look after someone like that, i mean obviously theyre different but it kinda feels like it might be similar. just having to keep a constant eye on him and never fully able to trust him alone, like he can do things i just dont quite trust him to actually do them without making a mess or hurting himself. honestly if i had to compare it to someone itd be more like parenting a schizophrenic even if that doenst really manifest early on. idk its just he talks a lot about how hes in a random building that isnt home, no matter how much you tell him the exact address of where he is and get him to look around the room he still just doesnt believe its actually home. as well as he does tend to kinda talk to himself, though i think thats more of a legally blind issue than a dementia issue but he has talked about seeing people that just do not exist stuff like that. idk its hard for me to understand exactly how his mind works thankfully, i just cant fathom what that mental state is like.   its just that like having to think about the strangest things, before this i would never have thought of a toaster as a potential hazard. same for a microwave, i had no clue you could even burn something in a microwave until he managed to turn two slices of dry bread into literal charcoal.  its such a strange concept that me, a 22 year old single gay guy, is going around childproofing the house just not something i ever expected to have to do honestly   like i just feel like a parent or teacher. idk who said it but its like that thing about an inverse anger curve where you get super annoyed at small things then just not at all at much more serious things.   like today he just pissed all over the kitchen sink and the cabinet doors under it, i just dont care about him doing it im just more annoyed that he just didnt say anything. its like yea ok youve done it just at least tell me so i can clean it up before it dries and starts to stink, especially the stuff inside the actual sink itself. it doesnt really bother me too much when he just starts trying to 'organise' the house and makes an utter mess but him putting dirty dishes in the drainage rack is incredibly annoying. same for his uh 'wandering' it just doesnt bother me but man him calling for me randomly to tell me some nonsensical shit while im trying to do something is possibly the most infuriating thing second only to asking for a cup of tea after ive bought their breakfast or dinner in   idk what the point of this post is honestly i mean ive got spiders to feed and water as well as an aquarium to clean and its already 11pm so yea

I yelled at my demented one last night
our "good" cat died a few months ago, the remaining cat is cranky (only wants to be petted on her own terms) and mother-in-law pets cranky cat with no regard for the swishing tail or laid-back ears that signal that the cat is on the verge of striking out. anyway, mother-in-law enjoyed sitting with and petting the late, lamented, good cat, so we got a 3 year old cat and a kitten (not related to the cat; they came from the same rescue but didn't know each other).  the new cats need to stay inside the house, especially the kitten. mother-in-law keeps opening the doors to let them out, even when one of us is saying "no, don't let the cat out. don't open the door. close the door." she has always done this; we also have a dog who knows that she isn't allowed to go out the front door off leash, so when mother-in-law opens the front door and says "good puppy, go outside" the dog backs away and looks at us like wtf.   it's been an adventure.so last night, after dinner (during which she tried to clear my husbands plate while he was still eating, then picked up his food, took a bite, then tried to wrap the rest up in a napkin) i spent a fun 45 minutes cleaning out the litter boxes.  my husband was hiding (only fair, her deals with her all week) and i had to redirect her away from the mess a few times.  when i was done, i took the trash bag outside, leaving by the front door.  going out and coming back in probably took all of 20 seconds. when i came back in, she was standing at the open back door, holding the handle, and the kitten was outside, trying to get back in, and she was saying "good kitty."  i ran to her and told her we don't let the cats outside. she stood there, blocking me, closing the door on the kitten's neck, and said "i didn't do that. i don't let them outside." i lost it. i yelled at her that she was doing it right now, and that we have begged her not to open the door to let the cats out.  i had to physically move her out of the way so i could get the kitten and close the door. my husband came out and led her away.  she told him i was crazy.she forgot about it in less than 5 minutes.\* my chest hurt all night.  i apologized to her (she had no idea what i was talking about) and apologized to my husband.  i still feel shitty about it today.i swear i hope someone puts me out of my misery if i get like this.  she seems happy enough most of the time, but i know the old her would be embarrassed and disgusted by the way she is now. i can't stand the thought of continuing to live after i'm no longer me.* \*she probably forgot about it as it was happening. after all, she forgot she was opening the door while she was opening the door.

How spirituality destroyed my life and gave me dementia in 33 years
how spirituality destroyed my life and gave me dementia in 33 years i am doing this for you because i love you and because i want you to live life as i wanted to live it. before i die, i have to try to leave something behind as a warning and advice for people in similar situations. this won’t be a text that is well written because my cognitive abilities are drastically reduced as well as my vocabulary after 3 months of rapid dementia.but i want you to try to understand my point and the urgency of my insights that may save somebodies life.i am not a doctor and i can only speak from my own experience about the severe trauma i was living with. it completely controlled my life without me even realizing it. i will share with you how i analyzed the behavior of my mental illness and how it manifested itself in my mind and body.insanity and trauma are the most cunning things in the world. it is not a joke and should never be underestimated. apart from physical disability or illness that is honest and straightforward insanity is not as clear and it operates by deceiving the mind and leading it to destruction.if you are lazy beyond the norm and refuse to work, if you refuse to educate yourself and think success is not for you, you might be traumatized. if you think you are spiritual and have spiritual ‘’symptoms’’ that are not aligned with life and living, by being constantly exhausted, depressed brain fogged, you might be experienced anything but spirituality, but a manifestation of trauma symptoms. as malicious and occult as it may sound trauma can present itself as a living entity that is sucking the life force from you, leading you ultimately to your demise. insanity as i was living with it, completely gripped the essence of my thought process and kept me in delusion for 15 years. i not only believed the thoughts i was having but was convinced beyond any doubt, with body, mind and soul that there has to be truth to them. my emotions, my intuition, even my heart was driven and aligned with the schizophrenic doctrine my mind created due to childhood trauma. as you can see unfortunately this means that when somebody is insane the whole psycho physical, mind and body can serve to deceive a person. its more than the typical hallucinations, hearing voices, and having conspiracy theories that we see in movies that make somebody insane. a person can be partly insane and be completely convinced they are normal, just following a higher path that nobody understands, just like i thought i was. if the thoughts do not support life and living normally then a person should try to question if there is truth to them. there is nothing wrong with being normal and ordinary and earning an honest living. loving life and being grateful for what it is and not searching for some fantastical worlds that don’t exist. i never realized what enlightenment is and i don’t care about it at all. all i wish for is a healthy brain but that won’t come now. i would have lived so much differently.my ideology was belief that there is no such thing as work or human will, that those things are illusions and that they are ultimately not important for realizing the truth about the world. i was aspiring to be a homeless bum, living as a fool for christ in divine truth and bliss. i believed in the force of undoing or unworking and that it is like a black whole that devours everything and extinguishes everything, and ultimately when we experience this black nothingness, we see truth. i had many instances where i did work and tried to persist in my endeavors but believing i was spiritual undervalued my efforts, and the very meaning of work and success. voices told me that work and knowledge are not important and that i was beyond them. that i don’t need it to be happy and enlightened. so, i was willingly retarding myself and regressing unconsciously while thinking this is a good thing. after dementia arouse and started desecrating my brain, this illusion collapsed and i realized that such thoughts came because of an extreme sense of worthlessness. which i was living with and considered normal. when a person is traumatized, they live with extreme and abnormal feelings of powerlessness and hopelessness, that they consider normal because they learned these things and didn’t feel anything else. a glimpse of power and true value feels almost like death to their sick sense of self. and they might even fear it because their whole identity is challenged and shaken to the core. this is why work; knowledge, creativity and education are transformative tools for somebody living with trauma. they were the only cure for me except i realized this too late. the human will and will to work, and create, and love, and enjoy the successes it brings is a divine force, not at all to be undervalued like most spiritual teachers suggest, by saying do nothing or let go of effort. when people have trauma work is the only salvation they have to live a normal life. so, if you refuse to work and think its something spiritual moving you in this direction seriously consider you might be wrong. now i will share some of my childhood story and how dementia happened. my story begins by me being born with a physical disability called artogriphosis. i had bent arms and legs which could not be stretched, kind of like a baby is positioned in the stomach curled up, that’s how i was when i got out. however devastating this situation seemed at first, there was hope, because by exercising diligently i could walk and eventually stretch my arms half way. i had all the function and potential of a normal child. the problem came while doing the very exercises because they were invasive, complicated and painful. i slept with plasters every night and all this lasted for the first 12 years of my life. my parents while doing a remarkable job of straightening my body didn’t consider that i could be emotionally damaged by the process. and thus, they convinced themselves and me that i was completely normal, which i wasn’t. those painful exercises created severe trauma that was left untreated and considered normal. in my 19 year i developed ‘’out of nowhere’’ a severe debilitating anxiety towards life and work. i had constant feelings of subconscious terror, which were relentless and constant every day all day. i tried many things to help myself and gave full attention to my psychological problem, which was paradoxically, a huge mistake. in the 15 years of living with this anxiety i learned to live with it and considered it a normal part of me. the only problem was i wasn’t productive and didn’t work and live independently. so, i read psychological books and all sorts of stuff and came across spirituality and eventually developed the doctrine i mentioned before.in my opinion symptoms of dementia can come at any age if a person lives with extreme psychological burden. it starts the cognitive decline gradually and very gently as years go by so the sufferer can forget the pain. it introduces a wide variety of symptoms that mimic so many of the ‘’spiritual symptoms’’ i read about over the years. brain fog, constant tiredness, sleepiness, a sense of peace, beingness and bliss that comes in doing nothing and sleep and rest. so all these ‘’positive’’ symptoms were actually dementia in my case, mistaken and confused for spirituality. in my opinion anything that reduces one’s abilities and qualities of life should be discarded whether it be ‘’spiritual’’ or not. the pain never ended and i was just becoming dumber and dumber and more tired, and unable to concentrate for longer periods.  in my confusion i mistook these sensations as positive and even advisable which kept me in massive delusion. even efforts to work and keep my passion alive were diminished by an unnatural exhaustion that came over me as time went by. and then i thought work truly must not exist as i am truly unable to sustain my will towards it, this otherworldly tiredness is keeping me from it. it must be a sign that the force of undoing(dementia) is the true reality. that tiredness came from dementia and it was just an illusion and breakable by sustaining the effort. it might be unlikely, but if anyone identifies with my experience, my advice is to keep going and resist the exhaustion for it is a lie trying to keep you asleep. there is nothing spiritual and worthwhile in death and dementia. life is a force to be lived, not spent asleep and tired all the time.the final straw happened 3 months ago, when i took ciprofloxacin ear drops for mild noise induced hearing loss. i overdosed by mistake using them for 14 days instead of 7 as prescribed. even though it was a relatively low dose of 2 drops each day, the final day my system collapsed. perhaps due to my already overloaded brain, and combined with this poisonous medication i finally enraged and triggered dementia. now the decline that was very slow and would have kept going on for 30 years or more, has accelerated 10000 times. i presume i have about 5 years of very unfulfilling life left. i will never experience the success i could have had. the love and joy of life i could have had. it was overshadowed by constant feelings of ungratefulness and arrogance.  believing i was beyond this world and its preciousness i was watching it go by me, waiting for my spiritual revelation which never came. i was very arrogant and ungrateful thinking that things cannot possibly be worse due to my anxiety. incredibly, things can be 10000 worse than they are. now i have dementia. the only right way forward for me was to accept the anxiety and reconcile that i have to live with it like any other handicap. and do everything in my power to work and live independently. work is the ultimate expression of value and love towards oneself which trauma cannot endure, that’s why it does everything in its power to resist it.so, this is it. i talked about my life choices and some spiritual traps that people might fall into. i feel very vulnerable writing this and even a bit stupid, wondering who on earth will want to read this depressive story, but honestly id give anything if somebody told me in the right moment how wrong i was. for years nothing could sway me from my stubborn convictions. the world is getting increasingly more insane as we can witness. spiritually can be the source of massive confusion as well, and by me interpreting it the wrong way, or actually falling for its lies i ended up like this. i wish i had never read anything about it. you might argue that its not my fault for getting these severe side effects from that drug. in a way you would be right but its the life choices and ideology that led to this. my unwillingness to educate myself and work left me underdeveloped. i didn’t know that antibiotic in topical form is still dangerous, i didn’t follow the prescription, i didn’t research the side effects properly, so all these mistakes led to this. the ideology of undoing and not knowing, that false spirituality that i had so much faith in and surrendered completely to, destroyed me in the end. it was insanity and trauma and dementia taking form of something incredibly valuable to me.farewell friends or enemies, i do hope this gives some value to anyone and people can at least learn from my mistakes. some key points:work, knowledge and creativity is more than means to an end. it can transform our life and destroy trauma and mental illness. because they represent love and support life. they are life.perfectionism and working eternally on your issues, waiting to first solve them and then return to the world, is trauma keeping you enslaved in eternal rumination which leads to nowhere. the only way is to ignore it. work, be creative, learn about history, geography, economy medicine, science... each day enrich your mind little by little. keep dementia away, keep ignorance away. massive suffering can naturally create symptoms of dementia like brain fog, forgetfulness and a false sense of peace that comes from oblivion, as well as sleepiness. don’t satisfy yourself by thinking this as a spiritual symptom. enlightenment if it exists might require force and enormous willpower contrary to much of the gurus say. not surrendering helplessly to the void and waiting for things to change. wake up by force, resist the antilife forces of the world. insanity can take form of some of our most precious values and ideas like spirituality, love, religion, trust, hope, etc. it can trick and turn them against us. sometimes you can’t trust your own mind, your emotions, your intuition, even your body that can create feelings of exhaustion. especially if it tells you to be homeless and renounce the world like it told me. its more than just a thought that keeps us in delusion.some chronic traumas only get worse over time, it won’t solve by itself no matter how long your ‘’spiritual process’’ lasts. and if you are destined to live with it, live the best and most fulfilling life you can. live now. don’t sleep and rely on dementia to take you.if you don’t work or know anything, and you depend on somebody to work and provide for you, you still won’t survive. because such a lifestyle attracts natural catastrophes and disasters in form of disease, dementia, insanity or disability. you are never safe by being stupid. it can cost you your life like it did me. love and gratitude is most important. learning from ‘’ordinary’’ people enjoying their company respecting and appreciating them. just being normal is the best thing in the world, and not being narcissistic. i unconsciously thought i was better than everyone. now i see ‘’enlightenment’’ in everyone. we are just great as we are, trying our best to go by and nothing more is ever needed. i’m sorry. you can’t imagine how sorry i am. i wasted my life for an illusion.i was insane, i was misled. may god forgive me, may you forgive me, may the world forgive me. i failed to live. i was confused and alone, marked by misfortune. if there is another life, i will never make the same mistake again. be well and farewellphillip

My mom has dementia
i don’t even know where to start. my mom has dementia, but she was hiding it somehow and my dad was helping her hide it. in april they both got covid and my dad landed in the hospital with psychosis from his bipolar disorder and my mom got way worse. with my dad in the hospital, my mom has been a complete wreck! the first night i took her home, i was getting texts from her at 2-4am freaking out because she was alone. i couldn’t get her to see a doctor so i finally just took her to the er. the doctor said she’d have to go into a home and she flipped out begging me to bring her to my house. i have three kids and a husband. my youngest is 4 and has autism. i did bring her home with me at first but she wouldn’t sleep at night. she would call me from my living room all hours of the night saying she was trapped somewhere. she was yelling at my kids and making them uncomfortable and asking me to take her home. it was clear she would forget where my dad went. i couldn’t leave my own house to do anything. it was horrible. we had graduation and recitals approaching so i hired a live in side to stay with her in her own home.well the phone calls and texts haven’t stopped! one time i stopped at her house unannounced to let her and her aide know my dad should be returning home in a week. when i got there she was dressed to leave! she was sitting on the couch panicking and begging me to take her home with me, the same place she begged me to bring her to her own home from! i don’t have the heart to tell my dad how bad she’s gotten since he’s been gone. i also think she might need a new aide? i can’t tell if it’s just the side or that my mom seems to be in a constant panic, which by the way is the opposite of how she was before dementia!i took her to the doctor, for the first time in 30 years. she was given meds for anxiety and sleep, the patch for dementia and something for water retention. she may have had a silent heart attack, and will be getting an echocardiogram this week. she’s had the aide living with her for three weeks and she is currently texting me asking me why this lady is living with her. it’s nearly midnight. i don’t even know what to do.

my grandfather has dementia
it's not like something new, he was diagnosed 6 years ago. in 2016, i believe that he was diagnosed before that but that's what i heard. grandpa didn't show any signs of cognitive decline, until the early years of 2020, he began misplacing things like his wallet or shoes. the decline started to grow more at the start of mid 2021, when he misplaces his shoes he will take mine and say it's his. this really started to bother people at the house so we hid our shoes from him. later at june 2021 (i think?) my cousin had a wedding it was fun seeing all my cousins from different places come to our town for this, it was all fun. until we got back from the wedding, since my family lives with my grandparents we were going there to go to sleep. but grandpa forgot about us and locked the doors, so we had to sleep at my aunt. later at the morning next day, i hear my aunts with my mom at the breakfast table they invited me but i refused because i ate my breakfast before. i am setting next to them when i hear them mentioning my grandpa, they said that one of my cousins goes to him in his house after he got back from the wedding,mu cousin asked "how was the wedding?!" he asks him "what wedding?", later after the wedding i was with my grandparents at the launch table when my grandma says "do you remember mohammed?"  he answers her questions with visible confusion "who's mohammed?" she says "mohammed! he's wedding was a month ago, don't you remember?" he answers "no, i don't remember mohammed". there wasn't anything big after that at least for a few months when he forgot his car at the pharmacy, but my brother and him managed to find the car. that happened while i was asleep, so i couldn't help. then a month or two ago he forgot his safe, which had like 70% of his money. luckily he found it later that day. and now he need my brother to go to the gas station and to buy groceries. he's still the charming champ he is, just less energetic and more vague. his language is starting to fall apart. everything is going to the worst and i acknowledge that, so i am trying to give him the time of his life before he ends up in memory care.

Sponge bath versus Shower
probably a dumb question, but ....  i was at my parent's home for a month while dad was in rehab with a broken ankle. (he's home now, and i went home.) mom has dementia (i'm thinking alzheimer's because her mother had that) she's undiagnosed because dad doesn't want her to be upset. anyway, during the whole month i could not get her to shower. i did manage to shampoo her hair because i told her she'd get a scalp condition called "seboria dermatitis" (dandruff). (yes, i'm bad, but it worked.)  but shower? forget it. she'd take sponge baths. rehab occupational therapy went to parent's house, and dad said he'd only do sponge baths!  (he's 86 in august, she's 83.)    are sponge baths enough?!? i can't believe ot was ok with that!    my brother, who lives closer, doesn't have a problem....with anything ... let's them do anything.  i don't feel like he's doing enough. am i worrying too much? i saw an article recently that was about why seniors won't shower/bathe more often. it said it had to do with when they were young, when people only bathed once a week, at most, and would even share bath water.  my mother grew up in italy and i'm not sure they had a regular tub, and their main "bath" was sponge bath.  to me, it just doesn't seem clean enough. but now i'm 5 hours away. am i worrying for nothing??

Ativan to Treat Dizzying Anxiety? [lorazepam]
tldr: is ativan a good idea for sporadic anxiety with dizziness? my loved one is having what seems to be increased anxiety episodes which include a light headedness, followed by severe dizziness, followed by body shakes, and finally breathing coming in sobs. if she gets to breathing like this for too long she may get nausea. i really don't know what to think about the dizziness.  we've done every blood test, head scan, xray and heart reading the hospital could think of (she was found on the floor and didnt know if she fell or not.) this was 2 weeks ago when we moved her to memory care hoping for a safer environment, but moves are also confusing for folks with dementia. vitals are always fine. thyroid, bp, blood sugar, and meds are all accounted for (unless the staff is messing them up which i will burn the place down if i find out- i'm double checking today). the spells always seem to come in the evening when a visitor starts saying their goodbyes, making me agree with anxiety (and her breathing sounds just exactly like my panic attacks i've had in the past). but again, i don't know if im not there and she rarely has visitors in the mornings to relay information to me. when i call to ask, the staff don't really act knowledgeable?? they just say that they dont know, she seems ok and shes probably just adjusting still...if i am there i'm able to talk her through them &amp; we seem to be able to avoid it as soon as it starts. (i am no stranger to panic attacks and i have only/always used breathing &amp; grounding tricks to survive them) i don't know what happens as soon as i leave though.the staff does "breathing exercises" with her that are simply telling her "breath in breath out" but no attempts to actually calm her breaths by counting with her or grounding with touch or other senses. and leave her saying "this is just anxiety" if it hasnt improved. (she has dementia though, after a few minutes she forgets they came and doesnt know why she feels so scared).*as her poa ive been asked to secure a prescription for ativan for her. my gut says this could actually increase dizziness and confusion, but i really don't have any experience using anti-anxiety meds. i also dont know if it's considered as needed prn or daily, or what side effects would be like. *i'm also nervous to prescribe something that will turn her into a zombie just because the staff cant be bothered to work with her. (i know they are short handed and its a hard job, but they also refused to answer her aid light because they were "on break"- that could have been a fall or heart attack or anything and i'm fiercely upset). what are your experiences using ativan for sporadic anxiety spells?

How is dementia officially diagnosed?
my aunt is currently in a nursing home, where she went for rehab after suffering a stroke in september. at the time she was discharged to the nh from the hospital, no diagnosis of dementia appeared on her record. it was aphasia and cognitive deficits caused by stroke (along with diabetes). she seemed to bounce back fairly well from the stroke (she has anomic aphasia which means not word salad, but she substitutes wrong words which sometimes sound like or have a shared meaning with the word she wants). if you don’t know she has aphasia, she does sound whacked out, like she’s playing mad libs. trouble is, the nh environment is chaotic and that makes her aphasia even worse. somehow, everyone there assumes she has dementia. i even saw it on her nh records and have no idea how she got “diagnosed” with it. she had a low bims score, but that wasn’t surprising after the stroke. i had her speech therapist do cognitive exams appropriate to an aphasic patient and she scored somewhat better, but i do believe the stroke caused some mild cognitive deficit.that said, i don’t know if she isn’t in the beginning stages of dementia or how it is even diagnosed. she hasn’t had a personality change. she seems oriented. we have meaningful conversations once the aphasia is allowed for. i can’t figure out why this on her nursing home record.what i do see in her is a slow continuation of tendencies she has for years before her stroke - she is happy to get important items and gifts she has requested - but her interest in them fades in 1-2 weeks and they sit unused after that.  she doesnt forget about the items so much as she loses interest and is very passive. today i discovered that the water jug i gave her for her bedside, which was happy to get 6 weeks ago, had never been touched and had mold in it. it was in plain sight the whole time. the music player she was thrilled to get and learned to use - she never touches it now. this happens over and over. is this dementia or "just" cognitive decline? like i said, she's ignored her belongings for years and before her stroke had some hoarding issues.she is 77 with diabetes.

Every bit of information I share is a shocking surprise to Mom.
to start off, i keep all conversations with mom simple.  no one is dead.  nothing is depressing.  the weather is nice.  we look at old photos frequently.  she tells me stories as if i don't know anyone in the photos.while looking at photos, mom pointed out her nephew, my cousin, and said somberly, "that's my nephew bobby.  he died very young.  he was hit by a car."  now that's horrible and it didn't happen that way.  bobby was hit by a car but he lived a very long life after that and only died about 10 years ago, after a good life.  so i thought maybe i could point it out positively?  she already knew bobby was dead."mom, bobby lived a long life.  he died of cancer after a good life.  we saw him in hospice.  we said our goodbyes.  he had a beautiful funeral.  we were all there. . . "mom's eyes widened and she gasped, "bobby's dead?"  (as if she hadn't just said that 30 seconds prior. . . she literally forgets conversations that she's currently in.)"mom, we just said that.  yes.  but it was okay.  . .he lived a long. . ."cuts me off."he's dead?  why didn't you tell me that?  how dare you keep that from me!  i didn't get to go to the funeral!  i needed to be there.  why would you lie to me?  why do you always lie to me . . "(is now semi-hysterical, forgetting she was at the funeral, wake, and saw him on regular basis.)i know she forgets people are dead.  i never remind her.  but i thought since she told me that bobby died in a gruesome manner, i could correct her.  she knew he was dead, right?  she said it.  now i know.  never, ever correct.  agree with everything.  no deep conversations.  needless to say, our entire visit was ruined because (a) bobby is dead (b) i am liar and keep things from her.you can't win, folks!

Where do I start?
i've been lurking for a while as i've noticed the problems with my dad starting to show since shortly after his wife died at the end of 2020, so i get that this pops up quite a bit. i suppose i'm just overwhelmed. i shouldn't be, but today i finally went into the doctor so it's...real?in the beginning, i was noticing problems with my dads short term memory from afar(i live quite a distance away, so it's been mostly phone calls until this past week). he'll have a conversation with you, but forget you had it by the afternoon. quick to call someone a liar over it, absolutely no recollection. thought this was weird at first, but he's 80 at this point so...old, ya know?he's becoming racist. whoa is he becoming racist. never used to be, but starting to make little comments on the phone. it's slowly but surely becoming such a problem, that other people are avoiding him. but...he's into some crazy things on facebook at this point, so i'm thinking...stuck at home, no wife, older...cranky old man? the covid conspiracy. not the standard one, but the "there's messages in this, which point to this obscure movie over here, which means that, which means the vaccine will kill me. by the way, they're listening into my calls with you". ok, that's nuts. i thought i could walk him through things logically...but i can't. he says i'm not making sense. strange...but...what am i going to do? not a lot you can do if someone goes down deep rabbit holes on the net.by last summer, i'm starting to have to intervene. he's getting scammed by anonymous people calling selling bitcoin. i'm fairly pro-cypto, but this was obviously a simple case of someone just taking the money off his credit card. we contacted the bank, canceled the cards, managed to get a refund(yay!), and now he knows to contact me when he gets those calls. during this time though, i find out the family business isn't paying it's bills. wtf is going on? he's on top of this stuff. i confront him, and he says "you probably missed this, but i'm under a lot of stress! i wasn't paying any attention to the bills while i was caring for my wife. wtf is wrong with you that you would get on my ass about this? just take care of it.". he's always been...brash...so again, alright...maybe i'm overthinking it.fast forward to last week, when i got here. he has no recollection of being scammed last summer, people are calling me because the bills aren't being paid, i find out he's paying insurance on multiple vehicles he doesn't have anymore and he didn't know, there's more people working for the company than i knew about and he doesn't remember them ever being onboard, a friend of his is posting sticky notes everywhere so he knows where stuff is, i see many multiples of food items because he's forgotten he's already got them when he's out, he's stopping mid conversation and walking away because...mid conversation..he's forgotten he's speaking to you, he can't find words and is getting frustrated, he's lashing out at drivers on the roads, talking to someone that isn't there at night, completely unable to manage his finances because he can't do simple math anymore, and hoooooly his memory is strange. his memory about decades ago is beyond on point. like he's recalling something that happened earlier that day. every detail. he's living in the past when he's talking about it, and can't stop talking about it. short term memory is continuing to decline. today? get to the docs office, get a moca test done. score's 27 out of 30, doc says "you did great! just because of your age though, i'm going to order a blood test and a ct scan". strange thing to do if he scored great. i call the doc back and he says it's obvious my father is masking. he see's this often in men like my father, his ego simply will not allow him to admit he needs help and it was a hell of a lot easier than saying there's a problem. sending a nurse over to evaluate things as well cause he's been falling.this post is a lot longer than intended. i feel like i'm still in denial. is this what's happening? memory is going, personality is changing...he insists it's stress. am i wrong? what if i'm not?! where do i even start? i'm moving away soon, and no one else in the family is left to help him. i want him to come with me, but he's so dead set on not. wtf do i do?!

just need to type it out
i guess i just need to post this into the void. my mother was the glue that held our family together. i realize looking back now for many years she had subtle signs of memory loss. in the last few years, my father stepped up to take care of her, they had been together for over 30 years. my father was over ten years older than her, a colon cancer survivor. by all accounts a tough old slavic man. i knew my mothers dementia was progressing but they did a good job of keeping it a secret (in as much as they could, i am a dr + they lived on the other side of the country). my father was capable of caring for her and they are old school europeans who valued their independence. unfortunately my dad passed away this past october from a short illness, and prior to his passing we had emergently moved both of them down to my sisters in florida so we could take care of them. it was an incredibly traumatic event for my mother as she was not really able to understand what was going on, despite us explaining it to her etc. dad has been gone for 6 months. my sister has been taking care of my mother largely on her own - i live about 4 hours away and just moved to florida by myself as my husband is up in michigan finishing his surgical residency. i try to help her as much as i can, every other weekend, and we try to schedule so she doesn't go too long without me coming by to help. we did have a caregiver but were running out of money to pay her and had to stop employing her. the financial situation is different now, with things sort of stabilizing. anyway, my sister, who is about 20 years older than me is taking care of mom full time while also working from home full time. we have gotten to the point now where i am stepping in and making the decision for my mother to go into a home. my sister is on the verge of a breakdown. we have no family here in the states to help us. both of our spouses are in different states. its truly a horrible situation. i have been slowly priming my sister regarding getting mom ready for a home, as she is now truly requiring intense supervision for just about everything and i think my sister is realizing this as her decline has been incredibly apparent over the last few months since dad is gone. my mother is now coughing everytime she drinks something, she will likely aspirate. her gait is incredibly unsteady and she is becoming a fall risk. she no longer speaks much. shes not my mother anymore. i guess i dont know what to sayi am in my 30s and will have lost both of my parents in one yeari am not willing to lose my sisteri hate this

Aggression and Violence…what do I do?
i posted in this subreddit when i discovered my grandmother had dementia and overall, things have been going well except for the few times she has problems with her memory or forgetting things that just occurred. &amp;nbsp;  at any rate, today, my grandma had an episode where she became aggressive with my uncles. she apparently got so aggressive with them that she disowned them (for no valid reason other than something she thought had been happening). i call her before i put my son to bed since she likes to talk with him and when she answers, she is emotional with me; not ugly, just emotional talking about how she was being lied to by my grandfather. she then told me she was packing her bags and leaving tomorrow. so i drove over to her place to talk with her. when i arrived, the air in the house was as tense and my grandpa’s eyes looked like he had been upset and my grandma had these…the only way to describe it is a rabid dogs eyes. i sat with her and i just let her talk about what was going on, keeping in the back of my head that she was confused and things she was saying weren’t true….i just wanted her to feel like someone was listening to help calm her down. my mother arrives shortly after and my grandmother says something to her and suddenly my mother becomes confrontational with her, and it makes my grandma storm out of the house and into the back yard.  &amp;nbsp;  i confront my mother and my grandpa asking them to realize that it’s her disease and the best thing we can do is be empathetic to what she has to say, no matter how untrue it was. i ask my mom and grandpa to stay inside and i go outside to talk with my grandma so more. i tell her i don’t want to talk about why she’s angry unless she wants to. i then ask her to sit with me since she keeps claiming she will be gone in the morning and i won’t have much time with her left. so i just asked her to sit and be with me so we can enjoy our last moments together. we begin talking about something random and she begins to calm down but then my grandpa and mother come outside and sit down. my grandpa and grandmother start arguing and it makes my grandma storm back inside the house saying she was leaving. then she comes back out immediately and tells my grandpa to get his things and leave. he said he wasn’t leaving and that’s when my grandma tells my mom and i to leave the house because it’s about to get ugly. my grandpa asks her what she means by this and she says just don’t fall asleep with your eyes closed or your wake up with a hammer to your head. and my mom intervenes and the next thing i know, my grandmother is running at my grandfather and pushes him and begins to punch him in the chest. my mother steps in to stop her and she begins to hit my mother. i then jump in and bear hug my grandma asking her to look into my eyes and see that it’s her grandson tony. my grandma says i know who it is and then threatened to hit me if i didn’t let her go. so i let her go and she appears to raise a fist at me and my mom steps in defending me like a mama bear to her cub. my grandma storms inside, gets her purse and storms off from the house to the main road. &amp;nbsp;at this point my mom and i are emotional and my grandpa is beside himself and goes inside. i decide there was nothing else we could do so i call 9-11 and get police to come out to help while asking my mom to follow my grandma so she doesn’t get hit by a car. my mom does and after i’m done talking to the 9-11 dispatcher, my grandma shows back up at the house and is looking for her phone (which she had in her purse). the cops finally arrive and they are told what’s going on and go inside to talk with my grandma. apparently, she took some medication and had finally calmed down. however, because of her violence and aggression, the police had to take her to the hospital. she did not remember anything from what had happened and didn’t understand why she was being asked to go to the hospital. she was told she what she was threatening (suicide, murder, running away) all of which she couldn’t believe.  &amp;nbsp;my grandma has always been a georgia peach so for her to have this kind of aggression is completely something new and terribly depressing to say the least. i found out from my grandfather that she also suffers from being bi-polar and this wasn’t her first outburst. &amp;nbsp;  my questions are:  1. did i do the right thing by calling the cops to get her committed to the hospital?  &amp;nbsp;  2. should i hire a counselor to help my family coup better with the outburst? i am very disappointed in them for getting confrontational when she was clearly having an episode.  &amp;nbsp;3. based on her current stages of dementia…i read online that she is midway through the disease stages. is this correct or is this at a point where she may not make it much longer?  &amp;nbsp;4. my uncles were all called and realized it was her disease causing the outburst and so they are going to meet online (they all live out of state) with my mother tomorrow to discuss next steps and how they can help support this moving forward seeing that the disease is progressing so much. but what are some things we should be doing? if at all?!&amp;nbsp;tldr: my grandmas dementia has gotten to a new stage where she is aggressive and violent and the cops had to be called to get her hospitalized. i need some wisdom on what my family and i should be doing at this time.

Forgetting visits, telling me it's been so long since I visited
this turned into a rant.  i apologize.  i think i need professional therapy to process this :(my mom is right on the borderline of cognitive impairment and dementia.  she lives in a retirement community independently yet.  however, i handle every aspect of her life outside of that safe bubble, except for my brother handling her meds and her medacube.  it seems like there's always an appointment, an insurance change, finances to handle, phones to fix again and again and again, furniture to move, shopping to do...  i work full time, i work her needs and the time it takes into my schedule.  i live an hour away.  i don't/can't just visit for pleasure anymore, i'm always taking care of some administration thing, at least weekly.  frankly, even more relaxed visits aren't pleasurable anymore as this person now is quite different that who my mother was :( we had a good relationship all my life, but not at all close.  she was my dad's wife 100% and after we could take care of ourselves (4 or 5 years old?) she poured all her energy back into my dad, who died from heart failure in 2019... she and i had a polite and respectful relationship but there wasn't much support, so, honestly, i do what i do out of basic responsibility, not nurturing and powerful love.  and now, she's unfamiliar.  now my mom is sending me repeated messages about it being so long since she's seen me and when am i coming to visit?  we went to her neurologist appt tuesday and i was at her place for hours after work the thursday before completely resetting her phone (some bible app she clicked on took it over!)  she's sending these on the group chat we have set up with my two brothers, so at least they see how many times she brings it up.  i plan to visit her tuesday morning before work (but i can't tell her that since she won't remember it, at all and has like four calendars all over her apartment she uses randomly).  my daughter visited her yesterday.  my cousin brought her mom supper last night and invited my mom to eat with them (her sister-in-law lives just down the hallway).   my brother is taking her to a doctor appt tomorrow.  she loves her community and is very much a central figure there.  she goes to 9am coffee everyday and eats one meal a day in the dining hall. she has plenty of social stimulation.  i want to scream at her "leave me alone!" but of course, i don't.  more pent up emotion.  i can be randomly enjoying some relaxing activity, by myself, and in pops a message, nagging me to pay attention to her somehow and it plunges me into anger and blackness.  i'm not mad at my mom, she can't help it.  i'm incredibly sad that she thinks i'm ignoring her and never visiting.  all immediate things that happen to her or she hears just completely disappears right after they happen.  i don't know how to let her know i am helping her and visting her or seeing her or talking to her multiple times a week.  i can't tell her, she forgets.  i can't write it down anywhere, she will take down notes and tuck them away.  she took down the white board i put up for this kind of thing.  i'm at my wits end and it's only the beginning... my wits are not at all good at this type of thing and never have been.

Entitled sibling and disability complicating caregiving
i'm 45 (non-binary) white, disabled, autistic, mentally ill, a sexual assault survivor, and impoverished. i was a software engineer before being fired for being disabled. my sister (43) is nondisabled, married, no kids, a homeowner, attorney, lives in a big fancy city, works from home as a federal judge, has benefits, and lives near a big accessible healthcare complex. she has four degrees, two divorces, and a marriage, all paid for by my parents. the house she bought was partially paid for by my parents with the understanding she'd take me in after they die. she lives 3.5 hours away. i have trouble understanding her voice in person and on the phone because she talks so fast. she purposely uses medical and legal language to trip me up lip-reading. two years ago my dad (82) was dx'd with dementia, probably alzheimer's. he's still mobile, not too steady with a cane and not oriented to time anymore. he knows his family, but he's angry and resistant alot of the time now. he's struggling to use the thermostat and tv. he can'tcuse a phone anymore because he forgets what he was calling about.my mom (78) is deaf, losing her eyesight,  and has trouble walking. she's not as sharp as she was, but she doesn't have symptoms of dementia. we share caregiving for my dad and trying to keep up a three bedroom house. my parents have medicare, insurance, and basic savings. my dad gets decent retirement and my mom a little. i took them to a lawyer years ago to get dpoa and because they wanted to have a will. (my sister had a fit because she wanted me to have my dad declared incompetent. i didn't see the need. )both of my parents were doing so well and my dad suddenly declined a few years before the pandemic. my sister has visited us once for two hours after my dad's dx and then stopped calling. she's "protective of her free time." she didn't even want her wife to work because she wanted her at home with her all the time. i'm starting to think my sister never intended to let me move in, and i'm guessing that her promises to help us with dad were lies too. she told my mom i was trying to take over the money and put them in a facility. i am trying to keep them in their home. (my sister is the only one with enough money to afford ltc for them.) my mom is now conflicted about letting me help more with finances. my dad is still giving my sister money we can't afford. i absolutely love my parents so much. they weren't perfect and neither am i. we've always helped each other out though. i knew eldercare would be a struggle for me with disabilities. i had no idea what dementia did to a family. it's so hard and i dissociate a lot of the time. i'm scared i'm going to die before one or both of them do and no one will care for them. plus, i spend a lot of time stopping people from taking advantage of them. i went from low blood pressure to high blood pressure in six months and it's complicating my chronic kidney disease. my doctors are begging me to reduce my stress. i can't get care for my treatment resistant depression and adhd here (rurally) either. my mental health is garbage. it's crushing my soul to watch my mom go through this. no matter what my mom does my father complains and is nasty to her. that's on a good day. i can't bring myself to mention the rest of the stuff. my mom and i are doing the best we can and holding each other together. she's able to do more than i can physically right now. i don't know what to do now that my dad can't be left alone and my nephrologist and the nearest trauma center is a two hour drive. he refuses to leave the house most of the time.i don't know what to do if my mom has an emergency and they fly her out of state to the trauma center because i hold poa for both of them. who do i leave alone? how can i possibly choose. my sister blocks me when i ask for help. i've lost thirty pounds in two and a half months. i am out of breath taking the trash out. my mom is losing weight too and has high blood pressure.we both need respite desperately, but my sister says it would be a hardship on her as a federal judge. she gets four weeks of paid vacation days a year and works from home!!we're only asking her for a week for my mom. i want to scream at my sister. (i literally can't because she's a federal judge and will have me arrested.)am i a bad person because i'm scared to die for my parents and leave them alone with her? i love my parents so very much, but my body is giving up and i am in so much pain. i go to sleep crying and wake up shaking.any advice?

"Please help me"
when my mother was a small girl she had a chronic health condition and she spent most of her childhood in hospital. she suffered so much trauma from it that when i was growing up she would never let anyone know she was sick until it was severe. at the beginning of this year mom could hold a conversation but she needed help finishing her train of thought. she couldn't make food or keep appointments and she needed help to run water for a shower. she was content and the whole family helped to keep her busy with stuff she could do. there were times when the moderate became severe but only occasionally.then she fell two weeks ago.i was cleaning her bedroom. she was in the living room. i was away from her for about 5 minutes. it was the last step on the stairs and it's a miracle that she didn't break anything but she has very bad cuts on her face. she was in hospital for a week and when she was discharged she had gone from moderate to severe. she can't walk unassisted. she needs help to go to the bathroom. she has forgotten how to use utensils. she's incoherent.the worst part is what she keeps saying. "please help me". it's never when it's a concern over bodily needs (food, water, bathroom, pain, hot/cold, etc) and i know that because she will ask for help with everything physical (incoherently most of the time but distinctly). from a week of trying to decipher what she means when she says "please help me" sometimes she's asking for a cure to her dementia or to go home. she's still stuck in the hospital she spent most of her childhood in and just wants to be healthy again so she can go home. she wants a return to before. how do i look my mother in the eye and let her know that it's never going to get better for her? that it's really only downhill from here? that the best i can do is try to keep her comfortable?i can't. i keep telling her that help is coming and that she's healing very well from her accident but she doesn't believe me. i steer conversation away from anything hospital or home related. when she realises that she's actually home it makes her hysterical. the thinking is obviously, well if i'm home why am i still like this? i tell her stories about what everyone in the family is doing. i watch her favourite movies with her. none of it really helps. she is deeply deeply depressed from her condition. i don't know how but every time she says: "please help me", my heart breaks again. i'm trying mom. i'm sorry.

when my mother was a small girl she had a chronic health condition and she spent most of her childhood in hospital. she suffered so much trauma from it that when i was growing up she would never let anyone know she was sick until it was severe. at the beginning of this year mom could hold a conversation but she needed help finishing her train of thought. she couldn't make food or keep appointments and she needed help to run water for a shower. she was content and the whole family helped to keep her busy with stuff she could do. there were times when the moderate became severe but only occasionally.then she fell two weeks ago.i was cleaning her bedroom. she was in the living room. i was away from her for about 5 minutes. it was the last step on the stairs and it's a miracle that she didn't break anything but she has very bad cuts on her face. she was in hospital for a week and when she was discharged she had gone from moderate to severe. she can't walk unassisted. she needs help to go to the bathroom. she has forgotten how to use utensils. she's incoherent.the worst part is what she keeps saying. "please help me". it's never when it's a concern over bodily needs (food, water, bathroom, pain, hot/cold, etc) and i know that because she will ask for help with everything physical (incoherently most of the time but distinctly). from a week of trying to decipher what she means when she says "please help me" sometimes she's asking for a cure to her dementia or to go home. she's still stuck in the hospital she spent most of her childhood in and just wants to be healthy again so she can go home. she wants a return to before. how do i look my mother in the eye and let her know that it's never going to get better for her? that it's really only downhill from here? that the best i can do is try to keep her comfortable?i can't. i keep telling her that help is coming and that she's healing very well from her accident but she doesn't believe me. i steer conversation away from anything hospital or home related. when she realises that she's actually home it makes her hysterical. the thinking is obviously, well if i'm home why am i still like this? i tell her stories about what everyone in the family is doing. i watch her favourite movies with her. none of it really helps. she is deeply deeply depressed from her condition. i don't know how but every time she says: "please help me", my heart breaks again. i'm trying mom. i'm sorry.

MIL: what is "her" vs dementia &amp; perseverating about pain meds.
i've seen comments from others with this problem . . . i'm  frustrated, hurt, and aggravated rn, so forgive me if this is all over the place.my mil (mid-70s) is in the beginning-ish stages of dementia. we have a neuro &amp; neuro-psych that she sees regularly. summer of 2020 after a car accident, her driving ability was medically evaluated (she's cleared to drive). though, fortunately, she doesn't drive much. she lives on her own. husband goes over at least once a week to hang out, do things around the house, and -important- to fill her pill box for the week (heart, bp, blood thinners, etc etc). home health aide comes once a week. she and i speak  once or twice a week for over an hour at a time. mil and her widowed neighbor speak every day on the phone and keep tabs on each other. she also texts dh every night when she's upstairs in her bedroom. she's physically frail. a hip replacement a few years ago (retirement happened at the same time), a knee replacement is in the works, and other joint/ arthritis issues. mil also doesn't have many friends &amp; the only real hobby she's ever had she can't do bc of arthritis in her hands. her gp - who sucks and i've nicknamed "dr. feelgood" - keeps giving her oxycodone for the pain (i know). she's become obsessed with it to the point she ends up misplacing it by putting it in "safe" places and forgetting etc. now, we get to the problem. she's always been someone who gets into her head and becomes anxious when she has too much time on her hands. this has obviously worsened.  she picked up her meds including oxycodone early this week. all the meds in their own paper bags etc. monday, dh went to do the thing, including dealing with getting all the meds our of their paper bags and putting them in her weekly am/pm pillbox. note: the oxy doesn't go in this pillbox. the next day, she and dh were texting all morning about missing oxy pills from the bottle. i didn't know this, so when he left for his daily walk, i called her to chat. we chatted for a while, i mentioned how the past 2 days had been terrible for migraine. next thing i know, she says "this is going to sound accusatory." explains how she's missing 21 pills and the only "reasonable" explanations could be that either the drug store screwed up or dh took them for me. i was pissed. but, calmly &amp; firmly told her that her son would never do that. i then hear her say "oh, hi" then to me "he's here." ok, not knowing this has been ongoing, i shoot dh a quick text about it.when he got home, he explained that he remembered there was a pill bottle lid that was on cock-eyed, so he went out to the garage garbage and found the bag that had all the paper bags from her scripts in it. he found about 15 loose oxy in one of the white paper bags. he brought them in, explained how he'd found them. she says (and the story changes) essentially she opened the oxy bag and bottle in the car "to check it." for what, who knows. whatever. he also bought a monthly pill box specifically for the oxy and split them all up. we think all is well. yesterday evening she calls. apparently, she'd been perseverating on this since tues afternoon and still thinks he took pills as there are still a few missing. he calmly tells her again what he'd done, how he'd found the missing pills &amp; that some may have made their way out of the paper bag into the actual garbage, and no, he didn't dig thru all that. nope, he took them. dh has the patience of a saint. he has to be extremely frustrated or hurt, to raise his voice. she knows this. he finally lost his cool and raised his voice to her/ yelled. it kind of snapped her back. he ended up telling her how he's very careful not to bring up the dementia often as reasons for things as he doesn't want to make her feel bad, but she needs to entertain the possibility that it's that. she seemed to take this to heart, it made sense, sincere apologies all around. 10 min later she texts about how she's going to go look in the garbage. fine. she didn't text last night before bed as she does every night. home health aid is there today, so we know she's fine otherwise the aid would have called. i know we've got to figure out something re: oxy and her behavior surrounding it. we're trying, but all the cajoling from us and her neuro changes nothing. her gp is old, seemingly doesn't care, and loves the sound of his own voice. she sees her neuro every 6 mths (all doc appts are with dh). fortunately, i also see this neuro and have a long established relationship. my next appt is soon &amp; i plan to talk to him too. all that to say, what do we do with all this? do we need to bring up the dementia sooner when she gets like this? she's not to the point where redirecting works. she's also a very intelligent woman who will not be "handled."  ack. apologies for the length of this  post.

Violent Dad with suspected Dementia
i’m 21f and my dad has been losing his memory rapidly the past few months.all my life, my dad has struggled with depression and his mental health. i believe these mental health struggles caused him to be extremely violent and have constant angry outbursts. these episodes were only heightened with his drug and alcohol abuse. i’ve always been terrified by him, and walk on eggshells constantly to not upset him.over the past couple months he has been acting very strange (stranger than usual). he’s constantly losing valuable items such as his credit cards, keys, and his phone. he forgets the time that he should pick up my sisters from school. he will knock on my door telling me that my car is missing from the driveway just for me to check and see that it’s there. he will call my mom from the house phone to ask her if she can call his cellphone because he can’t find it (he has the house phone so i’m not sure why he needs her to call). he will repeat the same story over and over again. he will have to change his own underwear constantly because he can’t make it to the restroom. his room is dirty and he’s began hoarding. he also has developed a tremor and shuffling gait.two days ago, i called 911 because my mom started screaming that he was having a stroke. he was rushed to this hospital where they did a ct scan showing narrowing of the blood vessels in the neck and head. the mri showed that he had an ischemic stroke. other abnormalities they found were issues with his liver and heart. the doctors only suggested that he would need a medication change and to follow up with his primary care provider and neurologist. since he’s been back from the hospital, his anger has only continued to grow. he will scream for hours on end. shouting profanity and slurs. he will throw objects and punch walls. he violently threatens my mom and the rest of my family. when it gets really bad i will lock myself in my room or try to leave the house without him noticing. my mom has been married to him for 30+ years. she is afraid to leave him because he’s violent. i don’t know what my options are. he will probably need a caregiver soon because he can’t make it to the restroom. my mom has thought about a long-term care facility but i doubt my dad would consent to that. please don’t suggest leaving him or reporting him to the police. he is scary and will most likely seek revenge if that happens. i’m stuck and i don’t know what the next move should be. any suggestions would be helpful.

The unknown
so, i have been watching and reading a lot over here this week.im not sure what to say, this will be just a rant i guess ..little background story.i spend half my childhood with my grandparents. then contact ended. no one really knows why. they’re a bit traditional and we had very different views on the world.that said.every friday i work in the building, my grandparents live.at first i was like; pfff. no.then they invited me in, after years of ignoring. i felt obligated to do so, and we had a drink.then the next week they invited me in again.fast forward to me being actually happy every friday to chat and had a drink with my grandparents again.till last week.my mom told me that grandma is not doing okay. and they are searching what the hell is wrong with her. long story short; she’s starting developing tremors in her arm. and has memory fog. this was probably going on for a year or so, but they finally addressed to the doctor when they went for their annual check up.she is beginning to have trouble walking, very tired very easily. at her birthday she cried all day. because of frustration and not knowing what is going on. at one point, she pointed at pictures of us all, and she could easily call out the name of my wife. but she forgot mine … and i am there every week. she knew  my name later on but that’s the part when all the alarm bells went off.she had her first memory test last week. next one with all the scans and all are in september.but things don’t look good and are going downhill very fast. a day after her birthday she thought is was monday again. few hours later she thought it was mothersday and asked if there would be any visitations.she told my grandpa she would wacht the floor and then sweep it with a wet towel.when my grandpa came back from grocery shopping, she was sweeping. but was convinced she would vacuum after sweeping. etc etc.sorry for the rant. for all who stayed reading; thank you. they think it’s lewy body or parkinson dementia. but the part where it might not be dementia is already out of the picture ..i finally got them back and than this. im scared as hell. thank you for me, to do my story. sorry for the rant.

Grandfather is convinced he is locked up in a police station and is very angry. How to help with sudden hallucinations?
tldr: last two paragraphs for current sitaution. severe decline in past month. unable to provide care because not a first world country. wish i could type everything but the post will only get longer and discouraging to readhe is 92 and lost his wife to covid last year. he was physically able to move with some help but in the past one month his health has gone worse and has shown a very rapid decline in both mental and physical capabilities. we have an in house attendant during the day and he takes great care of him. we as a family are also present with him and try to keep him engaged and distracted. his mental decline has been too fast for us to handle. two months ago he started having short term memory loss and would repeatedly ask same questions over and over. he was also confused. taking him to poo was a hassle but we would manage it. also started to eat way less than what i would imagine would be healthy for him.however, last week or two, he pooped in his diapers and refused to get cleaned up. he never urinates or poos in diapers as he is not used to it and doesn't want to accept it but he wears one for emergencies. 3 days of trying to convince him lead to nothing. we also got him a wheelchair so he could move around but he got physically weaker to the point where we couldn't get him to sit on it from the bed. we hired an attendant for the day and he somehow didn't resist much to the idea of getting a bathe. anyways we get him cleaned and back on the bed. but since then he is completely immobile and doesn't even move at all in the bed. where we live it is very hard to take him to a doctor and he is afraid of going to hospitals. doctors have refused in-home visit and give some covid protocol bs as an excuse. we have been trying to get one since a month. anyways, back to 2-3 days back, he says he is in a lot of physical pain and would fight on any attempt to move him on the bed. he got a huge bed sore on his lower back as a result. we then had to just force ourselves to keep changing his position in bed while he screams and tries to hit us and the attendant because he is scared he will fall down (and the physical pain). he is on a huge double bed and we always try to reassure him and hold him. the attendant did warn us and insisted on us to help with changing his positions but we didn't know any better to deal with his unwillingness to be moved at all.anyways, yesterday, we were making some progress with everything. he got up and sat on the bed, had his hair combed, didn't forget much and kept talking. however, later in the day he kept hallucinating and was convinced he is not at home and kept telling me to pack our stuff and that we're going home. i tried distracting him with visuals and music but he didn't give up on this idea. we are also barely able to attend to him at night since it is very hard to sacrifice our sleep and function properly the next day. (the attendant was originally hired to help with tasks like cleaning and feeding which is for the day time.) i believe he has been unable to fall asleep at all in the past 2 days. so i wake up the next morning and he is screaming in his room and is talking loudly to the walls. i enter his room and he thinks the police have stolen something from him and also locked him up. he is mad at the hallucinations for not answering to him and letting him leave. i help him to pee and now i am too scared to go back because he is fuming. the attendant will be here soon but i don't know what to do at all.

Help for a Newbie
my mother is 77. she lives alone in a small town with no public transportation and everything she needs being at least a 15 to 20 minute drive away. she still has her license and drives daily. my sisters and i each live anywhere from a 2 to 12 hour drive from her house. she has a very supportive friend network at home. this is how we found out she was having problems. my sisters started getting phone calls from her friends a little over a year ago voicing some concerns. she was repeating herself in conversations. she would show up for a meeting on the wrong day. stuff like that. after being alerted by her friends we started to pick up on some of the same issues in our phone conversations with her. my sisters and i all go to mom's for a week or so every summer as a kind of reunion. this last summer we voiced our concerns with the memory issues she was having and suggested that she permit us access to some things and that she schedule an appointment with her dr. to see what might be the source of the problem. she acknowledged that she was "a little forgetful" and wasn't combative or argumentative, but it did seem like she lacked the insight into the potential severity of her situation. we scheduled an appointment with her primary care physician that one of my sisters was able to attend with my mother.  after a mini test and a referral to a neurologist for an mri the results came back showing a pretty normal brain for someone her age and a diagnoses of mild dementia.in the immediate aftermath we made sure we had access to her bank accounts so we can monitor activity. she has given her pcp permission to speak with us about her care and we can all look up her medical information on the online portal for her drs. office. we also have the ability to track her by her iphone when she remembers to keep it with her.  i brought her to stay with me for a month over the winter with the plan of having her evaluate if she wanted to come and stay with me permanently. my sisters have done the same. over the course of the past 6 to 8 months it is apparent to us that mom has some serious deficits. she still has trouble focusing on dates and times. she takes blood pressure and diabetes medication that we can't get her to stick with consistently. we have tried the pill containers with the days of the week and all of that stuff, she just doesn't remember that she needs to take them. she still drives and is familiar enough with everything at home that she knows where things are and how to get to her house, but in the last few days a friend of hers, who is a saint and spends a lot of time with her, informed us that she was out with mom for lunch and when they left the restaurant mom couldn't remember where she parked her car and had trouble remembering how to get to her friends house to drop her off.she is flying out to stay with me this sunday. the original plan was to have her here for a week or two, but i'm starting to question if i can let her go home, and just typing that has made me start crying. i'm already feeling overwhelmed and i feel like things aren't going to get any easier.i have drafted a financial and medical power of attorney and plan to take her into my office on monday, where we have several notaries, to get them executed. i'm scheduling an appointment with a local geriatrician with the hopes of getting a more detailed assessment of her cognitive deficits. i have also reached out to my local county office of adult and aging services to see what resources they might have. i plan to discuss with her, as i have previously, what her thoughts are. i have told her from the beginning that i want her to be as much a part of this process as possible as opposed to feeling like it's something that is happening to her, but her insight into the gravity of her illness is poor and i don't have any faith that she has a reliable memory of any of the detailed conversations we have had around the issue. when we do discuss it she is open and her responses remain fairly consistent. i am also thinking about seeing if i can set up tours of some local long term residential memory care facilities so she can get a look at them now while she's at a point where she can still give me feedback about what she does and does not like so down the road i'm not flying blind. there is a part of me that feels like all of this might be too much for her too, so i don't know. i'm going to wait to see what the geriatrician has to say, but i think i'm looking at two options. one is letting her return home where she is familiar with things and has a solid support system of friends, and hiring someone to come in for a few hours in the mornings every day to make sure she knows what she has on the agenda for the day and that she's taking her meds. the other is having her stay here permanently. my sister was at my mother's earlier this week to pick mom up. she said the house is in good shape and well kept. mom pays her bills, is active with her friend group, and is capable of all her normal activities of daily living and caring for herself for the most part, but she's just very forgetful and gets disoriented. i'm just afraid that i'm going to let her go back and something bad is going to happen. so now that i've written way too much i guess i'm wondering if i'm doing everything i should. is there more i should do with her when she's here? am i trying to do too much and will it confuse her? if she is going to stay here permanently, is it terrible of me to just make that decision and keep her here without any kind of lead up or preparation for her to leave where she has been for the past 50 years? would allowing her to return home for a short period of time to get things organized at her house confuse her even more than just having her stay here and having me go back to get necessary things on my own without her? for everyone who has been doing this for a while what are the things i'm not doing at these early stages that i should be, and what sort of things can i do to help her function as independently as possible for as long as possible considering she's on the very front end of this thing?

Does the Guilt Ever Go Away?
appreciative of this sub. was kinda here on an old account years ago and wrote some posts. anyway, my grandmother passed in 2019. 3 years ago this month. she had vascular dementia (specific type wasn't ever diagnosed but her symptoms and likely cause of dementia were all aligned with vascular dementia). she never forgot who we were. she loved when we were all in the house. she would call us some days every 30 mins for no reason. some days she was paranoid. i felt so closed in some days but i'd go back to those days in a snap if i could have her back. anyway, i still feel so much guilt at yelling at her, being short with her, etc. i helped my mom care for her then my sister returned to help. she was super easy to care for compared to most but getting her to listen many times was so hard and i know it was the dementia but also she was a stubborn thing and i felt part of that came through too. i feel so bad for yelling though. i wasn't angry. just frustrated. i feel bad for not giving her the attention she needed some days. especially after my mom got cancer. my sister and i were so worried because of the cancer treatments. we fed and changed my grandma and our caretaker was super helpful during that time. i want to apologize to her. let her know i love her (i think she knew). but i just feel so guilty and feel like some of the diverted attention caused her eventual downturn. i miss that woman fiercely and watching her siblings pass away is making my grief come back harder. i wouldn't wish this disease on anyone.

What do I do with my suspicions of dementia in a parent?
my mom is nearly 70. earlier this year, my mom was doing something weird.  basically more often than not she was in a silent mood to me.  i live at home and i am mindful of my own attitude and mood.  i am not critical or sarcastic.  i am always helping with jobs and paying bills.  i can't think of a reason for the silence.  it wasn't the first time.  the silence was on and off for months. one morning she might not be talk to me and than the next she could be trying to be my best friend.  the evenings as well.  some evenings after work, she's sitting in her chair and i would be lucky if i got 'hello' out of her.   any attempt at conversation from me was met with one word replies.  then there would be days she would be in the silence mode and she would start prancing around the house and get her jacket and looked as if she was making progress to go out and then the next second i would hear the front door close.  not even a 'goodbye' from her.  no speech to tell me where she's going.  if she's going for a walk or to the shops. this was the behaviour that caught me off guard.  i thought it was so weird.   i was able to think back over the past 2 years and there were some other behaviours too and it's only now that i am piecing things together and thinking maybe dementia might be setting in. my understanding of dementia though is that there is a forgetfulness or confusion.  i will admit, there is some mixing up of things from her but it's ever so mild and i can be the same when i am busy and stressed.   a relatively new behaviour from her is ocd cleaning.  the youngest is gone now from the nest and she had a lot of focus on him and helping him.  she's now cleaning every day and a lot of it i think is ocd cleaning.  this is difficult for me because my suspicions of dementia is not showing up as forgetfulness.  it's just some odd stuff on mood and angers and ocd stuff. every day is different with her.  some days are ok and then other days she's just flat if that makes any sense. i don't know how to go forward with my suspicions.   i feel like i can't talk to her about this. she's not going to welcome any of this and it will likely result in an outburst from her. i don't feel comfortable ringing or writing or emailing to the gp practice. i would feel more comfortable talking to a gp face to face.  we attend to the same practice.  i wonder would it be ok for me to make an appointment for myself at some point and raise concerns about my mom so they can maybe not it on her chart and start the process of investigating. i think there's definitely something going on but it's not showing up as a typical forgetfulness. i know some replies to me before said sometimes utis can present in a similar way.  i don't know if it is a uti because i can go back 2/3 years with pieces of my mom's behaviours.  if it was an undiagnosed uti surely she would be in sepsis by now.

It's Both Comforting and Depressing How Much Better My Grandmother Gets When Someone Needs "Help"
don't know if anyone has experienced this, my grandmother is in mid stage, moving into late. we can have an amazing dinner with her getting to see her great-grandkids, she will have a wonderful time, but the next day she forgets it happened.  sometimes, if you remind her, she will partially remember it, other times she has no recollection.  but the moment she is told someone in the family is sick, hurt, needs help, it's like her mind reverts back a decade.  six months ago when my mom had surgery, she called everyday to check on her.  she didn't need to be reminded or prompted.  a few months ago when her great-grandchild had covid, same thing.  yesterday, i was pretty sick.  i called up her and my grandfather to let the know that i was, and wouldn't be stopping by.  twenty minutes later, they were dropping off some fresh cut fruit for me and a bottle of juice.  talked to my grandfather on the phone and he said it wasn't his idea.  when i called, she was having a bad day.  laying on the couch, not dressed at noon time, confused about where she was.  the moment she found out i was sick though, my grandfather said she got up, she put on her clothes, went into the kitchen, got out some fruit from the fridge, cut it up, bagged it up, and told him her to my house to leave it on my porch.then this morning, i get an phone call from her, she's asking how i'm feeling, asking if i ate the fruit, telling me to make sure i drink a lot of liquids, and she just comes off as sounding very cognitive during the entire conversation.  like i said in the title, it feels both comforting and depressing at the same time.  it's just so insane how the mind works.  her mind has been breaking down for years now.  on my daily visits i'm asked the same set of questions every time.  when sundowning she gets angry, agitated, doesn't even recognize my grandfather most nights.  but **she** is still there.  it's as if the moment she hears any one of us is sick, hurt, in trouble, her brain just uses everything it has left to kick into overdrive for a time period in order for her to focus on doing what she did for her entire life, take care of family.

i am in the early days of dealing with the possibility of dementia with my mom.  i feel at times there is something off with her. something not quite right.  it's different every single day.  some days are good and then other days are not so good. the main behaviours have been mood changes and easily angered, some silliness, some ocd. mood changes - some days she talkative and other days there's nothing but silence from hereasily angered - there were incidents where she blows up at me easily and over nonsensical things. like i was preparing a parcel for sending away before and she went into a range at me. another time i was looking for a pan from the cupboard and that was another episode from her. another time i reached for a clean kitchen towel. small incidents that would anger her. another time she blew up at me over the laptop when i was setting it up. she has no knowledge of computers or internet and i was setting up my laptop to sit down together with her and she blew up at me shouting - 'i will do it's. silliness - getting me to do online shopping for her and getting me to buy her more shoes even though she has loads of shoes.  last year during lockdown she wanted more 'going out' or 'fancy' shoes for wearing to am event.  she has a wardrobe of shoes for such events but she wanted more even though we had no events to go to.  we were in lockdown.  i think in her mind she thought the whole country was going to break out and go dancing at each crossroads the minute the pandemic ended and she was buying to party. i don't know. she was never ocd when i was small. she is still not very particular ocd but she is spending a lot of her time cleaning and needlessly cleaning more and more. there's a lot of time and effort spent of cleaning.  it's almost as if she wants to maintain control. i know a lot of the time forgetfulness and confusion presents with dementia so this is very difficult for me..  i think there is some forgetfulness but it's very, very mild and hardly noticable. this wasn't the first thing for me to raise alarm bells. it was earlier this year after yet another silent episode from her that i started piecing together bits and pieces over the past 2 to 4 years with when i started thinking on the lines of dementia. i think she is going senile. every day is different from her. i am in a place where i don't know how to move forward with my suspicions. i am apprehensive about emailing or writing to our gp practice. we attend the same practice.  i would feel more comfortable speaking face to face with my gp to see if they could put a note on my mom's medical file to explore dementia for when my mom goes next. today i found something new with my mom.  she had a rack of clothes drying and there amongst some of her undies was a bra that looked familiar to me. i had a closer look and it was one of my bras for sure. we would be different sizes and we would shop in different places. i looked at the tage and it was my size.  i am plus size so my band size would be larger than hers.   my mom never does laundry for me so there's no way she picked up this up and put it into a load of her own laundry. there's no way this bra was lying around the home for her to pick up.  another thing is that i have my clothes and undies divided up into good wear and every day wear.  this bra would be a bra for good wear.  it was a good bra.  i remember last year when going to an event, i thought i had more bras but i couldn't find them.  i even checked my laundry basket and definitely a lot of my good bras were gone. i didn't think anything more of this. i thought maybe it's in a bag somewhere. and here today i found my mom with one of my bras. i am completely shocked that she has a bra from me.  so she robbed my bra and possibly even more as if it was hers. there's no excuse in the world to rob my bra though.   i know if i asked her she would give me an excuse of buying it in a second hand shop. i found her with other things before that looked familiar and she told me that she bought it before. it's just a new incident to add to the list of doubts that i have.

Lost my mom at 24. Question about gene test..
sorry for the long story. there is a summary of my question and a tldr at the bottom.  i want to give some backstory. my mom got early onset alzheimer's/dementia and over the course of 8years i watched her completely forget who she was, who i was. near the end before we put her in a care home i was changing her diapers. she would talk to her reflection in the mirror like it was her friend. i'd come out in the middle of the night sometimes to find her just standing there staring into darkness or facing a corner. it was really unnerving. she started getting symptoms when i was about 16 or so and she died when i was 23, my younger brother only 18.  her dad died of alzheimer's but his didn't set in until he was around 80years old. her symptoms started when she was about 40. she always said she wouldn't die of that disease and technically, she didn't. she progressed really rapidly in the care home and in her last few days she became violent, attacking other residents in their sleep. so she was sent to a psych and they prescribed her some medication. well this medication made her really dizzy and a couple days later she fell and hit her head. she died of brain trauma/internal bleeding. so her statement did stand true in the end, she didn't let that horrible disease be the thing to take her out.. although i believe she died long before her physical body did anyways.. now none of that is really the point of this post. since she had early onset that means she carried a specific gene that caused it. this is hereditary so me and my younger brother have a 50/50 chance of carrying it. this gene can be found in a dna/gene test.  if i carry this specific early onset gene it is pretty much 100% that i will get early onset alzheimer's. if i don't carry it there's still always the chance i can get it later in life but it's not a certain thing.tldr:  if i don't carry the early onset gene id get some bit of peace of mind. but if i do carry it there are 2 cons and 2pros that come to mind. con #1- it will most certainly effect  health or life insurance right? con #2- i feel like i'd psych myself out and think about it all the time, worry if any small thing i forget is symptoms setting in etc. pro #1) i could likely start trying tests studies treatments &amp; prevention methods early on and pro #2) i would try harder than i have been to live my life to the absolute fullest knowing that i could die in my 40s. i already live by this to an extent as i know every day isn't guaranteed but i'd definitely spend a lot more time doing the things i love in the next 10years or so. i know in the end it comes down to what i want to do but my question for you is, would you want to know?

I’m bone tired &amp; sad (TW: suicide)
hey everyone. i just need a place to vent. so i’m a single childless woman in my 40s who moved in with my mother to care for her, which meant leaving behind my community of friends several states away. in addition to having dementia, my mom is also a narcissist. since relocating to my mother’s, i’ve been busy managing her care while also trying to set up a life for myself: searching for jobs, trying to find social groups to join, trying to get enough exercise to support my mental &amp; physical health. i hate being unemployed, i feel like such a loser, and it’s so draining to spend every day hunting for &amp; applying for jobs. anyhow. friday was my birthday. i told myself i could have the day off from job searching and exercise and all the “to-do’s” i assign myself. i didn’t have any plans and i don’t have any friends here to celebrate with, but i at least wanted to be gentle and kind with myself. of course my mother forgot my birthday. and i reminded her. and she went out to the drugstore and got me a hallmark card and a bag of shitty chocolates. i know i shouldn’t have expected anything but it still made me so sad. i’ve sacrificed so much for her and i’m so lonely and have no idea what the hell i’m doing w my life other than caring for a thankless old lady and a dog. i ended up going for a hike on my birthday. it was fine. but when i pulled into the driveway of my mom’s house, i just sat in my car…contemplating what the point of it all is. telling myself i did not want another birthday like this next year. feeling just pretty hopeless and tired. thought about not going on. i have a therapist who i see weekly, thank god for that. but otherwise i am completely alone, despite my efforts to meet people. there is no other family involved in my mom’s care. it’s just on me. i thought i’d reach out here because i’m sure at least some of you can relate. i’m sorry for such a long post. thanks for reading.

Father with Parkinson's calls late at night, poor relationship (long ramble sorry)
my 68yo dad was diagnosed with parkinson's disease around 8 years ago. he had to retire from his main job but i think he is still quite active. i live quite far away from him. he has issues with short-term memory and comprehending things. he lives alone but has a girlfriend who lives in a neighboring town. their relationship is awful and they seem to fight whenever they have contact. she's a pretty horrible person and i don't know why they have stayed "together". he has always been quite narcissistic and psychologically abusive to his girlfriend and also previously towards my mother (physically and psychologically). we have never had a close relationship and he was not really involved in my upbringing, except when i used to visit him as a child for school holidays.during the past couple of years he has been through some periods of really dementia-ish behavior but probably more delerium, like night-time anxiety and calling at crazy hours like after midnight, freaking out because he is having normal (?worsening) parkinson's symptoms. he hadn't been taking his melatonin and wasn't sleeping well. that seems to have settled down. he frequently fails to take his parkinson's medications on-time. it's probably partly forgetfulness and partly denial / not thinking he needs to. he will often wait until his symptoms get bad which is then too late. he says he sees a different doctor each time he visits the medical practice but i still think he would have been advised about the importance of taking the meds regularly and on time regardless of current symptom severity. he has dyskinesia now (involuntary movements). he won't allow anyone to accompany him to the doctor.he has generally refused home help even though he does not cook - his kitchen doesn't even have an oven and his girlfriend says he won't even microwave himself something. he just eats out for every meal, basically, or goes to his girlfriend's house. he does not use the pill boxes we bought for him to carry his meds so that he has some pills handy in all the places he goes such as the car, his home, his girlfriend's home, and previously his work briefcase. back in around 2018 i had to write to his doctor about his driving as people from his church noticed him driving home late at night, weaving all over the road "as if he was drunk". he passed his driving test anyway. for years his teeth have looked terrible and he clearly wasn't brushing. when i visited him i saw a very old, mangled-looking toothbrush in the bathroom when i had recently ordered groceries for him which included a new toothbrush. when i asked him where it was he said he had already used it up and thrown it away (clearly not true as the one he had there looked ancient). years ago i ordered him some assistive aids for parkinson's such as buttoning loops/hooks to help with doing up buttons, key and tap turners, a liftware spoon which compensates for tremor movements, etc. he has stashed all these things under the bed and they have never been opened.my sibling and i have really tried to help in many ways over the years, like trying to help him fix issues with his home that for some reason he hasn't been able to organise himself, and arrange an assessment for in-home services but it didn't really go well and his doctors don't seem interested in assessing his cognitive function. if you call or write to them they regard you as a controlling family member and nobody has any power to make him get assessed, so nothing happens. everyone gives lip service to "early diagnosis" being important but nobody ever actually seems to want to assess for or diagnose it. i have also found this in my work life (i work in health). we have kind of given up. when we have tried to make suggestions and help him in the past he's become combative and mean and we have never really had a close relationship anyway. i feel a bit guilty for not picking up every time he calls but i cannot for my own sanity. he has been calling me quite often, not every night but sometimes consecutive nights in a row depending on what's going on at the time. for the past year-and-a-half, i would guess that his calls to me are averaging once every 2 days but he will often call me multiple times in one day. i have a child to look after and i don't like talking to him. he always expects me to stroke his ego and repeats the same things, wants to talk about his time in the army and asks me about my life which i don't really want to share because he then blabs things to my other abusive family members. in the past we have never really had frequent phone calls and it just feels inappropriate and weird now. it's just awkward and unpleasant for me and a chore, and he will go on and on and not understand that my child needs me. talking to him is draining and he still treats me like i am a child (i'm 38). he always wants to bitch about other family members, evaluate everyone's life-choices and talk about himself. i still feel like i have to do what he wants because of how authoritarian he was when i was a kid (and still is). i understand that in his situation he's isolated and trying to hold on to his dignity ad self-respect and wants to feel heard and relevant like his opinions matter, and i do do that for him sometimes. often he will call under the pretense of "seeing how i am going" and put on this excessive fake concern about me when he has never really asked or cared in the past because he has had better things to do and i find it really uncomfortable.i don't really know what i want with this post, maybe just support? i just needed to vent about how frustrating the situation is and how sometimes you can't really do anything. he has lots of acquaintances, goes to church, has always been very extroverted, even forcefully so with people. he kind of pressures people to be his friend and talk to him. he is a skilled manipulator and good at appearing to be a "great guy" who everyone likes but deep-down he is very self-centred and does not feel remorse when he is abusive towards others. he will never apologise for his actions and is now more prone to emotional outbursts if you try to hold him accountable for things he says or does.just wondering if anyone else has a similar situation and anything that's been helpful? basically i understand he's lost many outlets including his work and a significant amount of function (eg., he doesn't drive much now), and expects me to fill in the blanks for him. he is involved with the local returned serviceman's club and has reconnected with his old army mates. i think that at times he just gets "the fear" and wants/needs to be talked down, but i can't do that for him every time he wants it. it does seem like a bit of a transition into him being more childlike.

Should my dad have to ask for pain medication? Nursing home not giving pain meds after hip fracture unless he explicitly asks.
last week my dad fell out of bed at his nursing home and badly broke his hip. he had surgery placing a rod, screws and a plate, was in the icu for a week and sent back to his nursing home. i saw him this weekend two days after he was discharged and he seemed really out of it. i assumed he was on lots of pain meds.  he told me he was in a lot of pain. he was just super sleepy and couldn’t stay awake, talked in a whisper. today his palliative care nurse called and said he was doing so well and hasn’t asked for pain meds since he was discharged from the hospital last week. i told him about my visit and learned he had no pain meds that day at all. the nurse said they give them when the patient asks. i’m not sure my dad understands to ask for pain meds. for context he comes across very lucid at times. you almost question his dementia diagnosis until you realize he thinks he is working at the nursing home not a resident. then he talks about how they are holding his hostage and refusing to pay him and he can’t find his car. and he thinks he’s owed a paycheck from a place he hasn’t worked for in 40 years. it’s strange. he has also forgotten he has a brother and sister. i’m not convinced he understands to ask for and can make a connection between pain meds and pain. also worth noting the palliative care team got involved because he was very combative both physically and verbally prior to his hip fracture and refusing to take meds. they determined oral meds stress him so part of his care plan is to reduce unnecessary pills. like cutting out his fish oil supplement and other vitamins. so the excuse was they don’t want to upset him by overwhelming him with pills unless he asks. does this seem right?  do i just not understand how this works?  i’ve never had a parent or any family member go through this so i may not understand.

last week my dad fell out of bed at his nursing home and badly broke his hip. he had surgery placing a rod, screws and a plate, was in the icu for a week and sent back to his nursing home. i saw him this weekend two days after he was discharged and he seemed really out of it. i assumed he was on lots of pain meds.  he told me he was in a lot of pain. he was just super sleepy and couldn’t stay awake, talked in a whisper. today his palliative care nurse called and said he was doing so well and hasn’t asked for pain meds since he was discharged from the hospital last week. i told him about my visit and learned he had no pain meds that day at all. the nurse said they give them when the patient asks. i’m not sure my dad understands to ask for pain meds. for context he comes across very lucid at times. you almost question his dementia diagnosis until you realize he thinks he is working at the nursing home not a resident. then he talks about how they are holding his hostage and refusing to pay him and he can’t find his car. and he thinks he’s owed a paycheck from a place he hasn’t worked for in 40 years. it’s strange. he has also forgotten he has a brother and sister. i’m not convinced he understands to ask for and can make a connection between pain meds and pain. also worth noting the palliative care team got involved because he was very combative both physically and verbally prior to his hip fracture and refusing to take meds. they determined oral meds stress him so part of his care plan is to reduce unnecessary pills. like cutting out his fish oil supplement and other vitamins. so the excuse was they don’t want to upset him by overwhelming him with pills unless he asks. does this seem right?  do i just not understand how this works?  i’ve never had a parent or any family member go through this so i may not understand.

Already posted to r/Alzheimer’s - just a rant/plea for advice
i’m a 20 year old full-time nursing major. i currently work and recently had to quit collegiate track. i’ve become a full-time caregiver for my wonderful grandmother, 93yrs old, that helped to raise me as a kid.it was december when my gram was diagnosed with alzheimer’s. i knew i couldn’t cope with the fact that i knew the stages of it/how it progressed/etc and my brain had ended up blacking that out in order to protect me mentally. it was until last week that i had decided to break my own heart and revisit the progression of it when i was looking into respite care.my gram is a great great great grandmother. we have a relatively large family. i only mention that because i never thought that being a caregiver would be so ungodly lonely. i’m so alone in this. i already suffered from gad, ptsd, and unspecified depression prior to this, and i hate to sound so so selfish but it had increased horribly since taking on this job. i have sought out a therapist, but it’s through my college and will be discontinued in the next few weeks.i was always unphased by everything i had to do to and for my confused/sundowning patients at work. i always saw my gram in them and knew they deserved the utmost respect and love with the unforgiving situation they were in… but it’s so different when it’s your own family member. to say it’s difficult is possibly the biggest understatement i’ve ever come across in my life. i have so much guilt going anywhere, even if it’s for an hour or so. or even just going to class since i’m a commuter. i get violently ill and especially panicky at the thought of it. she is still mostly independent (can clothe/feed herself) and won’t wander off. it makes me so sick to my stomach to even think about what i’m missing out on because that’s so selfish and disgusting of me. i want to be with her. i want to do everything i can for her. but the thing is, i’ve destroyed myself in these past few months. completely and utterly ruined my mental health. i absolutely do not blame this on her though. i’d die for her in a heart beat.i never thought i’d see every inch of my own family member. i never thought i’d come home from my job at a hospital only to continue exactly what i did at work for my grandmother. cleaning her in every way and down every crack. i also was never prepared for the fact that i had to know every single thing about her, which i have no problem with now. but taking on her medications/making sure she takes and receives them, her appointments, taking her everywhere she needs to go, taking all calls that were for her because she doesn’t understand a single word they’re saying, making sure she gets some sort of stimulation so she doesn’t deteriorate even faster than she already is, being in charge of all of her bank/money/financial things and writing all checks because she forgot how to spell her name, everything you could possibly imagine. i didn’t know i’d be a parent figure at 20. i live every day in fear of her passing. she’s a dnr/dni and i’m constantly reminded every time i go to the fridge and see the big pink order on our fridge. i wake up constantly throughout the night whether it be because i want to make sure i still hear her breathing, or because she made the slightest noise and i’m praying she’s okay. i live my life in fear of something happening to her. and as a nursing major, of course i am burdened with the knowledge of signs/symptoms of impending death and i hate it more than anything. it makes me so nauseous. i didn’t know i’d be waking up to her screaming for her mother in the middle of the night. i didn’t know i’d wake up to her completely naked and running around because she claimed her dad was trying to kidnap and kill her. i didn’t know that i’d have to learn that the only thing to soothe my sundowning grandmother was to let her into my bed because i convinced her my room was safe and free of any harmful person, only to have her wet my bed because she can’t control it. but i will never ever blame her for that. i’ve sought out a home health nurse to visit her occasionally, but the process takes about 6 months according to her case manager. my mom didn’t see that it would be necessary in 6 months (possibly assuming her mother wouldn’t make it 6 months) and so i’m yet again alone in this. i’m the only person that lives with her. she has 5 children, and innumerable grandchildren/great grandchildren/etc, yet nobody calls her. nobody visits her. nobody cared especially when she was diagnosed. they didn’t care to make time to deal with that.since i’ve quit track due to the situation, and considering that i’m also a commuter, i don’t have any support either besides my incredible boyfriend, but he can’t take on everything i endure.and that’s the thing. i can’t take on everything either, yet i still wake up and attempt to do everything i can every. single. day. no matter how much it destroys me.

Is there treatment for dementia? Can dementia be slowed down?
i have recognized some changes in my mom who is nearly 70.  these changes are mainly in mood and aggression over slight things.  there is some senselessness too.   memory loss and confusion is not a big issue. it's very mild and hardly noticable. the biggest issues that i see is mood and easily angered, and senselessness. it's only recently when i am piecing a lot of these issues together and i think she is going senile.   i have suspicions of maybe dementia but my biggest issue here is that it's not presenting with a major loss of memory and confusion that you would associate with dementia and alzheimers. every day is different with her. i am actually seriously thinking that maybe dementia might be coming in. it's early days yet. i'm at a point where i don't know how to proceed. i know she won't be open to me having a chat with her.  she won't welcome that and i think it will be met with hostility from her.  we do attend the same gp practice so i am thinking about chatting to a gp at my next appointment and give her my suspicions of the possibility of dementia and tell her what i am saying her.  memory loss is limited and not an issue or a huge concern of mine.  it's other things presenting - mood, personality, aggression, some senselessness there's even a type of ocd setting in. she never had ocd when i was younger. my question here is -is there treatment for dementia? can the progression of dementia be slowed down? if this is the case, it would be worth my while raising my concerns now with a doctor instead of waiting some years and seeing more serious symptoms of memory loss, confusion and losing the ability to perhaps care for herself. if the progression of the condition can be slowed down, i think that would help her and me too.

What do I email the doctors?
my mom is aging.  she's nearly 70.  i think she's going senile. every day is different with her.  some days are good and then other days are bad and then other days she is middle of the road. my observations on my mom is that she's moody. i don't know what way the wind is going to blow on any given day.  these moods are different every time. some times there are outbursts and then other days there's a complete silence from her. a lot of this stuff makes no sense.  for example, there were times when my brother, an adult, was careless with alcohol and perhaps even drugs. my mom would develop unhappyiness towards him and she would misdirect her anger to me and rage up at me.  as if i encouraged him to drink and take drugs.  i don't and we were polar opposites of each other.   i work hard for a wage but unfortunately it doesn't pay a rent or a mortgage and so i live at home.  i help at home.  my brother was different.  he was unemployed.  we were polar opposites. me, being female my mom saw me as weaker perhaps and she never lashed out at my brother, only me. i am the only one at home paying towards bills and i am mindful of my attitude. i am not sarcastic or critical.  i work hard and often i just keep to myself.  then other times, i would come home to what is complete silence from my mom  no words, no speech or no conversation from her. then there were episodes from my mom where she demonstrated complete senselessness.  like there could be 100s worth of bills due and all she cared about was getting me to shop online for her for new shoes.  then there are episodes where she's behaving as if she wants to be my best friend. then there were times i caught her eavesdropping on my brother. basically i think my mom is going senile.  it's not showing up as a typical forgetfulness that you would associate with dementia and alzheimers.  sometimes there is a forgetfulness but it's mild and hardly noticable.does this sound like dementia? there's definitely something up with her and i think it might be worth exploring the dementia route although it's not showing up as a typical forgetfulness.  last night i came home from work and there might have been an hello but that was it from her. there was no talk or conversation or speech from her. the same tone this morning in the kitchen.  any attempt of conversation was met with one word.  eventually blowing up at me for using a fresh tea towel.  this is usually the pattern of her angry explosions - days of coldness followed eventually by an outburst over nothing.

hi everyone    question... my parents are paying me a visit (first time in years, due to covid) and my mother is displaying very strange behaviour. with all respect, she has always been a unique character (no education, very limited social connections her entire life, never worked, anger management issues, diagnosed bipolar, chronic depression, etc...). i am grateful for the sacrifices and care she gave me. i am a successful, well-functioninf adult because of her, but truth off my chest - it took me years to get my own mental health straight after some of the damage she has done, i do not love her, and although i don't want to deny her access to my family, i want to keep a healthy distance. anyways. she doesn't strike me as massively different as usual, she is her natural self. but some of her bad temper/behaviour seems just... "amplified". i am starting to wonder if this is a medical condition. it is hard to explain. a couple of examples in the last 48h.   she wanted to cook a roast chicken and chips for us at dinner (great!). she asked how to prepare it, i recommended she just put the chicken in the oven a 180*c for 1h30 and leave it (keeping it simple). an argument ensued (she always gets angry very quickly, it is unpleasant but nothing unusual). she wanted to know what to do for the stuffing (we don't need stuffing, it's good as it is), if she needed to cover it in butter (no, it's not a turkey, chicken is fatty enough), how to cut the chicken (no, keep it whole, we'll carve it at the end), etc... i just stuck to the simple instructions. she kept entertaining suggestions until, in the end, i lost patience, insisted on my simple steps and she reluctantly agreed to just put it as is in the oven. anyway - fast forward half a day, my family arrive to her holiday rental for dinner. it all smells good, i go check on the chicken. she decided to turn the chicken upside down at some point during the cooking. whatever. she left it for 2h30 (and it would still be roasting had i not asked her how long the chicken had been in the oven). when it came to taking it out of the oven, we had another argument about what cloth to use. i recommended against using a thin polyester cloth she randomly grabbed to take out the hot tray. for reference, this was not at her home, so it was not the equipment she is used to using. she insisted and went for it, the cloth started to melt immediately on the tray and i had to actually forcibly step in and intervene to remove it and stop her from burning herself. she got angry again, saying that she had lived more than me and could take a chicken out of the oven. i took over (with a thick cotton cloth), which made her cry. oh and she had forgotten to cook the chips (so we ate the chicken while the chips were cooking).     another argument was about her laptop. it refused to turn on (blatantly, the battery was empty). she told me it went in "security mode" (... what?! -,-') and she needed to bring it to the repair shop (... what!!??). i tell her it just needs to be charged, and ask her where the charger is. she says the charger is in the laptop, because it is portable. we argue about chargers/batteries for a while, she gets angry again. i show her the charger, connect it to the laptop, put it in her hands, and tell her to just plug it in and leave the laptop be for a while. she tells me she doesn't know how to do that, gets angry, goes back to "the laptop is in security mode". i tell her to plug it in and that she knows how to plug something in. she gets angrier about me being "unhelpful" but as i walk odd, she reluctantly complies. lo and behold - after 15min the laptop just boots normally. we discuss further (calmly this time, yay), and she tells me she regularly goes to the local computer shop and pay $40 to get her laptop out of "security mode". yes, i want to kill the shop owners.    anyway, i could go on. it is like this all. the. time. my mom has always got angry quickly her entire life, i lived my childhood in-between shouts and arguments. but it's now happening for everything. and i mean every thing. she argues about opening the car door. she can't peel a carrot properly, gets angry when i peel them further when she is "done". when my young son greets her with a white blouse, green scrubs and a stethoscope around the neck, she asks me what he is dressed up as (and gets angry when i am surprised she can't see it's a doctor costume - "how am i supposed to know", she says). i don't know if it is me being shocked by her attitude because i have lived a long time with no contact with her or if she has got worse. but it is exhausting. it is impossible to have a conversation on anything that is remotely non-basic, it goes completely over her head and she just doesn't understand what it is about. my dad confirms the type of interactions i describe is his daily life. he is numb to it. i only admire his patience explaining the simplest of things again, and again, and again, in spite of being shouted at in the rudest of ways. i can't stay calm like he does. his relationship with her is clearly beyond repair, but he stays at his post, sticks to his principles/duties like a boss and won't leave her despite all she does to him. she never worked, has no pension - if he leaves she is absolutely f*cked, which he will not allow. i am in awe about his ability to remain steadfast.  my parents live abroad, i can't do much with their medical support. but i wonder. my dad says she had multiple brain scans, and they were all ok. is what i describe dementia? or is it just who she is and i forgot how bad she was? how do i know the difference? how should i behave?    i am sorry if this is not the right forum, i just don't know where to look or who to turn to.   thanks

The doctors don’t see it
new to the group. forgive me if there are resources here covering this. if so, pointers would be appreciated. my father just turned 78 and his memory has been failing for at least 8-10 years, but initially it was just forgetfulness. about 6 years ago he had the first of several episodes of what were initially diagnosed as transient global amnesia. he would seem fine, but think it was years prior. in 2016 he thought it was 2012. (we we’re a tiny bit jealous, as we wished it wasn’t 2016, but so it goes.) he was oddly calm about it, but would act like he had time traveled without knowing it… for about 5 minutes, and then reset to the beginning. he went to neurologists, he had tests. they told him it was nothing. but it happened several times over the next two years, and meanwhile his memory got worse and worse. then he began to have seizures. i think that it was seizures all along, but he crashed his car for the first time 3.5 years ago. that time he convinced everyone that he fell asleep. the next crash was 2 years ago, and that time the paramedics witnessed a seizure. not grand mal. he often seems awake and agitated. sometimes combative. his license was suspended and he went on meds. and he thought he was fine. but his memory got worse and worse. and whenever he sees a doctor he just charms them, and they never diagnose any cognitive decline. so he thinks he’s fine. right before new years he totaled his brand new truck. this time he had a grand mal in the er. i forbade him to drive again, and he agreed, but reluctantly. i went to the neurologist with him this time. once again all scans were clear. they changed his meds and seem willing to let him drive after 6 months. but he can’t remember when he has seizures. unless he crashes a car he doesn’t really seem to believe that they happen. and now he is behaving on a day to day basis like he has dementia. he nearly burned down my stepsister’s house the other day trying to light a broken wood stove 1 hour after being reminded not to use it. many other examples. the thing is, i don’t live very nearby. i only see him occasionally. i have arranged to legally take charge of financial stuff, but i can’t be there all the time. and none of his doctors seem to think there’s anything wrong except seizures. how can i approach them in a way that they will take seriously when he is so invested in convincing them that there’s no issue? everything is landing on my stepsister, who is also dealing with her mother’s physical decline. especially since now neither of them can drive. i am really getting worried that he’s unable to care for himself.

My grandmother forgot I transitioned, and I don't mind
sorry if i'm just clogging this place up, i have a lot on my mind after i visited my grandmother yesterday and i need to get some of it out somewhere.i'm twenty years old and trans ftm. i've been out for around 6 years now. as my grandmothers dementia progressed, i knew that one day she would forget about my transition. i also knew that it wouldn't be personal if she did forget. it's just how dementia is. even though i'd told her it's okay if she slips up, and i don't mind what she says or whether she calls me her granddaughter or grandson, she still did her best. in january i visited her, and i was unsure if she remembered me due to her seemingly avoiding talking too much to me. afterwards my dad spoke to her and asked her upfront if she knew who i was. she apologised to him, saying of course she knew who i was, she just couldn't remember my gender and didn't want to upset me by making a mistake. it was sweet, but also sad. and i felt really bad about it, too. despite her mind working against her, her top priority was my comfort. i visited her again two weeks ago and this continued.then yesterday, me and my dad went to visit her in her new care home. she couldn't tell who i was, and she asked me to take my mask off, which i did (with staff approval.) upon seeing my face, she immediately grabbed me and pulled me into the tightest hug a frail 83 year old could possibly give, repeating things such as "my beautiful granddaughter", telling me how much of a pretty woman i was, and talking about how she'd been waiting for me to visit her for so long. she probably got a lot of confused looks from other residents and maybe even staff, but i didn't care. and i didn't care that she forgot, either. i always told her it was okay if she did. it's a sign that her memory is still obviously deteriorating, but really, that's to be expected. she has two types of dementia at once (dual dementia) so sadly, things are probably going to decline quickly. but right now, i'm just glad she doesn't have to worry about "slipping up" anymore.

Talking to loved one about the memory problems
my grandmother (77) has been acting strange over the past year or year and a half. it started with her forgetting little things more often, having more problems cooking, and needing more help with technology related tasks. not unusual, except sometimes these tasks were things like changing the batteries in her remote. then she wanted to add mom onto her bank account to help her make sure her bills are paid and everything. in all fairness, though, she was preparing to go stay with my aunt for a few months, so it made sense to have us handle that stuff. she's back from her trip, though, and it's a lot easier to see the changes. still nothing massive, but she's repeating the same stories a lot, the dogs got fed twice the other night because she forgot mom had already fed them (she was in the room when they ate the first time and definitely saw), things like that. she's also been kind of mean to my mother lately, and the other day, she accused us of throwing some of her cups away. that also isn't like her, but she and my mother have fought before, she brought it up to me earlier. someone with alzheimer's happened to come up in conversation, and she made a comment about how she knows she's going to end up like that someday, she just doesn't know when. it's worth mentioning that she knows a good bit about alzheimer's. she was a psychiatric nurse for awhile, and both her mother and her husband had it before they passed, and she was their caretaker. she also said that she knows my aunt thinks she's having memory problems, but she doesn't think they're that bad yet. i asked her gently if she's seen a doctor about it, and she said no, she didn't think it was necessary. i suggested that it might be a good idea, because maybe she just needs to use oxygen for her copd more often or something similar. she just said that she doesn't think she's out to lunch yet, and that it isn't that big of a deal yet. i wasn't sure what to say and i agreed. i figure that it's still kind of true because aside from maybe needing a little more guidance in her finances just to make sure everything is covered, nothing is preventing her from taking care of herself yet. but is there a best way to talk to loved ones about this? she's not the type to be afraid of talking about this kind of thing. she's been continuously making adjustments to her will to make sure everything is right just in case for the past 20 years, at least, she has already paid for her funeral and picked everything out (except for the flowers, because she doesn't know what season she'll pass in), toured several nursing homes for herself as well as papa, and let us know which one she'd like to be in if it was impossible for her to stay at home, etc.

my grandmother (77) has been acting strange over the past year or year and a half. it started with her forgetting little things more often, having more problems cooking, and needing more help with technology related tasks. not unusual, except sometimes these tasks were things like changing the batteries in her remote. then she wanted to add mom onto her bank account to help her make sure her bills are paid and everything. in all fairness, though, she was preparing to go stay with my aunt for a few months, so it made sense to have us handle that stuff. she's back from her trip, though, and it's a lot easier to see the changes. still nothing massive, but she's repeating the same stories a lot, the dogs got fed twice the other night because she forgot mom had already fed them (she was in the room when they ate the first time and definitely saw), things like that. she's also been kind of mean to my mother lately, and the other day, she accused us of throwing some of her cups away. that also isn't like her, but she and my mother have fought before, she brought it up to me earlier. someone with alzheimer's happened to come up in conversation, and she made a comment about how she knows she's going to end up like that someday, she just doesn't know when. it's worth mentioning that she knows a good bit about alzheimer's. she was a psychiatric nurse for awhile, and both her mother and her husband had it before they passed, and she was their caretaker. she also said that she knows my aunt thinks she's having memory problems, but she doesn't think they're that bad yet. i asked her gently if she's seen a doctor about it, and she said no, she didn't think it was necessary. i suggested that it might be a good idea, because maybe she just needs to use oxygen for her copd more often or something similar. she just said that she doesn't think she's out to lunch yet, and that it isn't that big of a deal yet. i wasn't sure what to say and i agreed. i figure that it's still kind of true because aside from maybe needing a little more guidance in her finances just to make sure everything is covered, nothing is preventing her from taking care of herself yet. but is there a best way to talk to loved ones about this? she's not the type to be afraid of talking about this kind of thing. she's been continuously making adjustments to her will to make sure everything is right just in case for the past 20 years, at least, she has already paid for her funeral and picked everything out (except for the flowers, because she doesn't know what season she'll pass in), toured several nursing homes for herself as well as papa, and let us know which one she'd like to be in if it was impossible for her to stay at home, etc.

I'm only 28, mom is 80, I'm overwhelmed
sorry this could get long. mostly a vent.first post here. my mom is showing signs of dementia. she has been for a year or two now. she remembers who we are, who she is, her past, even her bank account numbers and things that have been the same for several years. but she often forgets where she is, how long she's lived in her apartment, the day/year, current events. she has an appointment with her doctor soon to discuss everything and seek help.yesterday i became exponentially worried. she fell for a computer scammer. i had to leave work early to come help her reset all of her passwords and call her banks to make sure nothing was compromised. i spent six hours there in total, and tried my best to drill it into her the steps to take to avoid it. we agreed that leaving notes above her computer was a good idea so that she'd see them warning her and be able to stop it in its tracks if it happened again.well, today, not even 24 hours later, she did it again. she called me crying because she doesn't want me to remove her computer. she self isolates due to depression and doesn't have contact with the outside. she orders all her clothing and groceries on her computer and phone, but i would rather take them away than risk her losing what little financial independence she has left.she lives in independent living right now and if she would just leave her room she'd be able to have church service, watch movies, have dinner, play games and more all in the same building! but she hasn't left in over two years because she's depressed, so instead she non stop orders things online and is living almost like a hoarder (not unsanitary though), and now falling victim to scammers left and right.this isn't the first worrisome thing. a few weeks ago my husband, son, and i went to visit as a surprise and came into a smokey apartment because she'd left a pie in the over for who knows how long and it was black and burning in the oven. she had no idea because she forgot she put it in there and couldnt smell the burning or see the smoke. if we didn't show up she might have started a fire and the worst could have happened.she's fought us left and right about taking away any iota of freedom. she's physically capable of caring for herself, she can bathe etc. but she gets confused and forgets extremely important things from one second to the next and even today she told me she doesn't know how to protect her from herself.i don't know what to do. i'm barely 28, just got a good job, my son is under 10, i'm trying to go back to school and i'm so tired and overwhelmed. i don't know how to help her. i didn't sign up for this. not to mention, the first 17 years of my life i had to watch my dad suffer through parkinson's before he passed away at 81, so i know the horrors that can come next. now it feels extra traumatic watching the only parent i really had with me during my whole life going through the early phases of memory loss too.i've looked into memory care but i don't know if we could afford it, especially since she's still somewhat independent physically. we want to buy a house in the next year or two and have a special ada suite added on for her so we can care for her and also utilize her ltc insurance to help. we don't want to just put her somewhere and let her rot away, we love her and are scared for her and just want the best.yes i was raised by my grandparents and no the rest of our family isn't in the picture. it's just me, my husband, and my son. we don't have any other support or resources. thanks for letting me vent.tldr my mom is showing signs of dementia and is at risk of being scammed and i'm too young to be prepared to handle this and it all makes me very sad and scared and i don't know what to do.

Our journey is over. Our story with Vascular Dementia
i've lurked these boards for years, trying to solve the riddle of what our journey would look like, when it would end, how it would end, what i needed to do to be prepared for everything.  i read the posts from others about their journeys trying to find similarities and trajectories.  there's not as much information out there about vascular dementia progression as there is other dementias, so i'd like to share our experience in the hopes of helping others.  my loved one had vascular issues for years.  she had had heart surgery about a decade ago but was doing well.  she was still able to walk on her own up until a year and a half ago.  i had been helping her for years but noticed in late 2016 - 2017 that she wasn't caring for herself as well as she used to. i talked her into selling her house since i was too far away to come as frequently as she would need. she moved into an assisted living facility.  she didn't like it one bit, but she did it.  that's when things really started to progress.  the moved really highlighted just how bad she had become. her memory was still very good - thankfully that remained in tact for much of the last 5 years.  little things started to go, but people and events stayed.  her dementia seemed to mostly attack her ability to figure out or interpret the world around her. one of the first things i noticed was her having difficulty writing checks.  not remembering bills necessarily, but moreso how to write a check.  letters that she would write started to become more messy. words would be misspelled (she was an impeccable writer and flawless speller) or inverted or used incorrectly.  she also had difficulty using the key to her door.  when we would go shopping, she had difficulty reading the packages and only recognized items she purchased each week.  i admit, these seem like pretty advanced issues, but i didn't notice until i looked back in retrospect what all these things meant.  she was very good at covering, especially in her own home.  while in the assisted living, her disease progressed slowly.  she was able to walk about, go out to the stores and get her hair/nails done, anything she wanted.  she ate with utensils and drank from a cup with zero issues.  she toileted independently and had no incontinence.  her memory remained good.  the main progression i saw during this time was that she started getting rid of everything - she gave away stuff or cut it up or ripped it and threw it out. fidgety type behaviors i guess.  she called friends and family for chats or gripes but the agitation that she expressed at this time did become increasingly worse. she lived at the assisted living for years until she started having falls.  she went to the hospital (during covid) and they wouldn't allow anyone in with her.  she "came to" in the hospital and panicked.  she thought she had been kidnapped and was being tortured.  they chemically and physically restrained her.  all they had to do was let me in to explain to her and hold her hand, but they wouldn't.  i will always resent that with all my being.  covid was no excuse to do that to her.  needless to say, this event really damaged her.  she never recovered.  she was placed in a memory care unit from the hospital.  she went from walking with a cane to being wheelchair bound for the rest of her days.  her dementia progressed rapidly. the last 1.5 years she spent in this facility she slowly became less and less able to talk. she could ask questions and would remember many things still but if you asked her a question outside of the usual "how are you?", "are you in any pain?", "how was your dinner last night?", she would be unable to understand or answer appropriately.  she also became incontinent - first single, then later on about a year in, double.  she became unable to drink from a cup without a straw.  she stopped using utensils  and could only feed herself with her hands.  she spent much of her time with a blank stare and didn't engage much.  she had always been such a social person.  the last few months, she finally started to forget me.  she knew me, and with some explaining, she would remember me, i am so incredibly grateful for that.  but when i would see her, she would look at me for a while, i'd tell her in as many different ways as i could, that i was hers until she'd finally remember... and then she was so happy.  i cherish that so much.  the beginning of the end for her was a bump on her leg.  we don't know what caused it, but for a month, it didn't get any smaller.  she didn't express any pain at all and the doctors said to treat it like a contusion.  they assumed she bumped the wheelchair or table or something of the sort.  one day, the skin gave way and it burst.  the wound was treated and it appeared as though it was finally resolving.  unfortunately, it became infected.  she was taken to the er at the first sign of fever. the amazing doctor there called me. she was so compassionate and respectful of my loved one. she said my lo had sepsis.  she had read my lo's healthcare directive and knew that she didn't want any antibiotics and so suggested hospice.  i agreed and the placement was made.  before she left the hospital, though, an er nurse called me and asked me if i wanted to talk to my lo on the phone. i spoke to her for a few minutes, told her i loved her and that i was on my way and would be with her in a few hours.  she didn't respond, but the nurse said she was blinking her eyes and was listening.  i am forever grateful for that nurse, because that was the last time i spoke to her while she was awake.  she arrived at the hospice but wasn't responding when they tried to give her something to drink.  she was no longer able to swallow.  fluids and food were then stopped.  morphine was administered.  she never opened her eyes again.  i stayed with her as long as i could each day - leaving only to eat and sleep.  on her sixth day, i left to get lunch.  i kissed her and told her i'd be back.  on my way back to the hospice, i got the call.  she had passed ten minutes ago.  i wasn't there.  i didn't want her to be alone, but i suppose that's what she wanted.  i wanted so badly to be there with her. i hope she wasn't waiting for me. she was so very loved and i was so very loved by her.  what a blessing our love for each other was. &amp;#x200b;ultimately, our dementia journey lasted 5 years of active management although it probably began before then (i just didn't recognize it). i don't think she had any "step-like" progression like they say. hers was just a slow, steady decline, punctuated  by two hospital stays.  there were no strokes or big health events.  she was 95. i hope this may help some of you on your journey with your loved ones.  while you're going through it, it's so frustrating and so hard.  the not knowing is tremendously hard.  keep loving them as fiercely as you do, even when you don't feel like you're loving them, you are through your actions.  love is an act as well as an emotion. let your acts carry you through the times when your heart's just not in it.  and be kind to yourself.

Throwing stones at God
i am pissed...i am furious...2 years gone and i still cry, i still want to scream all my fury and loss up into the sky. if you have the time, i'd like to tell you a story. i will try not to ramble, but it's a story that needs to be told if only to hopefully put it to rest....  growing up it was my mom and i, we had my grandparents and aunt and uncle's but they were rarely around. my grands were abusive and the others indifferent. my mom put herself through college and worked her ass off to put a roof over our heads... something i never really understood the strain of until i grew older.   she had always been eccentric, always a little off but in a fabulous way in most regards. we had the first home computer in our neighborhood, one of the first to connect to the internet..she loved art, music cooking and medieval history.i'm telling you all this to gain a grasp of her intellect.  my entire life i never heard a lie leave her lips or a curse worse that calling someone a "nut nut". was she perfect?? fuck no. i had been asking her to seek help for mental health issues since i was 20...i'm 42 now. i promise you this is all relevant.   she started really sliding down hill around 15? years ago. it's hard to judge times...like i said she was eccentric, i just thought my crazy mom is acting like my crazy mom. until it was more than that. i blew off a lot of what in retrospect i shouldn't of because they were very, very big warning bells. what finally woke me up to her mind truly slipping was that she could not remember what car was mine parked in my own driveway, a car i had had for 10 years.  a bunch of other slips started happening, couldn't remember my kids ages, her personality started to rapidly change... very very! angry. i did finally manage to get her to see a psych doctor. the list of disorders was almost a page long ( this happened before she got to far gone btw). ptsd anxiety depression were at the forefront. then the delusions started. 'theres someone climbing on the roof" " there's a peeping tom at the window'  she made multiple phone calls to the police about a random neighbor and a highschool friend trying to drive her crazy.   i became very good friends with the police.  i should state that at this time she was living with my alcohol grandmother as my grandmother's caretaker. they did not have the best if relationships at the best of times.  my grandmother was also a horder.  the situation progressed until the council of elders intervened. my mother's doctor would not listen to any of us, wanting only to focus on her diabetes...bitch the lady can't take her meds if she can't remember them.  she was finally placed in an assisted living facility. unfortunately she continued to decline at a very rapid rate. she would constantly try to escape thinking my grandmother's house was right outside. she got very mean and very violent even as her body forgot how to function, by the end i couldn't get her into my car to take her home for weekends.  i'm losing steam writing this. 2020 hit and i couldn't see her at all until it was to late, but really it had been to late for at least 4 years...that was our last really coherent talk anyways. i got to talk to her on the phone a few times but always set her off. i got a call from the home that she was in the hospital for a uti...later get a call from the hospital that i had better get paperwork signed cause it looked like she was checking out soon. ketoacidosis. her whole body is shutting down.  i run down there, an hours drive from here, covid regs so i can only stay 15 minutes and that's only because it's an end of life visit...fuck that. i climbed in bed with her, put on her favorite music on my phone and i laid right there for an hour. that is where we did goodbye. i had a few blessed minutes where she was there, where she knew who i was. it didn't last long but she hadn't known me in 3 years so i will take that time to my grave 2 days later she was moved to another hospital even farther away, i was told to come say goodbye again. it was an active covid floor so i had to sign a bunch of waivers and get suited up in a marshmallow suit. i called all the fam on video chat, laid down next to her husk and tried to be as brave as i could as i talked and tried to assure everyone without breaking myself.  i got the call she had passed that night.  no wake, no funeral..just me by myself going to deal with the morge and her ashes.   bottom line to anyone still reading...i'm still pissed. i'm furious something like this could happen to someone who tried so hard to be a decent person despite all the odds and unfairness and suffered so much before dementia got it's hooks in. i want her back. i want the time that was robbed. she died at 62, she left me in her 50s. i hope when my time is up i get to sock god one for all the people lost within themselves cause it's a living hell.  end rant

I don't know how to cope with my grandmother's Alzheimer's
hello everyone. sorry for the rant/vent but i just... need a platform of sorts to let some things out i guess...?  as the title suggests, my grandmother has alzheimer's disease. it's late stage. i feel like i could just wake up any day now and learn that she's passed away and it weighs on me.   i'm 19 years old- so pretty young still i would say. i am also a full-time college student and so these things just continuously put weight on me every day. i am so afraid of her passing suddenly and the grief will just completely wreck my school life. i almost flunked high school due to depression and so i am trying not to make any sort of repeat with this newfound "chance" i now have. it's conflicting- because part of me feels awful for just "waiting" for her to pass away. of course, i don't want my grandma to die, but this disease has destroyed her so much it's like she's just a physical shell at this point. she is my last grandparent, after all. but at the same time, me internally hoping that she will at least die when i am not in school is such a terrible thing to think about and i feel so... selfish, quite frankly. she's the one with the disease, after all.  every week or so, i see her- except it's just a depressing experience at this point because alzheimer's has taken such a toll on her. i'm trying to spend at least a good amount of time with her while she's still here but it's hard to do so. she's incoherent and does not remember me nor a good chunk of my relatives and requires assistance to do the majority of things if not everything. i'm not surprised at this but it still hurts a bit, you know? plus, i know she is the only person holding my family together because her children aka my aunts and uncles are in a feud over finances and god forbid what happens after she leaves this realm.   i've been crying tonight like i do every few weeks nowadays when i think about her. my parents do not know about this. it's just so stressful, and it also feels like i'm looking into the future because dementia runs in my family. my other grandmother also passed from the same disease before i was born. every time i notice my parents forget something it just sparks a tinge of pain within me because of that fear that they will develop the disease too and i can't really do anything about it. i was also raised in a culture where children are expected to take care of their parents when they're older, so the possibility of me having to be a care-giver myself one day also haunts me because i've seen what it is like and also feel a bit selfish for not wanting to do such a thing.   i really don't know what to do anymore, or how to even properly cope with something like this. it's a cruel cycle of waiting for her to die so she can finally be at peace and then feel bad for thinking such a thing. am i a bad person for thinking it'd be better for her to pass away at this rate? how am i supposed to live knowing about this slow and cruel decline towards death my grandmother is facing, and that she's almost at the finish line? i've always wanted for her to see me graduate but i know it is likely that she will be gone by the time i finish any sort of degree. seeing my friends be able to interact with and spend time with their own grandparents is like a stab in the chest reminder that i will never be able to have such a relationship. i am happy for them yet i can't help but feel... jealous about it. i do have a few very vague memories of my grandma back before alzheimer's got to her, but i've since long forgotten a good bit of it myself- such a cruel twist of irony, isn't it. i love my grandma very much but it also hurts so much seeing her like this. i am in pure agony.  still, if you're still reading this, thanks for your time. really. i may not know who you are but just know i am thankful you'd put off some of your time to read this. i do not expect a lot of attention and for this to just float around in the reddit ocean forever and that i am content with. i just want to let some of my thoughts go, and after typing this i think i feel a little bit better. well, i stopped crying a bit ago at least, haha. maybe i can finally go to bed.

hello everyone. sorry for the rant/vent but i just... need a platform of sorts to let some things out i guess...?  as the title suggests, my grandmother has alzheimer's disease. it's late stage. i feel like i could just wake up any day now and learn that she's passed away and it weighs on me.   i'm 19 years old- so pretty young still i would say. i am also a full-time college student and so these things just continuously put weight on me every day. i am so afraid of her passing suddenly and the grief will just completely wreck my school life. i almost flunked high school due to depression and so i am trying not to make any sort of repeat with this newfound "chance" i now have. it's conflicting- because part of me feels awful for just "waiting" for her to pass away. of course, i don't want my grandma to die, but this disease has destroyed her so much it's like she's just a physical shell at this point. she is my last grandparent, after all. but at the same time, me internally hoping that she will at least die when i am not in school is such a terrible thing to think about and i feel so... selfish, quite frankly. she's the one with the disease, after all.  every week or so, i see her- except it's just a depressing experience at this point because alzheimer's has taken such a toll on her. i'm trying to spend at least a good amount of time with her while she's still here but it's hard to do so. she's incoherent and does not remember me nor a good chunk of my relatives and requires assistance to do the majority of things if not everything. i'm not surprised at this but it still hurts a bit, you know? plus, i know she is the only person holding my family together because her children aka my aunts and uncles are in a feud over finances and god forbid what happens after she leaves this realm.   i've been crying tonight like i do every few weeks nowadays when i think about her. my parents do not know about this. it's just so stressful, and it also feels like i'm looking into the future because dementia runs in my family. my other grandmother also passed from the same disease before i was born. every time i notice my parents forget something it just sparks a tinge of pain within me because of that fear that they will develop the disease too and i can't really do anything about it. i was also raised in a culture where children are expected to take care of their parents when they're older, so the possibility of me having to be a care-giver myself one day also haunts me because i've seen what it is like and also feel a bit selfish for not wanting to do such a thing.   i really don't know what to do anymore, or how to even properly cope with something like this. it's a cruel cycle of waiting for her to die so she can finally be at peace and then feel bad for thinking such a thing. am i a bad person for thinking it'd be better for her to pass away at this rate? how am i supposed to live knowing about this slow and cruel decline towards death my grandmother is facing, and that she's almost at the finish line? i've always wanted for her to see me graduate but i know it is likely that she will be gone by the time i finish any sort of degree. seeing my friends be able to interact with and spend time with their own grandparents is like a stab in the chest reminder that i will never be able to have such a relationship. i am happy for them yet i can't help but feel... jealous about it. i do have a few very vague memories of my grandma back before alzheimer's got to her, but i've since long forgotten a good bit of it myself- such a cruel twist of irony, isn't it. i love my grandma very much but it also hurts so much seeing her like this. i am in pure agony.  still, if you're still reading this, thanks for your time. really. i may not know who you are but just know i am thankful you'd put off some of your time to read this. i do not expect a lot of attention and for this to just float around in the reddit ocean forever and that i am content with. i just want to let some of my thoughts go, and after typing this i think i feel a little bit better. well, i stopped crying a bit ago at least, haha. maybe i can finally go to bed.

Can someone please let me know what's appropriate in restrictions for dementia patients? Feeling like shit right now
this is kind of a long rant but i just don't understand some of the actions my family members are taking in relation to the care of my grandparents. they have been both diagnosed with rapidly progressing dementia and alzheimers within the last 7 months. my grandfather is definitely worse. he's mood has changed, and he's joyful and happy all the time which is nice. he's never forgotten who i am and he knows what i'm talking about. he'll also ask me how things went two weeks after the fact, so he's still there. my dad took over his finances last summer and has severely restricted my grandma's spending. she has a credit card limit and her card gets declined when we go out for dinner. they did this because she was buying my aunt too much stuff (who's mentally unwell and lost her son).  they have over 10 million dollars so it's not really a problem for her to spend money, but i get it. i just found out my grandma was diagnosed 2 months ago with dementia and alzheimers as well. i didn't realize how bad she was, i just thought she was getting forgetful when she would tell me the same story after a few hours. they now have 24 hr care, which is great. but i am no longer allowed to sleepover and i'm so upset about it. i can now only visit from 1-8 pm to put them on a strict schedule. i only slept over because it made them happy and i liked having breakfast and reading the paper with them in the morning. i also worked as a home health aide for 14 years so i thought i could help them if they needed it. i'm graduating with my phd in may, and my dad told me they couldn't come to my graduation. i'm so sad about it, and i get that it messes with their schedule. but they really wanted to go. are these restrictions to make them have a set schedule normal? i just want what's best for them, but i don't understand why taking away things that seem harmless and make them happy is helpful. i don't have a good relationship with my dad and my stepmom, so i think it's also me feeling resentful towards him.

Fast decline after a fall and I’m so lost and tired.
i so rarely get personal online, but i just have to vent this before i burst. my mom started showing signs that i saw about 9-10 months ago that dementia was creeping in. you all know the deal - the repeated stories, the forgetting things, confusing timelines a little, and agitation when anyone tried to help her do anything - but she was still very much in control and lucid. she was in denial, as i’d asked her about the memory loss several times and she just brushed it off, but she’d just have moments. she was still running the show. saturday she fell and suffered a subdural hematoma. it’s been a sharp decline since then. the bleeding has stopped, she’s physically well, but she’s completely lost in her mind. adding to this is the fact that i had not been able to see her in 4 years owing to living 600 miles away and covid. (we had a trip planned to visit in august 2020 to see her for the first time in a couple of years… so you know how that went.)last week i talked to my mother and she was excited she’d found a new primary care doctor that she really liked, that she and my 83 year old step father were given a pretty clean bill of health for their age, and we talked about a lot of things. she said i love you at the end of the call like always. i drove 9 hours to come see her yesterday, knowing she was confused after the fall but my stepfather sugar coated what he’d told me a lot. i’m not angry - i completely understand why he’s in the state he’s in. but i just wasn’t quite prepared for today. today i saw her for the first time in 4 years and she sort of registered who i was, but kept telling me she had to get off the phone and go cook dinner, and i didn’t even get the normal i love you from the end of calls. and it only got worse after that - that’s one of the laugh to keep from crying bits. later she bit and scratched me because she was very angry that i would not take her home, and i’m currently trying very hard to get some tiny bit of rest in a chair next to her bed in the care facility, because she is just relentlessly trying to get up and go home after repeatedly stripping off any clothing we try, she’s completely unstable on her feet, and we were advised against bed rails bc she is super agitated and would hurt herself on them more likely than not. so i’m exhaustedly keeping vigil until my stepdad comes back in the morning. she keeps telling me i’m her good baby boy and it’s time to go to bed. i’m her only child; her daughter. her dog is the good baby boy she’s talking to. i’m so tired and broken. my stepfather is just lost in a haze and can’t face the reality. i’m so sad i didn’t get to see her when she could see me. i have so much to do and i can’t stop crying. the doctors have said that she may regain some lucidity, but it’s unlikely we will get her even back to a week ago and that most likely she won’t be in control. i have some resources to lean into and we’ve been lucky enough to receive excellent medical care; i knew this was coming in a way, and i’ve checked out this sub and other research a few times to confirm what i was thinking and trying to keep an eye out for when it was time to step in. but i was not ready for this sudden change. i thought i had more time. we had a trip planned in october hoping to be in a semi-post covid world enough to feel safe seeing them. i’m shattered. oh also my actual father has pulmonary fibrosis and prostate cancer and likely won’t make it til april. his mind is still sharp but that’s almost a curse at this point as his body fails completely. my step mom is taking great care of him, but it’s just so much grief to bear at once. i’m not sure where i’ll find the strength to get through this. i know i will, i just cannot figure out where it’s gonna come from right now.

Concerned about Nana and living far away
tl;dr at bottommy nana and i fairly close. there is very rarely a day we don’t speak in some form despite the 800 miles between us. she is coming up on being 80 this year and i’m concerned about personality and behavioral changes that are increasing in frequency over time.she is often forgetting the words to various things. when i try to help and offer solutions she gets flustered and that is turning into anger now. her hoarding behavior has taken on new heights. before i moved away she was a pack rat who kept various sentimental things and had a storage room that was reasonably filled. according to her now she has two and a half rooms full. full meaning you literally can’t go in there. this are closed off rooms that don’t impede her ability to move around the house or affect immediate safety. the items hoarded are not immediate health hazards (mostly files and new things). but her unwillingness or inability to throw out a grocery receipt from 1998 is concerning. she used to walk a lot. i’m talking many miles a day up until the pandemic. it began with a reasonable concern about her health in going to shops but she eventually stopped taking leisurely walks and has since developed into a refusal to leave her home almost entirely. my mother (who i am nc with) lives with her for the time being and she does her errands for her. she has turned to seemingly manipulative tactics for attention. calling me in tears worried that i’m hospitalized because i didn’t call her for a few days despite the fact that we did text back and forth that morning. calling me in tears again concerned about my sister having covid and worried if she’s going to be ok even though my sister never had a severe case and was recovering well and she didn’t tell her she had covid until after she was on the mend.she is denying things she has said that i have text and voicemail proof of that i show her and she holds her ground saying to just move on from it and she didn’t say that. what in the world can i do to help her? i cannot afford to go see her financially or otherwise. i can’t afford any type of attorney either. i cannot reach out to my mother to help her for my own safety. most of my other family does not speak to her due to these escalating behaviors. she is refusing to go in for a check up and claiming her mind is as sharp as ever. while she is right in some ways there, in most ways she is not. she isn’t perfect but i love her so much.tl;dr- what can i do to help my nana from so far away with no money, denial from her and no help from other family?

Power of Attorney Pre Diagnosis
i hope this post makes sense and hasn't been covered already. i tried looking through but could not see an answer. sorry if it's a bit all over and will try to keep short.i'm 29, my dad is 67 and my mam 57. they live together. around five years ago my mam first phoned and said i may notice a difference in my dad, he's forgetting things more. as i didn't visit home often, i didn't really notice much. it wasn't until covid that i really noticed, and the last six months, have got particularly worse. a few years ago, he had memory tests and passed, but he's had more recently and did not do well. it's to the point now where every conversation we are repeating. taking a list to the shop for two items is pointless because he forgets he has a list, doesn't brush teeth, struggles with movies now etc.however, this is not the only thing we've noticed. my dad gets extremely down and has very sudden mood swings, he's restless to point that he's taken two months to do some invoices that should have taken days. he can be quite insensitive when talking to people - rude, almost cruel, sometimes pretty vulgar, and not realising it. he can be so angry, and his mood changes so quick and he gets down. he struggles in group situations and will become withdrawn because he can't keep up with conversation, and when replying his response doesn't make sense or relate to the topic. it's the personality change that has been really difficult to see - he is so angry, down, fed up, withdrawn. he constantly wants to go out somewhere with my mam (who is often tired from work) and gets really upset/angry when she wants to go out with a friend as he feels he is being left alone. i'm trying to come home more to help, i work from home, but he often wants to go out somewhere and it's hard to say no.he has had memory tests, ct scan and is having an mri scan on sunday. after looking at the types of dementia, we thought all the personality changes could mean it is a form of frontotemporal dementia - but of course this could be totally wrong, he just has all symptoms listed.it's been five years since they first went to the doctor. the awful thing is my dad still believes he is just getting old and this is standard forgetfulness, but as i said, we can barely have a "normal" conversation now. we still have not had a diagnosis, but something is definitely not right, whatever the outcome is after mri. we were at my dad's brothers funeral today (72, parkinson's). it is the first time we have mentioned it to my aunty as we are not close and she told us you are much better trying to sort power of attorney before the diagnosis. my friends mam also said this, as she had to with her own mother. we were planning to talk to my dad about this after more results come through but now we think it is best we talk to him as soon as possible. to be honest, we are both concerned about whether he will get much worse before we get the diagnosis and then it will become much more difficult.does anyone have any advice with the situation? the big concern is waiting for a diagnosis and by that time he could be much worse, but he is a very proud person and it's going to be an extremely difficult conversation.thanks for reading and sorry if i went on abit, or this has been answered.

Just want to vent
hello, i am from the philippines. i just wanted to ask help/vent regarding my 88 year old grandma who is now in the onslaught of dementia. i actually struggle a lot with her presence in our house. she smokes a lot, and this is all she thinks about every day. my father, mom and sister have weak lungs and this has been a struggle daily. my grandma insists on going out for hours on end, and she gets lost that we have to find her. i could not believe that this is the same grandma that read me bedtime stories and cooked delicious food. now, i am seeing unpleasant parts from her. she becomes selfish, bitter, and thinks people owe their success to her. she brings back garbage from other people's houses. she backstabs her sister..she has a nasty tongue. since she already forgets how she manages her money and when it's gone (from buying cigarettes), she blames.my mother. she also has a big sense of entitlement. this was shocking to me. she expects to be always prioritized and her wishes granted, from food to everything. we are currently in a tight financial spot and cannot afford any nursing homes at the moment. nursing care here is expensive. nursing homes for elders is also not a prevalent idea here in the philippines where caring for elders is deeply embedded in our culture. she cannot also stay with her other children because the condition of their houses is not fit for taking care of someone with dementia. :( how do you deal with this? my family, esp my mom, struggles a lot. every day we have stress from just dealing with her.

I don’t want to have sex with my husband
ok…i know this is super personal. i just don’t feel comfortable talking about this with my friends. internet strangers it is. my husband has early onset ftd. we are still fairly young. he’s only 59. i’m 10 years younger. he is not the same person. his personality has changed significantly which is a symptom of his kind of dementia. between that and the fact that i am basically a caretaker/ mom role for him these days, i just do not feel even slightly sexual towards him any longer. don’t get me wrong. i love this man with my whole heart. he is the love of my life and my best friend…or was…but i just can’t. he has been wanting intimacy and i keep putting him off. usually he forgets for a while until the next time it comes up. i really just can’t. no matter how much i love him i just do not feel sexual about him any longer. i can’t bring myself to have what would basically be pity sex. the idea of it just makes me…ugh. no. i just can’t. and i feel like i shouldn’t have to either. i feel horrible for feeling this way. none of this is his fault. it feels wrong to force him into celibacy when we previously had an active love life. but i really really do not want to do it. i would appreciate any advice, thoughts, etc. i’m truly at a loss as to how to proceed other than to keep putting him off and hoping he forgets about it.

Early stages, trying to be proactive &amp; help, but far from home…
hi folks,i’m an only child in their 30s, living across the country from my parents (late 70s). dad has mci (mom and i suspect it has been going on for many years), and was diagnosed with early dementia 2 years ago (no signs of alzheimer’s) and he’s on meds. he does ok, it’s mostly short term memory issues and inability to learn new things. he’s pretty physically fit for his age and he’s allowed to drive 2-3 places still, but my mom has to make sure he remembers to eat, give him his meds at the right time of day, keep otc meds hidden, that sort of thing.mom had to go to the er the other night and was hospitalized for 2 days so my dad went without his meds. since the hospital is one of the few places he’s allowed to drive to and from by himself, she asked him to go home and get her phone charger because her phone was dead. of course, stressful or out of the ordinary situations get him even more frazzled and confused and upset. so twice he brought back just random things. on the second drive, he accidentally turned off his phone ringer (he does this all. the. time.) and no one could reach him. by the time he eventually got back his phone was dead, so they couldn’t call their friend who they would normally call in a situation where they’d need help. mom is the sole keeper of knowledge and does everything for him. i’ve been trying to get her to make a shared online spreadsheet to put all his medical info, important document locations, friends/family phone numbers, etc in case of emergency because someone will need to make sure he takes his very important heart meds and his other meds. but she’s been dragging her heels. he’s always losing his phone, keys, wallet, credit/debit cards, money, hearing aids, etc. she got him an apple watch to monitor his afib and to watch his location when he’s out. but he broke it within 2 weeks. he keeps forgetting pins so he ends up locking himself out of cards, the garage, email, etc. even though she put a card in his wallet with his pins written on it. he doesn’t remember it’s there or he’ll forget how to even use his debit card. he’s ended up getting scammed a few times and is giving money to all sorts of charities (which may or may not be legit). i don’t know. is there anything that can be attached to his wallet/keys/cards/car/phone? i’ve been looking at apple air tags but my mom’s phone isn’t compatible (too old). i tried tile before and he got rid of them and mom doesn’t know the log in. losing everything all the time upsets him, stresses out my mom, but and “aids” upset him too. i’m sorry i’m rambling. i don’t know what i’m asking. i am just feeling helpless being so far away and wish i had more info in case of emergency. i asked two of my friends who are close with my family and live near by if they’d be willing to take care of him in the event of another emergency and i gave them the garage code to get in (unless he puts in the wrong pin again and has to have it changed again), but i don’t know anything about his meds, etc.ugh. i’m feeling useless and helpless and like a bad kid for not being there for my parents.

Is It Impossible To Not Hurt My Grandmother's Feelings?
my grandmother, mid-stage, has recently become obsessed with me eating dinner with them on a daily basis, as well as my whereabouts in general.  her and my grandfather would watch me growing up while my parents worked.  after school, i'd be at there house all afternoon.  in the summers i spent the whole day there, until my parents got out of work.  i also use to eat dinner with them mon-wed nights, to give my parents some alone time and a bit of rest after work.  this has apparently popped back into my grandmother's mind.now, i always pop in once or twice a day for 20-30 minutes at a time, to visit and check if they need any help, because i'm only a couple streets away.  my grandmother, the past month, has started to think i stay there with them still, like when i was a child.  there's been a lot of confusion on her part recently, because we can go from a conversation about the home i own, my job, etc., to her thinking i'm a child/teenager in the span of about 10 minutes.sometimes when i come over, she immediately asks, "where have you been?" and wants a rundown of everything i've been doing.she's also started saying, every single day, "you're eating dinner here tonight, right?"at first, i was making excuses, which worked, but now in the past couple weeks, she's stopped accepting them.  the mind of someone with dementia truly is complicated, because despite all her memory issues, she has *picked up* on my constant excuses, and now thinks i'm lying.  she actually started getting mad at me, and insisting i was "hiding something."so this past week, i've just had to be honest with her and it obviously hurts and upsets her feelings.  she seems to *forget* that though by the next day.  even though she does remember and pick up on certain things still, for over a year now she has blocked out any type of "upsetting" information she's given.  i've basically just told her politely but firmly, "you and grandpa are 90.  i'm 35.  i have my own house, and my own food.  my fridge is full, i can afford it, and i like to cook and eat quietly most nights.  you don't cook like you use to.  i have your recipes, and i make them sometimes, but you won't let anyone else cook dinner for you and grandpa.  plus i eat at a much later time than you both do."she has gone between, said, hurt, angry, and every emotion in between this week when doing that.  and even though she seems to forget by the next day, my grandfather says she's been in a sad mood during dinner, and still sets a place for me "because maybe he'll change his mind."that honestly breaks my heart.  but i don't see any other way around this, at this point.  is there a better way to handle this?  (and for the record, i *do* take them out to dinner 1-2 times a month, we just have to compromise on the times, and in addition i take them out to lunch 1-2 times per month.)

i care for my grandma with vascular dementia. 4 years now i've been helping her. gradual at first. driving her places, taking her shopping, helping get her to appointments and bible studies. then she started her decline. helping to bathe, doing her laundry, getting her dressed, and now even toileting. i've read plenty of stories and heard everyone who said "we wished they went into a home sooner." and i think we are to that point. she still likes being social but we don't live in a neighborhood. she goes to a senior day center that she calls "school". after more decline and now issues with eating, breathing, and aspirating- i've decided i'm done. i want to enjoy time with her and not dread it. she takes her anger out on me. 4 years she has been threatening to throw me out. tried to physically fight me on occasion. and last month she told me she wanted to stab me. no idea why. i was cooking dinner and something set her off. 20 mins later she'll be calm and have forgotten the whole episode. but it'll take me days to come down from my hurt and anger that she treats me like this when she is supposed to love me. so i told my mom (her daughter) that it's time. we would all be happier and feel more free if she was in a facility. we all currently live together as a multigenerational family. but we have dementia, autism, and ptsd all under one roof too. everything revolves around her and who can watch her, where we can take her, if we need to leave because of her. it has gotten overwhelming.i also think we are going to refer to it as "boarding school" since she likes "school" so much. and once we decide on one or 2- take her to tour and see what she thinks. then she can finish her time at the current school out and graduate to the new school. i don't know if any one has used this line of thought. but we are going to try it.

MIL Asks the Same Questions Over and Over...and Over
for background, my 82 yr old mil has dimentia (i don't know the specific level or formal name). she isn't able to drive, cook, she forgets names, she can't be left alone,etc. she lives 1000 miles away and we haven't been able to spend much time with her over the past few years. the past few years have been tough, but the past few months have been extremely challenging for her. she lost her husband two weeks ago and because of her condition we decided to sell her house and move her into a memory care facility. because we live out of state, living with her is not an option. as i write this it sounds horrible that we haven't included her in the detailed conversation, but she wasn't able to understand and contribute to conversations with her husband and family months ago.my wife and family quietly packed up part of her house without discussing it with her until the end. they explained that she was moving to a place where she can be cared for and safe. my wife and her flew to our house and told her that she was staying with us for a while. the reality is that we're getting her place at the memory care facility ready for her to move in shortly after her things arrive. she only remembers a few pieces of the conversation (s) about moving, and incorrectly remembers the details frequently. she will tell us that someone (she knows it was family but doesn't remember who) came in last week and started packing up the house. then she said that someone told her that she was moving but she didn't have other details. my wife will explain that they packed up their house and they're trying to figure out the best place for her to live. luckily, she understands that she can't stay in her house alone which is very helpful. this conversation happens again and again and again. my mil brings this up somewhere between once an hour and as frequently used every five minutes. my wife had that conversation 10 times in less than an hour and a half tonight. she also wakes my wife up multiple times per night to have the same conversation. how can we either help her understand and remember the plan, or reduce the frequency of having the same conversation? we have been truthful with her about the plan (except that we have decided on moving her to a facility) but she forgets within minutes....not sure what to do from here.

Help.
i posted a couple of month's ago about my dad being hyper paranoid. he believes people are after him. i was in denial about his declining mental state. i saw him for christmas weekend, and it was very evident he has been declining. he has lost 20 pounds and could hardly walk up the stairs. he stopped working out... he looks like an old man, and he has never looked like an old man. we spoke yesterday, and he went on about the people who are after him. he said they have his car keys, have been in his home. he said they haven't taken anything, he just knows they have been inside.  in the past, when he has talked about the people following him, i would ask questions about them, and he couldn't answer them, and he would get frustrated, and mad at me. i have become the enemy at this point. i have never told him i don't believe him, just asked questions he realized he couldn't answer. i feel like an idiot because the signs have been there for a long time. about a year ago he decided his friends who has known for decades were trying to sabotage his business. he has been more forgetful, but i just ignored it. now i'm at the point where i know i need to take him to the doctor, but i am so worried. we have always been close, but i have become someone he doesn't think he can trust. he has a heavy military background and very extensive fire arm training. i don't know how to break it to him that we are going to the doctor to get him checked out. i live about an hour and a half away, and my dad is more willing to trust my fiance. i am going to make the appointment but i am so afraid he will hate me or react very violently. i know there is no good way/good outcome, but what is the best way to go about it? thank you so much. i am lost and very overwhelmed.

Holidays are Hard (Long Text)
minor tw, someone gets hurt and i mention x-rays.i’ve talked about my grandmother a little on this sub, but i needed to share what happened over the holidays. it was…rough.recently my family has celebrated christmas with my grandmother with dementia and it's been extremely hard this year. this year we decided to attend the party her side of the family throws a week before actual christmas, so she can spend some time with not only her siblings, but their families as well. i was planning on trying to talk with some of my family and not end up just watching her like on thanksgiving. however, the moment she walked in and her younger brother started talking to her, i knew that wouldn’t be the case. her dementia has gotten so bad she has started to forget them, and the heartbreak of watching her brothers and sisters realize their sister is forgetting them is an image i can never unsee. they ended up keeping a distance, i ended up sitting with her and keeping her focused on her food. the entire time she kept introducing herself, making the same joke about one of my cousins “stealing her shirt” because she had a similar one at home, and also keeping an eye on the youngest of the grandkids running around because his mom expressed that he’s allergic to eggs and i know grandma would either give him something without realizing it or leave something where he can reach it, he’s only 2. i could see on the faces of my family, the painful pity they were giving. i wish i could give them answers about how she’s doing that they would be ok with, but the sad truth is she’s not. it’s getting a lot worse and they are starting to finally see it. now i’m not going to say her family isn’t forgetting things, the brother i mentioned earlier (she has 4 brothers and 3 sisters, but one sister passed early this year, and one brother passed many years ago) confused my mother and my mother’s cousin, who unfortunately passed mid october, and her younger sister is starting to forget things as well, and her boyfriend has been on a “trip” so my aunt has been keeping an eye on them. but my great aunt and great uncle’s memory gaps are more because of the fact they’re in their late 60s early 70s.during the party my grandmother had on some nice dress shoes but my aunt packed a pair of tennis shoes because we knew she would want them eventually. and she did…after taking them off while we were eating. after dinner we started white elephant, and my mom and aunt let me play for my grandma, who i told throughout the game we’re a team. it was just easier that way. one of the younger kids ended up picking up an electric foot bath, which i knew would be perfect for my grandma. when i picked out her gift and saw it was a starbucks mini gift bag, i knew i struck gold. the kiddo with the footbath was a teenager, a teenage girl for that matter. so it was a win win. and at the end of the night, we managed to not get it taken, so i’m glad we ended that on a good note. a week later we did our christmas celebrations. it’s supposed to be low key, since we get so tired after thanksgiving my dad just wants to grill steaks and make mashed potatoes. my aunt goes a little overboard with christmas candies and whatnot but it’s fine. well…something not great happened. i coaxed my grandmother out of her room (she was going through clothes or something, her bed was off the box spring and a mess) so she could come talk to us for a little while, and luckily her younger sister showed up by then. well, we have two doggy gates set up for her dogs to stay out of the living room, but the side closest to the door was more of a barrier made with plastic panels and a side table. i was right behind grandma, keeping an eye on her because she’s been walking with a wobble and i wanted to keep her steady. she reached over the barrier to hug her sister, and collapsed onto the table. i screamed “grandma!” and tried to get the debris away from her. my scream alerted my mother and aunt, who were standing on the porch 10 feet away. we quickly got her up and onto the couch, and swept up the broken decorative bowl. as i was putting the broom away, i hid in the laundry room and had a mini panic attack. for the majority of the night i ended up blaming myself for her falling. my mother has since helped me get out of that mind frame, but it’s still scary to think about. she was in such pain for the rest of the night. when we got the food ready, she sat at the table with a pillow on her lap to help. she’s in this habit where she’ll eat a little bit of her food and pick pieces off for her dogs to eat, which wouldn’t be so bad if it wasn’t almost every time she took a bite.during dinner she started talking and mentioned my brother’s name. she said it’s been a while since she’s seen him, and she hopes he’s ok. he was sitting a foot away from her. my brother, who normally kept his emotions about grandma forgetting him away, broke down. he made an excuse of having a rough day and just went to the living room. at that moment i felt like an asshole, because before we left our house i had asked him to talk to her a bit more, to see if that would help her remember him more. we quickly finished our dinners and headed to the living room for gift exchanges. my grandmother was still in a lot of pain though. we tried to get her comfortable and gave her the presents we got her. she did like them, but she ended up falling asleep on the couch. my aunt ended up taking her to urgent care on monday, and they didn’t see a break but gave the x-ray to a radiologist because their equipment isn’t great. they did say she landed on or around her kidney, and to keep an eye on that. i was over at her house again that night to help my aunt clean a little, and it broke my heart seeing her in such pain. she tried to sit up and walk, but every movement hurt her so bad, even with the pain medicine they gave her. we ended up just getting her to rest on the bed on “doctors orders,” which is kinda right. the holidays have been hard, especially since we just passed the 10 year anniversary of her late husband’s passing. she cried during thanksgiving every time she saw his picture, which was a lot because she hangs pictures of the family everywhere. and even while crying she wouldn’t remember what she was crying for. she would be sad one minute, then think she’s just having a reaction to her faulty tear ducts, which is something that’s been a part of her life since she was little. i remember our past christmas and thanksgiving experiences, my brother and i excitedly watching parades on tv, putting our favorite ornaments on the tree, shaking boxes to see what’s inside. back then it *felt* like a holiday. now? now it’s not as festive. i don’t know if it’s just because of the pandemic taking away my holiday moods or the fact i want to cry every time i see my grandma, but things don’t feel the same. and i doubt it ever will again.

hey, all.  this is my first post and it's because my mom has dementia.  she's in her late 70s, worked up until a few years ago and was always active.  after selling our business she was essentially forced in to retirement.  up until recently, she was completely self-sufficient with short term memory being the only issue.  however, since getting covid over the summer and having a rough time with it her dementia has worsened significantly.  i'd describe it as the blinders have come closer together.  short term memory is shot, introverted due to fear.  has forgotten her usual routine.  has anyone delved into therapies?  since noticing her memory decline in 2018, i did my best to lower her carb intake.  she never drove so i do the grocery shopping so that's easy.  she started taking mct oil for the ketones and benfotamine because of the thiamine deficiency that may have something to do with it.  she was steady for 3 plus years, then she got sick.  i know inflammation and/or low oxygen saturation are big culprits.  she was dealing with both so that may have exacerbated the problem.  i'm going to start high potency cbd for her along with epa/dha through supplements.  i'm fortunate enough to have her living with my family and my work gives me the time to experiment and observe.  i'm a proponent of quality of life and stubborn as a mofo so i won't give up on her.  i was thinking if anyone else is keen, we could pool ideas and theories.  you never know.  i was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in my late teens.  i went from an athletic 170lbs at 6'1 to 130lb.  i was hospitalized for months and had to take steroids and transplant meds to keep my immune system from murdering my colon.  after 6 months i eventually recovered.  i was put on maintenance meds and thought that was the end of it.  a year later the blood in my stool showed up and the same cycle began.  this cycle happened 3 times over 4 years.  my bullheaded father took me to mayo clinic, cleveland clinic and northwestern in chicago to specialists.  all said i'd have to live with it unless i want to cut my colon out and live with a colostomy bag.  maintenance drugs was the best they could offer.  i was 24, couldn't go to the bathroom without dreading to see blood in the toilet.  i had a moon shaped face due to the steroids, weird stretch marks due to rapid weight fluctuation and a host of other issues.  one which was remedied by viagra if you get what i mean.  i was despondent to say the least.  there's little joy in convalescing knowing that the same thing will happen inevitably.  you can't have a life or at least a semi long term plan.   i was sitting in my gi's office one day waiting for my appointment time and watched the person across from me drink a mountain dew.  i was feeling decent but suddenly remembered my last flare up was the day after i had a milkshake.  i had asked every specialist i saw what i should eat and none said diet had anything to do with it.  i took them at their word.  but for some reason after watching that dude drink his dew, i started to plan elimination diets.  i also started to read about gut health and the gut biome.  the last time i ever got sick from ulcerative colitis was 15 years ago.  i eat clean, have eliminated processed and fast food (one in the same?) and eat a lot of quality greek yogurt.  i've also minimized sugar.  so far so good!i went on this tangent because i'm sure most understand the medical establishment is far from perfect.  i cured myself.  this does happen.  i know most people are too busy to worry about solving the problems of a relative or friend with dementia but hey,  might as well give it a shot.  if not a cure at least may calm their minds and everyone around them.  improve their quality of life.  it's such an awful disease.  maybe we can develop a reddit hive mind for therapies to help some people out.  let the internet do it's thing so to speak..

Seeing my granny decline is triggering me.
my granny who has dementia is morbidly obese and can no longer walk. not even to use the toilet. despite my dad's warning that it wouldn't end well, she somehow got approved to receive knee replacement surgery. she thought this would have her walking again but her mental state had her feeling hostile to the physical therapist that would come over. she refused to do the exercises and can't communicate in a cognizant enough way to get prescribed adequate pain meds, even. while she was in rehab right after the surgery, she would not cooperate with them and kept accusing grandpa of leaving her there to rot so he could cheat on her. (he loves her dearly and doesn't have it in him to do anything of that sort.) her delusions are almost psychotic in nature and it's hard not to be angered by her logic. on thanksgiving, she called him a "dirty rat" because he briefly came to visit my parents' house without her, for example. my grandpa got her a brace for one of her legs in hopes it would make it easier for her to get in and out of her wheelchair again but she hates it. she yells at him when he tries to get her used to wearing it. she doesn't even remember that the surgery was her idea. she's blaming my poor stressed grandpa for all this! last time i was over, she yelled at him something along the lines of, "was it your idea to get me carved up and make me a cripple? i bet it will be real fun for you when i die soon." he has to change her briefs and wait on her constantly even though he has cancer. seems hardly fair to him. i'm guessing she'll have to be moved to some sort of care facility soon. like hospice? she doesn't make much sense and can't do the things she ought to be doing. since she can't get up, i told him to look into a doctor that would make house visits or something. i'm not sure where i'm going with this but seeing her lose her dignity and independence scares me. i'm scared i will be like her someday except without a loving partner and no way to end the misery. it seems like what she's experiencing is worse than being dead. i'm sorry, that's... dark but i am frustrated someone i love is being consumed by this affliction. i highly value independence and already deal with my own mental issues and physical pain. when i see her, i just feel like my life is going to get worse. i feel like she's foreshadowing what i might experience someday and i've already been through a lot.  she hurts my feelings sometimes too. for instance, i was on the phone with the pharmacy the other day to get my vraylar filled and had to go in the other room because she kept going off on tangents that might get me flagged if they overheard her plus i needed to charge my phone. prior to this, we were having a perfectly normal, pleasant conversation. well i ended up leaving with grandpa to run a quick errand and when i got back, she had completely turned on me. she seemed to be having some sort of religious delusion. i forget exactly what she thought but i do remember being accused of "being mean and talking to devils." she then let me know she was "giving up" on me. whatever that means. she later apologized but i'm still upset with her even though who she really is in her heart would never treat me poorly. i don't want to ever require the level of care that she does. i don't want to be hollering disturbing nonsense or to be a bigger burden than i already am. if i ever can't wash myself or use the toilet on my own, i hope it won't be illegal for someone to assist me in terminating what's left of my life. this isn't about me, though. i mainly wonder how to support my grandpa. he deserves some sort of assistance to take stress off him. if he gets sick of changing briefs and sends her to hospice because she just keeps declining, i don't want him to feel guilty like he did something wrong. i know it's a hard choice to make because these places are hell on earth from what i can tell. i don't think he is able to care for her much longer, though. he needs care himself. i guess that's all for now. 😓

hi everyone. i’m a new member and i believe we’re about to start this awful journey… long story short, i’ve been concerned about my mom’s behaviors over the last 10 years at least. growing up, she was a great mom, but very strict and quick to anger. however, she was affectionate and loving.she started getting really nasty and verbally abusive towards by dad, her husband of over 40 years. gradually, it just got worse and worse to the point where it’s constant berating at my dad. she gets triggered by minor, random things, has an outburst, yells and insults, then acts like nothing happened moments later.  for example, i lost my phone. my dad and her started looking for it since it was in the house somewhere. my dad ended up finding it and she got furious that he found it and not her. it was a infantile. “you always want to be the hero!”among anger and tantrums, she has lost interest in things, she has trouble sleeping, she claims she “can’t do math anymore.” she hasn’t been able to recall her phone number or address in years. she’s never been good with numbers, but i don’t find that normal. her social tact is going downhill. she repeats the same stories. she keeps bringing up old memories and events from 40 years ago that make her mad. she obsesses over some of these things. she can’t hold normal conversations… she abruptly changes the subject. i find her forgetting words to things. she slips in random spanish words (her native language) when talking to us in english, which never used to happen.i thought this was her narcissism getting out of control as she ages, but now i’m convinced she’s got frontotemporal dementia. so my question is: how do we get her tested? she still functions quite well and can talk in circles around her doctor. they have no clue. do i call them? due to hippa, i don’t have any say… will they even listen to me?thanks for reading.

Starting the journey
hi:i’m a new member and wanted to say hello. i am concerned that my 80 year old mom is showing signs of cognitive decline and memory loss. i’m not sure how to proceed. just a little background.my mom and i are not particularly close, and we are both independent women. our relationship has had its ups and downs and we’re definitely not the mother/daughter types who are constantly on the phone with each other. i’m (for all intents and purposes) an only child. i live two hours away from where she lives and i grew up – a small town in northern michigan. throughout her work life she was very sharp and good with computers. she worked as an executive assistant to a city manager, and then later part-time in a nonprofit office. she enjoys and is very dependent on technology like email and streaming services. but lately she’s been struggling with it. i got her a smartphone for christmas and it’s not been going well. mostly i got it so that we could text with each other, but she’s keeping it shut off most of the time. i visited this past weekend and we walked through placing an online grocery order. i’ve been placing orders for her during the pandemic, but she’d like to do it herself. i saw that she keeps a folder of word documents with step-by-step instructions on how to do things. we went through the steps of placing the grocery order six times, while she wrote down notes. she would forget things she did just a few minutes prior. she also seems to forget things we talk about in our weekly zooms. i guess i’d like some advice on when it’s time to broach the subject of talking to her doctor about testing. also, when is it time to take a more active role in things like finances, etc? these are all so delicate. thanks for listening.

My dad has been trying to escape his whole life
my dad was diagnosed with dementia a year ago but shit has gone downhill suddenly and a lot has happened in the last two months. my niece and i have fallen into the position of caring for him from two different cities. i decided to start doing some personal writing about it on my blog. for reddit purposes, i'm copy/pasting. also i think all of you would understand it better than publishing it on facebook with people i know but don't really want to hear from. here's my first post...thanks for reading.&amp;#x200b;a few days after thanksgiving, my dad ran away from my niece’s home where he was staying after running away from his home in kentucky. he wandered the streets for a few hours until my niece found him and tried to take him home. unfortunately, his dementia has progressed to include “behavioral disturbances,” a very clinical way to name uncontrollable emotional — often violent — outbursts. he threatened to hurt my niece or smash the windows. on their way to the local hospital, he ran away again.throughout his life, running away has always been the ultimate solution. he has run away from his marriages. he has run away from his children. he has run away from his landlords. he has run away from his jobs.said another way: my dad has been trying to escape his own life.throughout my childhood, i can remember a lot of the excuses for leaving jobs. they usually revolved around broken promises; the job was harder than they said, a promotion was not coming around the corner, employee housing was not available after all. his most recent job, which he took at age 71 in early 2021, wasn’t the right fit because he didn’t need “fat women” telling him how to drive — he had driven professionally since the 1970s.he had the job for three weeks before quitting. he probably didn’t need it anyway.the excuses for leaving other things – women, children, landlords – were similar and sometimes more abstract. he left us in las vegas in the ’90s because the gambling was too much. he left other women because they were too controlling or whatever. sometimes he would just wave his hand at a problem and say “naaaaah” and that’s all it would take.he has been in the hospital on a legal hold since nov. 28. it occurred to me that he is technically homeless now. he literally has nowhere else to run. he’s scared. he’s sad. he’s suicidal.we’re a few days away from getting him into a group home. the family feels a deep sense of foreboding. what if he doesn’t like this place? what if he finds an excuse to hate it? what if he runs away again? everyone has asked the same questions.two months ago he finally said he was fed up with his home life in kentucky. he didn’t like how his wife was treating him. he had threatened her a few times, too. he packed up a barely functioning 2007 honda odyssey and started driving around on his way to las vegas. he got lost. went home. and tried again the next day.he made it to new mexico where my brother and niece tried to meet him. he forgot he was meeting them. the new mexico state police found him instead. my brother and niece took him home to las vegas.in las vegas, he stayed with my brother and sister-in-law for a week or so. but he didn’t like their house, he said it was too loud. he made threats there too and bailed again. this time my niece picked him up at a gas station and took him in. he liked it better there. for a time.when i visited during thanksgiving, my dad pulled me aside several times to discuss his plans to escape. he grew paranoid people would steal his money. this is apparently super common with dementia victims. once the gate broke on the gated community, he found a way to escape. that’s when my niece picked him. full circle.i never put the escape mentality together until now. my brothers have always thought of it the same way. as a kid it felt like one-offs; often easily justified to a pre-teen. as an adult, now i see it as an underlying theme.where does it come from? a feeling of rebellion? the ultimate expression of independence?it’s fascinating though. because his need to run, to be free, to escape, has been his ultimate prison.when he runs from marriages, it brings along alimony. when he runs from children, it generates court-ordered child support. and when he runs from that responsibility, it creates mountains of debt. when he runs from landlords, it destroys his credit. when he runs from jobs, it leaves him impoverished.there is no money to steal from him. and if there was, it would already be spoken for.he built a prison of bad choices. there is no way to truly run away from six wives and five children. most of us are still here. but now he has dementia. and he’s locked inside his own brain; a place he can never escape from. the walls will just close in tighter every day until they crush him.it’s inescapable.

Im so scared
i am seriously worried that my favorite person in the world may be facing the first small hurdles of dementia. she has always been bad about repeating herself, but never this bad. we must have the same 4 or 5 conversations every time i visit (1 time a week). maybe its because we dont have much to talk about, but she says it each time like its new information. she is also getting worse and worse with names. the icing on the cake is on my last visit to see her, she even told me she is worried that shes losing her memory.my grandma is a widow who lives alone. she has no friends, and the only meaningful interactions are going to church, visiting with her former brother in law (her sister died), calling her my aunt, and seeing me every sunday. sometimes i think she may be depressed. her mood swings are violent and often. her resting attitude is nihilistic and sad, a far cry from the sunny optimist of my childhood. since grandpa died she only got worse about this. i hope im overreacting. i hope im breaking down for no reason. i cant lose her, i cant. i would not survive it. watching her withdraw into a frightened husk of her former self, watching the woman that raised me forget me altogether. already, in these early stages (i don’t even know if she really has it or not) i don’t recognize this person. shes there but she kinda isn’t sometimes.when my dad and grandpa were alive, she was the most cheerful person i knew. the only pure person in existence. i cant count how many times i would have offed myself if not for her. to prevent her sadness. to spare her the hurt of losing her two sons, husband, sister, and grandson in the span of a few short years. **this woman is my only remaining family, one of the only people i love**i’m freaking out, hoping against everything that im wrong. that she’s wrong about herself. any advice is welcome.

Grieving and coming to terms with dementia
i’ve been a guardian of my fil who has dementia for less than a month.  we keep telling ourselves that it was necessary and that we did the right thing. i secured his finances and secured other items from his home to make it safer for him and homecare.  homecare comes three times a week. i’m upping it to a daily check.  we live 3 hrs away and we are his closest relatives.  he struggles with his finances, gets scammed, clicks on links and thinks everything is legit.  his judgment just isn’t there any more.  this last month he has started repeating himself and being in loops really bad.  it is frustrating and we are grieving because he doesn’t believe he has dementia and thinks we are stealing from him.  we try to tell him that we secured it for his safety.  but he just can’t remember.  he calls us daily about his money.  he apparently goes to the bank ~3 times a day asking about his accounts and checking his balances.  he forgets his cash at home and wants to take more out of the bank.  i know this has been a slow progression over the last two years but we live three hours away and aren’t faced with it every day.   since i’ve taken guardianship, it is in our face every day.  we are at his house this weekend and it is heart breaking and we feel like we are going behind is back.  he has moments of being mad at us luckily he gets over it and was ok most of the time.  i frankly have to take my hat off to those caregivers that live with or check on the person daily.  i wish we lived closer.  i tell myself things would be different and easier; but somehow i think that dementia is deceiving and it is terrible no matter how close or far away you are as a caregiver.  i’m thankful for this redit. i get on here just to know we are not alone in this and to read how others are doing and dealing with it.  and to confirm to ourselves that my fil really has dementia and we are doing the right thing.  the last few weeks has been the worst and i didn’t sleep well last night at fil house.  i’ve wanted to post something to ask for advice or encouragement or i don’t know.  i haven’t this weekend until now. the movie frozen 2 has the line “just do the next right thing.” it seems very appropriate for this stage of our life.  thanks for listening.

Grandma diagnosed with dementia
hi everyone. i (38f) have my grandma (82f) recently diagnosed with dementia. there have been signs the past two years but the past couple months it has gotten worse. she is forgetting a lot of basic things and needs a lot of help. she got her license taken away at the doctor and flipped out. she told me she hated that doctor and that he doesn’t know what he’s doing. she’s extremely angry all the time (not like her) and takes a lot of anger on me. she will call family members and say i’m against her and that i’m plotting with my grandpa (80m) to put her in a rest home. lately my grandpa has been guilt tripping me because i don’t go over enough or do enough for her. i work a full timejob in the er of a hospital in addition to being a single mom to my son (12m) he says she took care of you when you were little now it’s your turn. i literally don’t have the time to be there more than once maybe twice a week. he does the same thing to my brother. my brother is married with two small kids and works full time as well. we are 15 grandkids total. some of my cousins take turns taking her to eat and spending time with her. my grandpa constantly makes comments that too bad her daughter isn’t around to take care of her. he’s talking about my mom who passed away 20 years ago. i know the hospital got my grandma a social worker but she refuses to go back to the doctor and even the mention of a caregiver pisses her off. i’m not sure what to do in my situation. i want to help her but feel like i’m in a lose lose situation. for context my grandpa is in good health and lives with her in the home they have shared for 60 years.

Very worried advice needed
i just want to apologize for how long this is i just want everyone to have a clear picture.so i am very concerned about my grandmother's state atm. i will try to give you a quick rundown of the situation. my grandmother has always had slight memory problems all my life(i lived at my grandparents and currently am now) anyways she has had some medical problems she had her bladder removed years ago cuz of cancer and more recently(1-2 years) has had some kidney issues. anyways a few months ago she got real sick and was in the hospital and ended up having to have a major high risk surgery cuz something happened with her pee bag(sorry don't know medical term) and basically urine wasn't leaving her body. so everything went great and we were happy but we did notice her memory problems dramatically increased and got worse. not to the point of anything significant but definitely noticable. i will say before that my mom had taken over doing the bills for her because over time she was getting more and more confused with them and accidently putting herself in negative. (a few months before she got sick) so my mom took over money and bills but she was still involved and aware. fast forward to like a week and a half 2 weeks ago she had randomly started getting extremely tired and slowly over time had to do less and less.(she's always been very independent like washing clothes grocery shopping and loved playing her computer games) we get her to the dr and he does a blood test and calls back the next day and says it's something with her kidneys so we get her apt for 2 days from then. well we had to call an ambulance cuz she was so bad off we didn't think she would make it that long. it ended up being a uti they said and she had lost alot of weight. so they get it under control and she comes home and her mental state has dramatically gotten worse and changed. she never knows the time, wakes up crying randomly in the middle of the night thinking everyone just left her alone and it's day time so i sit with her and keep her calm, and is confused and always wants to sleep. what i worry about most is she is not eating.. i don't understand why she won't eat.. i got her some high calorie boost drinks that i can once in awhile get her to drink. i try to explain to her the importance of her needing to eat and tell her that's probably why she is feeling so bad and tired. we make sure she gets her meds on time and i just don't know what to do. she is able to walk and use the bathroom on her own and knows who we are etc, but her not eating is scaring me and her memory. she don't remember conversations we have even if it's just 5 minutes later. every day she seems worse and gets up less and less. today i went to check on her at like 11 pm or so and she seemed completely normal asked what time it was and if my grandpa was watching tv when i told her if was 11 at night she was totally surprised. we talked for a minute and i had an idea and told her i had to go to the gas station and asked if she wanted any cookies or anything like that(she loves sweets) and she just said no she wasn't hungry but thank you i again tried to tell her it was from her not eating and she just kinda gave me a blank look and didn't really say much then asked for a mcdonald's coffee. so i left the room got my shoes on and got her night meds and went back in(5 mins tops) and she had no idea that i had just been in there and no recollection of our conversation. i still got her a coffee and when i brought it to her if was literally the same convo as the first one but she wasnt the same she was confused and literally just from sitting up she said she was so tired but couldn't figure out why. i am so emotionally drained i don't know what to do anymore i've been closero her then anyone my whole life and i can't help her or get her to understand or remember. my family says there's nothing we can do and it was only going to get worse and to try to prepare and enjoy the time with her but i guess i just don't want to accept that and still have a hope she may be at least a little better soon and that it was probably just from the infection she had. she hasn't even mentioned bills or money or driving or anything. she hasn't been officially diagnosed with anything but i assume and my family has to for a long time now(3-5 yrs) that she has dementia. i guess i always thought it just made people forget stuff and not do this.. any advice or thoughts or anything. why would she decline so rapidly to being basically fine other then minor memory problems to how she is now? i'm sorry for how long this is.

Early dementia, mental capacity to set up Power of Attorney
hi everyone, i’ve just returned from a 10 day holiday with my father in law, which has confirmed to me (a none medical professional) that he has early dementia. prior to the holiday i would see him once a week for family lunch on a saturday for a couple of hours. at these lunches he would tell the same stories as the week before, or the week before that, and wouldn’t seem to realise that. i wouldn’t say anything because i didn’t want to embarrass him, but i would speak to my partner about it. she thought it was because her father &amp; mom did very little so did not exercise their minds. they are both 75 &amp; do very little the last 7 years in retirement. they only leave the house to go to the supermarket. otherwise they just tv all day. my partner thought a holiday together in new york would invigorate her dad mentally, however this hasn’t been the case. he told me the same stories each day, 4 stories which he repeated every day, for 10 days in a row. i didn’t say anything because i really felt he’d be deeply embarrassed &amp; i didn’t want to spoil his time on holiday. rather, i thought i’d deal with it on return. he is a little bit aware that he’s losing his memory - but from forgetting to buy things at the supermarket, rather than from repeating stories. his situation is complicated by the fact he’s been addicted to alcohol all his life &amp; has drunk alcohol every evening for 55 years. he’s not an out of control, completely unmanageable addict, he’s always been a functioning addict. he doesn’t get extremely drunk, but he is quite drunk each evening. he won’t quit drinking at least not yet. an early dementia diagnosis may well shock him into stopping. he also has great difficulty concentrating - he has a very hard time listening to anyone for more than a couple of seconds, after which he can’t maintain eye contact &amp; fidgets and moves a great deal. i have a few friends with adhd &amp; he very much presents as adhd. he has never been honest with a doctor about the adhd like problems &amp; he’s not been honest with a doctor about his drinking since 2002. in 2002 he became type 1 diabetic because of his drinking &amp; was hospitalised with pancreatitis. he manages his diabetes okish. he often has blood sugar 50% over what it should be. my partner has recently broached a power of attorney with him, which he was in favour of. he despises the idea that a lot of his inheritance will go on care fees in future. he frequently uses words like “it’s disgusting after all the tax i’ve paid in my life”. he does have substantial money to pass onto his wife (who is also 75) and my partner. about £200,000 in cash &amp; about £650,000 in his house. his wife is very sharp mentally, although physically she has trouble standing up &amp; walking now. i don’t know how to proceed with his poor memory &amp; a power of attorney. is it already too late because he no longer has mental capacity?he is lucid &amp; can problem solve &amp; functioned quite well on holiday except for the memory of what he said. what is the next step? is it to talk to him being honest about his memory of story telling &amp; to go see his gp for a mental capacity &amp; dementia evaluation?what are his options for a power of attorney over both health care &amp; money based on varying degrees of early dementia?thanks for the help

Does a diagnosis matter?
i’m power of attorney and the only remaining family to an uncle. he has a number of complicated health conditions and lost all mobility after a fall more than 2 years ago. i found him in his bathtub after what had likely been 3 days. he had a minor stroke (not tia) at least 15 years ago. he had been in declining health and gradual cognitive decline for many years. i had been trying to convince him to downsize and move into an apartment with more accessible arrangements for years (his house was old and dangerous) for years before this incident. he is very overweight. he has a-fib, hypertension (controlled with meds)congestive heart failure, minor kidney disease and a number of other underlying conditions.  he has vascular wounds and has been going to a wound  center every 1-2 weeks for about 9-10 months. he takes roughly 25 prescriptions  including blood thinners.  he now lives in a long term care facility (he will likely run out of money in about 3-4 years) and is only 75. i have poa but he is still cognitively “there” enough to want to remain involved in decisions (but doesn’t remember them and can’t comprehend all of the details). he cannot perform any adls independently and needs helps with transfers. he takes diuretics and is not technically icontinent but needs a lot of help toileting and wears pull ups. i strongly suspect he has vascular dementia.i am not sure that an official diagnosis actually matters or would change anything about his medical treatment or life.  it is a lot of manage his medical care and wound care and cardiac care already.  he was hospitalized twice in the last year. should i pursue a diagnosis? does it matter? the cognitive declines and issues are all more about executive function, planning, social skills, and emotional regulation  and not forgetting who people are or anything like that.  he does seem to occasionally hallucinate at night but that is me inferring things from what he tells me later. he is fine or seems better for a while then things get worse, then a little better, then worse.i work full time and have 2 kids with special needs. i am just not sure pushing for a diagnosis is worth it.

How to be more patient with my grandpa?
hi, i'm fourteen years old and my granddad has dementia, alzheimers and hearing loss. hes 85 years old. he lives with me, my younger brother (he's 9) and my parents and a dog. he came to live with us maybe two years ago. i think hes had dementia since i was about 8. i didn't really know him before then. his wife, my grandma, died when i was ten years old of a heart attack. she was really the only grandparents i was ever close to. i loved her aand i was really close to her. so back to my granddad. like i said i didnt really know him before he had dementia. i used to get frustrated cause we would have the same conversations over and over, or because he would sometimes barge into my room while i was at online school and ask me to write a telephone number down for him but i dont any more. but lately it's been getting harder and harder.even before dementia i dpnt think he was a very nice person. my mum would sometimes tell me stories of him being borderline abusive - hed call her names, and ignore her, and push her into a wall, and break the things he liked because they were "disturbing" him. so i dont like him at all. but my mum is the only person who can take care of him. i've seen his private parts because one day he forgot to put his pants on. luckily my brother wasn't home. i have  changed his diaper before, since he shat in it. my parents try the best they can to take care of him albut most of the day they're at work. last week he kept calling my brother a little brat, a monster etc and my brother went crying in his room. my parents were comforting my brother but i got so mad i stuck my.middle finger up at him. then he started calling me a brat too, and i didnt really care. we went ot the mall with him too a whole ago and he got really agitated and wanted to go find my mother (she and my father were going to get some stuff from the supermarket and told me to stay with him where he was). anyway he got really mad when i tried to explain it to him, and he started to walk away. i was afraid my mother wouldn't know where we were so i tried to sort of move in his path so he started shoving me to the ground. i started to cry but he still wouldn't listen to me. luckily my parents came back then.a couple days ago too he kept demanding to see a doctor (hed seen one the day before) and when my mum said she did she lost her temper and started to yell at him, saying he was a horrible person and basically saying hed harrassed and hurt both her and my grandma i was really close to all their life. and she went on for a bit. i told my brother to stay in his room and listen to some music. then i went back to my room and started crying. i hate him. hes a burden and a trouble to us and i feel really really guilty for feeling that way, but sometimes i just hate him absolutely. i wouldn't care if he dropped dead. at least my mum would be free of him.anyway that's about it. i feel really stupid and selfish for thinking that way but does anyone know any tips for being more patient with my granddad? thanks.

Signs of early dementia? Should I seek help?
hey all, i've posted about this on r/askdocs if you want to check my post there for more info, though i thought i'd post here as well. i'm a 17 year old male, so maybe i'm being totally irrational, but i'm still a little worried. i've found that dementia actually develops in someone wayy before they show obvious symptoms and it can be diagnosed, and so by that point its too late to treat (is it treatable at all?). english is my first and only languge, yet i will occasionally totally forget super common words. i'll know the idea for the word i want, but the actual word has absolutely slipped my mind; i know there's a word for it because i remember there being one and it would be crazy if there wasn't, but i can't manifest it in my mind for my life. sometimes when this happens i'll be able to remember the word after a minute or two, and sometimes i just won't be able to get it and i'll have to ask people for help. it's not like the word is totally gone from my mind forever though. eventually i do remember the word, i just can't recall it in that moment. i can't say precisely how often this happens, but i'd have to guess maybe once a week. though sometimes more often--it's mildly happened three times today, and once yesterday, which is a lot. i've never *heard*  or *read* and common word and not known what it means though (unless i actually haven't learned it somehow haha), only when i'm speaking/typing. i also sometimes forget names of people who i know pretty well, like teachers or family friends. i'll just absolutely not be able to recall what someone's name is. i might as well not even know their name, even though i have class with them every other day and see them almost every day. probably the worst case of this happening was when school started back again this year, i could absolutely not remember the name of a friend whom i had hung out with nearly every day last year. i didn't remember it until someone else said it, and i haven't forgotten it sense. it's not so bad that i'm forgetting my family members names though--it's usually a teacher who i had a previous year, a family friend who i haven't seen in a while (but i've still known very well for a long time). although it has happened with concurrent teachers. and a couple days ago, this wasn't with a word or a name, but i totally forgot my zip code. i remembered the first 3 numbers, but the rest i didn't know. i searched it up and read it and though "no way that's what it is", even though i've been able to perfectly recite it nearly my whole life, and it's even a nice combo of numbers that rolls off the tongue well. and that was just a single incident. now i can still recall it perfectly like i could before. i didn't mean for this post to be so long. should i be worried? i don't any other symptoms, or serious symptoms. my grandfather currently has lewy body dimentia, so i'm worried if that would increase the chance for me to get it. should i go see a doctor about it? or are these just the same memory slips everyone has, like when you walk through a door and forget what you were going to do? thanks for any replies.

hey all, i've posted about this on r/askdocs if you want to check my post there for more info, though i thought i'd post here as well. i'm a 17 year old male, so maybe i'm being totally irrational, but i'm still a little worried. i've found that dementia actually develops in someone wayy before they show obvious symptoms and it can be diagnosed, and so by that point its too late to treat (is it treatable at all?). english is my first and only languge, yet i will occasionally totally forget super common words. i'll know the idea for the word i want, but the actual word has absolutely slipped my mind; i know there's a word for it because i remember there being one and it would be crazy if there wasn't, but i can't manifest it in my mind for my life. sometimes when this happens i'll be able to remember the word after a minute or two, and sometimes i just won't be able to get it and i'll have to ask people for help. it's not like the word is totally gone from my mind forever though. eventually i do remember the word, i just can't recall it in that moment. i can't say precisely how often this happens, but i'd have to guess maybe once a week. though sometimes more often--it's mildly happened three times today, and once yesterday, which is a lot. i've never *heard*  or *read* and common word and not known what it means though (unless i actually haven't learned it somehow haha), only when i'm speaking/typing. i also sometimes forget names of people who i know pretty well, like teachers or family friends. i'll just absolutely not be able to recall what someone's name is. i might as well not even know their name, even though i have class with them every other day and see them almost every day. probably the worst case of this happening was when school started back again this year, i could absolutely not remember the name of a friend whom i had hung out with nearly every day last year. i didn't remember it until someone else said it, and i haven't forgotten it sense. it's not so bad that i'm forgetting my family members names though--it's usually a teacher who i had a previous year, a family friend who i haven't seen in a while (but i've still known very well for a long time). although it has happened with concurrent teachers. and a couple days ago, this wasn't with a word or a name, but i totally forgot my zip code. i remembered the first 3 numbers, but the rest i didn't know. i searched it up and read it and though "no way that's what it is", even though i've been able to perfectly recite it nearly my whole life, and it's even a nice combo of numbers that rolls off the tongue well. and that was just a single incident. now i can still recall it perfectly like i could before. i didn't mean for this post to be so long. should i be worried? i don't any other symptoms, or serious symptoms. my grandfather currently has lewy body dimentia, so i'm worried if that would increase the chance for me to get it. should i go see a doctor about it? or are these just the same memory slips everyone has, like when you walk through a door and forget what you were going to do? thanks for any replies.

I don't want to care for her anymore, I just don't want to be near her
my grandmother has alzheimer's and receives 24/7 care. my father talked me into taking the weekend position since i needed a job and i'm in college. she wasn't bad, for a while it was difficult to get her to stop trying to care for me and let me do things for her, but it worked out. she has always been polite and only occasionally needed assistance. this isn't the case anymore. having to help her more isn't a problem, it's just my job as her grandchild. the problem is she is extremely argumentative, she'll argues about things don't need to be argued about. she walks out in the cold without a jacket. she doesn't make sense when she's talking. she's forgetting to pull down her pants when she goes to the bathroom and then gets mad when i suggest she showers. she struggles to put her medication in her mouth even when i place them in a cup or directly in her hand. she argues that things are changing but me nor the other caregivers and changing her routine or moving things around. i thought maybe she needs something to do but she can't read or use her computer anymore, even with help she just gets frustrated. and she is unwilling to try anything i bring for her, she just wants to watch tv and go on the occasional walk. i am a college aged student, i'm in the middle of finals, and i work two 12 hour shifts on the weekend. my father is basically refusing to believe how difficult it is to take care of her. "all she does is watch tv, it's easy!" he says as i come home emotionally exhausted and immediately have to work on final essays and projects. i have bad mental health even before this, i can barely care for my cats (my father does most of the work at this point and then scolds me like i'm a forgetful five year old). today she started an argument and i just realized i'm at my limit. i should have never taken this job, all i can think about is breaking all the glass in her cabinet. i only have three days left and i just don't know if i can do it. she needs someone who is patient and can take care of her without getting upset. i can't telling my dad he'll tell me to just hold out, it's only three days. none of this is her fault. she never even remembers when she argues with any of the caregivers.

Father experiencing cognitive decline: question about first steps to take
hi--my father is in his early/mid 70s and is showing signs of some sort of cognitive decline. over the past year:* he sliced his hand sharpening the blade for a garden tool. we had to take him to the er to get stitches.* he went for a walk in the summer when it was 90 f, and he apparently dehydrated himself to the point where he collapsed in the driveway.* he has (nearly) gotten physically abusive with my mom. some other family intervened. * he recently ran an errand for my mom. should have taken him 45 minutes, but after five hours we found out he got lost and couldn't figure out how to get home. he's lived in this city (and performed this particular errand) numerous times over the last 40 years. * he seems to have difficulty doing basic tasks like buckling his belt when getting into a car. his hands shake, and he seems to have difficulty understanding others and holding basic conversations, etc. he is very forgetful for basic tasks. there's a consensus in the family that he is 'not all there' anymore.i'm trying to be proactive about this. my basic assumption is that my father will decline over the next year or so to the point that my mom will have to separate from him. plan is to have my mom spend time with me and my siblings. my siblings and i will split the cost of putting my dad into some sort of place with 24/7 care. general questions:1. does anyone have recommendations for tracking software? i want to install something on his android so that my sisters, mom and i can use to monitor him. similarly, i want to put something in his car that i can use to monitor his location. 2. does anyone have recommendations for cameras? i would like to install cameras in a few locations in my parents house to monitor things from time to time.3. is there any general idea of the 'rate of decline'? should i assume he will need to put into care in six months? a year?4. when did it become clear that it was 'bad enough' to have your parent be put into assisted care? 5. how did you handle his assets and estate? who should i speak to?6. when looking at assisted care facilities what should i keep an eye out for? and what should i avoid?i'm mostly concerned about my mom's safety since she insists on staying with my dad and taking care of him. any other advice would be appreciated. thanks!

I don’t know how to support my family through my grandfather’s dementia
first time posting, sorry if my train of thought is kinda all over the place, i have a lot of thoughts and don’t really ever address them.my (21m) granddad (83, we call him dai so that’s how i’ll refer to him) is in mid-late stages of dementia, and has been living in a nursing home since my nana (84) broke her hip last winter. she feels guilty about not being the person to look after him, and had tried to hire my aunt and older cousin (since they both work in care) before they realised that he needed 24/7 support.dai was always very passionate about football, and my family believe that doing headers with the ball might have caused head injury that eventually led him to this point. he was always very sure of himself and stubborn, traits that my mum and little brother both inherited, so when the first stages appeared, he wasn’t all that different despite the absent-mindedness. i don’t even remember exactly when he was diagnosed, but he’s been showing symptoms for nearly a decade. it doesn’t help that my nana keeps things to herself so ‘we don’t have to worry.’the biggest incident was boxing day 2018. the night before had been fun, loud, and festive, but i woke up the next day to shouting and arguments. my mum and uncle were arguing with dai, unsuccessfully trying to calm him down as far as i remember, as he threatened to phone the police. he didn’t recognise any of us except nana, and wouldn’t listen to them trying to convince him that we were the people in the photographs around his home. he believed that we were a cult trying to brainwash my nana, since she was agreeing with all of us. he did end up calling the police, who were sympathetic towards us. one of the worst parts of it was when he aggressively insulted my brother, who had been his best pal for his whole childhood, right up in his face. while we knew he was unwell, none of us had any idea things were so bad.fast forward to now, where my family have gotten phone calls from his nursing home, saying that he’d been trying to headbutt staff. this came out of seemingly nowhere; while he’s always been stubborn and grouchy, he’s never been violent. we didn’t want to believe it for a while, but recently when nana visited, he suddenly started cursing and yelling at her for seemingly no reason. they haven’t told us he needs to move yet, but we’re hoping it doesn’t come to that; nana can’t drive and he’s nearby enough right now that she can get the bus. i’m not a carer. i haven’t seen him since before quarantine. he forgot who i was a long time ago. but i’m worried about my relatives; my nana, obviously; my uncle’s family who live in the south of england who only come to scotland twice a year if we’re lucky; my extremely emotional auntie; and my mum and bro who are just way too practically-minded to process everything properly. i don’t know if i can do anything, which feels even worse. i don’t feel like official dementia/alzheimers support groups are even for me since i‘m never even around the guy. i just feel powerless to help.

Pretty sure my mother is starting this (pardon the no paragraphs)
so.....i just wanted to see if anyone has any thoughts about this.  and i'm sorry this is long, i just found this sub and i need to tell someone about this.  i'm pretty sure my mother (74) has started down this road.  she refuses to get any test for it, to the point that i'm not brining it up anymore because every time i do she starts screaming at me.  anyways.  this started about a year ago, it kinda snuck up on me.  she would call me (she lives on the east coast usa and i live in the western usa) -- anyways she would call me and ask me to help her balance her checkbook.  she was having trouble with basic addition and subtraction (something she was always good at, she was faster at it than me using a calculator.)  this went on for a while until we determined it was time for me to have access to her finances.  making a long story short, i now have access to everything. she pays some of the bills and i pay the rest.  it hasn't been too bad for a while, save her writing an extra check to her car insurance company for a completely random amount of money -- like $359.26 or something (her premium is $115 a month and had already been paid.)  she had no recollection of writing the check and only when i went into her bank account, brought up an image of the check written in her handwriting and printed it out and sent it to her would she believe me.  not to mention that check put her account into the negative -- i had to use my money to pull it out of the red.  she's set to take an airplane trip soon (i'm dreading that) -- i typed up the entire itinerary for her, dates and times and when to be there....everything.  she's set to leave on the 22nd.  multiple times she's asked me, "now, what day do i leave again?  the 16th?  is it after christmas?  -- "no, mom it's the 22nd" -- "the 22nd???  you never said that....."  --  "mom where did you put the itinerary i sent you?" -- "itinerary??" ...........  about 2 weeks ago she called me at 4 o'clock in the morning, i just happened to be awake so i answered it and she said she was tearing her apartment apart looking for her phone.  looking under her mattress, took all the cushions out of the sofa and chairs.......i said "mom, your phone is in your hand.  you're using it."  ---  "well i know that, but i'm telling you i can't find my phone!!"  i honestly didn't even know what to say.  i think i just changed the subject.  another thing she does is call me for a certain reason but once i answer the phone at some points she starts talking quieter -- almost to herself -- i have to say  "so what's the reason you called me again?" -- "oh yea i wanted to know \_\_\_\_\_" -- the quiet mumbling also goes into odd tangents..... tonight she called me to ask if i could help her book a doctors appointment (which, when she wasn't explaining it fully and i asked her again she got mad at me).......somehow in this "conversation" she ended up talking about my cousin (her niece) who died  in a car accident in 1973.   i forget everything else that was said except when she said "i'm not dealing with this anymore.  goodbye"  and hung up on me.  at which point i picked up an object in my room hurled it against the wall screaming every 4 letter word you can imagine and then broke down in tears.  but then, other times things are fine.  (relatively.)  i never expected this was what would happen to my mother.  physically, for a 74 year old, she's fine.  i take more meds than she does.  and honestly.......i just don't know.  i'm an only child and she's been divorced since she was pregnant with me.  so guess who is stuck with handling everything?  and, god forgive me, i resent the everlasting hell out of it.  i'll have no one to help me.  my family is fully of selfish assholes, nobody talks to anybody, so i can forget that.  it's all on me.  being as i'm her son rather than a daughter changes the dynamic somewhat if it gets to the point of needing help in the bathroom or such -- we'll have to get a nurse or something because i'm not moving back to where she is (where i grew up.)  i don't even know what i'm asking here but for anyone who got to this point, thanks for reading..

Post Operative Delirium/Menigitsis Will it get better or is this new baseline...stressed out!
my mom had a sudden change in vision and needed surgery in september. there were no beds at our local hospital so they lifeflighted her to a city about 300 miles away. the surgery was done through her nose (her pitiuary gland was pressing on her optic nerve). my mom came through the surgery fine, she was her "normal" self on facetime, andf the doctors said she would be home in 2 days. i got transportation arranged (they don't tell you when there are no beds due to covid they pay to take to you another hospital but they do not pay to tke you back). this was my first time having to really use my financial poa, and a great learning lesson. then nothing from the hospital for 4 days. i paniced and had to file compliants to get answers. it was scary being so far away and my mom's cell phone was disabled! she had developed mengitsis after the surgery. the hospital said she was safe, they had her in a small covid safe room (no windows) and she was getting iv's. i talked to her and she did not know who i was or our family was. it was hard. her baseline before the surgery was forgetting where she was going in the car or why she walked into a room or if she took her meds, but she knew who i was still and her family was and she was very sharp still on long term finances. the doctors signed papers saying she was not aware and i needed to take over all medical and finacial decisions so i was called for every med change and procedure and had to give permission. her blood cell counts got better and the medical staff said the meningitsis was getting better. she did get more peppy in her speech. she was not as sleepy sounding but still so confused about where she was what day it was and who people were. she would claim she was being held prisioner or in a drug rehab facility (she was in a neurology floor icu i confirmed no drug rehab in the building) she would claim she was outside all night (i know she was not i was in constant contact with the nurses). the doctor said she developed post operative  delirium.  they said this would get better when she got home. they finally got a bed a nursing home back at home and she was transferred. she has been a a facility close to me for almost 3 weeks and she still has this post operative  delirium ?, she is so confused as to what medical staff have come in, what time of day it is, she will claim she has not been showered for 2 weeks (not true) or that i have not visited for days (when i have been there every day . many times 3-4 times a day, and there is covid sign in so it is on the sheet i was there for hours).  she will say that kids were at her door screaming at night (no kids allowed, doubled checked, thr nurse says it is  delirium halliculations). the nursiing home staff is super nice but way understaffed and it is hard to get answers. one staff memeber (someone high up in an office) said iif my mom still has this post operative delirium a month later, it is likely her new norm? it is such a huge decline from pre surgery plus she is so angry. she will yell you have not visited me, and say bad words and i an exhustated and have visited her 2 times that day but she yells and she flashes her diaper(the surgery left her incontinent which is been very hard) and says crude things. this again is a shocking 1 month change. i have looked up post operative delirium and had no idea how common it was in patients over 75. &amp;#x200b;now i have to make decisions and i have sat with the lawyer and i have the power to make almost every choice i can think of. she is going to be released soon. she wants to go home, to her home. no way she can go home alone. the other factor is when she got sick i was in the process of moving out of state. like i had sold my house and my spouse had a new job in another state and we had offered on a home. our plans at the time were for her to live at her home with help and then we had located long term facilities in the area we were moving to that my mom was familiar with (she used to live in the state we are moving to) that she agreed to.  now this level of help she needs is so much higher then 1 month ago so what i had lined up will not work. now my spouse and one child are  cross country and myself and my son are renting part of a home trying to stay nearby my mom. i have not got a good nights sleep in a month, i have lost almost 20lbs (and i was not overweight), i just want to have my own space and some quiet (the retirement city my mom is so hard to find a rental, hotel room, it is booming and i am lucky to have the small noisy sapce i have but i just want to cry some nights, it is so loud and i am used to quiet) and sleep but i cant leave my mom yet. she says i do not want to move (yet she does not know where she is right now). she is angry and just so hard to spend time with. i have the legal paperwork and i can write a check for her to move, i can put an addition on my new house for her to stay there, i can pay for a nursing home or assisted living, i have the control but she is so angry(before the surgery, she was fiesty and opinionated  but not angry like this). her wish is to go home locally and have caregivers (which she can afford) but i , her only family will be over 2,000 miles away.  her pcp says while she might be able to go home, with her many issues, she likely will be back iin a hospital or care center in 6 months to a year and i will be far away. the pcp says take her with me, the nursing home says take her with me, she has almost no friends left in the area, sadly most have died or some have moved back to be with family. the local medical care is very hard to come by, the city boomed and doctors did not come to meet the demand. do i just force her to come with me? or do i let her stay and most likely fail and come back for her. i worry about people taking advantage of her in her if i am not close. it scary to see the lack of workforce. stores are closed, restuarants are closed. one of the reasons i am losing weght is at 8pm i leave the nursing home and the city is already closed due to no workers. i cant find a grocery store or fast food place open after 8pm. previously i was easily able to find a nice stay at home mom to come help with housework or errands who was happy to make some extra money, but that is gone. ther rates for in home care were $15 an hour and now are $40+ if you can find someone and with my mom's anger she is not going to be a patient someone wants if they have a choice. &amp;#x200b;if yoiu read my whole long story, thank you so much. so my main concerns are is this post poerative  delirium her new norm?  since she already had memory loss, did this surgery and the complications just send her downhill faster? should i move her or leave her ? i want to respect her wishes. i have been very careful with every medical choice and financial choice to answer as if i were my healthy 50 year old mom not what i want. she does not want to move so i dont want to go against her wishes but her wishes are no really the best medical choice for her and not the best choice for support.

long post, tldr at the end. i didn't know my grandpa growing up. he was estranged from the family for decades. by coincidence, i moved to a town close to him a few years ago, and decided i would try and strike up a relationship with him. as it turned out, he is a kind, quiet soul. i knew he had mild dementia when i looked him up, but he knew who i was, and we bonded really quickly. now, looking back, i realize how lucky i am that i got to form a relationship with him before his dementia got really bad. i feel like i got in there just in time, he has already forgotten who by brother, and his other grandchildren are.the last year was the hardest, he lost the ability to keep track of time. he'd go to bed at weird hours, and wake up just thinking it was morning all the time. i would pop by for a visit at 8pm, and here's grandpa at his kitchen table, having a cuppa coffee, saying "what brings you here so early?". he would go for short walks at all hours of the night, which was very worrisome, as he lives in kind of a crummy area. i became that one person he could trust if he needed help. since he never knew what time it was, he would make phone calls at all hours to ask about groceries, mail, and other little things. eventually, i had to take his phone book away because people were getting mad at him about the 3am calls (including one of his ex wives - i always joked that maybe i would just leave her number there!). i left my number by the phone, and said "you can call me any time, and i will never be angry." true to my word, whenever he called at weird hours, i was as nice as pie and patient. it was usually a short, 2 min conversation, just to reassure him that things are taken care of and he doesn't have to worry. recently, someone started to target him for money, "some babe", he called her. she would come to him and say she's taking him out for a drive, then get him to pay for a bunch of stuff at walmart. she sent her kids to his house to beg for money. he'd call me after to tell me "i've done something i shouldn't have". by the time i got talking to him the memories of it would fade. we never got a proper description, or figured out who was targeting him. not that the targeting was a good thing, but it was the catalyst that got him into long term care finally. my family has been begging the local health authority to approve his long term care application, because he got way past the point where he could manage on his own, or with my help. we had people coming in to help 4 times a day, but it wasn't enough. we sent the health authority an email with the subject line "instances of elder abuse", and bam, three days later he had a placement! his ltc facility is about an hour's drive from me, i wish it was closer, but i'm glad he got into it. it's one of the nicer places around here. he has his own room, and the facility and staff seem amazing. i was so worried about his confusion, because he did not want to go into care. but when he arrived, and saw all his stuff set up in his new room, he said "all this is for me? what did i do to deserve this? this is great!" phew! he's doing great, and i'm finally sleeping through the night without the phone calls. i miss him, even though it's only been a few days. i'm going to give it a couple weeks before i visit, because i really want him to get into the routine there. sorry for the long post, just new to reddit and this community, and so happy i've found a place where i can talk about it anonymously with people who are going through something similar. tl;dr - newly formed relationship with my estranged grandpa with dementia turns heartwarming, then difficult. after being essentially robbed by someone, gets long term care placement. couldn't be happier, except if he was a bit closer.

PCP won't screen for dementia?
sorry if this is not the right place to ask this question. looking for advice on how to get a screening and diagnosis for my dad.my father (late 70s) had an "episode" last year. he was dazed, disoriented, confused, forgetful. he said he was hearing voices. he had no history of hallucinations or delusions before. finally he was barely responsive to my mother asking him questions or trying to talk to him. she took him to the emergency room and they sectioned him. it was terrible. the place they sent him, i don't understand how anybody could get better in a place like that. there were people screaming at all hours having severe mental health issues in the halls. they kept him strapped to a chair! he doesn't use a walker or anything, he does not need a wheelchair. he couldn't have his ipod. because of covid my mother, his wife of 30 years, could not even visit him. he had limited access to a phone to talk to me or my mother. no one would consider his age to be a factor, it was treated like a mental health crisis. they said it was depression. he had been prescribed ambien so that was also blamed. he was finally released but he has never been the same.he forgets things all the time- i don't remember how to use the washing machine (he's done hundreds of laundry on this machine), i don't know how to answer my phone (it's a flip phone), how do i get to turner classics (it's the same channel number it's been for 15+ years), how long should i cook this steak for (he's been grilling t-bones for 50 years), etc. wakes up at 1:00 or 2:00 a.m. thinking he has to get to a doctor appointment. doesn't read anymore, doesn't talk to friends, doesn't listen to music. my father has over 1600 albums on vinyl. i have no idea how many cds and classette tapes. this man isn't listening to music anymore?! can't decide what to order for dinner for like, 30 minutes. burger or salad? burger or salad?his pcp *will not* screen him for dementia or alzheimer's. will not refer to a specialist. he says it's not worth it because my dad is depressed so the screening won't be accurate anyways. how do you have a man in his late 70s with these symptoms and not even look into it? he won't test for vitamin deficiency or anything. blames everything on depression and says the severe episode last year was because of the ambian.well now my dad is having another episode. he won't talk. i got him to say hello to me over the phone but he couldn't answer when i asked how he was feeling or what's going on with him. asked him if he knew where he was and he didn't answer. asked him if he remembered he and mom are supposed to come visit me soon and he was quiet for a long time and then said yeah. ask them if he still wanted to come visit me and he didn't answer.he's terrified to go to the er because he thinks they'll section him again. i need his shitty doctor to take this seriously or get him in asap with a doctor who will. how do i force this terrible medical system to screen and diagnose my father so we can know whatever is going on with him and start looking into treatments?? how can i stop them from putting him in a horrible place like they did before?

I don't know what to do.
hello. my grandmother has dementia, i recently found out. although i kind of knew that she was showing symptoms of it, now i realize how bad it actually is. my mother doesn't really have a strong relationship with my grandmother, they normally see each other once or maybe twice a year, they also live pretty far away from one another. i think when we visited my grandmother in 2018, she was already being a bit forgetful: occasionally repeating words and phrases in sentences. in 2019/begin 2020 we visited her again, she did not seem to recognize me at first when she opened the door. she went upstairs, and showed us cabinets and wardrobes full off unnecessary stuff, which she compulsively bought. rows and rows of the same cleaning product, toilet paper, et cetera. i don't think that we really visited her after that. (until recently)just a few weeks ago, my grandmother (she is usually very cold and blunt) called my mother in a deeply emotional state, begging her to come by once. my mother asked if it was okay to see her that same day, which my grandmother initially accepted.however, just 30 minutes or so before the appointment she said she wasn't 'feeling well' so my mother shouldn't come. she didn't, but a couple of days later she did. when my mother arrived, she found her own mother lost in dementia. my grandmother has formed this narrative which she says every single time when she's talking to someone: "oh, did you know i got fired from my job? the business closed down." this was 15 years ago."hey, i renovated my kitchen." 10 years ago. yesterday, i went with my mother to see my grandmother. she did not recognize both of us. we brought some food, because she is terribly skinny and keeps forgetting to eat. my mother had to explain that she was her daughter, i think she understood that. she kept asking for my age, and awkwardly asked me what my name was, and where we lived. care: she can not live by herself without help anymore. we can't go there every day to take care of her, but, there is a friendly neighbour at the other end of the street who helps her and chats with her occassionally. he is truly a kind man, but it is also very strenuous for him. he is getting literal physical pain because of the intensity of taking care of my grandmother, poor soul. we have contacted my grandmother's doctor (she has not been officially diagnosed yet) who is very, lazy i would call it. he refused to get help for my grandmother and was overall just lacking. after some pushing, we have managed to get a caretaker to take care of my grandmother, but onfortunately, it starts in januari! my grandmother still has a driving license and is still driving, which should be taken from her. i don't know what stage she is in, however, i would guess stage 5 of alzheimer's. damn, i just realized how much i wrote. if anyone actually read all of that: thank you. i don't know what we can do at this point.

Dad thoughts
dad passed recently and im cleaning his den today. im realising that his dementia was much worse than i ever imagined. there were times when he looked like he was thinking intensely and solving the world's problems. maybe that should have been a sign for help. like alot of old guys he had to always be tough and never admit he had a problem. in fact sometimes he would get really ticked if i tried to help too much. used to be he got ticked if i tried to help at all. but watching him try to stand with his pd and look like he was about to fall i couldnt help it. he tried his best to act like nothing was wrong but of course it was pretty obvious.  later he would let me help him up and help him balance. its not about ego or saving face its about being safe.it's hard to talk about one issue and not the whole package but will try. my dad had things he forgot he had. and things stuck in drawers. he would say he didnt want to do something. if i tried to get him to listen to audible he would just say maybe later. i think he was embarrased that he couldnt remember how. and thats not a problem. i never minded showing him every day.so, to keep from rambling.take what they say with a grain of salt. try and peek inside and make it as easy as possible. always be willing to do it for them. make up a good excuse to get tat audible started, show em that book they like. start it and then check on em and make sure all is ok. understad that theyre probaby not going to tell you the entire truth so look for signs. like my dad they dont want you to know theres a problem. put yourself in their shoes and think about what they face, what are the challenges and frustrations? most of us just think of ourselves as us. we dont always notice how we degrade or our issues. maybe the changes are so gentle until say you cant button a button w/out alot of trouble. theres a feeling of losing yourself and losing self sufficiency. you dont want to let on and hpe no one notices.what i sincerely wish is to find a way to touch their hearts and say 'its ok, im here to help you'. they dont have to hide it, or worry or feel bad. maybe i assume too much based on my experience.  if someone who loves you is caring for you, let them in and let them help. to me the important thing is to enjoy life as uch as you can. if you're taking care of someone youlove then the thing is making them as happy and confortable as lossible and enjoy your tie with them. too many of us learn thru experience. maybe its out there already but a book about how to care for a loved one when you're a family member.my folks are gone now. i will always miss them. i learned by experience and wish with all my heart that i had known certain things in the beginning. if you think you understand it all, trust me, you dont. read, find someone to talk with, watch videos. get involved, get your elder involved. my mom made me promise to never put her or dad in a home. that never happened. mom passed in the doctors office and i held her hand. i wasnt there when dad passed in the hospital. but earlier in the day i held his hand and told him i loved him.  he passed peacefully. for better or worse my watch and duty is done. for those still going may god bless and keep you.

stubborn parent with dementia out of state
my father is not an old man. he isn't even 70 yet.he's a stubborn, old school biker, who is decompensating rapidly these days.i wasn't aware of how bad things had gotten until my brother called me to say that our dad's neighbor called bc our dad was wandering up and down the street and didn't know where he lived. he was giggling like a teenage girl, massively uncharacteristic for our gruff n tuff father.i live out of state, and moving back honestly wouldn't be much help, as he lives in the middle of the woods and i don't know how to drive. and honestly? i don't know if i could emotionally handle the times when he gets to be emotionally and verbally abusive. he made one very cutting comment to me at my last visit and it wrecked me. not just because it was hurtful, but bc i knew my father would never, and yet, here he was.we're working on getting a surrogate poa, bc i was told by his local courts that the poa could only be signed if he was aware of what he is signing. which he clearly isn't. it's been this awful back and forth of always thinking we are about to get him somewhere safe and then it falls through.i've been working with long term care services org for over a year now, and up until i lost my shit and yelled at the case manager, nothing at all had been accomplished except having some meals brought to his home. my outburst led to him finally getting a caregiver, who is usually works with hospice patients and met with my father as a favor. she was so moved by how rough things are, how nice and grateful he was, and who he is, that she decided to keep helping. she even comes out on her days off to make sure he takes his meds.recently she had to leave town and he started cherry picking his meds again (he only takes the ones that fuck him up, bc old hardwired addict behavior, though he's been sober for many years now)he's depressed. he managed to rack up a bill for several thousand dollars with the cable company, so unless we cover that, he doesn't have television. he cannot read anymore. they finally took away his driver's license, because he was bored and just driving in circles all day, burning gas and time. all the while having dizzy spells.his house is rotting out from underneath him, but he refuses to leave. multiple times now we have secured placement for him, only to have him refuse, vehemently. only recently did his absolutely useless pcp acknowledge the diagnosis of dementia, after forgetting that he even referred him to neuro. this man was rx'ing benzos to a man in his 60's with multiple tbis, without even considering how it could be advancing his dementia, until i started protesting it and pointing out how harmful this is. his office rarely responds to the case managers request for home health etc.  i knew it was vascular dementia due to tbi for a long while. and i've pressed relentlessly for this dx, which we finally got. it's been a fucking roller coaster, man.he can't pay his bills bc he keeps blowing all his money, cannot tell us where it's going, and then showing up at my brother's work (up to 7x per day) to ask for money. which my brother gives him bc he wants to help, and my dad is always saying things like "my water is going to get shut off if i don't give them $200 today" and then the money vanishes and the bill remains unpaid.while my brother is local, he works full time+ side jobs to provide for his wife and two children under the age of 2. he's beat down. and his relationship with my dad is frayed at best d/t my father calling him up to 60x a day (sometimes at his place of work) to try to manipulate him or guilt him into things. so he just doesn't have the bandwidth to try and care for him after 7 years of trying to clean up his messes since our mother died in the accident that caused the first tbi. (another accident, two years later, with identical injuries made this worse. and his refusal to do any ot or pt afterward was...bad)i have been struggling to get the few members of my family who know what is going on, to understand that he isn't just being a dick. this is an illness.all of the guys from my dad's former mc vanished. exhausted by him and his house, and all he did for them for so many years now magically means nothing. no one comes to visit. and they may have tried to call but he kept going to the kiosk at walmart and getting burner phones without minute plans, so he just had like 15 cell phones stacked in the house, with no way to reach anyone, until i got a landline installed at his house in my name so they would turn it on w/o having to pay off a debt he has with them that we cant afford.i finally got on his bank account to help get his bills paid/keep his utilities on via online banking. he's been to the ed 6 times in the last two weeks. yesterday, we had another beam of hope when he called an ambulance (he's been doing this a lot lately bc he's having a ton of anxiety and depression bc his mother just died around the anniversary of his wife's death, and he knows but doesn't know how to process emotions anymore. he also has a heart condition, thyroid issues, copd, htn) and his care giver raced to the hospital with an action plan. his heart rate has frequently been below 60bpm, hold him for 72hrs in the cardiac unit, and then d/c him to a med rehab facility that he agreed to go to for two weeks, to get his medications managed and help him get leveled out again, and from there get him placed in a permanent memory care unit. except the hospital looked at all of this information, including his dementia dx, and that he lives alone in the woods, ignored the care plan. and discharged him home in cab. absolute negligence. i am so heart broken. i'm trying so hard to get him the help he needs, knowing he would be better not being alone all the time, bc that's destroying him. and it always falls through.advice is good and welcome, but i mostly just feel so so so alone in this and thought maybe, somewhere on the internet there would be other people dealing with this too who could make that feeling a bit less.thank you.

Does my dad has postfrontal dementia?
i don't know why i'm here. maybe i just want to vent, maybe i just want to find people who have been in a similar situation and learn about their stories and how they deal with dementia. for me, it's my dad.i notice my dad has difficulty talking, although i still understand him. a couple of months ago, i was explaining to him that i'm about to do my master's degree and he had trouble following along, asking me to repeat things multiple times. that's when my suspicion started and so i dug around the internet and found that he might suffer from dementia.i didn't think much of it at first, i thought it's natural for people to become forgetful as they age. he's in his mid-60s. physically very healthy. he goes for a walk every morning.i didn't know it at first but he recently had multiple episodes with my mom. my mom is in his 50s, she suffered from a stroke and had part of her left arm and leg paralyzed. anyhow, these episodes always involved my dad accusing my mom that she's been cheating on him. and that she was secretly seeing this 'imaginary' person while we were preparing for grannie's funeral last month. my grandma from my mother side passed away last month. dad pissed me off so much because his accusation was so absurd given the occasion and mom's condition.my sister was with my mom the entire time so she always defended her. but my dad kept pressing on the issue even after we cleared his misunderstanding. when my sister offered to show him mom's call logs and all the messages she exchanged. he refused, saying she must've deleted them. he insisted that eventually, he'll find that 'imaginary' person. he even threatened mom with divorce. mom was crying almost every day. he's also acting like a child, when mom and him were not speaking to each other, he won't eat any meals prepped for him. my mom started sleeping in my sister's room because she told me she was scared. sometimes he's suddenly enraged over something that never happened and won't listen to reasons. although sometimes when he calmed himself down, he self-reflected and admitted that there's something wrong with him.my mom told me what she endured on daily basis, and i feel sad for my dad and what mom had to go through. when i first confronted dad, he agreed to see the doctor after pandemic is over. and he was aware that he might have dementia. but recently he had another episode with mom, and refuse to see the doctor. i thought we already resolved the issue, but he kept bringing it up. he doesn't know it but everyone around him notices that his personality has changed. he used to be kind, patient and sweet. now he's irritable to be around. when the family from my mother's side is gathering which happens often, he used to always go with her. now he exerts very little effort to socialise, staying at home most of the time. my mom always asks him to come with her, and he always refuses. later then he would complain that mom never invited her. when my sister defended her that she indeed invited her, he would silence my sister by shouting telling her to shut up.i told my mom to keep a journal on her and to take notes whenever dad has an episode. i've had another talk with my dad and he agreed to relieve his responsibility to mom and me. i honestly don't know what to do. i want to have him diagnosed so it becomes a fact that he is indeed sick. and i want him to accept it so we can start working together helping him live with his condition. it seems to me that he has trouble accepting that he is sick. according to the internet, he might suffer from what's called protofrontal dementia. i'm also worried for mom, she suffered enough already.

From one ending the journey, here's my advice to those starting out
my mom died yesterday after a long battle with dementia. here is what i've learned in hopes that it may helps those of you starting out.&amp;#x200b;1. have a conversation early about what they want they dementia journey to look like. what things are important to them to have around, so you know what things to take with them to a nursing home? what are they worried about or afraid of, so you know where to focus your energy? who do they want making decisions for them if you they can't make them? most importantly, what does a good death look like to them? this will help your decision making along the way.2. get medical and financial powers of attorney documents drawn up, along with a dnr, if at all possible. these documents will make everyone's life so much easier. 3. email an electronic copy of the dnr and poas to yourself and keep those live in your inbox. hospitals, emts, nursing homes, doctors and funeral homes will all want to see them so they can be sure you are truly the person allowed to make decisions, and being able to email them the moment you are asked for them will mean you won't have to wait to make any decisions, and can make sure your loved one gets the best continuity of care with the least confusion and the most consistency on what they want.4. if you do not have a financial power of attorney document, banks cannot give you access to your lo's accounts to pay bills, monitor for fraud, etc. if at all possible, convince your lo to sign you on to their accounts as a signatory (i.e. ability to sign checks from the account.) review the account monthly for weird charges (signs of fraud or scammers). close credit card accounts they don't need. put a freeze on their credit card and social security account so scammers can't take out loans in their name or get social security checks redirected to someone else. where possible, set up direct deposit on social security/retirement checks, and direct withdrawal on bills.5. if you have to make a payment or transfer on your lo's account, use the "note" feature to document what it is. for example, i buy my lo's groceries, and i put "june groceries" in the note feature when i transfer money to my account to reimburse my expenses. that way if someone ever accuses me of stealing from their account, i can explain what the money was for.6. if your lo's doctor uses an electronic medical records system, try to get the sign on information. your lo will have to give permission for you to talk to the dr, or you can use your medical poa. being able to email the doctor via the medical records system before i took the lo to a doctor's appointment with my real concerns and what was really going on helped all of us. the doctor had the background to make the right treatment decisions. i didn't have the lo disagree with me in front of the doctor "no, i'm not forgetting anything, i'm fine to drive." and it helped me establish a partnership with the doctor to discuss concerns, which was important especially as my lo got worse and needed more care.7. being a caretaker means a level of selflessness that many don't really understand. you have to give up being right in favor of your lo's comfort ("you're right, mom, it's awful that someone stole your wallet" when you know they just put it somewhere and don't remember). be ready to apologize for things you didn't do because it will be easier on your loved one than fighting them. 8. you may get called names, insulted and even face violence. dementia will teach you a level of love and forgiveness you won't expect. 9. but you also need to care for yourself. you need to remember that you are in this for the long haul. take breaks. get respite care. ask someone else to be with your lo for a day or an hour or a weekend or a week. this isn't failure, and it isn't you being demanding. just like you have to sleep to face the day, your need a respite to face the next battle. 10. if your loved one is violent, it is a sign that they need more care than you can give them. you can't care of them if you are hurt yourself.11. relatives and friends may second-guess you, criticize what you do, etc. the best defence is a power-of-attorney and the ability to say "lo and i talked about this and this is what the lo told me to do in this situation. please stop contradicting lo's directives." say this publicly in front of witnesses if possible. tell others what your lo has told you about what they want. the more this is widely known, the harder it will be for others to interfere in what you do.12. accept that the time will come when you can't do it all yourself. this isn't failure. it takes 2 people to bathe or change an incontinent adult just due to their size. 13. early on in the journey, think about what level of care your lo would need before you would feel comfortable putting them into assisted living/ memory care. then back that level up 3 months - that's when you need to start looking for a place to move them to, because if you wait until an emergency, you may have to take what is available, not what is the best possible place. and waiting until an emergency placement could mean waiting until something awful has happened. 14. most memory care facilities do a quarterly care conference to review how your lo is doing. at that conference, you want to ask many of the questions you asked when you were looking at which place to move them to - what level of care do they offer? what is their staffing and how has it changed in the last quarter? do they have any concerns about your lo that might lead to them evicting your lo? do they think your lo is far enough along that you should engage hospice? 15. be aware that you might have to move your lo from one assisted living facility to another. we all hope that will be the place they can live until they die, but facilities close. they have staffing problems. your lo could develop a physical issue that needs more care. sometimes you have to move. 16. hospice hospice hospice. use hospice. hospice will provide medical equipment that you don't have to pay for (wheelchairs, special beds, lifters, shower chairs, so many useful things!). hospice will provide extra aides to tend your lo. hospice is a separate set of eyes on how your lo is doing and how your lo is being treated, which is especially useful when your lo is in an assisted living center and you can't be with them 24x7. ask hospice to give you an update on what they see and think 1xweek.17. know the names of your lo's aides and caretakers. the more you know them as people, the more likely they are to treat your lo well. and if something bad happens, you will be able to tell the police who said or did what. thank them for their care of your lo. people who are appreciated treat lo's better.18. keep records. keep a few notes about who said what and when after every visit or conference. if something bad happens, those notes will be critical evidence for the police, or critical medical records for doctors in tracing the progression of the disease. 19. label everything you take into the assisted living center, but be aware that things move around and everything - clothes, knickknacks, jewelry, pillows, etc - may disappear from your lo's room and appear somewhere else. likewise things may appear in your lo's room from elsewhere. don't take anything valuable. don't take anything you can't bear to lose.20. when you have to pack clothes for your lo, keep in mind clothes that are easy to put on/take off. drawstring pants are better than button pants, because your lo may lose weight and drawstring pants can be adjusted to still be worn. my lo's aides preferred button-up shirts over pull-overs because it was easier to get them on my lo. my lo couldn't have enough shoes, because she would kick them off as she walked about her assisted living place and it could take a while to find them again. slip-on loafers and slippers were better than tie-on tennis shoes.21. after surgery, be aware that it can take a week or two for all anesthetic to leave the body of the elderly. you may think that your lo has taken a drastic step down when you see them in the hospital the day after a hip fracture. it's possible they might have. it's also possible they might still be under the lingering traces of anesthesia and they'll bounce back in a week. it's really hard to know their condition at first. being able to tell the hospital care takers that "they remembered my name on tuesday and fed themselves dinner, then watched tv and laughed appropriately before walking to their room, all before breaking their hip on wednesday" will help the hospital know how to grade your lo's condition post surgery. it also helps people like occupational/speech/physical therapy know how to interact and motivate your lo.22. have in mind a best case and a worst case for your lo, and be able to say it. for example, after my mom broke her hip, i was able to say that my best case was for mom to return to her nursing home, scoot herself around in her wheelchair and be able to take part in activities, while my worst case was that she have an easy, painless death. that helped the doctors know what to work towards for my mom, and also helped them know what to tell me as to whether my hopes/fears were possible. 23. as your lo's condition deteriorates, they will have trouble walking. there will be falls. this is not a sign that the nursing home isn't treating them well. it's a sign that they are deteriorating. on the other hand, the nursing home should be able to tell you how they are monitoring and supporting your lo. if they can't, be concerned. ask more questions. visit randomly. ask the aides what they think. sometimes management will tell you a better case than the reality. sometimes aides will tell you nothing is wrong because they won't want increased work. you have to balance out what everyone tells you with what your eyes see and with what common sense and knowledge of the disease tells you.24. pre-arrange the funeral. no matter how prepared you are, your lo's death is going to be difficult. the fewer decisions you have to make, the easier it will be on you. and you are less likely to miss things if you make decisions when it is not a traumatic time. this includes packing a "funeral bag" which includes the clothes your lo should wear in the casket. 25. consider if you want any personal items to put in the casket - i promised my mom decades ago that she would have a new mystery novel and a chocolate bar in her casket. hospice will be able to tell you if they think your lo is declining ("declining" is hospice-speak for moving into the pre-dying phase) which gives you time to acquire and do any final tasks you need before the bad things happen. i went out and bought a book and a couple of chocolate bars, and added them to her funeral bag. it was all there when she died, i didn't have to think of a thing, and i knew here wishes were being carried out.26. read up on the pre-dying phase and the active dying phase. hospice and the assisted living center can't predict what will happen to your lo or the timeline, but the more you know, the more you will understand their euphemisms like "declining" and be able to ask the right questions about timelines and symptoms.27. if you think your lo is in the pre-dying phase, think about what music they might like to hear. they say hearing is the last sense to go. download a couple of albums to your phone of the music they might like so you can play it for them on your visits.28. when your lo gets the the later parts of stage 6 or early stage 7 (fast scale), start hoarding vacation and sick leave. you will need it at the end. 29. be aware that the fast scale is not like a road. people don't move linearly from 6c to 6d. my mom could talk right up until she went into pre-dying phase, even though she was incontinent and couldn't walk. you have to consider your lo's overall condition to figure out how far along they are in their dementia journey.30. ask for help. your friends want to bring you dinner when you are exhausted. your cousin wants to pick up a new pair of slippers for your lo because they lost them. your doctor wants to give you anti-depressants when you need them. your assisted living center wants you to come to the support meetings to help you along the way. accepting help isn't failing, and it isn't weakness. it's being a general mustering an army to help fight the disease that is hurting your lo.31. forgive yourself. you will have doubts along the way - am i doing the right thing? you will agonize over mistakes - i missed x sign, i made the wrong decision about y. you will feel guilty when you miss a visit or are so tired that you snap at your lo. forgive yourself. there is no way to be a perfect caretaker because there is too much going on, and the disease is just too complex. this is a cruel and vicious disease. do the best you can. act with love in your lo's best interest. meet them where they are at in their disease progression, remember the person they used to be, and grieve when you need to. things will happen. forgive yourself.32. when the journey is over, rest. it's ok to be relieved, even happy that it is done. let yourself heal. let yourself grieve. let yourself not feel grief, because you grieved for months and months while your lo was losing themselves. go do something to regain the life you put aside to care for your lo. they would want you to be happy and to live again. 33. good luck to you, and to your los. dementia sucks. but we caretakers are the best of humanity. what else is love other than taking care of someone who needs it? be well,peppermintgoddess

This is new to me and I am scared for my Dad
my father (69m) was paralyzed last year due to a cortisone shot gone very wrong. he has been tested mentally for alzheimer's. the doctor said he doesn't have it but he can not confirm or deny dementia. i moved 400 miles to his town to help care for him every day. my stepmom(sm) and i are trying to regiment his days and certain days are certain events (in wednesdays he reads to my niece and nephew via zoom. sundays football etc) we try to keep a schedule noon get him hoyered into his chair for lunch. etc. today he is lashing out angrily. i come over every day at 9am. i was 5 minutes late and he called my stepmom at work screaming no one is taking care of him. no one has changed his brief in two days. (bull. i did to yesterday morning, checked him before i left at 5pm and sm did it before bed and this am when she got up. he yelled at me his fork was dirty (i used a clean fork to cut up his pancakes and kept it there.) he yelled at me for not moving fast enough. i felt 13 years old again. in my head i know it isn't me he is mad at, but i can't help thinking i did something wrong) there are days he gets mixed up. he comes up with stories that never happened. we will have the same conversation multiple times a day. he takes phone calls from drs etc and doesn't tell anyone. he forgets who he is talking to or sometimes talks to people not there (like his brother who has passed on) i don't know what to do. how to help. speech therapy is only 1x a week and that is currently on hold due to c-diff.ty for letting me vent.

Need urgent perspective on a dog situation.
hello everyone. i previously posted about my grandfather [here]( things have progressed and i'd very much appreciate some insight. my mother is poa and sort of the unofficial caregiver, but does not live with him.first of all, shortly after that post, one of the dogs was put down. we are unsure exactly what happened, but she was throwing up and apparently miserable. i believe papa was talking about "putting her down" like, "in the backyard" if you catch my drift. this was alarming. my mom convinced him to try a medication the vet had suggested. the short version of this story is that the dogs looked very similar and the wrong dog was getting the medication and therefore the sick dog did not improve and therefore got euthanized by the vet. to say i'm horrified about this is an understatement. the remaining dog (11 year old yellow lab) is overweight, arthritic, currently has a double ear infection, and recently sprained an elbow. supposedly she fell off the bed. she is 110% not getting medicated for arthritis, nor is she getting the care she needs for her ears, because papa does not remember to do this. he loves the dog. but also apparently is starting to forget he has a dog. i guess he asked my mom last night "where did this dog come from?". but also still thinks he has two dogs sometimes. his gp and neurologist seem to think it's good for him to have the dog. do they know about the state of the dog? i do not know.papa is moving in to an assisted living facility this month. my mom is trying to work in conversations about the dog coming to stay with me/my husband while he moves in and then hopefully he'll just forget about her. my mom is convinced this isn't going to work and papa will get belligerent. i guess she's brought it up a couple times before and it hasn't gone over well...the general idea of the dog coming to live with me. quite frankly i don't give a shit if he likes it or not. this dog is suffering and needs to be taken care of and no one is taking care of her. papa is already forgetting her and how many dogs he does/does not have. i know the doctors think the dog is good for him, but it's not good for her.what can/should i do? from what i understand about papa's condition, he's going to be angry about it but probably not remember it the next day anyway. do we take the dog and all the dog stuff out of the apartment at the same time and then poof! she's gone from his mind?

My Grandmother Has Dementia, But My Grandfather Is Harder To Deal With
both my grandparents are 89.  they are in good shape physically, in terms of people of that age.  they still live on their own.  i go over daily to offer some help with things, but they're pretty independent.  my grandmother is early/mid stages of dementia.  it's hard to tell reading these different symptoms, and different resources seem to have different views on what's early and mid stage.  just a quick rundown on my grandmother, since this post is mainly about my grandfather.  90% of the time she is aware of who she is, who everyone else is, and where she is.  her long term memory is excellent, no issues with it.  her short term memory depends on the day.  sometimes she might ask the same question five times in a 30 minutes visit.  other days, she's on the ball and has minor or no issues.  her "middle term" memory is the worst.  she has trouble putting together memories from recent weeks to recent years.  there's a lot of confusion, and a lot of false memories.  sometimes people can get her to remember things, other times she is adamant of her view, and gets annoyed if the issue(s) are pressed.  a very recent thing this past year, is she sometimes gets confused over the season.  last spring, she sometimes thought it was fall.  this fall, she sometimes thinks it's spring.  interestingly enough, she knew it was summer the entire summer, and never got confused.  she does have some worse issues when sundowning, and *occasionally* in the first few minutes of waking up.  for instance, in both times of day, she's sometimes forgotten who my grandfather is.  she believes he's her father (but remembers my grandfather exists and asks about him, to him).  and on a few occasions wants to know in the mornings "if the kids have left for school."but those issues have only occurred in the past year, and according to my grandfather, maybe once a month at most.  now, on my grandfather.  he is an intelligent, kind, loving, man.  really the best kind of person, someone i strive to be like.  but he's still 89.  he's still "old school", and doesn't really know how to deal with this.  because she got confused a handful of mornings about who he was, he now interrogates her every morning as soon as she wakes up.  i've seen it.  he gets up about an hour before her, and when she comes out of the bedroom he goes right up to her and starts asking 20 questions.  "debbie, who am i?  do know my name?  do you know your name?  what year is it?  how old are we?"she immediately gets flustered and confused and starts stuttering.  every time i've witnessed that though, she manages to say yes she knows everything, but then gets mad.  most of the time if i'm there that early, i'll push past him and meet her in the hallway.  and guess what?  i smile and say, "hello nana!", and she knows my name and who i am right away.  then she seems my grandfather and says, "good morning, dan".  she then moves right into her morning routine with no issues.  my grandfather's other huge problem, is arguing with her when she's wrong, especially in situations that make no difference.  she might say to me, "oh, we saw your cousin at the mall today."  and my grandfather has to chime in with, "no we didn't, it was at the grocery store.  we went to the mall yesterday!"he also has this thing with no "lying" to her.  my grandmother's sister died six months ago.  once or twice a month, she'll ask, "did something happen to my sister?"  if it's asked to me i'll tell her no, she's down in florida, i'm sure she'll call soon.  then i redirect her to a new topic.  my grandfather though will answer, "yeah, she's dead!  don't you remember?  we went to the funeral at 'abc' cemetery, they had the wake 'xyz' funeral home.  she had a stroke.  do you remember?"and of course then she's upset for the rest of the day.  the worst part is nobody in the family, myself included, likes spending time *alone* with my grandfather anymore.  we all still love him, but prefer my grandmother is around.  i use to love alone time with my grandfather.  we share so many interests, he has amazing stories, good advice, etc.  but all he does now is complain about my grandmother, and insists on telling us every mistake she makes.  even if it's a mistake she's made every week for the past three years.  if i go to visit, and he catches me alone while she's in the shower, or she's outside and we're indoors, he just uses every single second to complain.  i know everyone needs to vent (honestly, i think that's more what i'm doing now than actually asking advice), but it's nonstop with him.  "do you know she took the bedsheets off to wash them when she only put them on three days ago!......do you know she put the pork chops in the fridge, when we bought them to eat next week and were meant to be frozen!....do you know i planned we planned to have spaghetti for dinner, but when i came home from a haircut she was making soup!.....do you know she took the curtains down to iron while i was in the shower!it's nonstop complaining, about things i and the rest of the family know she does, and have heard about a thousand times.  and you can't redirect my grandfather.  if there's a pause in the conversation, i try to bring up another topic, something he normally would be interested in, and he blows it off to keep complaining.  we've tried sitting him down as a family to talk about this, we've tried explaining that while none of us are experts, we've researched dementia and understand it better than him.....he just blows it all off.  i know he lives with her 24/7, it's his wife, it's tough for him, but he can't comprehend that his actions are making things more difficult for him.  and what also stresses me out, is i just want to be able to have conversations with my grandfather like we use to, that he's still capable of, in the limited time i have left with him.  the last thing i want to do is blow up on him and hurt his feelings, but lately after hearing the same rants/complaints for the 500th time (especially when he's refusing my advice), i get close to losing it.  i want to scream at him to shut the fuck up.  we're all trying to help my him and my grandmother live their happiest final years, but he makes everything so much more difficult and won't listen to advice or reason.  **now that i've written all this....i just realize that i had to get it out.  this is a long post, and i don't expect anyone to read it all.  if you have advice, i appreciate it.  but honestly i feel better just getting it all out.**

It took me TWO YEARS of taking my dad to multiple doctors to get his UTIs treated! Don’t give up
ageism exists. i can’t count the number of times i was told “it’s not a uti” despite high leukocyte esterase and at least one other sign (eg nitrates, white blood cells, a few other things ) at any time. know that this is a judgment call for a doctor. they can have a positive sign, but decide that unless a b or c is present, they’re not calling it a uti. or they’ll say the person is “colonized”. or that it could be anything (with le this is true, it’s not specific). if antibiotics were used in the recent past, they may not be able to get a culture so it’s an open question. or they’ll say “it’s probably the dementia” (i heard this several times. by internal medicine specialists as well!). sometimes they know it is a uti and just don’t treat because it’s fashionable to do this now. (some article came out advocating for not treating.)i knew there was a uti, based on the frequent urination and the fact that cognition would sometimes temporarily improve after an antibiotic. he never complained of symptoms. but he was retaining urine thanks to bph and probably some nerve damage after a catheter. as well, he was forgetting to pee. which led to an accumulation of bacteria. this cycle of temporary improvements with antibiotics  went on for two years… through two urologists and countless other doctors in and out of hospital (not all for utis). in that time, my dad’s cognition and communication were pretty limited. well…  finally, one of the urologists agreed to put him on weekly prophylactic antibiotics. to humour me, because i asked about it. it seemed to help, but not totally - half the week he’d be ok, half not. so i went back and the doctor agreed to give this to him twice a week (it’s a sachet you usually just give once). well -  now i’ve got my dad back, apart from some memory issues. i cannot believe this. his speech is fluid, and his repertoire has expanded a hundredfold. for years the man had only a handful of phrases… i’m not saying this will work for every person with dementia who has a uti. he doesn’t have alzheimers, he has small vessel disease and ftd. but even so, if you really feel certain it’s a uti, don’t let bias get in the way… get your loved one help! i can’t believe for two years, my dad suffered. if i had listened to the doctors, they’d have all agreed he was far gone and he’d probably be in a home or dead (from neglect at an ontarian home) right now.

Concerns about my grandma
hi all! first post here. i take care of my grandma on the daily along with my siblings. she has respiratory issues, wears oxygen 24/7, and has to sleep with a bipap. we do everything for her.recently, she has been acting different. she asked my sister if i was the cook, the daughter of the owner. (i cook almost every meal so i guess that's why she labeled me as the cook) when i was with her she said my mike (my brother) was a nice man, but who was he? and i said he is my brother. and she seemed so genuinely surprised. i feel like she thinks she is in some kind of facility or something because of how she acts. so rewind, about a month ago she was saying incoherent things so we thought her oxygen was low and it was after we checked. the doc gave her this med for a week that picks her back up. (this happens about every year) but i feel like ever since that med she forgot who we were. she didn't go back to being grumpy ol grandma. she usually isn't nice. but now she is nicer and asks the same questions over and over.we know something is happening with her so we are all just trying to be patient with her. we answer all her questions even if it's a million times. but i feel like she is missing pieces or something. i guess it gets me frustrated because i know she is old... like i accepted that she is getting older but i don't want her to forget us. i guess that's what hurts. idk if this is the beginning stages or something. i am making assumptions here so i don't really know. another side note, she likes touching all her food. she doesn't use a spoon or fork anymore. is this normal? i try giving her things that don't require a spoon or fork because last time i did she said she didn't want it. tl;dr - grandma isn't the same as before. not sure what it is. does not recognize us sometimes.. asks lots of questions. touches all her food.

Am I over thinking about GMIL showing signs of dementia?
my so lives with his grandmother(77f) who is often alone when so is gone for work. i admit i do not like her and you can see my previous posts about my issues. that's why i want an outside opinion in case i'm using my dislike for her to look for signs of dementia.poor impulse control/poor judgement. she suddenly wanted to get a large dog after decades of yorkie sized dogs. her reason apparently is for protection in her home. she hasn't been attacked and her neighborhood is one of the safest in the city, but she knows that so wants a big dog. she heard about labradoodles and became obsessed and pushed so to get her a puppy. the puppy is now 5 months old and she is complaining about troubles controlling him on walks. she wanted to buy her granddaughter a car for a while now but hasn't done any searching with her until suddenly she was told of a "wicked deal" on a used car at a dealership an hour away. grandmother doesn't tell her daughter or granddaughter about this plan until the woman shows up and wakes the girl up and takes her to buy this car she heard about. girl doesn't have her full license and just got laid off. the old woman bought a $20,000 sedan for a young girl to learn on without talking to the girl's mother or other family. you don't get a fancy car for a first time driver due to higher odds of them hitting something and to keep insurance costs down. the starting cost for insurance for new drivers is sitting at $2000, a newer, pricier vehicle will likely be $3000+. so warned her that this purchase will wipe out a large amount of their bank account. not to mention maintenance, gas, insurance costs that grandma has to provide since the girl doesn't have a job. overall, her ability to gauge consequences seems compromised.worsening language skills. she is having a harder time remembering english words and is preferring her native french. her accent is becoming more noticeable too. she is constantly mixing up my so for his uncle and me for the uncle's wife. several times today alone she called me by the wife's name and her grandson by his uncle's name. we have to constantly ask for clarification when she is talking to us. she will start random topics from nowhere, "she said...." "who are you talking about we were talking about the dog." "oh the lady across the road was talking about..." repeated questions. she asked us three times how the dog reacted to us coming over since she was out when we came. we responded each time and she acknowledged us responding each time. i pointed out that she has asked the same question three times. she instantly got defensive and argued that she didn't hear us the last two times.her driving is really poor. i noticed that her parking is odd. she will have like 3-4 feet between her front bumper and the curb. she makes very insecure and jerky turns, she sometimes leaves the turning lane she is in.poorer memory. she forgets where she puts things constantly. she asked me how ripe my melons were from the garden. she helped me grow butternut squash all summer which seemed odd to mix up. despite multiple trips to my apartment, she still isn't sure where to turn. i'd like to think that her behavior is typical for early dementia, but now i'm second guessing myself since i also detest being around her. so and his mother have admitted she is showing mental decline but refuse to speak with the grandmother about what they are seeing for fear of making her angry.

Mom sent video of Grandma that Grandpa took the other day. My heart hurts.
two years ago was the last time i saw my grandma and while she was definitely aging, it wasn’t much other than a few more wrinkles and the occasional need of a walker. she still looked like my “gma”. 2020 was hard for my grandma and i think the isolation didn’t help her depression. i call my grandparents often and i started talking to my grandma less and less because she’d be too tired or not in a good mood; etc. may 2021 grandma is going through back surgery because there’s an issue with something in her spine. she still was herself though for the most part. definitely some changes but still my gma. last time i spoke to my gma was maybe a month ago. she called me, which she never does. by this point after her surgery things had begun to rapidly get worse. grandma was confused and unlike herself. she started talking about some unpleasant things from her past, confusing my grandpa with her dad. anyway, she called to tell me she didn’t know how much longer she had. i don’t know what she was referring to as far as memory or… you know. i’m sorry. i’m trying to be as honest as possible here and i’m still really processing this. it doesn’t help that my grandparents live over 1,000 miles away. i’m getting all of my information either via my grandpa or my mom essentially, and sometimes the information conflicts. my grandpa has been under so much stress the last few months. anyway, a week ago grandma was placed in memory care. my grandpa made the choice, and the facility seems lovely. he sent a video of my grandma the other day when he was visiting and he’s just holding her hand while she’s laying in bed crying out. it’s just a video of her starring at the ceiling and moaning and yelling. it’s so sad. my grandma is unrecognizable. she’s frail, she’s small, her hair is so grey. i’ve never seen her without brown hair. why is she crying? is she okay? grandpa said the doctors are going to put her on medicine, but i haven’t gotten anyone to tell me the name of the medicine yet. i just think mom and grandpa have forgotten. grandpa says it should help her. i hope it works.

MIL - early dementia?
i am trying to figure out how to get started with getting my 69 yr old mil assessed for dementia. she lives alone in another state. we had hoped she would move to our city, where my sil and her husband also live, after she retired in 2019, but the pandemic got in the way. i think she’s been on a slow decline for awhile, but she’s always been forgetful and wildly disorganized (i’d put her on the low-end of the hoarding spectrum, as she’s also a compulsive shopper and i haven’t seen her house anywhere near clean in 12 years, and that was only after my husband i and and siblings naively spent 4 days hauling junk and cleaning the house for her, believing she could keep it that way if we helped. it is 10x worse now than it ever was then). she’s also never been able to follow directions in the car and gets lost constantly, even to places she’s been numerous times. so our baseline is a spacey, borderline hoarder who can’t follow directions. it has made it challenging to determine what behaviors are new and concerning and what is just my mil being herself. right before the pandemic, we became very concerned following a car accident that caused post concussion syndrome and seemed to make the forgetfulness much worse. it turns out, she’d had a couple concussions when she was much younger that none of her children knew about. but she told us that a neurologist didn’t think anything else was going on and that she seemed fine. she’s been evasive about everything since, and of course covid came along and appointments got canceled and we didn’t see her for a long time. fast forward to this weekend. she came to visit and she smelled bad. really bad. and didn’t seem to notice or care. she repeatedly forgot things we’d already told her. and she asked my sil to help set up her new computer but then accused her of somehow remotely controlling all her devices. all of this makes me think it is time to get some sort of assessment for memory loss. i don’t know how to get started, especially because mil has been evasive and resistant in the past. but i’m really worried about her living all by herself in that atrocious house and all the ways that memory loss could make living in that house even more dangerous than it already is with piles and piles of stuff everywhere. would love some advice on where to go from here.

i just don't know anymore...
my mother suffered a stroke in front of me 3 years ago.  during that time they noticed preexisting vascular damage.  apparently, she was continually misdiagnosed by her primary physician when she complained about her memory and by the time she had a small stroke the damage was already excessive hence vascular dementia.  she has degraded over the last 3 years and now i really don't know anymore what's right.  when doctors or people speak to her they don't see her the way i do.  she no longer knows how i fit into her life but she knows my name and knows she's familiar and comfortable with me.  it is so damn weird.  i see brief glimpses of her coming through so much that she actually forgets to forget and treats me like the son she used to know.  she almost mistakenly remembers; that's the only way i can describe it.  it breaks my heart on one hand and on other hand she hasn't changed her way of making me feel like crap when she wants to; she can be really mean.instrument adl is totally out the window.  she can't handle numbers or anything.  so, she's beginning to fail at adl like feeding herself or bathing but on the other hand she got dressed today and left for 2 hours to go the store a few blocks away.  she is typically terrified to leave the block she lives on; in nyc.  this was a triumph for her almost like telling me to piss off in a way.  i know she is not as bad as many people in this situation but on the other hand if no one is around she just decays into filth and starvation.  i came to live with her for 5 weeks and now 2 weeks in she is stronger and more aware and feels more like she doesn't need help.  once i leave and we have limited aid she will surely suffer.  i am her healthcare proxy and have poa but i can't believe i need to stick her in some place.  when i speak to nursing or assisted living homes they ask what her state of mind is like and they immediately want her in a memory ward which is basically prison.  i get it, no one wants liability, but my mom is not that bad.  there is just no middle ground.  either medicare assesses her and tell us she only needs someone 4 hours a day which is nowhere near enough or they want to lock her away 24/7.  i read alot of posts here and i know there are folks in heck of alot worse situations but i just don't know what the heck to do anymore.  anyway, i feel you all in your posts and i wish everyone a better day if you are having a bad one because sometimes when my mom has a good day it's such a great feeling.  today was not a good day for us.

Need a better set of options than "waiting for disaster"
dad is 84. we got a formal diagnosis of alzheimer's back in april. his wife was moved into an adult foster home in february following a fractured hip from a fall. she also has dementia as a result of hydrocephalus; she has had short-term memory loss for quite a while, and her husband was the primary caregiver. since moving her out, she has actually improved in terms of weight, energy level, and general attitude. since she moved out, my father's symptoms seem to have accelerated. (or maybe i'm just not in denial anymore? i can't tell) presently, my brother and i visit 3/week, including cooking once a week, (and making leftovers for the rest of the week) and taking my father to visit my mother at the group home. i have tried several times to broach the topic of moving out of the family home (which he is living at alone) into facility similar to the one his wife is in. again, **she** is doing great: more interaction and stimulation is good, the staff forcing her to exercise every day is good, regular meals... she's *thriving* (in the medical and non-medical senses) and my dad sees this. but my dad is absolutely adamant that he does not **ever** want to move out of the house. he does not want to move in with his wife, and he will not even *discuss* what kind of a facility would be acceptable to him. whenever i have tried to broach the subject, his answer is "i haven't fallen down or set the place on fire!" and arguing that we shouldn't have to wait for something awful to happen isn't an effective argument. his dementia is progressing; he has serious difficulties with language (speaking and writing), he has very little encoding of short-term memory, and he's starting to lose basic living skills.(toilets aren't being flushed, leftover food isn't being stored safely, frozen foods are kept in the fridge, etc.) legally, there aren't a lot of options to *force* him into memory care. i suspect that such a move would be a very hard transition for him, and i'd rather not traumatize him any more than absolutely necessary; if the loss of his autonomy by being forced into a home would be hard, having it happen because his sons had him declared legally incompetent would be even more so. i'm reaching a personal breaking point here. right now, it feels like my only options are to play the heavy (get him declared incompetent, take over the bank accounts, move him into memory care) or provide what little supports he'll allow (cooking "sunday dinner", driving him to visit his wife 2/week, making sure he doesn't buy an extended warranty for his car, etc.) and just waiting for something awful to happen. help me find a third choice, something that keeps him in the house for longer, and lets me think about this situation in terms of other than "well, guess i'll just wait for something bad".

What’s the next step?
i posted a couple months back about my mom because one of the hoarding subreddits directed me here because it seemed to them my mom possibly also had some dementia mixed in with all her hoarding issues. i was calling aps on her for her living conditions. i ended up deleting all my reddit posts about it out of an excess of caution after i made the call because i did it anonymously.by law the state had to investigate within seven days after i called. the seventh day they came and left a business card on the door. they have done absolutely nothing since then. i’m not even sure they even tried to contact them when they left the card.after a couple months i am now convinced she has dementia.what is my next step? my mom is living in a hoarded house with most of the exits blocked. i tried calling the fire marshall but they don’t deal with residences. the house has been flooded by a leak in the upstairs bathroom multiple times so i’m sure it has mold. they opened a window upstairs tears ago and it is still open (with no screen). there are mice. there is a hole in the  dining room ceiling (that’s where the water leaked). there is a literal pile of shit in one corner of the house. she’s basically living in squalor.the refrigerator doesn’t work but she keeps food in it anyway. i have caught her digging food out of my trash to take home to take home to her non working fridge. she has conversations with my daughter where she basically repeats the same short exchange three or four times. she can’t remember my birthday and other things she could know. she forgets how to drive places.i have power of attorney but she voluntarily signed it over. she refuses to move because it’s her dream house and “it’s not that bad”. she seems to have no concept that mice are not ok, that living without a fridge or air conditioning is not normal. i have taken over her finances but only to make sure bills are getting paid. otherwise she just spends what she wants, whether she has it or not, and then goes and withdraws more out of her ira. her housing situation isn’t really sustainable monetarily either.when it was hoarding and a choice she was making (however bad it was) it was different, but now i think she has dementia, i am not sure i should be leaving her to it. i don’t know what my next step should be since aps seems to be unwilling to do anything. any advice? thank you so much!

Father in law making sexual advances on our daughter (Grandpa towards granddaughter) Family is split about what to do. Advice, help, welcome.
i don't really know where to begin. this is my first time posting in this subreddit, although i've read through many of these stories. in a matter of four months my father-in-law (77) has gone from mild memory issues to moderate to severe alzheimer's. his doctor is giving him a maximum of nine months to live. we're doing everything to make him comfortable and even improve his memory/slow the progression with medication and daily brain training.he's at the point where he cannot be left alone; he has nearly started fires, wandered from the house multiple times, and it's at the point where he doesn't always know who we are or what day or year it is. he cannot be relied on to take care of his daily hygiene or medication, and he's very resentful that he's not allowed to drive or be left alone. i know he resents being watched and driven around all the time, but he's honestly a danger to himself and others.this has all happened very fast and we're all trying to adjust. he lives with us, as does a young lady who we adopted. we also have an infant at home. i've felt very protective over them, especially since he's getting more and more unpredictable. i hate feeling afraid in our own home. we installed cameras all throughout the house after the second time he wandered off, we also removed his hunting guns and weapons, and he doesn't have access to car or house keys. i have a fear that one day he will forget who we were and try to hurt us. as is common with dementia sufferers, they have a tendency to mentally revert back to their younger selves, and he was a very violent man towards his family back in the day.out of the blue one night, he confessed his love for our 17-year-old adopted daughter. he acted really tormented about it and kept saying that he realized he was too old for her, but that he really wanted to take care of her and he was struggling with hiding his feelings for her. we were all shocked and i kept repeating that "that's not going to happen because you are her grandpa and she's your granddaughter." we thought he might have forgotten it by the next day, and didnt bring it up to him. we didn't want him to feel embarrassed. we know he's lonely, his wife of 50 years (mil) passed away years ago.lately the comments and stories have ramped up and escalated. he fully believes that they've had an affair, been in love, and he got upset one day when he thought she was seeing somebody else. he's touched her a few times in what he thinks is a playful way, but is still inappropriate. she now avoids giving him hugs goodbye, avoids eye contact, and dresses in really baggy clothes so that he won't stare at her body. we don't allow them to be home alone together anymore, but due to a miscommunication the other day they were home alone together for about 5 minutes before we arrived home. in that time, he confesssed his love for her again and said, "i know what they're trying to do, keeping us apart. why won't you just let me take care of you?" while coming closer and closer to her. she just kept walking into other rooms and dismissing his comments. thankfully she's very smart and kind, and understands that it's the disease making him behave this way, but she's incredibly uncomfortable. it's getting to the point where i'm afraid for her safety and can't trust him not to try act on his feelings. they both sleep in a different part of the house from us, and he's up and shuffling around at all odd hours of the night. she's nowhere near strong enough to fight him off if he ever tried to overpower her, so i recently installed a keyed lock on her door. here's where i could use some advice; half of the family doesn't believe that he's saying these things and are resistant to him ever going into a home. they think she's making up these stories even though they've heard him confess his love for her with their own ears, because "he would never do that." i remind them that we have cameras all over our home now, and they're welcome to see some of the footage if they don't believe us. we are the ones who take care of him and have seen the escalation of symptoms and unpredictability. we don't currently have any health aids coming to the home, but we know we're not far off. i'm not unsympathetic, but i think i checked out emotionally months ago because he's not the same man i've known for over a decade anymore, and i've entered into some kind of mama bear protective mode. with two children at home, i cannot keep allowing or tolerating unsafe and dangerous behavior. i refuse to let any harm come to them because of this disease. at what point is this behavior enough to warrant placing him somewhere else? thank you all for reading thus far. i'm sorry for how long this has become. i would appreciate any advice or tips on our next steps. tldr: fil confessing his love for our young daughter, increasing and escalating his advances. when is the danger enough to warrant placing him in a home?

i don't really know where to begin. this is my first time posting in this subreddit, although i've read through many of these stories. in a matter of four months my father-in-law (77) has gone from mild memory issues to moderate to severe alzheimer's. his doctor is giving him a maximum of nine months to live. we're doing everything to make him comfortable and even improve his memory/slow the progression with medication and daily brain training.he's at the point where he cannot be left alone; he has nearly started fires, wandered from the house multiple times, and it's at the point where he doesn't always know who we are or what day or year it is. he cannot be relied on to take care of his daily hygiene or medication, and he's very resentful that he's not allowed to drive or be left alone. i know he resents being watched and driven around all the time, but he's honestly a danger to himself and others.this has all happened very fast and we're all trying to adjust. he lives with us, as does a young lady who we adopted. we also have an infant at home. i've felt very protective over them, especially since he's getting more and more unpredictable. i hate feeling afraid in our own home. we installed cameras all throughout the house after the second time he wandered off, we also removed his hunting guns and weapons, and he doesn't have access to car or house keys. i have a fear that one day he will forget who we were and try to hurt us. as is common with dementia sufferers, they have a tendency to mentally revert back to their younger selves, and he was a very violent man towards his family back in the day.out of the blue one night, he confessed his love for our 17-year-old adopted daughter. he acted really tormented about it and kept saying that he realized he was too old for her, but that he really wanted to take care of her and he was struggling with hiding his feelings for her. we were all shocked and i kept repeating that "that's not going to happen because you are her grandpa and she's your granddaughter." we thought he might have forgotten it by the next day, and didnt bring it up to him. we didn't want him to feel embarrassed. we know he's lonely, his wife of 50 years (mil) passed away years ago.lately the comments and stories have ramped up and escalated. he fully believes that they've had an affair, been in love, and he got upset one day when he thought she was seeing somebody else. he's touched her a few times in what he thinks is a playful way, but is still inappropriate. she now avoids giving him hugs goodbye, avoids eye contact, and dresses in really baggy clothes so that he won't stare at her body. we don't allow them to be home alone together anymore, but due to a miscommunication the other day they were home alone together for about 5 minutes before we arrived home. in that time, he confesssed his love for her again and said, "i know what they're trying to do, keeping us apart. why won't you just let me take care of you?" while coming closer and closer to her. she just kept walking into other rooms and dismissing his comments. thankfully she's very smart and kind, and understands that it's the disease making him behave this way, but she's incredibly uncomfortable. it's getting to the point where i'm afraid for her safety and can't trust him not to try act on his feelings. they both sleep in a different part of the house from us, and he's up and shuffling around at all odd hours of the night. she's nowhere near strong enough to fight him off if he ever tried to overpower her, so i recently installed a keyed lock on her door. here's where i could use some advice; half of the family doesn't believe that he's saying these things and are resistant to him ever going into a home. they think she's making up these stories even though they've heard him confess his love for her with their own ears, because "he would never do that." i remind them that we have cameras all over our home now, and they're welcome to see some of the footage if they don't believe us. we are the ones who take care of him and have seen the escalation of symptoms and unpredictability. we don't currently have any health aids coming to the home, but we know we're not far off. i'm not unsympathetic, but i think i checked out emotionally months ago because he's not the same man i've known for over a decade anymore, and i've entered into some kind of mama bear protective mode. with two children at home, i cannot keep allowing or tolerating unsafe and dangerous behavior. i refuse to let any harm come to them because of this disease. at what point is this behavior enough to warrant placing him somewhere else? thank you all for reading thus far. i'm sorry for how long this has become. i would appreciate any advice or tips on our next steps. tldr: fil confessing his love for our young daughter, increasing and escalating his advances. when is the danger enough to warrant placing him in a home?

Demanding ER visit, but hopeful for assisted living tour tomorrow
bless my uncle, who's taking care of my granddad through this and i'm just his sounding board but... everyday, my grandfather (who we're pretty sure has dementia) finds a new ailment. used to, he'd write it down and complain to his doctor and get mad when there wasn't a magic pill to fix his myriad of issues.however, now, daily, he demands to go to the er. i'm in the us, we all know covid cases are spiking, he doesn't care.reasons he's been to the er in the *last month*:1. headache2. stomach ache3. feeling tired4. feeling anxious5. not knowing what time it is6. having to use the bathroom too muchmy uncle tells him he doesn't need to go but he'll yell and curse until he's taken. (then they get there and tell him 'if you don't have covid, you need to leave.' he refuses, makes my uncle sit there for a few hours just to hear 'sir there's nothing wrong with you, please go home, there's a pandemic.')if my uncle doesn't take him, he calls me and demands i take him or he "will die" and it will be my fault. it's becoming a real "boy who cried wolf" scenario. i dealt with this with my dad's parents (which... he didn't care for, i had to, so my patience is already so thin. i missed months of every college semester to take them to the doctor, er visits, etc). (this is also my mom's dad, but my mom passed when i was a kid so my uncle is the point of contact.)today, he called me and told me that my uncle was ignoring him and he was going to die. he said "it hurts when i take my pills, i need to go to the emergency room immediately." i should mention he refuses to drink water. says he has to go to the bathroom too much. he's 93. he's in a retirement home (not assisted living... yet) so his bathroom is about 10 feet away at any time. he also refuses depends but has a full-blown panic attack if he has to go to the bathroom and there is anything in his way.unrelated to the medical issues, 1. he told my uncle he owed me $2000 immediately and had to go to the bank as soon as they opened tomorrow.  (he owed me just over $100 and paid me yesterday.) 2. he says there's not food in his kitchen and we're letting him starve (the home provides meals and his kitchen is packed with microwave meals, his favorite snacks, all different drinks, etc.). 3. he forgets which medicine is which so we're not sure what he's taking. 4. he says he never gets to leave but thanks to the suggestion of a user here, i took him on a tour of the entire city that lasted 2 hours yesterday and i pointed out everything to him and he told me stories of the old days.he's touring an assisted living place tomorrow. wish us all luck. he seems to think it's a college dorm where "you and your uncle can't bother me!" but there, they'll take care of his medicine and lots of other things that he needs day-to-day that we can't anymore.if it was up to me, he'd see a therapist asap. but every time i get involved with anything like this, it becomes my responsibility and i didn't sleep from age 16-19 to take care of my other pair of grandparents. i just really really really hope assisted living works out. he needs it so bad.thanks for reading my rant. i'm sure it won't be the last. i really appreciate this community, i feel so much less alone and find so much help.

Unintentional animal neglect
my great grandma has dementia. she had a dog that she would forget to take care of. the dog was malnourished and had an untreated anal abscess that ruptured. the poor dog was in an incredible amount of pain and was very sick. she was kept in a cage 24/7, she was not let out to potty regularly and never got any love. my great grandma would just forget to take care of her. i was able to convince my great grandma to give her dog to me. however now she is threatening to call the cops on me for “stealing” her dog and wants the dog back. i have had her for a couple of months now, and have taken her to the vet regularly for treatment. the dog’s anal glad infection was so bad that she had to be on antibiotics and pain meds for over a month. i don’t think she ever had a bath or her nails clipped and had dreads i had to cut out of her fur. she also had ticks. if i didn’t take her she would have died. i spent hundreds of dollars to bring her back to health and i’ve also spent a lot of time working with her extreme anxiety. she has special needs due to begin neglected for so long. …so i’m not really inclined to give my great grandma a dog she is just going to unintentionally neglect. it’s a hard situation because my great grandma does not even recognize her owndaughter sometimes and is at a point where she needs assisted living or a caregiver. she is being incredibly difficult and resists moving. there’s also a lot of family drama behind that ..and her bum son who makes matters worse. all those problems are beyond me. there’s alot going on with her and my family just wants me to give her back the dog because they don’t want to deal with the drama. i need some ideas on how to proceed with this situation. i love my great grandma and i am just trying to do the right thing..

My mom is fading, advice appreciated
in march,i moved my mom to memory care from a semi-assisted living facility that was not equipped to handle memory issues.  she had lost weight in the past year- 15 pounds, was not eating much, not remembering to put a face mask on when going out, could not remember how to turn on her heat, adjust her tv or balance her checkbook.   she did so poorly on memory tests that five minutes after the test was given, she could not remember she had even had a memory test.the transition to memory care was very rough.  she was always a private person who was not very social.  she raged at the confinement, raged at the other residents (she was in a building with those with the least afflicted by memory loss, a lovely group),refused to participate in activities ("they are full of fucking old people!!!" she said), refused to eat.   they tried medications for mood and depression but she continued to avoid people, refuse to eat much despite a lot of caring attention from the staff, lost more weight (now down to 96 from 116 in march), kept packing all her stuff every night.  she had no idea where she was.the facility made the decision to move her to the main building for closer care.  it's also the building where they have music, exercise classes, concerts, gardening and the resident flock of chickens, pet rabbits and cats.she's having none of it.  she stays in her room all day.  won't come out.   nothing works.  the staff is worried and asked me if there's anything that could work.  i bring treats and craft ideas, a robotic pet cat- but it's as if my mother has decided it's time to die, her life is over.  occasionally she rages and throws her clothes all over the floor.   she's not the easiest person but i am absolutely heartbroken over her decline.  i can't imagine how awful this is for her.   nothing brings joy except pictures of her only great grandson but she's confused and thinks the baby is my baby and is sad when i visit and he's not with me.   my daughter is driving a long distance with the baby this weekend to make a special trip to bring my mom some happiness and the facility is allowing this despite the covid lockdown because they know how much she is struggling.my question- has anyone here had a loved one who just completely shut down?  what helped?  i appreciate any and all advice.

What are the steps to getting a reluctant family member into assisted living?
my dad literally doesn't stand ever unless i'm picking him up for doctor's appointments. he's been peeing in diapers for about 3 months and has been pooping in them for about a month.there has been some odd behaviors such as putting his poop under his pillow on one occasion and numerous times of wiping his butt with his socks but he generally cannot care for himself and sits in his feces for extended periods of time. one time overnight ruining his futon which we came to find doesn't have a removable cover or removable mattress... every single time he poops it gets in his pants somehow which leads me to believe he's sitting in it. numerous times my mom will walk in and find him soaked through his diaper completely with urine. his socks are always 100% filled with pee when she washes them from the pee running down his legs. on top of all this he hasn't bathed or washed himself in 4 months.my mom can't take it anymore. the house smells awful 24/7. it goes through the a/c. she has to bring him his food in bed otherwise he won't eat. he's lost so much weight we just need him to eat. she can't stand entering his room anymore. the urine burns your nose and eyes and the feces makes it even worse. a home care aide has been suggested in the past but i don't think that would help enough.on top of it all. and i'm ashamed to say this. my sister lives in that house with her 1 year old. i can't believe he's growing up in that environment.he's still very much there mentally. his memory loss is very minimal at this point. like he'll go all day without watching tv because he will forget it was fixed yesterday but he gets only maybe 25% of the slam dunk questions wrong when the doctors quiz him. like maybe he will forget the president and think we are in 199something but if you had a conversation with him you'd think he didn't have any issues.i haven't brought up assisted living to him yet. i plan to do it at his doctor appointment in front of a healthcare professional. (yay or nay?) i highly doubt he would fancy the idea but i think that is where we are headed. how does a family "force" someone to go when they don't want to? does it sound like he would be able to be "forced" based on what i've outlined here?any help would be much appreciated. thank you!

Need some advice on what to do with my father
my dad who has been suffering with dementia for the past 10 years, has been manageable until his hip surgery 4 months ago.  his memory has gotten worse and he has been more irritable lately.   i moved in to help take care of him and my mom who has her own health issues.    both him and my mom are not vaccinated and choose not get the vaccine, they never go into crowds and wear a mask at all times.  about three days ago, they return home after their walk in the park and i notice both of them coughing and complaining about dry throats.  i had covid in early 2020, so i was aware of  the signs, they started having chills and body aches the next day.  this morning i wake up and start my meetings, at around 11am i go to check on my dad and i find him laying on the bed with his legs dangling off the bed in a weird position.  i ask him what he's doing, he doesnt reply.  i stand next to him and ask him again, and he's just staring at me with a blank look.  i ask him if he's had breakfast and if he wants to get up, he says yes, i tell him to get up and he cant move.  so i help him up and he complains about his back and leg that had the surgery.   the whole time he looks like he's not there, i help him out to the living room and sit him down.  i ask him about breakfast, no reply, i ask him what he wants and no reply.  i make him breakfast and tea, he just sits there so i have to remind him to eat, he eats very little and just zones off.  the whole day has been odd with him, his dementia has never been this bad, he has a daily routine, makes his breakfast, shaves, listens to music, sits in the balcony and calls family members on the phone, forgets he called anybody and calls again all day.  today, he seemed totally lost, almost like he was catatonic.  he has no appetite to eat, no desire to watch his shows or engage with anybody, i called my brother and sister and he just said hi and put the phone way.   his hands are visibly shaking when he picks up a piece of bread or glass, complains he has chills.it could be they have covid and his brain is under stress and he doesnt know how to process it.  i have drive-thru tests scheduled for both my parents this week and i'm hoping the tests come out negative.  i'm at a lost as to what can make someone go from 50-&gt;100 in two days.  is this a known issue with covid and dementia patients or is it normal for someone with dementia to get so bad so fast.  his primary doctor is useless and doesnt know or care to treat him properly, i'm beyond confused and would appreciate any advice on what my next steps should be.

Am I a bad person for wishing my family member with dementia would just die already?
this family member (trying my hardest to stay discrete, sorry) became unwell with dementia and is no longer able to be trusted alone without proper supervision.  she started to forget faces, names, and major life events such as death of close family members.  she had extreme forgetfulness and repetition, and not even recognizing her own home that she's lived in practically forever.  she would forget that she's cooking and nearly burn the house down.  she would either take too much of her pills or discard of them.my family decided it was time to move her in with us and take care of her so she can spend the rest of her life with the people who love her most.  well, in short, it has been a literal nightmare.  my family is stressed, depressed, very unhappy, miserable, etc.  nothing is enjoyable.  everyday is like groundhog day.  she is verbally, emotionally, physically abusive to us and our disabled relative.  earlier on we had to call the police on her multiple times for being abusive and they said there was nothing they can do about it because of her age and condition.  after 3 or 4 cslls of desperation we just gave up.  our mental health has declined severely.  one of us is suicidal, and the other has become a train wreck of an alcoholic.  we all stay locked in our bedrooms because otherwise we are being screamed at from morning to night.  no exaggeration, understand this.  this is no "sundown dementia".  she wakes up ready to fight and finally exhausts herself in the late night and she will sleep through the night now that we switched her medicine.  this is a big beautiful home, she gets cooked meals every night, she has her own bedroom with a huge television of her own, she gets the living area to herself because its impossible to spend time with her.  we can't ignore her because she's banging at our door repeating the same thing over and over and calling us out of our names.  this is like an abusive relationship i can't leave.  sending her away is just not an option right now financially.  my brain understands that she's sick and she doesn't understand what she's doing and she's confused and paranoid.   but my heart is broken and sad.  the abuse i've had to endure has made me really resent her.  sometimes the sound of her voice makes me cringe and lose my appetite.  if she brushes past me and we touch it makes me feel dirty and violated.  i dont want to feel like this.  but when i look at her i see evil.  she feels foreign and i feel like im in prison, forced to live with someone i dont know.  i feel like things would be better if she had already passed away.  she is lonely, she is tired, she is miserable.  why does she have to keep going through this?  dementia really tortures people.  ruins lives.  and i hate that i wish this would all just disappear.  i really regret choosing to take this responsibility.  tl:dr my family member has dementia, i'm the caretaker, this decision has ruined my life, i wish she'd die already, i feel absolutely horrible for thinking that.  am i a bad person?

Is it possible I have early onset dementia?
first off my situation:i'm a male. i'm a high functioning autistic person between age of 30-35. i live with my parents, unemployed but trying to make money in my own way. i've tried the normal way, but it simply doesn't work for me between the workplace harassment and other problems. to the point where if i ever have to go to a normal job, i will off myself (this isn't the problem i'm trying to fix. this is simply caused by a life of horrible events, and again i have to do it my way since the normal way doesn't work for me).luckily i live with my parents who do seem to care at this time, but i do worry a lot what happens if they stop caring or what will happen after they are gone. but because i live with my parents i also have to deal with my drunk sister and her kids at this time. this does add a ton of stress on me and i'm sure it has made things far worse and made new problems. but some of these problems were around when i was 15.i did try to talk to a general doctor about some of this, but my mom who was in the room passed it off as stress and the doctor quickly agreed. sitting down with a mental doctor the first thing they asked without me saying a word prior is "what drugs do you want". so they aren't any help at all (in fact, i found they are more for the kick backs they get from drug companies)what is happening:* my memory is getting far far far worse over time. like if my mom ask me to get x item from the fridge in the garage. by the time i'm halfway there i forget what she wanted. sometimes it's so bad that if a person says something like "can you get me some tea? oh, and did you" and that quick i forgot they asked me for tea. like i know they asked me for something, but i 100% forgot what they asked of me. once this happened, i asked what they wanted, i went in the next room and forgot, and this happened 2 or 3 times.   * it should be noted at times my memory is really good. like to the point i can remember what was said when i was 3, what the room smelled like, and everything else. but these moments are happening less and less. like there is events i'm having a hard time or impossible time recalling anymore.   * it should be noted i have 4 degrees, and some of the info i was quickly able to recall, i'm not able to recall at all. like at all at all.* my spelling is getting worse. like i never been that good at it, but i have noticed a major decline in quality even when i'm trying as hard as i can. for something like this i have to review a good 4 or 5 times. when trying to write a paragraph for something i'm selling on etsy i have to spend a solid 1 to 2 hours on it.* i noticed i'm stressed out far more easily.   * note: i think this is directly caused by my sister. my sister came back into my life before the lockdowns and before she came along i was starting to be at peace with my life. because she most likely is a real sociopath and she drinks heavily. we had 3 dogs that died in the time she was here, and she was a nightmare each time. it was so bad that we had to deal with her being drunk while literally one of the dogs was bleeding out of their nose. (1 dog died to cancer in the throat, another died to liver problems, and another died due to malpractice which is being investigated. the one with the cancer the vet did bloodwork and said she showed signs of being extremely stress, and in a roundabout way she said the stress was a major killer. (my sister's kids is below 6 years old (i think 3 and 5), and they are complete brats when she is around. jumping until stuff gets knocked off the walls, yelling, running, stripping, and so on. my sister does nothing to stop any of this. my sister is the type of person who had her kids pee outside (even with one of them being a girl) because she will have to go out of her way.) it should be noted the dogs died in the same year.* i noticed i get worried about this far easier.   * idk if this is caused by my sister and her kids. i think part of it is, but i've always had this problem.* my memory problems can be dangerous at times. like when i was a passenger in the car when picking up my sister's kid from school one day. i seen the stop light that was red. i kept wondering to myself what it meant, what was it, why did all these cars in front of us had red lights, and why the person that was driving was slowing down. it wasn't until maybe 3 hours later i remembered what all that was and what it meant. this isn't the first time something like that has happened in such a place. and if i was the one driving, i wouldn't of slowed down. prior times this happened i was driving but by myself (i think this happened 2 times). i kept wondering why everyone was so slow, and i forgot what a speed limit was. like at the point i was going 100+ mph before i slowed down since i knew something was wrong. i'm just lucky it didn't get someone killed or a cop come after me.* on most days i have a solid 2 hours where my head is clear enough to do anything. like some days is more and some days is slightly less. there is no way to know how much time i have or how much brain power i have before the mental fog sits in. like some days i can go all day with no problem. but most after a few hours mentally i'm no good.there is a few other things, but i'm pretty sure if someone knows what i'm going through they might be able to point out what it might be. at least point me in the right direction.note it is possible i might of had a stroke at some point (if not a few). but i have no way to test this i think. one of the other things i was thinking of is maybe early dementia. but idkthe only reason why i'm seriously iffy on that is i remember when i was 15 the alarm beeping and i sat there trying to figure out what an alarm clock is, why is it beeping, what does the numbers mean on it, and so on. like this is the first major event that i can think that that seems to relate to my memory problems.note i have had blood test and get them yearly for general base line checks. there doesn't seem to be anything here that is too far out of normal if at all.i never had my brain scanned, and i don't think i have the money for that.

first off my situation:i'm a male. i'm a high functioning autistic person between age of 30-35. i live with my parents, unemployed but trying to make money in my own way. i've tried the normal way, but it simply doesn't work for me between the workplace harassment and other problems. to the point where if i ever have to go to a normal job, i will off myself (this isn't the problem i'm trying to fix. this is simply caused by a life of horrible events, and again i have to do it my way since the normal way doesn't work for me).luckily i live with my parents who do seem to care at this time, but i do worry a lot what happens if they stop caring or what will happen after they are gone. but because i live with my parents i also have to deal with my drunk sister and her kids at this time. this does add a ton of stress on me and i'm sure it has made things far worse and made new problems. but some of these problems were around when i was 15.i did try to talk to a general doctor about some of this, but my mom who was in the room passed it off as stress and the doctor quickly agreed. sitting down with a mental doctor the first thing they asked without me saying a word prior is "what drugs do you want". so they aren't any help at all (in fact, i found they are more for the kick backs they get from drug companies)what is happening:* my memory is getting far far far worse over time. like if my mom ask me to get x item from the fridge in the garage. by the time i'm halfway there i forget what she wanted. sometimes it's so bad that if a person says something like "can you get me some tea? oh, and did you" and that quick i forgot they asked me for tea. like i know they asked me for something, but i 100% forgot what they asked of me. once this happened, i asked what they wanted, i went in the next room and forgot, and this happened 2 or 3 times.   * it should be noted at times my memory is really good. like to the point i can remember what was said when i was 3, what the room smelled like, and everything else. but these moments are happening less and less. like there is events i'm having a hard time or impossible time recalling anymore.   * it should be noted i have 4 degrees, and some of the info i was quickly able to recall, i'm not able to recall at all. like at all at all.* my spelling is getting worse. like i never been that good at it, but i have noticed a major decline in quality even when i'm trying as hard as i can. for something like this i have to review a good 4 or 5 times. when trying to write a paragraph for something i'm selling on etsy i have to spend a solid 1 to 2 hours on it.* i noticed i'm stressed out far more easily.   * note: i think this is directly caused by my sister. my sister came back into my life before the lockdowns and before she came along i was starting to be at peace with my life. because she most likely is a real sociopath and she drinks heavily. we had 3 dogs that died in the time she was here, and she was a nightmare each time. it was so bad that we had to deal with her being drunk while literally one of the dogs was bleeding out of their nose. (1 dog died to cancer in the throat, another died to liver problems, and another died due to malpractice which is being investigated. the one with the cancer the vet did bloodwork and said she showed signs of being extremely stress, and in a roundabout way she said the stress was a major killer. (my sister's kids is below 6 years old (i think 3 and 5), and they are complete brats when she is around. jumping until stuff gets knocked off the walls, yelling, running, stripping, and so on. my sister does nothing to stop any of this. my sister is the type of person who had her kids pee outside (even with one of them being a girl) because she will have to go out of her way.) it should be noted the dogs died in the same year.* i noticed i get worried about this far easier.   * idk if this is caused by my sister and her kids. i think part of it is, but i've always had this problem.* my memory problems can be dangerous at times. like when i was a passenger in the car when picking up my sister's kid from school one day. i seen the stop light that was red. i kept wondering to myself what it meant, what was it, why did all these cars in front of us had red lights, and why the person that was driving was slowing down. it wasn't until maybe 3 hours later i remembered what all that was and what it meant. this isn't the first time something like that has happened in such a place. and if i was the one driving, i wouldn't of slowed down. prior times this happened i was driving but by myself (i think this happened 2 times). i kept wondering why everyone was so slow, and i forgot what a speed limit was. like at the point i was going 100+ mph before i slowed down since i knew something was wrong. i'm just lucky it didn't get someone killed or a cop come after me.* on most days i have a solid 2 hours where my head is clear enough to do anything. like some days is more and some days is slightly less. there is no way to know how much time i have or how much brain power i have before the mental fog sits in. like some days i can go all day with no problem. but most after a few hours mentally i'm no good.there is a few other things, but i'm pretty sure if someone knows what i'm going through they might be able to point out what it might be. at least point me in the right direction.note it is possible i might of had a stroke at some point (if not a few). but i have no way to test this i think. one of the other things i was thinking of is maybe early dementia. but idkthe only reason why i'm seriously iffy on that is i remember when i was 15 the alarm beeping and i sat there trying to figure out what an alarm clock is, why is it beeping, what does the numbers mean on it, and so on. like this is the first major event that i can think that that seems to relate to my memory problems.note i have had blood test and get them yearly for general base line checks. there doesn't seem to be anything here that is too far out of normal if at all.i never had my brain scanned, and i don't think i have the money for that.

My Step-Dad Passed Away Suddenly and I'm now my Mom's Guardian
my mom went missing in 2019 and we all knew something wasn't right before she went missing. long story short - she showed up somewhere and we called an ambulance that took her to a hospital. there, they diagnosed her with dementia and moved her to a behavioral hospital. she's been in a nursing home ever since. my stepdad had to move her after a year at the first one because it wasn't secure enough and she needed memory care. he would go visit her at least twice a week and they had a very solid routine. on july 10th, he was in an accident and passed away. i live a few hours away and traveled there as soon as i heard. i had to break the news to my mom and i had to go to the elder lawyer very quickly to take over as her guardian. she took the news hard but after about an hour, she forgot and we got her to eat lunch. the next day, it hit her suddenly, she remembered she lost him but with some redirection we were able to keep her calm. it must come and go though because she's ripping up photo albums. being a couple hours away is very difficult but she's doing so very well in the place she is currently in and they really care about her. i don't know if i have a question here or if i just needed to get it out. the dementia isn't new to me but being her sole guardian is because before it always felt like my step-dad and i could talk it out. we could figure out together the best decisions for her and now it feels heavier. at this point, when she says he's going to come visit, we just agree and move on. it seems cruel to make her re-live losing him over and over. i did take her to his funeral and she understood where she was but was quickly confused when people came to give their condolences. she saw his coworkers and said, oh we must find him so he can say hi. do any of you live far away from your parent/grandparent who is living in a nursing/memory care home? and to all of you, how do you deal with the guilt of it all? like if you can't be there as often as you like and the worry if someone is mistreating them? i'm still grieving the loss of my step-dad plus trying to figure out what to do for my mom. he handled all of her doctor appointments and everything. it's just so much.tl:dr - my stepdad died, i'm the sole person remaining to care for my mom and i feel so overwhelmed.

I Am At A Loss
so, i have been really thinking about things going on with my grandma. recently she got into a car crash, nothing serious and she is fine. she got stuck on a curb when she took her kitty to the pet store. she ran over the curb, got the whole car over it, and then called us (she was alone and i was with my mom) to come help her pay for her cat. never mind the fact that she had just gotten stuck alone and could have hurt someone. when we got there she said she didn't know what happened. she then told us she forgot everything at home. she forgot her purse, which had her wallet, which means she had no license on her person when she drove. she knows she could call on us when she needs help taking the cat to the pet store, but she has been avoiding asking us for help more and more. ignoring our advice and anything we say goes in one ear and out the other. she always pushes back. anything my uncle wants from her, he gets. she is worrying me because already she has shown that she cannot drive, she should not be alone, and she is incapable of making choices for herself. all things my uncle allows her to do! we tried telling him that she could seriously injure someone or herself or worse! on top of all that, my uncle brings home ladies to her house. they live together. the ladies are mostly single moms who don't want to leave their children at home, so they go with their mothers. the mothers leave their children with my demented grandma to take care of and my uncle is okay with this!! she is responsible for anything that goes wrong while the children are under her care. she has sat on an autistic little boy while he screamed and threw a tantrum because the mother left to go on a date with my uncle. she said soon after she didn't sit on him and completely forgot what she did to "calm him down". the kid was two. he was non verbal. the mom left the kid there on multiple occasions, even over night and let my grandma watch him while they were out all night. why not get a babysitter?? i am super worried by all that can go wrong because she isn't able to keep track of her own stuff, what about kids???i am 8 months pregnant right now on top of that and my concerns extend to my own baby. i don't want to say she cannot be around my baby, but she cannot be trusted alone. my mom says she might be okay for 30 minutes, but i say not at all because of what happened with that little boy. i want to 1. get her checked by a doctor. 2. get the license taken. 3. make sure my uncle stops taking advantage of her! 4. make sure she is safe. i have been arguing with my mom about taking her to a psychologist, the hospital, taking her to get a driver's test. all she argues is that my grandma won't go. there's a lot she is gonna protest and she is gonna fight us on, but she needs care. i want to get that to her as fast as we can get it. we have to force her to go get checked out. we have to stop my uncle's girlfriends from using her as free childcare!! i am super exhausted just feeling like the only one who actually wants to make sure she is gonna be okay and not okay with "just letting her do what she wants". it's dangerous! they (they being my mom and her boyfriend) want her to get into another accident so that she will have it on record and then get her license revoked. why potentially get someone or herself killed? get her lost? she could end up in another state and has had moments where she wanted to run away. she talks about it all the time and i really don't like her having access to keys where she can just run away.

Death is a gift to the dying.
grandma has passed and i am glad for it. i feel free in a way i never have in my life. i feel i can finally move on with my life, do things guilt free. for so long, everything was a compromise. every single extended weekend, every holiday or vacation, i had to weigh my options. would i see her? would i not? if i did not see her, i would have to see her soon to make up for it. i sacrificed so many years to her, and now it’s over. i wish could say i feel bad, that i am mourning her death. my husband says that i have been mourning her, for a long time. this is true. i truly lost my grandma a long time ago. my grandma was never the soft and fluffy sort, but she was mine and we loved each other. my mother (her daughter) died when i was young. we used to say that we had a special relationship, closer than other grandma’s and grandchildren. we used to tell each other that the other was our favorite person. she truly was my best friend at one time. her stubbornness and paranoia caused her to turn away from medical help. i don’t know when she first got her dementia diagnosis. she always kept her medical history private. my honest guess is that she was demented for at least the last 15 years, perhaps even 20. the last 10 years sucked, the last 5 were terrible. this last and final year was nothing short of fucking hell. i’ll never forget the look in her eyes as she lay in her bed of urine and told me that she was going to kill me. what was my offense? i hadn’t properly warned her of a nurses visit and the nurse wanted to change her. she liked to be warned so that she could showtime. the truth is that i had warned her, multiple times, she just forgot. i know that my feelings will change. that i am going through big changes in my life. later today, or tomorrow i might find myself crying in the shower remembering things, feeling the loss. i don’t feel that way now though. and i think that’s ok. i am really happy her suffering is over. she was in constant pain from her tumor. she was confused and afraid all the time. i have read the sentiment over and over in this sub of “i will not go out like that”. and i have to say, i am no different. i have thought about my end of life a lot at this point (like many of us here). i don’t know how i will die, but i will not go out like my grandma. covered in my own piss or shit, threatening my loved ones. getting poa for her was so difficult. she used to be an attorney. i only managed to get poa 4 months ago, and even then she hired an attorney and threatened to sue me. the only reason the suit didn’t happen was because i asked the attorney to get her signature in person in order to release private information. this stopped the suit. she knew that anyone who saw her with her tumor, in her state wouldn’t take her case. covid helped her deceive people. her final days were spent in a board and care facility. putting her there was hands down the most difficult thing i have ever done. i will always be haunted by the primal screams and cries as the paramedics took her. it was harrowing. it was also the right decision. she didn’t get to die in her home like she wanted. but she was clean, medicated and cared for. she didn’t die in pain. i am glad it’s over. i feel good. i am sorry that i do. i just feel so happy to finally be free.

She's aware and it hurts - This day took over and I'm in a fog
she's never been my best friend; she's never been close to us; she's had her ups and downs, but through it all, we know, she always loves us.over the course of 60 days, my mom has spiraled into a state that is hard to describe, but continues to be discussed across this sub and others.  after having a violent outburst some weeks ago, my mom was committed to a mental institution to work on improving her behavior.the facility she was in (a hospital) touted their ability to reduce behavioral issue associated with dementia patients.well, long story short, they did nothing but cause more anxiety on both my mom and my family.  days after returning to the nursing home, my mom hit another person and that made it strike three.  so all that anxiety we experienced with this mental hospital was a waste.the nice people at the nursing home found another place that would take my mom and she was transferred tuesday 7/27/21.today i visited to do the paperwork, setup payment from her checking and just talk to the staff.then came time to seeing my mom.upon seeing me she immediately burst into tears and cried the entire time, holding onto me as if her life depended on it.  she kept saying i love you and asking whats going on.  i could not hold back and i broke down to the extent the staff had to help me leave.seeing my mom; holding her listening to her cry's of help, i could not within me find a pocket to place my grief.  we hugged for probably 10 minutes with her crying and me as well.i returned after calming down to sit and talk with her.  it's not her; her eyes wonder; nothing she says makes sense;  she knows who i am, but almost like a mystical being (part son and part alien).i've been told many times, that this is where it starts.  that dreaded experience of watching them slowly deteriorate; forget all and eventually die.  no, i have no expectations of longevity of life, i believe that lifes happiness is who we settle to be.  but i see it in her eyes, she weary, tired, wanting the end to show up and perform its ritual.  she does not want to live like this.i pray that this misery can be over; so that she can finally rest her soul; that she will no longer wonder in these dreaded woods not knowing friend or foe.  i pray to god that mom meets him some day and that that day gives her the happiness she had desired her entire life.  my mom did not live happy and my attempts as her son to make that happen were redirected by a disease.dear god, i haven't followed, i've been absent on the sabbath, but i pray to you today to make the life of my mom more comfortable and without pain.  she's been a good servant; she did the best she could over these years with little to provide; she is a good woman.  i ask god that you spare my mom this vicious existence so that she may move on to allow her soul to rest.  i don't want to see my mom this way, but it may be your way of telling me that life is short and i should focus more on the things that matter vs the things i own.  god, oh lord, if it is your wish i totally understand, i only ask that her life in this capsule is without suffering so that her soul can be.hug your loved one!  although they maybe yelling to escape from the inside, who they were is not who we see.  show them your love and tell them so.  today i am in real pain, that which i've never had.  today, my soul shuttered, something i never felt.  today, i saw the path in her eyes and it hurt badly.  i hope today is not the last, but if it is, i want to say that i truly love her, she my mom!  god bless you all

I don’t know how to convince my mom to get tested.
first time poster here. i’m one of four children and we’re all adults. i’m in my 20s. my mom has always been our rock. when i was little i remember thinking of her as being strong and fearless; whatever goal she had she’d always accomplish it through hard work. now she’s 57, turning 58 this year, and she’s been exhibiting some behaviors for the last few months that have made me very concerned. to begin with, she’s become very forgetful. like, super forgetful. i’ll tell her something (a story, some instructions) only for her to ask me about it again (and again). here’s a recent moment that sticks out to me. when we first moved to our current apartment in april, i showed her how to adjust the thermostat (and how to put it on permanent hold). she picked it up and that was the end of that. however, a few weeks ago when i was in ny she randomly called me one night asking for help on fixing it. i was super confused and i even pointed out that i had previously taught her before, and the process was the same. needless to say that it took me about 30 minutes to reteach her the process through the video chat, something that she had previously picked up quickly the first time around.another behavior i’ve noticed is that she’ll sometimes change up what whatever she originally said to me. at first i thought that maybe i’m the one who kept mishearing things, but my sister has also pointed out in the past that she has a tendency of completely changing up her words… and therefore creates arguments where we’re pointing out what she originally said. at first i thought she was doing it on purpose to get out of things, but it looks like she actually believes her own story. my mom used to be a great driver. everyone would always tell her that. while of course your skills are bound to change as you get older, she has rapidly declined to the point where i feel very unsafe being a passenger in her car and would rather take an uber somewhere before asking her for a ride. not to mention that she seems increasingly paranoid about driving, and have seen her driving extremely slow in streets where you’re supposed to be going 60+ mph. i’ve tried to address this, but she attributes her now bad driving skills to having diabetes.while her memory has had me very concerned, it’s her ability to understand things that have made me realize she needs to be tested in order to be safe. it’s like trying to get a 10 year old to comprehend what you’re telling them without making them feel dumb. she’s also become exceedingly sensitive, and the smallest disagreement/argument makes her tear up/cry or get very upset. she didn’t used to be like this, at all. i’ve also gotten into big arguments because she’s become financially irresponsible. call me an asshole and selfish, but she fails to understand that she shouldn’t be giving money away to other, non-struggling, family members (including my two oldest siblings who are in their mid/late 30s, who work and have their own partners) when we are not financially stable ourselves. then she’s complaining about not having any money. i work, she doesn’t but she receives benefits. i’m literally the only one that provides for her and it frustrates me to no end when i’m working my ass off to make ends meet while she gives her money away a-la-mr. beast style. i don’t know how else to tell her that this is wrong and that people are only taking advantage of her.this morning she swore that she gave me a bag to put some things away, but the reality is that she never gave me any bag and the one she had she used for something else. i damn near lost it, and told her that she never gave me anything. it’s come to the point where i’ll even question myself sometimes, but i know for a fact that she didn’t give me any bag at all.i told my sister who is currently visiting to help me convince her to take a test just to make sure she’s okay, but like my other siblings she’s just as selfish who do nothing to care for my mom and minimized my concerns/made me seem like a bad person for even bringing the idea up. whether it’s a result of her taking diabetic medication that messes with her memory, like of vitamins, or something that’s more serious, i know something’s off and need her to get tested. for her sake, and for mine too. i apologize if this post is all over the place, but if anyone has any tips on how to convince her to get tested please let me know. i love my mom and i’m very worried about her. i want my old mom back.

Having a hard time with grandma :(
for the past year we suspect my grandma has dementia. hallucinations, confusion, etc. pretty much all the signs. the problem is, we cannot get her to the doctor's for an appointment. not only does her healthcare provider basically dismiss my mom and aunt when they attempt to get her help, my grandma probably wouldn't even get in the car to go to an appointment to get an actual diagnosis and perhaps get some kind of medication that might help. i really don't know what there is to do. i wish my mom and aunt would advocate for my grandma more, demand that she be seen, demand that they take them seriously. but they are both tired and just do the best they can to take care of my grandma.the thing is, her memory is sharp, she still knows lots of things. but what she is confused about is she thinks it's two months ahead than it actually is. her birthday is in september, and she thought that everyone forgot her birthday recently. stuff like that. it's really hard. she hallucinates that there is fish in her water, she thinks everything is poisoned, she thinks that there are people up in the attic who want to harm her. it's so hard to be around her when she is like this and i just don't know what to do anymore. i should also mention that she doesn't speak english very well; i do not speak an ounce of chinese so sometimes she goes off and starts yelling and i have no idea what she is saying and i can't help her. when she has an episode she can't speak english at all. another issue is we can't get her covid vaccination. she won't go in the car. i don't even think she would allow someone to come to the house to give it to her. i have tried asking her several times if she should get it for me, but she claims that her doctor told her that she doesn't need it. my boyfriend works with a lot of people in close quarters and i live with him, so i pretty much cannot help my aunt or mom as much with "babysitting" her but i would like to be able to give my mom and aunt a break, but i am so scared to get her sick, even though i'm vaccinated and wear a mask around her. i just wish there was a way i could get her to agree to get vaccinated; i would be able to help out more often and for longer periods of time if she were. &amp;#x200b;i know my situation may not be that different than many other people's and i realize that she may not be as bad off as some other people's loved ones here. i don't really know what i'm posting for. advice? words of encouragement? venting? maybe all of the above. &amp;#x200b;anyway, i've just been very sad and stressed out about all of this lately and it just weighs so heavily on my mind. i decided it was finally time to write some of my feelings out and hopefully talk to others who may be in the same boat. if you've read all of this, thank you for taking the time.

Can dementia come in 10 days?
they say my mom has dementia but it just doesn’t seem normal for what i know/knew of it. she started having issues finding her way to her house (that she lived for 40+ years) and would then spend 3-4 hours in a grocery store that would take her an hour before. she stopped wanting to cook or do things like send out christmas cards, or other habbits she had. she stopped wanting to be alone, so she would go along with my dad wherever he went.  there was definitely things going on. in 2019 at christmas time she seemed to enjoy it with little issues. her other son she never gets to see was visiting for the holidays. after he left, my mom went from functional to non-functional in the span of 10 days. as in, driving, dressing herself, acting relatively normal, to standing naked in the doorway arguing about how she was cold and needed to get dressed, but saying there wasn't enough time to get dressed, and getting stuck in a logical loop. this happened for about 3 hours the first few days when we didnt know what to do. seroquel is the magic drug that helped her get back to her new normal. it allowed her to function to be able to dress herself (for the most part) and join us in normal life again. but she doesn't act the same. she acts like a 5-6 year old. my dad has a job he can take her with him, so he does. when he doesn’t i take her with me. she can be by herself for 5-10 minutes tops, but she’ll forget she or gets too wired to stay still and starts wandering off to find where me or my dad are at. rather she’s at home, in the workshop, or in a car parked in a parking lot. she remembers about 4 people, and has forgotten other people she should know very well (did things together, etc.). at least once a week, she will ask my dad or me who we are (if one of us runs to the store and she hasn’t seen us for an hour or something). she will frequently ask whose house her’s is, or mine when she’s driving by. or where the bathroom is where she’s always gone. maybe she’ll ask how she ties her shoes, or how she gets a glass and fills it with water to drink. or how does she put her clothes on. she always wants help. but if you “force” her she can do it, albeit with a lot of questions along the way.the thing is, she seems to know most of the answers, but it’s like she’s anxious she’s going to do it wrong or she has the wrong answer she needs constant confirmation. if you drive for 3 minutes to the store, she’ll ask you 20 times where we’re going and what we’re doing, though if you press her she can tell you the answer. she needs constant verification for every action she takes in life. a neuropsychologist has given her two annual tests that are standard in their industry and said she has dementia and has demonstrated reduced mental abilities. her pcp chalked it up to dementia too, so that's what we call it. it's just so strange. she has a history of heavy depression. she's always felt lost her whole life and like she wasn't accomplishing anything. she's had few people she could make meaningful connections with, and the last people she did died off in the last few years. her father died when she was young and she's commented it on frequently throughout her life, so i believe it's really changed how she sees the world. it’s like she was having dementia-like symptoms, and then she just had a mental break. it’s like having a 5-6 year old you have to watch. she needs constant verification for everything, and its hard to determine how much she can do herself. she can’t be left alone. she doesn’t ask like herself or matronly anymore. i always thought dementia would be you acting normal, with memory, anxiety, increased symptoms until the end. that’s not how this has preceded. she’s just this new person now, with no real build up or change, it just happened one day. i don't know, i'm just looking for some guidance or answers if this stuff is normal, because it seems so odd.

they say my mom has dementia but it just doesn’t seem normal for what i know/knew of it. she started having issues finding her way to her house (that she lived for 40+ years) and would then spend 3-4 hours in a grocery store that would take her an hour before. she stopped wanting to cook or do things like send out christmas cards, or other habbits she had. she stopped wanting to be alone, so she would go along with my dad wherever he went.  there was definitely things going on. in 2019 at christmas time she seemed to enjoy it with little issues. her other son she never gets to see was visiting for the holidays. after he left, my mom went from functional to non-functional in the span of 10 days. as in, driving, dressing herself, acting relatively normal, to standing naked in the doorway arguing about how she was cold and needed to get dressed, but saying there wasn't enough time to get dressed, and getting stuck in a logical loop. this happened for about 3 hours the first few days when we didnt know what to do. seroquel is the magic drug that helped her get back to her new normal. it allowed her to function to be able to dress herself (for the most part) and join us in normal life again. but she doesn't act the same. she acts like a 5-6 year old. my dad has a job he can take her with him, so he does. when he doesn’t i take her with me. she can be by herself for 5-10 minutes tops, but she’ll forget she or gets too wired to stay still and starts wandering off to find where me or my dad are at. rather she’s at home, in the workshop, or in a car parked in a parking lot. she remembers about 4 people, and has forgotten other people she should know very well (did things together, etc.). at least once a week, she will ask my dad or me who we are (if one of us runs to the store and she hasn’t seen us for an hour or something). she will frequently ask whose house her’s is, or mine when she’s driving by. or where the bathroom is where she’s always gone. maybe she’ll ask how she ties her shoes, or how she gets a glass and fills it with water to drink. or how does she put her clothes on. she always wants help. but if you “force” her she can do it, albeit with a lot of questions along the way.the thing is, she seems to know most of the answers, but it’s like she’s anxious she’s going to do it wrong or she has the wrong answer she needs constant confirmation. if you drive for 3 minutes to the store, she’ll ask you 20 times where we’re going and what we’re doing, though if you press her she can tell you the answer. she needs constant verification for every action she takes in life. a neuropsychologist has given her two annual tests that are standard in their industry and said she has dementia and has demonstrated reduced mental abilities. her pcp chalked it up to dementia too, so that's what we call it. it's just so strange. she has a history of heavy depression. she's always felt lost her whole life and like she wasn't accomplishing anything. she's had few people she could make meaningful connections with, and the last people she did died off in the last few years. her father died when she was young and she's commented it on frequently throughout her life, so i believe it's really changed how she sees the world. it’s like she was having dementia-like symptoms, and then she just had a mental break. it’s like having a 5-6 year old you have to watch. she needs constant verification for everything, and its hard to determine how much she can do herself. she can’t be left alone. she doesn’t ask like herself or matronly anymore. i always thought dementia would be you acting normal, with memory, anxiety, increased symptoms until the end. that’s not how this has preceded. she’s just this new person now, with no real build up or change, it just happened one day. i don't know, i'm just looking for some guidance or answers if this stuff is normal, because it seems so odd.

It doesn't seem that bad, but it's grinding us down....what are we meant to do?
long story short, i've posted before, due to covid and a few other factors we're unable to get an official diagnosis on my father yet.  he had a sudden and severe illness christmas last year and we had to move him in with us.  6 months and counting so far, not able to let him go home yet (his house is a disaster).  i feel really guilty for getting so annoyed, but it's affecting my whole family.  as much as we're trying to just deal with it and go with the flow.......we just need a f\*cking break.  constant noises when eats, yelling out every night in his sleep (occasionally really inappropriate things too, awkward!), the fixation on trying fix something randomly that just makes no sense (eg. a bike that was being replaced because it was old, broken, and had been ridden to death, we told him it was wrecked, so he spent more than we originally bought it for trying to fix because he decided he could - spoiler alert no, and now we have unneeded spare parts and a bike at the tip).  he decides to wash dishes then we have to rewash most of them because he seems to just wave them at the soapy water and they're left with bits of food or oil all over them.  he lost his old mobile so got him a new one, set it all up - now he's constantly looking up anything he can think of, and usually getting angry about: it isn't working properly (him pressing something wrong), websites, notifications, ads, errors in articles from 15+ years ago, wikipedia.....  and we always need to hear about it.  he talks over every tv show if it's not his thing.  he won't leave the room, read a book, play on his phone or just shut up and let people watch.  he sings, or makes inane comments that he thinks are witty or clever or insightful, or asks why/what/how while talking over it anyway.  over and over again.  then asks what he missed while he was talking.  last night he ruined a football game my husband and son were super invested in, to the point they refused to come back to watch.  and even when told point blank why, and that he needs to stop, he thinks it's some sort of joke. then does it again.  if he likes whatever's on, he has no trouble being quiet and just watching, then waiting for a break or the end to comment, discuss etc.  and then what he says is usually interesting, or at least relevant.  which makes me question myself about whether there's actually anything wrong or if he's just an a\*\*hole.none of us want to be angry with him, and looking from the outside it's just an old man being a bit silly occasionally.  but from the inside it's like death from a thousand cuts.  he refuses to believe he's anything but 100% right 100% of the time.  what i've listed isn't even half the little things that happen daily.  and i'm coming to the realisation that he probably won't be able to go home at all.  if he does i suspect it won't last long, for a lot of reasons.  suffice to say while he's not getting worse at a rapid rate, he's not improving.  he's not constantly forgetful, he's not confused all the time, it's not obvious what's going on unless you're living it.  until he was living with us we really didn't understand he's not been looking after himself for a long time, he hid it well.  our house isn't big enough for 5 people - it wasn't big enough as it was but we were only planning on being here a few years before moving to the other side of the country.  that's now on hold indefinitely.  we used to have family game nights, board games, old school video games and activities (especially through last years lockdown) to try break things up a bit and connect with each other (difficult enough with kids!).  now we hardly ever do things together, nothing feels the same.  it's like we avoid doing things we enjoy because my father won't join in, but will judge/comment/interrupt.  if all the above was only happening occasionally, i think we'd be alright.  but it's every day, every night.how do you deal with it when you're suddenly tasked with looking after an ageing parent?  when my kids should be my focus but now i'm looking after another adult, and i get so frustrated that he's so often basically like a bratty toddler?  i know no one ever plans to be doing this, but usually there's a buildup to this sort of situation.  it wouldn't be so bad but there's genuinely no end in sight to this situation right now, if we'd been anticipating this, we could have done at least a few things differently.how do you all cope, get a break, help your own kids and family, live a semi normal life, while dealing with a parent or grandparent with dementia?  is there anything that just helps alleviate the crap side of it all?  we have no family that could help, literally just my brother and he's barely a functioning adult at the best of times.

Sudden Dementia, how do you deal with the disappointment?
tldr: mother in law was excited to retire soon but now suddenly dealing with fil with dementia.my father in law had a brain injury during a surgery in february and now has serious dementia symptoms. before surgery he was a bit forgetful but mostly capable of living independently (traveled on his own, drove a car, did the finances, etc.) after the surgery he's incontinent, can now talk but only says a few words and it's unclear if he really gets what they mean, and needs 24/7 care. my mother in law is the primary caregiver and she hires someone to watch him during the day while she's at work. she hates her job and was excited to retire this september. she's been talking for a few years now about being able to travel, sleep in late, watch her grandkids all the time and take them places. that's all out the window now, well not all of it but certainly the freedom to do whatever she likes whenever she likes. she doesn't sleep in anymore because he gets up at 6am and despite child proofing the house he can still cause a lot trouble left alone (he's already peed in the living room once :/) we have lots of supportive family in the area to give her time off to go do something for herself but it's never enough. and she seems almost depressed at the thought of her retirement. my father in law is physically healthy and my mil mentioned at one point that she can't imagine caring for him like this for years, let alone decades - the best part of her retirement. the worst part i think is they never really got along. they sleep in separate rooms and my fil has always been sort of a jerk. never mean to me directly but often had rude things to say about others including my mil. he's also much bigger than she is so it's tough to force him to do things. we have often talked strategies because he acts very similarly to my 2 year old, but my fall back is always to pick up the toddler if he's not listening and she doesn't have that option, she has a tough enough time just blocking him from going somewhere.how do you all handle it? when you didnt expect this to be your life. how do you find happiness? my heart is breaking for my mother in law. this can't be a sustainable way to live. but what are the alternatives? we are all already supporting her as best we can with the little things (child proofing, grocery shopping, watching him while she goes out, visiting with the kids) but it just doesn't seem like enough. i think a care facility or at least adult day care is needed but up to this point she's been very against it. both for feeling guilty about "putting him in a home" but also for financial reasons.

Husband's declining mental ability-- beginning dementia?
hello.  i am new to this forum.  i came here looking for someone who i can talk to about my husband's declining mental acuity.  he was an attorney 30 years and a novelist and was very good at analytical thought and words.  in fact, since retiring we have spent many hours in discussion on whatever topic came to mind.   it was nothing to talk a few hours and not realize 3+ hours had passed.  we could debate ideas and conversation was one of our strongest  and most enjoyable interactions.   in 2018 he had a mild stroke  from which he recovered very well.  he described the  mental difficulty  concentrating and reading, etc. he experienced as a "fog" from which he emerged within a year.  seemingly , almost totally back to normal.  he returned to his  writing and used playing the piano and word games during that time  to regroup.that was  probably jan 2020.  now, 2 1/2 years later, it seems he is slipping a little.  he forgets things i have told him, he  asks obvious questions, makes redundant comments, or obvious statements.  he can't find things in plain sight and is thrilled to discover them when i find them for him.  these are very small things, and just barely noticeable by me, but i have no one with whom to discuss them .  i don't want to talk to my children about my feelings because they will be upset and think less of him immediately and me probably -- or to anyone who knows him, so they are not categorizing him as having dementia long before it becomes apparent.  saving face for him. but i am the one who is struggling.  i expect these small annoyances will grow, and i have a sadness that our relationship has changed forever.  i once told him everything that was happening in my life, and he enjoyed hearing these things since he has always been a tremendous listener.  now, he interrupts me mid sentence with an unrelated idea, not even noticing i wasn't through and is aggravated when i ask him to let me finish my sentence or thought.  my first  reaction is to stop talking to him altogether, so we don't end in a fight or disagreement.  which seems to be happening more often.and of course, if i do that, (not entirely stopping talking) but i mean if i limit what i tell him or even avoid sharing information with him, i know there will be a distance.  so, i think i am grieving the loss. obviously i need a therapist or some kind of support group.  i am thinking of journaling some of these incidents.  advice?  recommendations?  personal experience with this kind of situation?  please.

Mom Can't Handle Dad with Dementia - Won't sign Power of Attorney-
hello. my dad (78) was recently diagnosed with severe dementia and alzheimer's. he has become very difficult for my mom to handle. my mother is 15 years younger than my father, but she has osteoporosis. she is extremely stressed out and feels her life is over since she has to care for him. she has been caring for people since she was a child. she wanted to finally do things just for herself. my parents have never gotten along so there is a lot of resentment. now she is losing her patience and temper. i went to try to help her go through things to declutter the house and watch dad last week, but here were many fights between my dad and her. the doctor had the dmv take my father's driver's license away and my mom hide his passport. however, he keeps demanding she give him his passport so he can go to ireland. he says he is going to go live in ireland and that he has family there still. his family there is pretty elderly and i looked it up and it didn't seem the uk helps dementia patients any better than the usa. it's still expensive. he is also furious she sold his car and remembers that it is gone. (it couldn't pass the smog and it cost too much to get fixed anyway.) he obviously can't remember why the car was removed even though he have explained many times. he keeps saying he will call the police. maybe he should if a male office comes he may listen...in addition, the mobile home they live in, is in his name. we tried to get him to sign the power of attorney and a paper that says that the house will go to mom when he passes, but he refused, says nothing is wrong with him. he won't write a will (he doesn't have much besides the house and some old tools) and he has never prepared for his own death in any way. he won't even add mom's name to the house.i don't really know what to do to help her. i doubt he would agree to go to a memory care home at the moment even though it would be probably better for the both of them... i'm not sure we could afford to pay for one at the moment. the only income my parents have is the small amount of social security my dad gets and mom can't lose the house. my sis and i could help pay for it, but from research they seem to be over $5000 a month in california. my half sister was telling me to get him into one, but i'm not sure if her family would contribute to the cost. i need to ask about that. i thought about asking my half brother to help to get dad to sign the paper work since he doesn't listen to women. but he would forget if he just called him so he would probably have to drive 4 hours to do anything. does anyone have any advice on what my mother can do? thank you.

Update on my Grandmother
so a month ago i posted about my grandmother's dementia and my feelings regarding it, that post can be seen here: [&amp;#x200b;i have a not-so-fun update that happened earlier this week. so as i mentioned my aunt is staying with my grandmother to keep an eye on her. what i don't think i properly explained in the last post is that my aunt staying with my grandmother is what's keeping my grandma's sister from putting her into a nursing home for people with dementia. my aunt didn't want my grandmother to hate her for putting her in a home, and she didn't want to separate my grandma from her dogs. plus for some reason we still don't understand, my grandmother is packing up items into bags, boxes, and suitcases, so we don't know what she thinks is going on. she's also on this new medication that's supposed to help with her memory, i don't remember the name of it but my aunt thinks it might be making my grandma grumpy. another thing i didn't bring up in my original post, my grandmother's house is falling apart. very badly as well. she has a serious rat and ant problem, her kitchen sink is constantly leaking, she's got spots in her kitchen where the floor is caving in, the central ac isn't as great as it used to be, and at one point a whole row of cabinets fell off the wall. the hording mess is an entire other issue as well. but we managed to at least clean her bedroom and master bathroom while her sister had her at her house. she still doesn't notice, which i don't know if that's good or bad.so on sunday night, we're driving down to my grandma's house to drop off my dog, who my aunt had agreed to watch while we went camping. when we got there, my aunt's boyfriend was outside, and in a very hushed voice, told my mom something and she all but ran inside. he came back and told us that my grandmother had put a bag under the sink, into the bucket my aunt kept to catch the leaking water. it was soaked with dirty water and milk that she poured down the drain. my aunt tried to move the bag and save whatever was in there, but my grandmother snapped at her. my grandma just started screaming something about "this is my house and i'm not going to be treating like this in my house"my aunt, very calmly tried to calm her down. "mama-" and that apparently set her off more because my grandmother just shouted, "i'm not your mama. i did not birth you, you are not mine."now this isn't the first time she's said something like this to one of us, she told my brother a week before this that she isn't his grandma. but my aunt's heart broke. she knows how dementia patients are, she's worked with them before, and she thought she could handle her own mother. but to have her mother scream in her face that she wasn't hers just broke her. she went to the bathroom sobbing, and that's what it was like when we got there. my aunt's boyfriend showed us the video to catch me and my brother up while my mom handled the situation.  she tried that on my mother too but my mom is a bit more used to yelling, and just smiled. she later told me she knew that pissed her off, but she managed to calm her down and my grandmother just forgot in the next minute. this has happened again while we were gone, and my grandmother even ended up hitting my aunt on the arm if i remember correctly. but the short end is this, my aunt doesn't know how much more of this she can take, and while she doesn't want to put grandma into a home, that might end up being the case soon. i don't know how much more my aunt can take...and i don't know how much more i can either.

Mom is very high-functioning, but also not? My story. Sort of dark but... what isn't, here?
my mom is in her early fifties. i don't know too much family history, but my mother's mother had a series of strokes over my entire childhood leading her to be progressively disabled. i lived in the same home with her for some years, during which time my grandfather was still working and so me and my siblings were her prime caregivers during the day at the young ages of 5-10. it was a nightmarish experience and she was verbally and physically abusive despite being extremely obese, nearly 500 pounds at the time of her death. it was definitely not the little media trope of forgetful sad little grandma. she was angry, paranoid, short-tempered, and absolutely unwilling to try to do anything for herself. i was the youngest sibling but only by two years. she knew my siblings got older, but she never seemed to ever recognize, on a very literal level, that i was older than 6 or so, so she would angrily yell at me for doing things like turning on a microwave or tell me i was incapable of dusting the tops of doors because i was too short, even when i was the tallest. we had to clean her and feed her and cloth her and she fought us. she was mostly incontinent and for some reason, probably because i was the youngest and didn't fight back, this was always my job to clean up. my family always brushed it off because "what can we do?" and since her death, she is never mentioned. when i came home the day she had died, the first thing i was told was, "it's okay if you're happy she's dead." and i was, because i never loved her, and she was such a burden on my grandfather. since her death he has begun traveling the world and is very happy. it is a little sad because apparently she was a different person before her strokes and subsequent dementia, but i never knew her like that. she just spent 12 years dying slowly, painfully, and meanly. for many years this has been a sort of underlying issue or scar, in regards to my mom. she doesn't take good care of herself and never has. she's significantly obese and has had a lifelong depression, and neither of these things she has ever made successful efforts toward improving. she has told me things like, "i'm going to die fat" and "when i'm in a wheelchair, please take me outside sometimes" and always, always tells me that she's going to have dementia someday, and that **i'm** going to take care of her. the only thought in my head is nope, no, never. i will never pin myself down to be abused like my grandfather was, like i was as a child, ever again. in the past couple of years, my mom has started to show a lot of signs of mental decline, and it makes me very angry. i'm living with her as it's the summer and it seems like every summer she's worse. she's just more short-tempered and easily confused. she does this, throw-up-my-hands and repeatedly say, "i don't know! i just don't know!" thing that my grandmother always did. a lot of times if i have something in my hands for whatever reason, she thinks it's something else. sjust today i asked if i could have a ball of bright yellow yarn that's been on her dresser in plain view for months, and she looked at me in confusion and asked, "do you have a wound?" i said, what are you talking about? she said, "what do you want that for?" i said, for my weaving. she said, "oh! i thought that was a roll of bandages. where did you get it from?"i told her i got it off her dresser, and she told me absolutely not, she had never seen it before. **i just walked away at that point, which she huffed at because she always thinks it's rude. it's way less rude than the things i would say if i didn't just walk away.** stuff like that happens *multiple times a day*. she gets very agitated thinking that i haven't eaten all day and comes and tells me i make her feel like a bad person for not cooking for me. if you haven't gotten the idea, i'm a very independent person and haven't relied on her to cook for me since i was in elementary school. what happens, i'm pretty sure, is that she doesn't remember or doesn't realize ever seeing me in the kitchen. but she comes and guilt-trips me and says, "*you're* making me feel like a bad mother!" it happens pretty much every day. she's a very bad driver, sometimes driving past her own workplace and, if she's in a new place, she'll get hopelessly turned around even if the destination is in plain view. she forgets to brush her hair often and sometimes forgets to feed the pets. i mostly take care of them now, but i feel bad for when i go back to college.she won't go to the doctor for anything because "they'll just say i'm fat and unhealthy, and i won't listen to them anyways." this is true. this is the hard to understand part:**my mom is working on her doctorate and is doing very well in her classes.** she writes 20 page papers and does massive studies and is working on her dissertation, which is on a very cerebral topic that i don't even understand. i don't think any of her coworkers see any/many of these behaviors, although she rarely interacts with them outside of work. they know little things like, "oh, she has such a bad sense of direction!" but i feel like i'm going insane a little, or that people would think i'm insane to say it looks like my mom is having the start of a cognitive decline. i just don't think that "normal old people aging" is staring at a ball of yellow yarn two feet away for 15+ seconds and thinking it's bandages. my 80 year old grandfather is much more mentally fit than my 50some year old mother. it's not right, and i don't like it, and i don't feel like anyone would believe me. that's why i came here. i just wanted to talk about it all. i find myself having a lot of fantasies for her to suddenly die in her sleep, just because it seems so terrifying, the path she's going down. for her and for me and for everyone else. and then it makes me very sad, that i wish my mom to die.

[VENT] 75 year old live-in mother-in-law has lost her short term memory and it is destroying my home, work, and family life. What can we do?
**tl;dr:  75 year old parent with short term memory loss is constantly wearing our patience thin and causing us to lose sleep and a bit of our own sanity.  need advice for next steps.**for the last decade we have shared our home with my 75 year old mother in law. she is blind in one eye (glaucoma i think) and takes prescription eyedrops.   she also takes cholesterol and blood pressure medicine.    she is also diabetic.unsurprisingly, she has been increasingly forgetful over recent years.   often bringing up the same gossipy topics at dinner time that we often don’t care to hear again -- not even the first time.  her vision required a family member to take her wherever.   but around the house she had been relatively independent.    cooked her own meals, sometimes for us as well.   generally ate what we ate as long as it wasn’t too spicy or salty or whatever.when she feels a headache, she instinctually self-checks her bp (digital tabletop omron) so a few weeks ago she caught a 200-over-something reading and she was taken to the er.   there they found her sodium levels were very low.  so she spent a week in the hospital.  and the whole time she was calling my wife’s home literally every hour.  “they haven’t fed me.”  (yes they did.)   “what pills do i take?” (the hospital is giving them to you.)  they had to put a “safety nurse” in her room to keep her from getting out of bed unnecessarily and escorting her to the bathroom.  after sodium iv’s and pills, eventually her sodium got back to normal and a week later she was discharged but transferred to a physical therapy place to work on her walk -- which over the years has been more of a shuffle, i assume due to her decreasing eye sight.  but not even 2 days into what was going to be a multi-week stay at the facility, she was frustrated at not being fed (she was) and not getting her medicines (she was).    she exercised her “patient’s rights” and basically checked herself out.  my wife picked up her up the next day. it’s been a living hell at home ever since.every morning we now give some of her pills and eye drops because we don’t want her to self-administer multiple times due to her memory.   then we give her the others in the evening.   and throughout the day she will call (her room is on the other end of the home -- by design)  or she’ll come upstairs (to our bedroom/home office) and ask “where are my pills?”  “we gave them to you this morning” “are you sure? because i feel like i haven’t taken them.  why don’t you say while i’m taking them ‘mom, here is this pill, that pill, etc’”     “that’s exactly what we do.”  sometimes it ends there.  other times it ramps up:   “well i don’t think you are giving them to me…why are you holding my medicine? i don’t want a stroke.  i don’t want to go blind.  give them to me.  you’re killing me.  don’t make me call the police.  you can’t do this to me...”   last week she went to her pcp for a post-hospital follow-up and they did a basic memory test.  something to the effect of “can you recall the three words you were asked to  remember earlier?” to which she then asked my wife who took her to the appointment, “what words? was i supposed to remember?”   so the pcp prescribed donepezil and vitamin e pills, and we are praying they actually do something.  though from what i’ve read, even if it does, it doesn’t help much after a year or two.  and everyone’s experience here seems to vary wildly.on reading this to myself, i admit it comes off like we are simply tired of bearing her burdens and are horrible children/in-laws.   we do our best to put ourselves in her shoes -- being a generation older, once in charge of our lives, then suddenly told that our perception of the truth (i.e. not being given medicine) is wrong.  but being berated exacts a toll on us as well.  even just having to repeat for literally the 50th time in a day that “yes, you took your pills and eyedrops, yes we know you don’t remember this is why you write it down.  what paper?  the paper by the whiteboard where we list all your medicines.  no you cannot keep your pill bottles. because you can’t remember anything and you might keep taking them.”  my wife recently had a baby which was already a strain.  ironically having the in-law live with us was a boon at first, but now she is basically one more child to contend with, and frankly more difficult than any of the real children we have.  my own grandmother developed alzheimers late in her life, and i saw the toll it had on her, my mother, and her siblings and their families.   so as much i feel a prisoner in the present, i dread the future of escorting her to her bathroom, keeping her from eating napkins at the dinner table, and having to (re) child-proof all the entryways into the home.  we were looking forward to welcoming a new pet (or even another child) to the family at some point, but that feels like a distant dream now with our plate of responsibility.financially, the in-law has retirement savings, my late father in-law’s pension, and presumably a very good health insurance plan.  my wife and i know very little of the other programs (medicaid? medicare? social security?) to understand how that would help with future care.i desperately want a return to sanity -- for all of us.  i want to work at home without getting “triggered” when i hear the in-law dialing the cordless phone because 99 times out of 100 she’s going to call us to ask about her medicine.     i want to relax at night and not be triggered by the lights in the hallway coming on because i know she’s going to beg for her pills that she doesn’t remember we gave her hours ago and threaten to call the police if we don’t hand the pill bottle over. for the first time since covid started, i actually want to leave my house to work in a cube and bear all the annoyances of office life instead of working from the comfort of my home -- just to not hear this broken record chipping away at my own sanity.   but that’s not fair to my wife who will now have two babies to tend to.i recognize this is my wife’s mother we’re talking about.  and my wife deserves a lot of credit for putting up with the bulk of the in-law’s repeated questions, criticisms, and lapses.   but she will go back to her own work and career soon once maternity is over.  and while she’s also work-from-home due to covid, it’s bound to revert to the old fashioned office sooner or later, and then who will care for her mother and listen to her fret every 15 minutes over pills she doesn’t remember already taking.police threats aside, this past winter  she almost blew up our house (with my pregnant wife inside) by not closing one of the gas stove top  burners completely.   thank goodness for that rotten egg smell they put in it and that i came home in time to catch it.  my wife didn’t even smell it upstairs.    we’ve since installed a natural gas leak detector.  and then there are the recurring issues.  misplacing her eye glasses, her egg timer, her necklace (why did it move from her jewelry box in the first place?

[VENT] 75 year old live-in mother-in-law has lost her short term memory and it is destroying my home, work, and family life. What can we do?
**tl;dr:  75 year old parent with short term memory loss is constantly wearing our patience thin and causing us to lose sleep and a bit of our own sanity.  need advice for next steps.**for the last decade we have shared our home with my 75 year old mother in law. she is blind in one eye (glaucoma i think) and takes prescription eyedrops.   she also takes cholesterol and blood pressure medicine.    she is also diabetic.unsurprisingly, she has been increasingly forgetful over recent years.   often bringing up the same gossipy topics at dinner time that we often don’t care to hear again -- not even the first time.  her vision required a family member to take her wherever.   but around the house she had been relatively independent.    cooked her own meals, sometimes for us as well.   generally ate what we ate as long as it wasn’t too spicy or salty or whatever.when she feels a headache, she instinctually self-checks her bp (digital tabletop omron) so a few weeks ago she caught a 200-over-something reading and she was taken to the er.   there they found her sodium levels were very low.  so she spent a week in the hospital.  and the whole time she was calling my wife’s home literally every hour.  “they haven’t fed me.”  (yes they did.)   “what pills do i take?” (the hospital is giving them to you.)  they had to put a “safety nurse” in her room to keep her from getting out of bed unnecessarily and escorting her to the bathroom.  after sodium iv’s and pills, eventually her sodium got back to normal and a week later she was discharged but transferred to a physical therapy place to work on her walk -- which over the years has been more of a shuffle, i assume due to her decreasing eye sight.  but not even 2 days into what was going to be a multi-week stay at the facility, she was frustrated at not being fed (she was) and not getting her medicines (she was).    she exercised her “patient’s rights” and basically checked herself out.  my wife picked up her up the next day. it’s been a living hell at home ever since.every morning we now give some of her pills and eye drops because we don’t want her to self-administer multiple times due to her memory.   then we give her the others in the evening.   and throughout the day she will call (her room is on the other end of the home -- by design)  or she’ll come upstairs (to our bedroom/home office) and ask “where are my pills?”  “we gave them to you this morning” “are you sure? because i feel like i haven’t taken them.  why don’t you say while i’m taking them ‘mom, here is this pill, that pill, etc’”     “that’s exactly what we do.”  sometimes it ends there.  other times it ramps up:   “well i don’t think you are giving them to me…why are you holding my medicine?

First time poster; need advice on how to approach mom concerning dad with undiagnosed but apparent dementia. More info in post
i am a long time lurker, but first time poster. i have no idea if this is allowed here, i need advice on how to approach my mom and brother concerning my dad who has apparent dementia, but is undiagnosed. my dad’s cognitive state has been in decline for some time now and i live three states away and each time i see him, he is getting worse. my mom is unsympathetic and has very little patience. my dad has been semi-retired for about 10 years, and my mom just recently retired within the last month. now that they’re both retired full time, it’s painfully obvious that my dad has seriously declined now that he has someone around to observe him more hours of the day. they somehow made a cross country drive to visit me here in colorado from arkansas. i have no idea how they made it out here because my dad typically does the driving and my mom has to be the navigator. my mom has reported that his driving is erratic, and she had to remind him multiple times of where to turn. they will be staying here for three weeks. just in the last week, my dad has gotten lost in my small rural community and had to ask for directions to find my apartment even though i live just down the street from their hotel. he has no idea which direction the major cities are from our location. as a result, i’m genuinely concerned about how they will get back to arkansas on their own and my 17 year old daughter is going with them for the return trip to stay with them for two weeks before flying back to colorado in august. she knows the way as she’s taken the trip with me multiple times, but it’s unrealistic to entrust her with getting them back to arkansas on her own. other concerns include:1. he frequently talks to himself with full blown loud vocal conversations. 2. he will completely forget a conversation from just 15 minutes prior. 3. has a lack of self-awareness (he tried to give a partially earn hamburger to my neighbor’s dog until i told him no).4. he has difficulty comprehending complex conversations and scheduled road closures. 5. he forgets important dates and often enters them incorrectly on his phone. 6. he forgets common information such as how wifi and cellular data and hot spots work when he previously understood how this works7. his conversations are very circular in which he will ask the same questions that have been previously answered. 8. he acts very childish at times such as trying to randomly pick a fight with me over the dumbest things and will latch on to it until he “wins the argument.”9. i seriously think he’s functioning on a level of about a 10-13 year old. 10. he has difficulty getting around and refuses to take care of his health. he shuffles around like a penguin when he walks. 11. when my daughter got upset, she excused herself to her room to cool off, my mom and i had to explain to him that she went to her room and he had no recollection of this. 12. he frequently gets choked on his food which signals swallowing concerns that can be deadly. we have had a previous incident in our family in which my maternal grandfather confused the gas pedal for the break pedal and drove into a building killing an infant a few years ago and looking back on that we realized we should have taken the keys from my grandfather at least a year or more before this happened. i am scared that we could be setting ourselves up for another incident like this with my dad if we don’t take some action soon. does anyone here have any advice on how to approach this subject with my family? i foresee that we will need to have a serious conversation about this within the next few months where my dad can checked out by a medical doctor to get an official diagnosis, and to eventually take his drivers license away before someone gets killed. this is hard for me because my mom is unsympathetic and my brother doesn’t seem to want to get involved. my relationship with my parents is testy at best. long-term care isn’t an option due to my parents finances and doing so would likely mean selling my parents land and house to afford a nursing home. as quickly as my dad is declining, i suspect that he will need around the clock care within the next 3-5 years.

my gran has always (and will always) be my best friend. i’m unsure about how far along she is with her dementia, but it seems to be spiraling quickly now. she is a tiny lady, and my grandad fell on her last year. this resulted in a broken leg that just won’t fully heal. because of this she has had to use a walker, but is quite stubborn about using it. my greatest concern is- i want to know the best way to react to her memory loss and her being confused about where she is and what day it is. my gran has a history with the excessive alcohol consumption (she always kept this a secret). a few months ago i found that there were several bottles of hard liquor that had her lipstick on the lid. she has been taken to bed several times for being too intoxicated (sometimes even as early as 6am).thus, her live in carers removed all the alcohol. this throws her into a type of withdrawal which i think makes her memory worse, and her behavior more aggressive.we recently had to move her and my grandad into the frail care facility. she has woken up every morning at 5am and calls about 16 times before lunch time- terrified- unsure about where she is. recently she thinks she is alone in the train station and calls crying not knowing which train to take. yet, she is in her room. 💔my grandad has severe parkinson’s and is paralyzed, struggling to talk. but recently he was moved to another room because he said my gran keeps waking up in the middle of the night and slapping his face. the facility nurse said “i don’t know what is wrong with your gran”. how can a matron say this at an old age cate facility? it’s so so sad, it’s dementia! to make matters worse, the carers in this care facility scream at her (i’ve heard them shout at her to “shut up and get in the shower” and “you’re an alcoholic” etc.) when i have tried to address it i am told she is rude so what do we expect from the carers. 😢 i just think they possibly don’t fully know how to deal with her dementia. but the verbal abuse toward her has been mentioned by other people that have heard them shouting at her. since my gran was moved to another room, she is worse. she keeps thinking my grandad has left her or died. it’s so traumatic for her. my beautiful, precious gran :( this breaks my heart because she is so scared, and i’m trying so hard to be strong for her, to help.the care center gives her a glass of wine in the evenings because she seems to be so reliant. but i’m worried about the constant withdrawal and what alcohol is doing to her brain. but she loves her wine so much, and it is the last thing in this world she has that she can enjoy. i’m worried she is hurting and i can’t help her more than i am. when she is confused and thinks she is in another country or another era- should i gently reassure her that she is a little confused? or should i just lightly brush over it and go with what she says? i’m struggling to sleep and eat, because i’m so worried about her. i just want to do right by her because she has been the biggest part of my world and i love her with all of my heart.is there a medication i should look into for her aggression and fear? how can i ease this pain she is in? how can i do better?i really just want to do the right thing. 💔

Some advice
my father has been struggling for many years with combinations of conspiracy theories, adhd, and loss. however, even before he took his medication, even when he was loosing friends in the military, he was never ever like this. he has completely gone full rage to the point where i want him to stop suffering. my mom and i think he has to have some kind of dementia or alzheimer’s and i am wondering how late it is. he refuses to see most doctors. my mom barely was able to convince him to see the eye doctor to get new glasses. he forgets so much constantly asks for what our phone number is the date and time. (i think he has asked about what day it is at least 3-5 times a day at his worse) he has a hard time recalling memories from early in the day or from the day before. he can barely communicate what he wants to say. like he will say “put it here” but not state what it or here is. he has no social life and our neighbors think he is crazy even though they believe the same theories. i don’t even think he knows several of our neighbor’s names. he stays up some of the night and is asleep most of the day. i have no clue about other problems like if he has problems peeing or other issues. though he does have a tendency to spill food on himself all the time. i hate to say this but i want to know when his suffering will be all over. i know he used to be kind but all he does is scream yell and sleep. he can do hard labor (works out a few times a week). my mom and i know it’s something but even if we did get a diagnosis we definitely couldn’t get him to take the medication. fortunately he is not violent towards any of us. but i just don’t want it to last any longer for everyone’s health. any suggestions/ ideas on where he is are greatly appreciated. i just don’t know where else to go since he is refusing medical care.

Father's Day ramble
-begin rant/ramble-both my parents have dementia. vascular for my dad, alzheimer's for my mom. they're lucky that they're in memory care together. they're beginning to not recognize me now, partly from the disease and partly from the new medicines that have tamped down their mood swings. yesterday, my in-laws asked about my plans for my dad and mom on father's day. later, while i was out of the room, my wife tells me she told them it's hard on me to field questions like that. i do find it hard. i don't think i have any knowledge of how to think about this whole situation to begin with. i have had so many experiences with people who give unsolicited advice, who ask but drift away. i have many negative feelings from those experiences. i don't know how to respond to people who might actually care. people who might just be neutral. i feel the weight of expectations. but when i think about all the things that have happened... there's no damn elevator pitch for "shit's all fucked up and no they're not getting better." my parents won't remember if i visit. i haven't seen them in person since before the pandemic, and i'd cut myself off from visits right then because they'd already forget if i visited within a day. if i mention it's a special day, they'll ask for special activities. if i take them out they forget why we're out and want to go back. if i show my parents an ounce of sadness they'll mirror it back to me. but i don't yet have a foundation of happiness to hold me solid when i go meet them. right now it'd be easier to talk about visiting a grave. no-one expects a regular grave visit to require party-level attendance, food, and decorations. no-one expects a grave visit to even happen.i'm sorry to my in-laws. i visit them for holidays and occasions. i don't know how they think about it that i visit them but not my parents. i feel lost in the chaos of possible discussions with them. i hate being unready for conversations. -end rant-

Mother in Law with Moderate to Severe Memory Loss and Normal MRI
my (f60) mil (f81) has been experiencing progressive memory loss over the past three years.  it has accelerated during covid. she no longer remembers visiting us in another state or frequent calls with loved ones.  my husband (m60), her eldest son, was recently hospitalized with a severe infection.  she was staying with us at the time.  she could not remember why he was in the hospital, why when she couldn't see him due to covid protocols or where the hospital was.  last week she called him three nights in a row wanting to know what his illness is and why she hadn't been told about it.  she has lost the ability to problem solve, ie if she can't remember her pin number she walks away from the purchase rather then paying by credit card or check. in conversation we speak of the same things over and over.  her hygiene is declining, only showers once a week and wears dirty clothes. she frequently has no food in her home due to the pin issues. she has cycles where she says that she is ill and cannot describe what is wrong. during these episodes she is more confused and combative.  they appear to happen around every 4 to 6 weeks. i could go on but you get the picture.her children have taken her to a gerontologist where she passed the simple memory questions with ease. she was prescribed anti depressants which she took for a while.  a referral to a neurologist was granted and she saw one in december and again passed the memory questions with ease.  i took her in may and she did not do as well on the memory questions and a mri was ordered.  she had it this week and the results are normal.  this is a blow to the family as we had hopes it would shed light on her condition and provide a diagnosis and a treatment plan.  she has another appointment in early july and we do not have a lot of hope that it will provide us with much information.have any of you had any similar experiences?  are there other tests that we can request that might offer us a path forward?  we are very concerned because she is currently living alone and it doesn't seem like this will be an option for much longer.  many thanks to you all in advance for reading my rather lengthy post.  any information or advise would be greatly appreciated.

How to deal with your heart breaking for a parent with dementia who never loved you?
my father never cared much for me and basically abandoned me the second i turned 18. he’d only ever really provided the legal minimum for me, and otherwise just ignored me or yelled at me to leave him alone. over the years i’ve done my best to never ask him for anything because he specifically told me not to, but there have been a couple of emergency occasions where i had no other choice, and he always made it very clear what a terrible burden it was for him to have to help me at all. i once got angry at his attitude toward me and pointed out that i’d never asked to be born, and his response was “well i tried to tell your mom to get an abortion.” i never wanted to completely cut him out of my life because i didn’t have anyone else to even resentfully be there for me if something bad were to happen. i’ve tried to maintain a mostly shallow and tepid relationship i suppose. but at the end of the day he’s my father. he’s the only father i ever had, and i can’t help but care about him i guess because i’m just a sensitive and empathetic person. he’s typically been cordial with me as an adult so long as i was never asking for anything. now he’s in his 70’s and has dementia. i didn’t even know about his diagnosis until several years had passed and he had already begun to show obvious symptoms and it couldn’t be hidden from me anymore. recently it came to light that his spouse who was supposed to be taking care of him has been failing entirely to do anything that she was supposed to be doing. he’s been out driving severely drunk and has gotten multiple duis, and has been falling and hurting himself and has bruises all over. he even got some cuts so bad he had to be taken to get stitched up. my sister has recently had no choice but to take him in at her house, and he’s in the process of getting a divorce. i’d love some advice from anyone out there who can relate to the complicated grief of having a shitty parent suffer with this condition. dementia is terrible and heartbreaking to think about even for people i don’t know. my heart has always broken for others who have had to go through this. but when the afflicted person was not great to you, there’s this extra layer of awful in the form of conflicted feelings and resentments. for days now i’ve been anxious and depressed, randomly crying and then simultaneously getting so mad that i’m having to feel so worried and upset for someone who never loved me. i know that he’s only going to keep getting worse and i just don’t understand how on earth i’m supposed to get through this. when my mom died it was sudden. i didn’t have to watch her decline and suffer. i didn’t have to worry she was going to go out and kill someone with her car. i didn’t have to worry that she couldn’t even get up out of bed in the morning without falling over and busting her head open. i didn’t have to watch her forget everything. i didn’t have to anticipate the grief of having to put her away in a home somewhere and wait for her to forget who anybody even is.

Anyone familiar with what dementia this may be?
lots to this but i'll focus on symptoms/examples, because he is refusing to be diagnosed and his doctor spoke to me but can't do testing without his permission. he passes memory tests (the what year is it, who is president test). he had an mri scheduled but he decided to skip it last second. memory hasn't been too big an issue until recently. it's the other stuff:problems with decision making (this is the biggest/most evident). he can't make a decision without me. i give him specific, clear steps, make a list with the steps. he then asks me a detail that was never in the list/what i just said. so i have to say it again. ask him to repeat it to me. he then goes and does it not quite correct or in a way that is illogical/makes no sense. he gets mad at me for always "being critical/nagging" when i'm trying to stop him. if i don't give him instructions on what to do he sits in one spot and stares at nothing. he is now watching cartoons with fascination (little kid in the home) or he falls asleep all the time if not kept busy.understanding language. he can't detect the first half of a sentence. in addition, sometimes i will tell him an item to write down on a list. he can't understand what word i am saying (common item, like peas). so i explain what the item is. he then tries to write down my explanation of what it is as if that is the name of this item. if i spell it it is worse. so an example for peas is he will write down "peasr greenbell..." for me saying "peas are the green little balls we eat." i'll tell him to stop writing and listen and i am explaining what it is and he'll get mad and show me he wrote what i said like i said to. so i get the item and show him. he'll end up buying green beans instead when we shop or not get anything.he keeps trying to find/use cleaning cloths used for scrubbing toilets and gross household things instead of facecloths. he's been reminded 10000 times they are for cleaning and shown where the facecloths are. yes yes oh yes he says. aaand next time he finds the cleaning ones. laundry will end up in the dryer unwashed because he goes down to wash his clothes, closed the door, and forgets to turn it on. he also puts clothes for the wrong people in the wrong person's closets or drawers. he now keeps wearing his sweater outside when it is 30+ c degrees out, gets himself sick, and when i notice and tell him to take it off he says oh yes, then i have to stand there until he does. and he won't drink water without being reminded. wants to eat 1 food always. spagetti. he used to be a great cook, now he can't mamage cooking unless i'm watching. it gets a bit dangerous/takes him too long for the food he is making. so every day he wants to make spaghetti. a million other things but he can chat on the phone well so his family is not getting it and keeps saying "he sounds fine." need help so i can research. thanks.oh also, i have no authority legally over him. his family is not helping/avoiding the issue. i have to care for my child and this is too much. he says i can't evict him and became hostile when i suggested gently he look for an elder home or retirement home. i have no idea how to get him in a proper care home.

These people do NOT want to see me angry !
angry vent ahead ! lots of fsa couple months ago, mom, who has advanced alz and is in a nursing home in the alz wing, fell 3 times in 3 weeks (been there 2 years, never fell). (it's a f\*ing pandemic so i can only see her in a stupid room for 1h on sundays in the afternoon, so i don't see much of what is happening in the wing anymore. )1st time broke her wrist, 2nd had 6 stitches to the ear, 3rd a big knot on her brow. of course i ask to meet with the doctor see what we can do, look for a reason, help her sleep more, something. the new lady doctor is a bitch, tells me if i want to change her meds i can take her back with me and take care of her myself (come again? i pay 3 000 € a month for this place !) puts words in my mouth like i said they're abusing her, that she just got there, it's not her fault, she doesnt' prescribe the meds, it's only the disease progressing blah blah blah and for the first time : "you need to live your life, your mom had hers". (i'm boiling at this point)okay so you wanna play? we're gonna play. i work for the french health dpt (but i didn't say that). i found thee non profit on the island backed up by important local people, make good friends and ask for their help. they were wonderful. so they took my place. a team of professionals of the field organized a meeting with the bitch doctor and a bunch of alz staff to talk about mom's case. apparently the bitch doctor was very open to the collaboration (yeah? no shit!) but the 2nd very important professional, her neuro psych, who is said to prescribe the meds and see mom once a month only (!!), didn't come (said because i wan't there). so i had to take a second appt to see this one. and expose what i want to happen (basically i want them to try several ways to help her sleep, her body is very used to sleep meds, so they have to be imaginative and f\*ing do their job !! )that was yesterday... oooh a 2nd bitch doctor !! this one tells me she only recommends the meds, she's not the one to talk to either (so which one of you bitches is it??????!!!!!) and gives me my second :"live your life, focus on you..."the fuck !!! i ratted her ass too right away to the non profit, i said i'm not talking to either of them ever again. they don't want my "nose" where it doesn't belong huh? fiiiiiiiiiine yall are gonna have a team of pros so big up your asses in a minute ! her mind may be going going ... but she's still my mother and i will take care of her needs, and i'm not feeling guilty ! it's just normal ! to everyone here, do not forget ever that doctors, any doctor, deliver a service ! if you're not happy with your service provider you can change ! always ! you are not married to your doctor, you don't owe them shit once you've paid them. and never hesitate to look for back up with non profits that work on the subject at hand. rant over... fighto !!

Spouse has serious cognitive problem, refuses to get help and is getting worse
my husband is in his 50s. he has had problems for decades where he seemed confused, didn't remember things, had angry outbursts, sometimes about not remembering things, sometimes about random trivial things. he mentioned about 15 years ago he was worried he had a brain injury due to contact sports he had played but never elaborated and never followed up. i have watched his memory, his cognitive ability, his behavior, executive functioning etc all gradually decline over the last 10 years. i think this was going on for decades but i didn't realize these were cognitive issues and chalked them up some sort of behavioral issue.   he has frontal lobe epilepsy and is on medication for it but he now denies he has epilepsy and has been trying to convince his current doctors he doesn't really have it. when he was first diagnosed he mentioned something about cognitive decline and dying in 10 years but never would explain. so i don't know if a doctor found something more, told him something i don't know about and he isn't telling me? if this is related to the initial epilepsy diagnosis? he started with denying he actually has epilepsy and this has now evolved into him denying most of the events around the massive seizure he had and his hospitalization that led to him being diagnosed. i know he is lying. i was there for part of it, there were multiple witnesses to all of the events he is now insisting never happened.   he struggles to think or plan something out. he rambles with no point. today he randomly changed the subject to a medical problem with his hand then pointlessly rambled about various medical ailments for 10 minutes with no point then sort of just got lost. he will do this a lot. he will insist on talking to me then have these pointless rambling monologues about something he has interest in. no point, no conclusion, no real reason he is telling me all of this.   he insists on trying to help me if i am repairing something around the house. he decides he knows better than i do about what i am working on. then he decides he has a better idea. this involves making whatever the task is ten times more complicated then he just sort of get lost in the details of how to actually do it and eventually lets me go back to what i was originally doing. he will get angry if i don't want to do it his way even if he hasn't actually planned out or explained what that is. this usually results in him being angry, yelling and me and making a scene. so doing repairs around the house involves trying to hide them from him so he doesn't try to help.   tonight he forgot about the trees i planted last week, that he had gone outside to look at and commented on last week. he went outside tonight and acted like it was the first time he had seen them. he mentioned possibly throwing away some items in the garage as i am in the process of cleaning it out. except he threw them out 3 years ago. he forgets about something being gone, changed or done then rages about it that i was dishonest or didn't ask him.  i am absolutely beyond exhausted. he is low level agitated all the time, seems to have lost any understanding of manners or social cues. he is really hard to be around. he knows he has these problems but will turn around and angrily deny them and refuses to seek any sort of medical help.

Pretty sure my grandmother is developing dementia - how to start getting care (in Canada) when she refuses?
my grandparents are 90 and 91. my grandfather, you would probably think is in his late 70s or early 80s - he's still very healthy and active (or was until lockdown anyway). he still drives, they still live in their own home. but my grandmother has been declining over the last five years or so, and rapidly over the past year. at first it seemed like typical old age stuff, like forgetting a word here or there. but her memory and mood have dropped off noticeably over the past year. apparently she no longer cooks, and she spends most of her time in her chair in the family room even though we try to get her to do stuff. it is heartbreaking because she was also very active all my life. her no longer reading, knitting, cooking, playing cards etc. is definitely out of character.mental illness runs in that side of the family. my dad and i are both medicated for depression and anxiety. i know she has had anxiety issues all her life, and was also on ativan at some point (she revealed this to me when i was first having trouble), but never really got a proper diagnosis or therapy because it was a different time. her anxiety has been the worst to deal with, and i thought until last night that it was an untreated anxiety disorder that was the problem here. last night my dad called them, and my grandfather sounded exasperated. apparently she had been pacing and agitated, and wouldn't say what about when he tried to help. my dad talked to her and she just kept saying she was very anxious, but didn't know what about. he helped to talk her down for a while. he checked in today and grandpa said she couldn't remember what happened last night in the morning. she said she knew something happened but wasn't sure what. and her mood was fine today.after searching i understand this is classic sundowning, and it will probably become more frequent. i told my dad and he said he has believed for a while now that she is in early dementia. he told my grandfather to call the doctor and make her an appointment about the incident last night, which we believe he'll do. but he tells us that he's tried to raise her issues to the doctor at previous appointments, and she just denies everything, and is "together" enough during appointments that i guess there's nothing the doc can do. my grandfather is worried and asks my dad for help often now and we don't know what to do. about two years ago they were looking at moving into a retirement home, my grandfather was ready to do it even though he is fine independently, and recognized that she needs some assistance and it would be good for her. they went on tours and were almost going to commit to a place, but she changed her mind and refused at the last minute. now of course, i am glad they weren't in a home last year... but now that it's safer, it's probably a good idea.what complicates things is that my aunt is nuts. we're all fairly sure she is undiagnosed borderline or something like that. half the family is alienated from her. she is very clingy to my grandparents and calls them multiple times a day, every day. she has definitely made things worse, constantly seeding fear about my grandfather's health in my grandmother's mind, for example. she convinced grandma about a decade ago that she couldn't go anywhere unassisted because she might fall. yet she is also in denial about her cognitive issues and was the main person who talked her out of moving into the home.so yeah... i just needed to vent, because i am very sad about all of this, and we don't really know what to do. our family has been pretty lucky with health, lots of long-lived relatives and nobody has had significant problems with dementia. so i guess if anyone knows what we can do as a family, talking to the doctor or getting resources when she won't accept outside help, that would be helpful. or anything about dealing with family members that are counter-productive too.

Suspected dementia
hi all. this is long so sorry in advance. so as the title says i’m pretty sure my mil has dementia. she’s 63 but i have noticed a decline in her cognitive function over the past 5 years. about 5 years ago my in-laws moved back to their home state and we celebrated christmas with them. there was a few gifts given that were questionable. as in my mil ordered something on a family member’s amazon wishlist and once it arrived, she didn’t know who it was for. i was gifted an xbox controller which was clearly supposed to be for her 8 year old grandson. “b” (mil) has always been “ditzy” and a little scattered brained but this first little mental mishap was what first gave me the thought that she was beginning to have some cognitive decline. skip forward to the summer of 2019. “b” had an episode where she fainted and fell in her bedroom. her husband was concerned because she was somewhat incoherent. she was taken to the hospital and it was determined that she had an issue with her heart. her heart rate kept dropping to the point where she would become unresponsive. she then received a pace maker. we visited her in the hospital and she was pretty out of it. we were there when a speech pathologist came in to do an assessment (standard after a fall with loss of consciousness). she was unable to do some of the seemingly easy questions. the general a&amp;o questions of where are you, what day it is, etc. anyways skipping forward to the end of 2020. they (father in law and b) finally went to the doctor about b’s continual memory problems. (b is still convinced that her memory problems are related to her fall she had in 2019) they did a memory test that was 2 days long. i don’t know if it was inconclusive or what but no diagnosis came from it. this past april she finally had the eeg and mri and met with the doctor this past monday to discuss the results. we (so and myself) have not been told what the results were but i’m highly suspicious that she has dementia/ad. b has been going to speech therapy for a few months. she goes three times a week but dislikes it because “she isn’t getting better”. she still thinks that her memory problems started after she had the fall in 2019. i’ve noticed memory problems way prior to “the fall” but i’m only the daughter in law. b hasn’t driven since they moved away (about 15 years ago). i understand, it was a new area and she wasn’t sure so her husband drove everywhere. now that they’re back down here (where they’re originally from) she still hasn’t driven. right before the pandemic started, b and husband went on a trip to see the oldest child out of state. on the flight home, the plane had to return to the terminal because b was having a medical emergency. her blood pressure was super high and she was having chest pains. she was having a panic attack and also forgot to take her bp meds that morning. i did a little research and found a “pill machine” on amazon. as annoying as it is, it has really helped b. her taking her meds was an issue when her husband was still working. my father in law retired about a year ago. and bless his heart- he has the patience of a saint. he is now in charge of the whole household. bills, appointments, grocery shopping, etc i feel sorry for him because even though he’s the mentally 100%, he has post-polio syndrome so his physical capabilities are somewhat diminished (and will most likely get progressively worse)i come from a medical background and am currently a nursing student at 35. i witnessed my ex boss’s cognitive decline into alzheimer’s first hand and my grandfather had ad also (he was in his late 80s when diagnosed). i feel somewhat responsible for being a medical liaison for my in-laws. they usually come to me with questions or concerns. i try my best to answer questions. my concern all along has been - no one in the family is acknowledging that b has “dementia”i’m hoping that the results from the mri gave them an actual diagnosis so there’s not this “it will get better, why isn’t it getting better” mentality. i’ve watched some of the teepa snow videos and i love her. i’m so thankful to the people on this sub that recommended her. i think that will be a great resource to share with b’s family (her husband, my husband, and his sisters). i also learned that b has had 3 siblings that have passed already that all had alzheimer’s. i’m pretty sure that was never told to any of her doctors but that’s a gigantic red flag to me. i apologize for my lengthy story. i just felt like i needed to get it all off my chest. i’ve been lurking on here for a little bit and reading everyone’s stories. i truly love how supportive this community is. to quote my best friend who is a hospice nurse, “dementia is a bitch”.

brand new to this sub so please forgive me if i make any mistakes. also on mobile so please forgive formatting.i feel like i should start by saying that my mom and i have lost several different family members (some dead, some just gone) to several different types of dementia and have both been caregivers in some form or fashion. not that we are experts by any means but we know enough to know when to worry.my mom’s friend d (74f) has no children, no partner and no extended family. she has a neighbor that helps with her yard work and taking her trash to the curb and stuff like that, a financial advisor who helps looks after her assets, and my mom. over the past 10 or so years my mom has gradually gone from weekly phone calls and occasionally meeting for lunch to driving d to all of her appointments (doctor, hair salon, etc.) and having to fix all of d’s “technology issues” which started with a crypto-locker, then there was an “amazon” scam, then a handful of facebook scams... basically d clicking on links that she shouldn’t have and my mom dealing with the fallout for her. in the past year these incidents have increased in both frequency and severity, even though we’ve both told her multiple times how to identify and avoid harmful emails/texts/phone calls. at this point my mom has most if not all of d’s logins and password info even going so far as when d updates a password she calls mom to tell her.mom and i recently (in the last month) discussed mutual concern for d’s potentially declining mental state. we both think that she is showing signs of some form of dementia, and hindsight being 20/20, has been for some time.today d called my mom saying she was having trouble resetting her username for her main bank account. d claims she tried to reset it online but was told she had to go to a branch. when she went to the branch they told her she had to do it online. so now d is all worked up and flustered and frustrated and freaking out because she needs to get online to pay her bills. mom agrees to meet d at a different branch office (d refused to go back to the one she had already been to) and thankfully they got a rep who was both patient and compassionate. long story short, d forgot her username and new (about 2 months ago) password, rep provided correct username and mom had the new password. they get it all sorted. mom &amp; d go to leave and d is still noticeably agitated so mom is concerned about her driving. mom offers to drive d home and arrange to get d’s car there too. d gets confrontational, mom backs down. d gets in her car but can’t remember how to get out of the parking lot. she calls mom (who is also still in the parking lot) and mom again tries to talk d out of driving. d’s having none of that so mom leads her back to the main road (literally 2 turns) and lets her go. d made it home safely.so this brings me to the two main reasons for this post. 1) i’m not sure if i’m projecting due to my previous experiences but it really seems like she has early signs of dementia and has started escalating rapidly in the last year, and 2) we have literally zero authority in any way, shape or form but there’s also (as far as we know) no one else who does. how do we help d?(i have more examples of signs but this post is already super long and i figured today’s events were most relevant)

Grandma Called Me Worthless
hello. this post is not like me but i feel like i need it. i was raised by my grandparents from the time i was 8 till 18. my mom left me and my brother and they took us in. my dad was a jobless alcoholic during that time. growing up, my grandma was always distant. she suffered from mental illness and depression. there were times where she would stay in bed for months, she never loved us unconditionally, it was always conditional. since i moved out and started college, she hasn’t called me once. i love her like a mother, yet experience so much confusion. her dementia is getting really bad, she has forgotten so much. for her, however, at this point she is more paranoid. despite how distant she is, i don’t think much of it. we never celebrated holidays, she never told us she loved us, she’s like that to everybody. still i go over there maybe once every few months. this time was different. she said my dad doesn’t live with them anymore (he was because like i said he’s a drunk). i simply expressed how i think that is for the best. she felt as if i was attacking her son and lost it on me. she called me every name in the book, called me worthless, and said i’ll never amount to anything. my face went white, i was so hurt. she said my dad is an amazing man and with every bit of courage i had in me i told her i’m 4 times the man my dad is (he beat my mom, never worked, done nothing for us, and does drugs). she pointed her finger in my face and told me to leave her house (the house i grew up in) and never return. before this, i never knew where my dad got it from, but seeing the wantonness on her face, i now know where he gets his anger. i went straight to my car and cried, my grandfather said her meanness has been a constant lately. that she simply forgets losing her cool and acts like nothing happened.how do i get past that? how do i not take it personally? i want to go back but i can’t put myself through that again. i am not worthless. everything i do i do to make her proud, she was an educator so i am in school to be one. her calling me nothing might not be my last memory of her but it will forever be the most prominent and i’m angry.

I just need to vent. I feel like I'm at the end of my rope and we're still at the beginning of the dementia journey.
i am 31f and my mother with dementia is 70f. i'm an only child. my dad died about a year ago. he and i had been noticing symptoms for 5+ years, but they were subtle. things took a but of a leap when she went through chemo and then had an aneurism surgery. she still pays her own bills but i often catch them unpaid or in arrears, same with medication, she's pissed off at me when i point it out (i try to do so gently in a non accusatory way- lots of help with phrasing and approaching things from the sub). she will ask me things many times, and say good morning as if she hasn't seen me many times. the questions are endless. meal time is the worst.  she's so good at faking it around other people. her doctor diagnosed her with dementia symptoms as of a year ago. it's gotten worse but she can still mostly function independently and i've exhausted efforts to make her go in for a check up "for other reasons"... i can't force her, and she doesnt present as cognitively impaired enough for me to enact poa. i resent her for not contributing at all towards my dad's end of life paperwork, for not cleaning her house and for starting new projects everywhere that i end up needing to clean up. i have to secretly go through all her bills after she's done. i did her taxes for her and my dad and was met with resistance the entire way. she's so capable of so many things but just won't do what actually needs to be done, nor do i think she's capable of deciding what her best interests are. this is  part of her non-dementia personality and exacerbated by the dementia (i think?)i moved in to her gigantic messy house about 6 months ago and live on the second floor while i finished my graduate program. it's been hell and i worry our relationship will never recover. my partner is here too now and taking time off work to help. i worry about our relationship too.i can no longer tolerate being around her unless i've been drinking. it feels like a huge charade all the time. i'm so angry and i've gained 40 pounds. i feel like my body and mind and shutting down. it's damned if i do and damned if i don't. if i don't help then stuff goes wrong because, if i do, she's upset with me for taking too much control. i have medical and financial poa [if she were to be deemed unfit]. she's in too early stages for moving her into care. her friends say "she's just forgetful, she's always been a bit wacky." no she's on the edge of being incapable to live by herself. anyway, i just feel so angry and resentful and guilty. she still is a lovely person, but i can't stand to even be within 10 feet of her at the moment. she won't stop shewing on her cheek (no injury or tooth problem but just a 'new' habit). i feel like i'm hiding and it's increasingly difficult to hide how angry i am at my situation, which i feel doubly guilty about because i know she can't help it. i think even if she didn't have dementia i would be having a tough time living with her because of the mother/daughter thing, our history and personality differences etc. i can't afford psychological counselling, and i haven't been able to get a job since finishing school 3 weeks ago because i spend so much time doing her stuff for her which leaves me mentally exhausted. i think i need to let go, move out, help where i can, try to set up outside visits from a 'cleaning lady' and just wait for something catastrophic to happen that proves she needs outside assistance but i fear that i'll be judged as negligent, i just don't know how i'm supposed to move forward with my life. i just wish someone would release me from the responsibility just for a bit, i feel like i'm staring down the next 10 years of my life just thrown away. my parents never took care of their health, their property etc  and i spent a lot of my life already cleaning up their messes. it feels like "goodbye any hopes and dreams."

My Grandmother and her dementia
a friend of mine suggested i write here. it's pretty long.i’m 20 years old. my grandmother, now 73, has been a major influence and presence in my life ever since i was born. my brother, 17, and i would usually spend our weekends with her and a dinner every wednesday as children. for as long as i can remember, she’s had a problem with her short term memory, due to a side effect for her fibromyalgia. for a while, even if she’d sometimes forget what she was doing, she was able to function. but december 2011, my grandfather passed away. this left my grandmother crushed, and for a while she spent some time with her older sister. around that time she was diagnosed with dementia. the decline in her health was initially slow. she was still able to drive, live alone, and we would check in on her. she would tell us her older sister was “taking care of her.” but as i was going through high school, i could tell things were off. she would lash out more frequently, and kept talking highly of her sister, claiming that “she does everything for me.”during my senior year my mother and i started visiting her more often (we had stopped spending weekends due to school and my job) and found her kitchen completely empty of food. we began taking her to the store every time we saw her, only to come back to find weeks worth of food eaten in days. come to find out her younger sister, who lived right next door, was getting money from the older one to take her to get food, only to buy cereal and milk. claiming, “well your grandma doesn’t eat anything else.” then my grandmother started having episodes. it started back in 2019, when she was visiting her sister and we got a call saying she ended up in the hospital. i shuffled in to find my grandmother, bruised with a swollen eye, frightened and not wanting to stay away from her two dogs any longer. when we asked her what happened, she said that, “my sister was climbing up the wall, and well i had to go get her down.” we later found out she tripped over the dog gate at the top of the stairs. since then she keeps seeing a man, a large man, in her house. she sometimes says he took her younger daughter away from her father, my grandmother’s ex-husband. she sees her younger daughter as a small child, when she’s in her late 30s. my aunt, the younger daughter, recently moved in to keep an eye on my grandmother. she was a cna and figured she could keep an eye on her own mother. and it has helped. she keeps an eye on my grandma’s eating, how many sweets she eats (she’s diabetic but will eat whole sleeves of oreos at a time without thinking), and how many aleve's she takes a day (we bought a big bottle before thanksgiving and when i went back a couple weeks later the bottle was almost empty).  however, due to her doing stupid stuff in her childhood, my grandmother has some resentment that always seem to cloud over when my aunt tries to help. that isn’t fair to my aunt, but in her mind this is her way of making up for her mistakes. truth be told, i can see my grandmother trying to tell us she appreciates all that we do, but she can’t get that connection to us. and she keeps thinking what we’re doing is what her older sister set up. and sometimes we had to use that ruse to keep her calm. i hated the day i had to fake a phone call to my great-aunt to keep my grandmother from thinking she was robbed.  i try to visit as much as i can, but sometimes visiting her is draining. i have such vivid memories of her doing things, going places, and smiling. the woman i see now is sad, frail, and almost a shell of whom she was. it’s hard to face someone who raised you for 20 years one day look at you as though you were a stranger, and then slowly recognize you.  my brother is in pain as well, but he doesn’t quite remember who she was before all this. sometimes i think about her and start crying. i love her very much. i hate to see her like this. we’re expecting to one day hear her doctors tell us that it’s turned into full fledged alzheimer’s.  this all just hurts so much, and i don’t know what to do. thanks for listening, i really just needed to vent.

Like a Fireman
its like a lone fireman here. little fires crop up, you stamp em out or let em burn out, douse the big flames with water. and then theres another fire, so you run stamp that out. there always has to be a fire, always. a few months ago it was his skin growths. he has alot of skin growths and he said he was concerned and wanted them checked. i took him in and he was seen by their assistant, whatever the title is. she looked and checked a couple but no cancer. dad refused to believe it, he must have skin cancer, no way he cant have it. so he trash talked her and went off on how she isnt a dermatologist. why do i need to explain to him that he knows nothing while she is a professional and thats her job and if she wasnt qualified they wouldnt have her doing it. then he went on about how she didnt remove anything.me-"did you ask her to remove anything?"dad-"no."me-"if it's not cancerous they probably won't remove it unless asked. you have to tell them."doesn't matter, he just keeps complaining. he insisted on going back and having her doublecheck his back and he asked her to remove a couple of them. he's still complaining, about everything. but finally talk to him and i ask why he wants a cosmetic procedure done to remove skin growths that aren't cancerous. he said he didnt want a cosmetic procedure done.fire out.he was faking not walking. that was a narcissistic game he plays. like when he used to tell me he was going to die soon. that was two years ago. i need to look up the meaning of the word 'soon'.so we are back to skin growths again. he tells me he has been meaning to do this for years etc etc etc...no he hasnt. he can never ever ever just be honest. he has to tell a story, all bs, and lead up to it and hoodwink the listener. now, he has to have all his skin growths removed, for cosmetic reasons, because the girl who wasnt a dermatologist didnt know what she was doing. he started to say and this time he wants a dermatologist but didnt finish. to be honest i dont know if medicare pays for cosmetic skin growth removal. he's far from rich. he thinks they just use a cream? anyone know if thats how its done. i'm more familiar with a scalpel or freezing. i advised he tell them exactly what he wants and ask exactly whats involved and will medicare cover it. i did offer to go in with him and he refused. so when he forgets to tell them exactly what he wants and starts complaining im just going to walk away.

Almost all my grandparents have some form of dementia and it sucks
my grandma on my dads side is my last living grandparent from that side and her health is badly deteriorating. several (maybe 6) years ago she was happy and fully there and knew everything a normal person would. she could walk and go up stairs. she had no signs of dementia and went to costco and bought all kinds of random stuff. now she’s suffering, especially in the past year. she stopped talking mostly and now just shouts random words.. not even words. just sounds. she puts her hand over her mouth and yells as loud as possible, spits at people, yells curse words she never knew before at caregivers (english is not her first language). she doesn’t even understand english anymore. she can’t form sentences. she starts to say “i want.” but is unable to finish her sentence and gets frustrated. she used to be so happy and she could talk perfectly in english. now she can’t have a conversation with anyone, and can’t express what she wants anymore. it’s sad and it makes me sad. she’s always yelling and there is no way to stop it. there is always someone staying with her at all times, whether it is a caregiver or one of my aunts (who are staying with her now). we can’t take her places because she screams and grabs and rips people’s hair and clothes. she has fallen several times over the past 10 years , has type 2 diabetes, pacemaker , and most recently she fell getting out of bed on her knees for several hours and my dad was sleeping and unable to hear her screams (he felt horrible). before we had caregivers she fell a couple times and was on the ground for hours and it makes me mad that nobody checked on her. we don’t even know what kind of dementia she has since she is so out of it and it is unlikely that they’ll be able to determine the type and severity anymore. just one year ago she remembered some things. i read to her and she could at least understand me. now she has no idea what my name is until i remind her. i think she remembers who i am just not my name.  she is 79 i think and overweight my grandpa on my moms side has lewy body dementia. he is rapidly deteriorating also. he’s had the condition for a few years now maybe 6 or 7 years but only now is it getting worse. he still remembers some such as a good amount from his youth and can still talk to people, but has random moments of delirium (is this the right word)? he yelled at my cousin to get out of his house as if he didn’t know who she is. he gets anxious often and cannot be without my grandma on that side. he is also hard of hearing which means repeating things a lot. he has tremors and has fallen before and will probably need a walker now. all of this hurts me so much. i wish i had spent more time with them while they were still cognizant. i’m going to see my grandpa tomorrow, he lives 2 hours away. i hope i can make memories with him even if he doesn’t remember them. whenever i see people’s family members without dementia who function just fine at 90 years old i get so envious and i wonder why my grandparents and family has to go through this. it fucking sucks and i won’t be able to bear it when they forget me completely or are fully out of it.

No Judgement from Memory Care Director!
so when my mil used to live in a senior living facility where they housed mostly independent/assisted living residents, my mil was cognitively the worst case in the whole building of over 200 residents. while the director there was a very patient &amp; good hearted person, she never understood why we didn't want to visit my mil more than twice a week. i felt judged every time i went to see my mil or to take her to doctor's offices, especially when my mil was losing weight constantly. they looked at me like, "do something already for this old/frail lady!".after having my mil poked/prodded every which way, we have turned her care into comfort care with the doctor's agmt, and moved her to memory care, and now things are a lot calmer now.the thing i appreciate the most is the memory care director's understanding of why we may not want to visit my mil more than 1-2 times a month. what's the point?! she is going to forget it in a day and we will be miserable for days after we spend an hour at the mc (are you usually too happy of a person? do your friends say you smile/laugh too much? well, go visit mc, you will be cured of that happiness disease instantly!!).this understanding frees us from the expectation i used to seeing in the previous facility staff's eyes.  here is the status update from the mc director today."i apologize for the late response. mary (not her real name) is settling in well. she seems to be slowly coming out of her shell. she does not often initiate conversations, but she will socialize with others when we get the conversation started. she is starting to come out of her room more and seems to be getting more comfortable. she gets along with all of our other residents. she occasionally packs up her belongings and says that she is going home, but is very easily redirected. we had mock margaritas and mexican food today for cinco de mayo, and she seemed to have a good time. we love having her here."for now we have peace. thank you!!

Family history, confusion, speech problems, memory loss. Could this be early onset dementia?
preface: i am under the care of a physician, psychotherapist, and a neurologist. i go for an mri and mra in a few days. female, mid-30s, active, healthy weight, no known health conditions. only current diagnoses: migraines, c-ptsd, anxiety, depression.family history: i watched my grandmother's mind deteriorate over her last few decades due to dementia.20+ year history of general and typical anxiety, depression, migraine symptoms.within the last 2 years, i've developed: visual and auditory hallucinations, sometimes unable to understand what people are saying, forgetfulness.within the last year, i experienced severe face nerve pain that started suddenly. i get lost in my home town - in an area where i know well, have lived for over three decades, and previously delivered mail. i forget where i'm going and what i'm doing. my speech slurs. i swap out words randomly without knowing it, for example, i'll say plate instead of tree, or bathtub instead of firetruck. my youngest child thinks its funny. i forget what i'm saying in the middle of speaking. i forget what i did on previous days - i take detailed notes for work and even upon reading my notes, i still sometimes cannot recall the day's events. i reread emails i've sent to coworkers and i often omit words, sometimes the emails make little sense. i forget things in even normal routines. i'll wash my hair three times in a row and forget to wash my body. my mental acuity is diminishing and i'm struggling. i look back and compare my work reports and emails from a year or two ago to what they are now and i can't even believe they're from the same person. my coworkers, domestic partner, my kids, and family are are starting to comment on my speech errors, memory, and how frequently i get lost while driving.my domestic partner looked genuinely heartbroken last night when he said that he knows where came from years ago when he met me to where i am now. so, now i'm a bit concerned....in your opinions.... does this sound like it could be early onset dementia?i mentioned these things to my psychotherapist, but we have other goals that take priority. i also mentioned these symptoms to my neurologist during our first appointment in february. i have upcoming testing. then i will have another follow-up with the neurologist in several months. i would just like to be prepared beforehand with any questions or concerns i could mention.thank you.

Does pseudo dementia cause brain damage?
hey guys, i just found this subreddit and i’m happy for it. i feel like we’re alone when it comes to this disease even if it’s a really common one.my mom has been having memory issues. she’s young, in her mid 50s. we have gone to multiple doctors and they haven’t been able to pinpoint exactly what’s her issue, they said it was a possible dementia illness. possible. now, i don’t know a lot of dementia and how it affects the brain, but i wanted to ask you guys before we go to another professional. is it possible she has pseudo dementia instead of dementia? because i’m reading that the former might be reversible. to give more details, her memory per se isn’t affected. it’s even better than mine. she remembers all events that have happened in her life perfectly. it’s just language related. she’s forgetting words, names and all of the that. besides that, she clearly has undiagnosed anxiety and depression, besides ocd and other issues. she has had them for as long as i remember. depression does run in the family as my grandma clearly also had undiagnosed depression and i probably also do. she is cooperative, tries to learn and is willing to go to the doctors and is aware that she has an issue. she has had scans done that showed what i said, that the part of the brain responsible for language is affected.i know you guys probably aren’t professionals and i’m not asking for professional help, just for some insight and your experience. should i consult it with another professional? how would a psychologist even treat someone whose language is affected? thanks guys

Advice for Possible Dementia Symptoms with Mom
hey there - i'm posting here because i feel like i have run out of ideas on how to handle my situation. any thoughts, advice, or feedback is appreciated.recently my mom, who is 73 and lives alone, has started saying there are people that come to her bedroom window at night and shine flashlights into her window, keeping her from sleeping. it got so bad that she now mostly sleeps in her living room.initially, i thought she was seeing things due to some changes the neighbors recently made with their landscaping, i.e. car lights were hitting her bedroom window differently/more visibly than before due to less foliage to block them.then, she said she specifically saw a man right outside of her bedroom window one night after she got enough courage to open her curtains when he was doing the flashlight thing. she described the appearance of the man, gave a full description. i looked around the wooded area where she said he was and the fence was bent and mangled, which made me think he hopped the fence, broke it, and that this wasn't a hallucination, but was something very real.i then put up a bunch of nest cams and trail cams around this wooded part of her yard trying to capture whoever was doing this on video. one night, she said it got so bad that she was so pissed off that she went outside to confront the "several people dressed all in black wearing black ski masks that are crawling around all over the property." i have video of her doing this at 1:30 am on the nest cam, bless her heart for being so brave. i asked her to send me the photo. she sends me the photo of what she claims shows the several people scattered about. there's nothing in the photo. there's nothing on the nest cams. i drove over there and checked the trail cams, nothing on them either.so then i shifted back to thinking this is all some sort of hallucination. thanks to 23andme, i know i have 2 copies of the apoe4 gene, which indicates--but does not necessarily guarantee--that i will get early onset alzheimer's. there is no family history of dementia or alzheimer's that i know of. but my mom has lived longer than most of her direct relatives, i.e. mother and father, grandparents, etc.i trimmed a lot of bushes around her bedroom window to help prevent any branches or things of that nature from swaying in the wind, causing some sort of optical illusion for her. after i did that, the activity stopped for a while. but this morning she told me they were back, and that they started as soon as she went back to bed. what she describes as "comic book people shining lights and doing the shimmy in the yard near her bedroom." i gently asked her to clarify what she means by "comic book people" and she said to forget she said that.clearly something is amiss here, and i am trying to cover all options in order to keep my mom safe in case there is some sort of nutcase shining a light into her bedroom window at night, but it is looking increasingly more likely that this is a hallucination and the beginning of something that could potentially get worse.if you were in my shoes, what would your next steps be?

Is this Dementia?
help?hello everyone,my mom is in the bit of a pickle. a friend of hers who’s gone through a lot emotional/physically has moved back and lives in an apartment nearby (her brother lives nearby but won’t answer his cellphone). she does not have very much to live on and until just recently my mother and i have noticed some behavioral problems with her. she shows up to my moms house unannounced and sometimes late (around 6 or 7) and stays for 3 hours. she forgets things and has received a ticket for $250 and went to the police station for (they thought she was drunk) speeding in a 25 doing 75. she spends and spends and spends and takes 3 hours to shop in a small store and spent $500 yesterday and $700 last week and the week before that another $500-$600 at homegoods. she buys people all kinds of stuff and we tell her to return it. she doesn’t answer her phone because she forgets where she puts it. she misses and forgets all her doctors appointments. she bought nutristsyem for one month even though she is not heavy and has gone $700 grocery shopping (for one person). my mom and i are really worried because we think she is being preyed on by solicitors (she’s 69). she lost her husband last year (he died at a nursing home). has been through emotionally breakdown before that and had to enter rehab. has been financially drained (a lawsuit that i won’t go into). and just got out of cancer treatments. we are very very concerned but are just her friends. we are wondering if she has dementia or something. we have tried to see if she would be interested in living in assisted living (she really needs help that we can’t provide), but won’t budge on that (i don’t blame her but she needs help). my mom is looking to help her to her doctors appt tomorrow but can’t go in due to hippa and her brother is mia. what should we do? we are concerned for her well being as well as worried about her driving. please be civilized.

Is It Common For Someone With Dementia to Not Fit Into Any "Stage"?
my grandmother is 88, she was formally diagnosed by her pcp with dementia about 1.5 years ago, we started noticing some minor issues maybe 2.5 years ago.  the thing is, she doesn't really fit into any of the "stages" of dementia.  if you go by the 7 stages, or just a more broad early, mid, late, she's all over the place with symptoms.  in the last few months there's been a handful of times she hasn't been able to recognize me, my mom, or my grandfather.  she doesn't think we're strangers, but confuses us with someone else.  two month ago i picked her up for a doctor's appointment around noon (usually she is very good at this time of day) and she thought i was her brother for the entire ride there.  on the way home though, she knew i was her grandson.  two weeks ago she thought my mom was her sister.  just last night, she woke up in the middle of the night and refused to believe my grandfather was her husband, she thought he was her father.  but in between those incidents, no problem.  she recognizes everyone just fine.  even this morning when i stopped by she knew exactly who i was, and was back to knowing who my grandfather was.  honestly, these more severe issues are an outlier.  i'd say 75% of the time she's relatively fine, and things come across are simply more age related forgetfulness that you would expect from someone who will be 89 in six months.  for example, if i go over when the news in on, we can talk about current events.  she knows what's going on, and she understands it.   the majority of the time it might just be mixing up what day it is, repeating some family gossip she already told me a few days before (so she still has the ability to make new memories), or screwing up while cooking dinner because she forgot something in a recipe.  on a day to day basis she gets dressed on her own, she cleans the house, she goes up and down from the basement to do laundry (though sometimes she forgets the right settings on the machine), she goes grocery shopping, and she even still writes out the checks to pay the bills when they come in the mail. but she's got these off and on periods of severe confusion, and her pcp has diagnosed her with dementia.  it just doesn't make any sense to me, and i've begged my grandfather to take her to a specialist or just *anyone* for a second opinion to make sure there isn't something else going on (maybe a medication issue) but he refuses.  not because he's an asshole, but he's just very old school.  their pcp of 30 years gave a diagnoses, she gets mad if he talks to her about her symptoms, so he just deals with the issues and placates her.  so i'm just wondering, maybe i'm in the wrong here, and something like this is common....the "stages" are more mixed and not rigid, and this is just a normal case of dementia.  it's just...."fishy" to me.  i want the best for my grandmother in her final years, and i feel like i'm the only family member who is researching this and not just accepting the opinion of a 75 year old pcp diagnosing an 88 year old with dementia and not looking into it further.

Serious selfharm to free myself from my caregiving duties
long story am very very sorry (and excuse my english). please respond if you can.i used to be a caregiver to my (recently deceased) beloved mother. she got injured and paralyzed in 2011. in 2015, she got cancer which ended up killing her about 2 months ago. she died with me in a foreign country where we performed her final surgery. due to covid, no funeral, and i still haven’t had a chance to grieve.also, i have been and still am the sole caregiver to my father. he cannot move. has a heart issues. and developed some serious dementia, which is now the main cause for my troubles. he forgets everything and keep asking for food and cover nonstop. his voice is so loud. so loud that our neighbors started complaining. i cannot eat, i cannot work (from home), and i cannot sleep. my siblings got married and only visit once a week. they are not helping and i’m so shy to ask, but i do tell them i’m not okay. they haven’t shown me they care.back to my father. he used to sexually harass me as a kid. i told my mom when i grew up, and she filed for divorce, but she got sick and never was able to go through. i chose to forgive him because he is sick now and i want to move on. however, on some days he starts insulting my deceased mother and me with very intense language i cannot tell it’s dementia or that he is just a bad person. he always hated me. but i know if i leave him even for one day he might die. he is so reliant on me now.i live in north africa— no access to nothing. i have exhausted all of my energy and resources and now i’m sitting with no options. my country is torn apart by war and covid. it’s pretty shitty in here.i can easily walk out of the door and leave. i won’t. i cannot do it. it is hard.the thought of ending my life has never looked more appealing. i feel it is my only escape. it feels stronger than gravity now.i’m sorry to everyone who invested time and energy in me in my previous posts. i love you and appreciate you.

Driven crazy by the demands of the caregiving role I’m playing. Even contemplating ending my own life.
i used to be one of the caregivers for my mother since 2011. she had cancer and she was paralyzed. she passed away two months ago. i am now the sole caregiver to my father who is also paralyzed and has dementia. lately his memory loss became unbearable. he forgets that he already ate breakfast and lunch and dinner but he keeps asking for them nonstop. he calls my name nonstop. i hear him call my name with a loud voice almost all day long and for the most part of the night. i cannot describe to you how that affected my life. i can’t eat i can’t sleep i can’t work [we are still working from home]. i can’t use noise canceling headsets although i have them because he would start yelling very loudly and the neighbors start to complain. i am too weak and too desperate to the point where i’m considering taking my own life. i haven’t even had a chance to grieve my mom. her death was a trumatic experience and we couldn’t even have a funeral. and now i am suffering because of what my father is doing. i completely understand dementia and i understand thats everything is out of his control. however i’m feeling hopeless. i’m contemplating into my own life as i’m writing my post. i hope to hear from people in my situation. how are you coping? please let me know. i am extremely desperate.

Lewy body with Alzheimer’s misery
my mom has gone majorly downhill the last year. she went from independent to not at all. sane to insane. spect scan shows mild dementia with lewy bodies but dr said symptoms can still be severe with mild brain results. anyway. her dad and sister had this. it was always our biggest fear and nightmare and now it’s here. if she only had this disease and was otherwise happy or carefree i could maybe deal. but she’s miserable. miserable. scared. depressed. aliens or ghosts are stealing her things and trying to hurt her. i mean she’s terrified and then gets mean. it’s awful. her being scared and miserable is way worse than any memory loss. i have her 4 days a week, sister 3. neither of us have the space time or money. sooner than later we won’t be able to care for her. most likely while she’s still with it. putting her in a facility if any kind will kill her. i know the moment that happens she’ll die or disappear. she’s on mirtazapin lexapro melatonin and gabapentin next week. what else can i do??? i can’t stand to see her miserable. i cook for her. we play games. watch movies. she’s got grandchildren at my sisters. we are doing everything we can to make her happy but she’s scared and miserable and angry. this is the worst.

My dad (71) fell for the third time this week tonight and I'm worried about how we will continue to care for his father (96) who has dementia
i'm 31, an only child, and my dad's sister is the biggest beeeeeeeeeeeetch on this side of...  forget it.  she's the biggest belcher in all the land.  i hate that woman.  she doesn't offer us a lick of help other than bookkeeping.  she acts like she does all this hard work for us, but i just want to scream in her stupid face.&amp;#x200b;anyway...  i work part-time, go to college part-time, and i'm trying to get back into my hobbies after many years away.  my life feels like it's simultaneously coming together and falling apart.  why?  **my dad fell again tonight.**  he's 71, he can't keep caregiving for his father forever.  he's supposed to be retired.  he's already had double hernia surgery from injuries sustained while caregiving.  who was supposed to care for both men?  **only me.**  dad's "sweet" sister just couldn't get away from work.  she haaaaaad to save up her vacation days so she could go the flippin' england.  that must be nice, donna, you clucking magpie.&amp;#x200b;we have help that comes in three days a week for four hours each, but i'm going to start pestering the mad aunt (who insists i call her "aunt donna" instead of "donna") to get more help in and for longer.  i don't care if this woman hates me.  she's already threatened to write me out of her will and i'm just hoping she does at this point.  i'd hate to have to go to her funeral.&amp;#x200b;we can't keep living like this.  i honestly wish my grandfather would just pass on already.  it's honestly in everyone's best interest.  let the man die with dignity still!  life is such a shit show.

Emotional and social neglect?
my grandma is 73 years old and was diagnosed with dementia cca a month ago.it all started being quite problematic a year ago when my town went into lockdown for a month. grandma is at that moment living with my uncle, aunt and cousin in a decent house with a really big yard but she got scared because of the virus so she didn't want to go out of the house, not even into the yard where she had some vegetables and flowers.she has a tv in her bedroom and she would watch mass/service (she's very religious) on it since she can't go to the church. the first ''weird'' thing was when she told us that the priests are coming into her room to hold mass and she even asked my uncle to give them a bottle of olive oil as a gift (for context: my family has olive trees and we are making our own olive oil). my first thought was that she probably fell asleep while watching the mass and was dreaming of those priests in her room. stuff like that continued but only with the priests, for example she said once that they are mad at her because she didn't sing and similar stuff. she even said that they asked her to be the next pope. now that i think of it it was alarming but back then i thought that the corona is driving us all nuts, that's she sleeps during half of the stuff she watches and we even told her that they can't see her or hear her to which she agreed. basically, she would say something ''weird'' and we would tell her ''grandma, it's not like that'' and it seemed that she understood it and that she was okay with it. also, maybe important to mention during the lockdown i didn't visit her because we were really cautious with all that virus stuff.the summer was as far as i know okay. she was always a piece of work and acting like a victim so even when she was a little bit off, for example not wanting to sit with all of us at the table i thought it's just her being her petty self but also, when i would talk to her she would remember my boyfriend, she would talk about my life with me, my job, etc. so i wasn't really worried and the stuff with the priests stopped.fats forward to a month ago:she started being very aggressive, especially towards my aunt. she never liked her. for context: my uncle was always ''the golden son'', he always got everything and she would even lock his bedroom and forbid my father to enter it when uncle was at work (back when they were younger) so maybe one of the reasons is being an ''overprotective mother'', one of the reasons for sure is because my aunt is from ''another town'' (we are actually a pretty small town, almost village and there was always that stupid rivalry between the villages), also maybe one of the reasons is because my grandmas house was always clean and tidy until my aunt came and she kinda became ''the boss'' (which my grandma started calling her for the last month, or even more) and the house honestly went to shit. it's always messy, they smoke with the windows closed, they got a big dog which sleeps in their bed and hangs out in the house which my grandma doesn't like, she (grandma) also bullied my cousin when she was smaller (i have no idea why, she does look a lot like my aunt, maybe that's why?). she would slap my aunt, call her names (after what a assume a while my aunt started provoking her when she would insult her which i think is not okay, you need patience with grandma?) she would scream, she would tell her friends and my family that they are beating her (which they didn't but they were maybe aggressive with her, uncle told me that he did grab her and sat her on the couch, after that she ran away), she would think that they locked her but she would actually lock herself and then she would bang on the door of her bedroom so once my cousin had to go trough the window to her room to unlock the door from inside because grandma didn't know where she put the keys, she would constantly cry that they took her money so my dad had to go every other day to my uncles to count the money that she would hide somewhere and then forget where it is, she would run away from her house. my whole family was searching for her one evening and she was hiding in a freaking bush watching them. after that they called an ambulance and she was pretty ''sane'' during the conversation with the medical staff. she would also ask my family if she can come and live at our house. so, after what i assume was 2-3 weeks my uncle decided to put her in a retirement home for people with dementia and similar. he did it so that he told her that they need to visit a doctor and he left her there. i don't think that is the way you treat your mother but this is all a new experience for me, that's why i'm writing to you guys.what i want to know is:my uncle and his family kinda neglected her? they always talked bad about her, whenever she would join them at the table they would roll their eyes, my cousin was always very rude to her, they never had patience with her even when she was mentally healthy. they did cook for her, they went to the doctors with her (well, they would leave her alone with the doctor but at least they would take her there) but she didn't have any positive emotional or social interaction with her. also, my cousin(s) (i have two of them from that family but the older one is not living with them anymore) and my aunt would always prais my aunt family side, my aunts family side was always their fave if that means anything in this case. i feel like my grandma didn't feel at home for quite some time. does all of this have anything to do with her state?my uncle didn't visit her since he put her in the retirement home, neither did my cousins, his comment when my father told him that my sister and i visited her was ''they don't allow visits''. i'm really disappointed in how our family relationship turned out but i'm more sad because of my grandma.my sister visited her last sunday, she said that she thought that she came to take her home but my sister told her that she can't do that without the doctors permision to which my grandma agreed. they talked for 2 hours (that's how long the visits are), even laughed but when i visited her she was a totally different person. she was ready with all her bags in the corridor of the retirement home, wanting to go home. she was just going left and right through the corridor, taking 2 bags from the pile to the other side of the corridor, coming back to the pile, taking a look at the other side of the corridor, noticing the other 2 bags there saying ''what are my bags doing there?'' and then grabing those 2 bags and puting them on the pile again and it continued for 45 minutes. after that i realized i won't be able to sit down with her and talk to her so i left home. that night she wanted to escape through a window and she even hit the nurse. i don't know is it smart to visit her again? are we having a bad inffluence on her or is it better to visit her as much as we can? they said if she continues like that, that they'll have to send her to a psychiatry permantently (she already was after the second night there but they brought her back to the retirement home after a few days of observing)i'm just really heartbroken and don't know how to cope with all of this. i'm just waiting for a big fight to burst out between our families.

Funny thing about Mom
mom passed 3 years ago the 13th at 94 years of age and is on my mind. she was sweet like mother teresa until you threatened her family. for a small woman she was pretty tough. the last few years she suffered increasing alzheimers and i suspect dementia. she had oodles of energy til the end. they had a banker named jaime, super nice guy. mom called him hymen. couldnt get her to say jaime. it was always hymen no matter what. i explained it and she just stared at me lol. "yea, hymen". trips to the bank were fun lol. i moved back thanks to a job change and very glad i did. i was needed. mom withdrew from the outside world a year after i came back. she forgot most of cooking and she was always excellent. so i took over more and more of chores, until i did all the shopping etc. she quit her library club and no matter how hard dad tried she wouldnt go back. dad was dead wrong. you dont ever force them to do anything. then when dad was in rehab hospital mom tried to drive out to see him and got lost. dad always had to have a shortcut, feeling that made him special. it was a very simple drive and he confused her and she got lost. thank god she found her way home but it scared her so bad she never left the house again. i wish i could get a do-over now that i know more. this society does not prepare us to help people or ourselves with aging issues. if you're wondering if your loved one or friend suffers from an aging disease get some answers. do some research. if they act a bit odd or you dont understand then they may need help. never think theyre being lazy or dumb or mean. thats not it. most of us will suffer near the end with this. be patient and compassionate. most importantly its simple things like a hug or a call or just spending some time. mom loved arranging flowers. i would get her a bouquet from work and she would arrange and rearrange them for a couple weeks. its the little things. its looking into their heart and playing a string. you can reach them if you try. just dont ever have regrets.theres a big rose bush outside the dining room window. moms roses. she would sit and watch the birds and love the flowers. the day after she passed it had more roses on it than id ever seen. its been through so much bad weather the past 3 years and we thought we lost it during the winter storm here in tx. but i trimmed it and its coming back strong.

Anger, confusion, loss of respect
this is more of a rant but also sharing my experience to help others.  my grandma is 87, has dementia from alzheimer’s.my grandma moved in with me, my wife and my son because the assisted living place she was at managed to get everyone, people living there and also nurses/ workers sick with covid, to the point that they had to hire an outside company to come take care of people living there. my grandma ended up in the hospital for 2 months.  so my wife and i opened our home to her because she had nowhere else to go and we wanted her to be in a safe place.  i do not work so i became her caregiver.  everything i do is based on her and what she is doing. my life literally revolves around her, her confusion, and her depression.  we have changed everything in our home to make her life better, painting a bedroom, buying her furniture, installing a chair lift, giving her our master bathroom to shower in because it’s a walk in shower and would be safer for her. yes we knew things like this would come up and would need to be done. i want to stress that we agreed to take this on and help her as best we can. today started out great, my mom came over to help her shower and get her dressed, then her hospice nurse came to check her out for her weekly check up and things were going great.  recently we noticed that my grandma has been having terrible days after she was out for 4 plus hours driving with my mom the day before.  she would barely know who i was, didn’t know where she lived, and constantly saying i don’t know what i’m doing all while crying her eyes out because she thought she lived alone and didn’t have money or food.  well we told the nurse about this and she said that is very common for dementia patients and that it’s possible she had too much stimulation the day before and suggested we do only and hour or two out on drives or being away from her home (my home). so the nurse leaves and we start having a nice conversation about the weather getting nice and that the tree are changing and she will have some really pretty views on her drives. then i made the comment about her only being able to go out for 1 or 2 hours because of the horrible next day she has, she said that’s not enough time to do anything and also said so that means i’m not going on any more vacations? she hasn’t been on a vacation in years, probably 5-10 years.  she did not like the our answer when we said no.  i added, grandma you’re 87 years old and you can barely make it to the steps without passing out. keep in mind my mom and i were keeping calm the whole time and trying to have a normal conversation with her.  she blew up and started yelling, started telling us she isn’t going to be told that she can’t do anything. my mom and i looked at each other and were confused. she started screaming at us telling us she will do whatever she wants and we can’t stop her and we attempted to calm her down but there was no stopping her.  she eventually started calling me names and telling me i’m a piece of shit but with nicer words only because she doesn’t cuss much. that’s when my mom stepped in and got on her for acting like that and calling me names etc.. she then stood up and got in my moms face and telling her get move and not to get into her face but my grandma was the one who got up and got in my moms face.  that’s when i told her sit down and shut up because my nine year old can hear her acting like a nine year old. after some more arguing she went upstairs to her room. we let time pass and gave her the agitation medicine we have for her. after 30-40 minutes she came back downstairs and asked for food, i got it for her and she sat in her chair and after two minutes she started again.  talking about things that had nothing to do with the last conversation, telling us we are horrible people, that she is going to find somewhere else to live because apparently my constant caretaking of her wasn’t enough. she said that i told her to get out of my house when i actuallly said grandma if you continue to do this, act like this and scream then you will have to leave because my son can hear this and i won’t put up with him having to hear this and get upset because of this behavior.  so she took that as get the fuck out now and she held onto that but could not remember anything else about the conversation except that we were treating her poorly. which it honestly was the other way around, we have learned to just agree with her nonsense talking and “plans of vacation” etc.... but this time we were trying to inform her that the next day out she has will be shorter...so we were doing our best to stay calm and it just didn’t help.  then my wife stepped in and she told my grandma who started screaming and yelling again that she needed to shut up and go to her room upstairs until she calms down because our son can hear all this.  my grandma then threatened her by saying i really like you so don’t make me hate you and my wife said enough go to your room and calm down.  my grandma screamed at her to shut the hell up.  that’s when i lost it and screamed “stop” so loud it made everyone jump. (i rarely ever get mad and have never been this mad in my life) after i did this she got in my face telling me to get out of her face and i was so angry i didn’t just let it go like i should have and told her she was the one who stood up and got in mine so if you don’t want me in your face then move. that’s when she started getting in my moms face and then started walking towards my wife, i stepped in front of her and then my wife said this is enough, go to your room. eventually she did after us repeating that our son can hear her which scared her because she doesn’t want him to see her upset or mad etc... then after some time of calming my mom down and my wife trying to cool me down and trying to figure out what the hell happened she started to come back down but kept her head down and asked for food. i put my nice, caregiver, grandson face on and took her some food, she took her medicine, and after 30 minutes i went back up to get her plate and she was back to normal and acted like nothing happened.  so we are stuck knowing what happened and feeling bad or upset or mad while she gets to just forget it all and not know if anything happened at all.  how does this help anyone? well i understand people may lose their cool sometimes, they may get frustrated and angry, but remember it’s pointless. in my case i only ended up making myself feel upset and same with my mom and wife. i knew just to always agree with her and move onto the next topic because she won’t remember what she said anyway, but this time i let my anger get the best of me and in the end i lost, my wife lost, and my mom lost because we have to deal with every horrible thing she said to us and us getting angry with her. now i have to move on knowing how horrible she was to me after i have changed my entire life for her and continue to care for her while she gets to go back to a normal day for her. tldr:grandma went off on us after trying to explain how to help her with confusion after going out for the day before. in the end we lost, we are hurting, we are upset and she remembers nothing.

My dad: ApoE4+, COVID-related cerebrovasculitis
i know in my heart my dad has vascular dementia. i am a medical student in a family full of md's. we all agree.  he got covid in april and subsequently has descended into severe behavioral changes with cognitive decline. he is forgetting very basic things.  he has cerebral vasculitis confirmed by mri angiogram (post-covid).  he started cheating on my mom in june with a 35 year old (a few years older than me - his youngest daughter), divorced her in december after 33 years of marriage, moved to another state, and cannot keep a job due to angry outbursts. he is getting paranoid. he keeps thinking he can manage this with hyperbaric chambers and supplements. his reality testing is intact - he knows something is wrong - but refuses to take the appropriate treatment measures. &amp;#x200b;the absolute hardest part is that my dad is and was so abusive. at 8: he threw baskteballs at me, physically abused me, made me live with a 16 year-old-exchange student despite catching him in my room in the middle of the night. he did not kick him out until he was caught being inappropriate with his friends 7 year old daughter. he would shake me and throw me as a kid. he bruised my 4'11" year old sister. he made her eat pasta until she vomitted as punishment. he held  my foot in hot water while i cried because i "need to recover as fast as possible so i could play basketball." at physical therapy he turned the tens unit up as high as it could go on me and refused to turn it down despite my crying to please make it stop. he kicked me out of the house for telling the carpet cleaner to clean the wrong carpet. i went to drug rehab and he taunted me about how he never read the letters i wrote him. he financially and emotionally abused my mother. most people say i got the worst of it. he was obsessed with me playing basketball growing up. his favorite method of punishment was public humiliation. he would constantly threaten to abandon me. he was such a cruel father. he told me that all men would ever want from me is sex. in response to my sobriety, he has frequently told me that i shouldnt expect a congratulations for doing what i am supposed to do. when i moved back in with my parents after divorcing my abusive ex-husband, he mocked me for being afraid him of murdering me and made a rule that i should not talk about the divorced around him because i should just "get over it." he left me alone with coach known for preying on teenage girls. even after i told him i did not want to see him because he called me to drink with him. he tricked me into seeing him during a home visit from rehab. when i told him about being sexually assaulted and harrassed by a coworker he told me - i will never find a perfect working environment. trauma does not disappear because of his dementia. it does not undo all of the terrible things he did to me as a child. i do not want to live life in regret that i should or could have done more to help him but i also don't want to endanger my sobriety and mental health (bipolar disorder) by forcing myself into a positiion that re-traumatizes me and harms me. my mother is a saint and has said she will do what she can (go with him to doctors, help him get into a home if needed, etc.) because he is our father. sometimes i wish that he would just go away forever and end everyones suffering including his own.

i 23 (f) have been caring for my grandma since i was 16. she lived by herself until i had to suddenly move her into a nursing home last year. for about 6/7 years, i took care of her errands/doctors visits at least once a week. whenever i had travel plans, i would arrange a neighbor or friend to bring her food and her meds. around the time the pandemic hit last year, i had to go over 2-4 times a week (she lived an hour away) to meal prep and take care of her daily needs. i was paid in lunch meals and coffee. she never really learned english, became a retired housewife at 40, and hasn’t driven a car in 5 decades. so when my grandpa passed away several years ago, she became completely reliant on me, even though i had to finish high school, started college, worked 30+ hours a week in 3 part time jobs, had internships, finished college early and graduated with a masters degree a semester early too. i thought her decline in cognition was a normal part of aging until she had a diabetic seizure (turns out she wasn’t taking her meds like i thought, i think she was tossing them away or something) and the hospital informed me they were diagnosing her with vascular dementia. thank god before things got bad i had her sign a poa and started diving into her finances when she was officially diagnosed with dementia because it occurred to me she maybe wasn’t paying her bills. i found huge credit card debits, helocs, loans, no savings etc etc. i also found she stashed her bills into a drawer and was on the verge of having all her services cut off because she simply forgot to pay her bills. i caught her up to date on everything and consolidated her high interest credit card debt and quickly paid it off. now, after her diagnosis, all of her strange habits from about january 2020 - november 2020 made sense. however, she was put in rehab care for her seizure and i had to quickly scramble to figure out what to do. this is where i’m still having trouble coming to terms with what i had to do. i decided to sell her home of 30 years, the house i sort of grew up in, and most of her possessions because i realized, i could not live in and take care of her daily needs full time. i have zero medical training, and am starting my professional career in a cutthroat field. my student loans prevent me from not working too. well, i was unemployed twice in the middle of everything, but i’m putting all my remaining energy into finding a new job atm. she also fell in a sticky position where she could not afford a live in caretaker in our state on her social security, but did not financially qualify for assistive services or welfare because her social security is too high... the irony. the other stressor was that her home sold in 11 days, and i had one weekend to sell everything. my grandma couldn’t afford an estate sale company, so i spent a solid 72 hours on pure adrenaline selling furniture and all the crap she was semi-hoarding. her extra clothes, photo albums, family docs, and a few china sets are currently piled in my closet. i have now set up her nursing home to be paid for the next three years on private pay thanks to the sale of her home and estate and then she will be on government assistance. she doesn’t even remember her home anymore, and thinks she’s in 1944 in her home country... it’s currently wwii. why am i here? i think i was led to this reddit group because i’m looking for comfort. my grandmas only child, my dad, is incapable of helping because of his addictions. my mom has accompanied me to a few things, and acted as an official translator for my grandmas native language twice, but legally has no role. my sibling is a cancer survivor, and so i can’t give her any responsibilities because most of it involves hospitals, and she understandably has severe anxiety around anything medical and is too young to understand the severity of the finances. any other relatives are long dead or assholes living in another country. i won’t inherit anything because if anything is left over from the nursing home, it will go straight to my father, who will not be giving the inheritance to us. and even if he wanted to, he owes thousands to debtors who will be seizing it all. sadly my grandparents did not set up any protections for me and my sibling against our dad. yes, i have consulted three separate attorneys. it is too late. my grandma’s dementia is getting much worse, but physically she will be living for a long time. she is now seeing her other son who died at birth as a ghostly toddler hanging around her nursing home. she also had a full conversation to “something” standing next to her the other day when i had a window visit. i have chills thinking about it because she talked into the air, and jumped as if someone had brushed against her. i could see the whole room around her, nobody was there. her face turned different and her eyes were not hers for about 20 seconds. she also sees her mom sitting on her bed every night. thank you for reading.

Trying to figure out if my mom has dementia
my mom is 73. she has always said things to my sisters and i like “i know your dad is cheating” or “your aunt is trying to get money from us” we have heard these things over and over for so many years. the last couple of years things have slowly started getting worse. last year around september she called me and said “your dad told me he wants a divorce, he has another woman and he is leaving me” i asked questions and then it came out that he never actually said those things. i didn’t ask my dad because he’s a jerk and i knew he would yell at my mom if he knew she called. at this time i had no idea that my mom was having back pain and i’m still unclear as to wether she was on pain meds at this time. my sister went and said she was taking medicine and acting “bat shit crazy” so they went to a different doctor, got different meds that my sister decided my mom couldn’t take. my mom ended up getting a spinal block and we thought she would be better (she had a panic attack about a week after she called and told me my dad wanted a divorce). my mom has been having crying spells since at least september where she is just sitting there and starts crying and asking my dad if he wants a divorce and bringing up that she hates his family and different people in his family did this or that to her 50 years ago. she had a very traumatic experience when she was 19 or 20 and she’s bringing that up but the story she’s always told is now a little different. she passed out about a month ago and she had blocked arteries and had surgery. one was cleared but they couldn’t get the other one. these arteries run up her back the surgeon said that could be the cause of the emotions and memory loss (she only has memory loss like my dad will say something to her and 5 minutes later she doesn’t remember what he said). the surgery hasn’t helped her as far as emotions or anything so now we are trying to figure out how to help her. she’s almost having panic attacks because she’s so upset. she’s lost 30lbs also. she’s been to a neurologist and he said she has no dementia and seems fine but they scheduled her a memory test. she also had an mri. i’m really desperate to help her and i posted on fb and they think it’s dementia and said i need to get a second opinion. she doesn’t go into an episode of thinking she is in her past at all. she just talks about her past as if she just can’t let these things go.she doesn’t seem to forget her past or even who anyone is. she doesn’t forget where she is. she does not remember what the doctors say at her appointments or where she put her glasses. she is on a cholesterol medication and klonopin. she also takes vitamins. i know this is a lot of info but i’m trying to be thorough.does this sound like dementia? depression and anxiety? could it be that she’s just afraid she is getting closer to death and she scared? i just don’t know what to do to help her.

My dad with dementia got ahold of an edible, it wasn't good!
i'm so beyond my breaking point it's not even okay. so sunday my sister was watching my dad and there was a show on about cookies, my father's a diabetic and unfortunately forgets he eats and will continue to engorge himself and end up with blood sugar scores of like 400. so we had to lock up the sweets, well my sister went to the bathroom and he somehow found some old cookies, chocolate cookies made with blueberry kush distillate, 90% thc. they weren't eaten because the terpenes in the distillate were so overwhelming, and please i really don't need to hear that i need to just keep this stuff locked up. my whole damn house is under lock and key, sometimes things just fall thru the cracks and these things were hella old. well sunday we think around 7 or 8pm is when he got ahold of them, around 9pm he reported feeling dizzy so we checked his sugar but it was normal but still have him a snack and he went to sleep.monday was just scary hell. he woke up and he couldn't even walk. before i go any further and have to fight off all these weed snobs trying to tell me there's no way it lasted as long as it did, my father's health problems include having a shunt in his brain and not getting enough oxygen to his brain as he should, he has heart problems, kidney problems, and numerous mental problems other than the dementia. he was mumbling and hallucinating sort of, like pointing at stuff that wasn't there etc and wasn't enunciating his words as well so i figured maybe it was his shunt failing or a seizure. we gave him his pills but that just made him worse, now remember we had no idea he gotten ahold of some edibles. i called 911 and they took him to the hospital, they did the standard tests and whatnot. few hours later they had me pick him up and i expected to see him back to normal. nope. he started screaming like a bay he had to shit so i had the nurses take him to do that while i read his discharge paperwork. first page i saw was "cannabis use disorder" and thought it was a mistake. but there was "reasons being seen today: dehydration &amp; marijuana smoking" then his labs every drug tested negative except for cannabis and it dawned on me what happened. he was still unable to walk and we put him to bed right at what we think the 24 hour mark would've been of him ingesting it. finally the next day he was back to normal except for feeling a little groggy, and he did lose his balance and fell once. he's been fine since, and yes i did have another post explaining this for those wondering. i had to delete it and rewrite it because some idiots wanted to try and tell me it wasn't possible for my dad to be high after 3 days. then i wasted precious time trying to explain it was technically over a period of two days but only 24 hours, and he still felt weird on the third day.  i get this is reddit, but don't try an invalidate the hell i just went thru or take my post as the opportunity to brag about your cannabis knowledge because i'm no noob myself.

My dad with dementia somehow found an edible
what an ordeal that was, 3 days of things being abnormal. i love with my father, 72, who despite what he says has pretty extensive dementia. so sunday night he was watching a show about cookies with my sister (she also caregiver for him, we all live together so we can always watch him/keep an eye on him). now he's one of those dementia patients who gets violent when you tell them they're not allowed to do something or can't do it; such as he has an obsession about wandering and leaving the house and he obsesses about eating food. the medication that controls his violent fits is what's making him hungry, but he's a type 2 diabetic and he can't just eat junk all the time. my sister and i locked up the sweets. anyways my sis went to the bathroom, my dad did some digging around the kitchen, and found a potent marijuana edible. he took it not realizing it was medicated. around 7pm that evening he mentioned feeling lightheaded so we checked his blood sugar and gave him some food. after a few hours no improvement so he wanted to go to bed, we had to push him in a wheelchair to his bed which is very abnormal as he can still walk. i figured by morning he will be better. wrong! my sis and i had no clue he had an edible the entire time too.he couldn't walk, he was giggling, talking or rather mumbling nonsensical stuff, and was hallucinating so i sent him to the emergency room. i figured ok they'll get him fixed up and they'll figure out what's wrong so when i went to pick him up i was shocked to see him still so fucked up. he started screaming he had to shit so i had the nurses go handle that while i went thru his discharge paperwork like results of his labs and stuff. i notice a page that says cannabis use disorder and i thought maybe the doctor stuck it in there by accident...well his labs even said he tested positive for thc, then it all began to make sense. there were these really old nasty cookie edibles that have been burried under some cabinets for a long time and everyone had forgotten about them. my dad just probably thought oooo something sweet not realizing they were medicated.i can laugh about it now that he's back to normal and there was no harm done, but man was he a major pain in the butt for two days. even the day after the hospital he fell once because he was still tipsy. the edible was made with marijuana distillate which was like 90% thc instead of just making it with  marijuana bud which is usually only like 20% thc so he was bakes for days. i threw the cookies out and went on a mission for finding hidden treasures in the cabinets, that way i can know what we have in all our cabinets and know with certainty he won't get into anything like that again.

Something weird happened today..
today was supposed to be an exciting day. nov 1st we had a water leak from the upstairs bathroom to my moms floor. the floors had to be ripped out and the walls dried. sadly, all of my moms stuff including her furniture were put in storage. so she ended up moving  upstairs to the toddler room, liked it, and forgot  she even lived downstairs. i’d ask her over and over if she remembered living downstairs and she didn’t get it. well today was the day when all of her stuff was brought back, my husband and i after 4 months would share a room again. no more mom in the kids room! she was excited and we really got a lot of stuff done. however by 4:00pm her attitude changed drastically and she was very angry at me because she had to move downstairs. fine. i get it. it’s the dementia i told myself. however she went into this catatonic state. basically paralyzed on her bed. she wouldn’t make eye contact. staring off into space. she was unable to talk. at first i thought she was just ignoring me but then i realized something was wrong. i started shaking her gently to snap her out of it and gave her water and orange juice which she had a hard time swallowing at points. this was scary. she moaned very slowly that she wanted to die. not the first time she has said this. she’s made comments like this for many years under stress and anger but the way she said it was worrisome. very slow and slurred. now i’m left reading and wondering if she had a small stroke or something?!!!!! i’ve never head of tias. i’m going to call the doctor tomorrow. i’m wondering if all of today’s activity, stress, and anxiety of moving to a “new room” did something to her?!! it lasted about 10 minutes. when i asked she said she felt very bad and strange like she was drowning. what the heck?

my grandma is giving up...but I cant understand and don't accept it
forgive me if this is me rambling but i need advice. my grandmother is 89 years old. she was 1 of 7 kids, but now she and her brother are the only 2 left. my grandfather (her husband) died 7 years ago so she was living on her own. she doesn't drive and was dependent on her brother, son (my father) and daughter (my aunt) to care for her, picking her up, go grocery shopping etc. as she got older and more forgetful she was too stubborn to go into assisted living, and we couldn't afford an aid. subsequently, my parents sold their house to move into hers and take care of her. they've been living there for 5 months. my father and mother are still working full time and do the best they can. my grandmother was not happy about the situation but there was no other alternative available. my parents were forced to invade her space and its cause a lot of turmoil. my grandmother's short term memory is shot, she forgets what she has eaten for lunch, lies that she has eaten when she hasn't. she refuses to drink water and only drinks instant coffee. if it's not us forcing and fighting her to eat she is eating sweets. she can't allow anyone to take care of her except my aunt and my sister (the angels in the family). she fabricates and makes up stories that my father is yelling at her or hurting her, and it creates this aura that is just depressing and negative in the house. living in the house she is always making sure to watch over my mother like a hawk. she does not trust my mom to do laundry, to cook. to clean (my mom is in her 60's). mt grandmother constantly wears the same clothing, which is 4 sizes too big, it doesn't fit her so she rolls the waist up and the cuffs up on her pants to fit. she constantly says "i'm next" as if she is going to die next. her memory loss results in her being hypersensitive to situations. she cries and is depressed and doesn't really try anymore.  it came to a head today when we were together. in the past we bought her 4 pairs of pants that fit her that would replace the jeans that are too big on her. we constantly say "where are the pants we bought you to wear that fit why are you wearing pants that don't fit you." she was eating cookies and refusing to eat dinner. i said to her that she always complains that she's tired or doesnt feel good but why do you think that is, because you don't eat right and refuse to eat things that are good for you and your not wearing clothes that fit you. she goes "well it doesn't matter because im giving up" and then i said why are you saying that why are you giving up, she goes because all you do is say i'm not dressing the right way and i don't eat the right things and i can't do anything and she stormed to her room and stayed there. i understand that i can seem as if i am berating her and to just leaver her alone and let her do her thing but when she is left alone to do her own thing she starts fires in the house on the stove, eats melted microwaved plastic etc. my parents are tired emotionally dealing with her stubbornness, we cant hire an aid and i she said she will never let an aid into her house, she wont leave her house, she wont accept help. she makes me feel like shit because i feel badly that she's upset making me feel like i did something wrong because shes not taking care of herself. the only happy medium is when her daughter comes or my sister comes for a visit but thats only for a few hours. can anyone give me advice on what we can do because there's no logical reasoning going on for to have valid conversations anymore.

An essay I'm currently writing on Dementia, feedback requested.
hello, i'm working on writing a paper for school based around dementia. i havn't written a paper in years and i wanted to share what i have thus far. all of this is based around my personal experiences and what i've picked up on working with patients/residents who are suffering from dementia. after a few years of work experience in a couple nursing homes i am looking to use what i have learned to hopefully shine some light on what dementia is and how to interact and assist those who are affected.i have not had a chance to look up and fact check any of this yet as it's all just off the top of my head and annecotdal experience but i'm curious what some people who have family members with dementia think. thank you for your time, here's what i have so far._______they're are many different types of dementia with 70% of cases being diagnosed as alzheimers while their is also lewy body dementia (dlb-dementia with lewy body), and vascular dementia. it is most common after the age of 65 but can happen in even earlier years, exessive alcohol intake is known to damage the pre-frontal cortex overtime which can lead to dementia even sooner such as in your 50's.dementia is a vast spectrum, every case of dementia is particularly unique to the individual as it is a very wide spectrum of both symptoms and behaviour stemming from the nature of the illness being brain failure in different regions of the brain. depending on which areas begin to shutdown will affect the behaviour of the patient, such as if the pre-frontal cortex is failing then executive functioning will suffer and the patient may start to have trouble communicating as well as staying focused on tasks.dementia is a blanket term that describes the progressive loss of brain function and issues may arise with simple tasks such as brushing teeth or remembering to flush the toilet as well complex tasks like remembering dates and managing money.dementia starts off slow and only  progressesivly worsens with age and time, never improving. although symptoms such as hallucinations, aggression and agitation can be managed with medication there is no known  reverse or cure currently. they're other ways besides medication that can help reduce symptoms such as music to help soothe the mind. appreciation and recognition of music is thought to be one of the last aspects of the mind to falter. often times people with dementia love listening to old time classics they enjoyed in their youth, and it is not uncommon for quiet classical music to be played when a resident is palliative and nearing end of life. converserly a quiet environment can also help reduce stress, as sensory overload from too much going on can be disorientating. physical contact like handholding when escorting someone somewhere can reaffirm a feeling of connection. although care must be taken as some residents/patients may be physically strong and unable to control their impulses and accidentally or intentionally hurt you. being a careaide has one of the highest risks of recieving injury, even greater than say being a police officer, a tree faller, a security bouncer etc. having a toy like say a baby doll, can help comfort the eldery as well having a tactile object to hold can help distract them as well as potentially bring back memories of a time when they had to nurture their own youth. a warm blanket can be a very powerful tool as when someone ages blood flows slower throughout the body causing many residents to be in a perpetual state of feeling chilled sometimes with even many layers of clothing on. some residents may prefer more simple shows such as cartoons intended for children as the plot is easier to follow, as well as shows about nature such as planet earth where there is no plot to follow but is instead relaxing.giving a resident with dementia small simple tasks can help stimulate their mind which helps slow the progression of the disease and give feelings of accomplishment. tasks such as folding laundry, or collecting dirty dishes or say setting a table for dinner can make a resident feel valuable/useful. we never lose our desire for agency, and oftentimes without a purpose we can fall prone to depression. this is still very true and perhaps even more relevant when one has a mental illness such as dementia. it is not uncommon for people with dementia to fall into depressive tendencies so we must make an effort at all times to help enrich their lives and remind them they are loved and not a burden.it's important to try and include someone with dementia in day to day living and still treat them as if they are an adult, even if parts of their mind is failing. ask how their day is going, if they like the weather outside, what type of food do they like, while remembering to try and keep the questions simple without much nuance.we can easily fall victim to assuming we are an authority figure over these people due to their constant need for care, such as needing help with showering, eating and having their meals cooked, changing clothing, being escorted to bed, etc. though the truth is that while we are their guardians and caregivers they are still an adult with their own sense of autonomy and while we may be at a job and in a hurry to complete it, this is their home and with that their progression of time will feel vastly different than ours.we can not forget these people have lived a very long life and still want to be treated with the dignity of being an adult. a mistake i often see is people saying the job is just like taking care of babies, or is as simple as "wiping someone's ass", this is a fallacy as a baby is fresh and new to the world, while an eldery person has been around a very long  time, longer than the caregiver for certain.in order to facilitate communication it is important to keep conversation simple and to the point. avoid long winded explanations and instead approach the patient in a calm and quiet manner and refer to the resident by their name as the name is one of the last things generally forgotten. ask yes or no questions and remember that body language is 80% of communication, so maintain eye contact and be assertive while speaking loudly, as much of the time they will be hard of hearing and ask you to repeat yourself. it's important to remain calm at all times and understand it may take rephrasing of questions in order to effectively get your point across.with the limited brain functions of the patient we need to not take things personally, we have no idea what is really going on in someone's mind and an outburst of rage may simply be because of a misunderstanding. _____i need to edit this quite a bit and move stuff around but i'm on my phone and waiting until i get on my laptop

An essay I'm currently writing on Dementia, feedback requested.
hello, i'm working on writing a paper for school based around dementia. i havn't written a paper in years and i wanted to share what i have thus far. all of this is based around my personal experiences and what i've picked up on working with patients/residents who are suffering from dementia. after a few years of work experience in a couple nursing homes i am looking to use what i have learned to hopefully shine some light on what dementia is and how to interact and assist those who are affected.i have not had a chance to look up and fact check any of this yet as it's all just off the top of my head and annecotdal experience but i'm curious what some people who have family members with dementia think. thank you for your time, here's what i have so far._______they're are many different types of dementia with 70% of cases being diagnosed as alzheimers while their is also lewy body dementia (dlb-dementia with lewy body), and vascular dementia. it is most common after the age of 65 but can happen in even earlier years, exessive alcohol intake is known to damage the pre-frontal cortex overtime which can lead to dementia even sooner such as in your 50's.dementia is a vast spectrum, every case of dementia is particularly unique to the individual as it is a very wide spectrum of both symptoms and behaviour stemming from the nature of the illness being brain failure in different regions of the brain. depending on which areas begin to shutdown will affect the behaviour of the patient, such as if the pre-frontal cortex is failing then executive functioning will suffer and the patient may start to have trouble communicating as well as staying focused on tasks.dementia is a blanket term that describes the progressive loss of brain function and issues may arise with simple tasks such as brushing teeth or remembering to flush the toilet as well complex tasks like remembering dates and managing money.dementia starts off slow and only  progressesivly worsens with age and time, never improving. although symptoms such as hallucinations, aggression and agitation can be managed with medication there is no known  reverse or cure currently. they're other ways besides medication that can help reduce symptoms such as music to help soothe the mind. appreciation and recognition of music is thought to be one of the last aspects of the mind to falter. often times people with dementia love listening to old time classics they enjoyed in their youth, and it is not uncommon for quiet classical music to be played when a resident is palliative and nearing end of life. converserly a quiet environment can also help reduce stress, as sensory overload from too much going on can be disorientating. physical contact like handholding when escorting someone somewhere can reaffirm a feeling of connection. although care must be taken as some residents/patients may be physically strong and unable to control their impulses and accidentally or intentionally hurt you. being a careaide has one of the highest risks of recieving injury, even greater than say being a police officer, a tree faller, a security bouncer etc. having a toy like say a baby doll, can help comfort the eldery as well having a tactile object to hold can help distract them as well as potentially bring back memories of a time when they had to nurture their own youth. a warm blanket can be a very powerful tool as when someone ages blood flows slower throughout the body causing many residents to be in a perpetual state of feeling chilled sometimes with even many layers of clothing on. some residents may prefer more simple shows such as cartoons intended for children as the plot is easier to follow, as well as shows about nature such as planet earth where there is no plot to follow but is instead relaxing.giving a resident with dementia small simple tasks can help stimulate their mind which helps slow the progression of the disease and give feelings of accomplishment. tasks such as folding laundry, or collecting dirty dishes or say setting a table for dinner can make a resident feel valuable/useful. we never lose our desire for agency, and oftentimes without a purpose we can fall prone to depression. this is still very true and perhaps even more relevant when one has a mental illness such as dementia. it is not uncommon for people with dementia to fall into depressive tendencies so we must make an effort at all times to help enrich their lives and remind them they are loved and not a burden.it's important to try and include someone with dementia in day to day living and still treat them as if they are an adult, even if parts of their mind is failing. ask how their day is going, if they like the weather outside, what type of food do they like, while remembering to try and keep the questions simple without much nuance.we can easily fall victim to assuming we are an authority figure over these people due to their constant need for care, such as needing help with showering, eating and having their meals cooked, changing clothing, being escorted to bed, etc. though the truth is that while we are their guardians and caregivers they are still an adult with their own sense of autonomy and while we may be at a job and in a hurry to complete it, this is their home and with that their progression of time will feel vastly different than ours.we can not forget these people have lived a very long life and still want to be treated with the dignity of being an adult. a mistake i often see is people saying the job is just like taking care of babies, or is as simple as "wiping someone's ass", this is a fallacy as a baby is fresh and new to the world, while an eldery person has been around a very long  time, longer than the caregiver for certain.in order to facilitate communication it is important to keep conversation simple and to the point. avoid long winded explanations and instead approach the patient in a calm and quiet manner and refer to the resident by their name as the name is one of the last things generally forgotten. ask yes or no questions and remember that body language is 80% of communication, so maintain eye contact and be assertive while speaking loudly, as much of the time they will be hard of hearing and ask you to repeat yourself. it's important to remain calm at all times and understand it may take rephrasing of questions in order to effectively get your point across.with the limited brain functions of the patient we need to not take things personally, we have no idea what is really going on in someone's mind and an outburst of rage may simply be because of a misunderstanding. _____i need to edit this quite a bit and move stuff around but i'm on my phone and waiting until i get on my laptop to switch stuff around. i'll need to end on some kind of note though i havn't decided how yet, of you've read this far thanks i really appreciate it. i hope i've made some sense in all this and you've

Need advice with grandma
hi everyone, made this account because i really don't know where to go for help about what's going on right now. sorry it's a long one, tl;dr at bottoma little bit of background: my grandmother, who used to live in a different state, moved in to live with my mom and dad (that's his mother) because she developed paranoia (constantly thinking someone is taking her things, being untrusting with everyone around her) over the years. she used to live alone in the state she was in, but sold her house and lived with relatives there. however, because of the increasing paranoia, her relatives thought it best for her to move in with her son. since the paranoia wasn't getting better, my parents brought her in to a doctor where she was diagnosed with cognitive impairment about 2 years ago (not sure if it was dementia since i wasn't there at the doc appointment) and was given donepezil to take for it. she adamantly refused to take the medications because she "wasn't crazy" and "wanted to age naturally." my parents asked if she could be placed in an assisted living facility, but again she adamantly refused, and because at that time she was still competent enough to make her own decisions, she continued living with my parents. i know it was bad but after that matter the issue was dropped because my parents had other pressing matters to deal with. my dad's kidney failed again and his colon cancer came back, by the time it was diagnosed it was stage 4. with all the health problems they had to deal with, the best they could do at that time was to just encourage her to take her medications, which she continued to refuse.the problem: my dad's health declined drastically last year, and he ended up passing away in january. with his passing, my grandma's mental health took a hit as well. she has become increasingly more paranoid, sometimes doesn't know that her son has passed away, and is now claiming that my mom is abusing her. my mom calls me weekly asking me what to do, and i honestly don't know. i know my mom is not abusing her, we talk on video chat and as far as i can see, there are no bruises or marks on her body. when i ask my grandma what's going on she only tells me she needs help? i ask her what kind of help she needs and she just keeps repeating that she needs help. i told my mom to make another dr appointment so she get reassessed and hopefully get placed into an assisted living facility since my mom can't take care of her and is worried that she may hurt herself while she is at work (grandma forgets she's cooking things sometimes and leaves the stove on). unfortunately the dr appointment isn't untl mid march, and with the increasing episodes where she's accusing my mom, i'm worried my mom will get in trouble with elder abuse when she isn't doing anything. i just don't know what to do anymore. i feel like it's unfair for my mom to deal with this, my dad was bedbound when he passed so it was only her taking care of him, and now not only does she has to deal with his passing, but she is left with her mother-in-law who is constantly accusing her of stealing her things. what do we do??tl;dr: grandma getting increasing paranoid after my dad's passing and now accusing mom (who is her daughter in law) of stealing her things and abusing her (she is not being abused). have no idea what to do

Feeling hopeless - not sure of the next step
i’ll try to keep this as short as possible.this week has been the hardest one of my life. earlier this week my mom told me that my dad was all of the sudden hallucinating (in all honesty we don’t know how long because he didn’t tell my mom until this week) and was acting strange / memory issues.so i decided to take matters in my own hands and drive him to the hospital. he had blood work, urine tests, cat scans, and an mri done as well. all of his tests came back “normal.” this doesn’t make sense because...well...he’s hallucinating after not previously hallucinating (he’s 68 years old). he’s not making much sense and super paranoid. they wanted him to stay the night but he refused...so...we took him back home and he didn’t go to sleep that night. the next day he was acting weirder and hallucinations were stronger. my mom took him back to the hospital and she made him stay the night. they ran the same tests and everything is somehow fucking normal? clearly not. he does take medicine for restless legs and migraines...we researched and saw that elderly patients who take them can become confused and hallucinate. we brought it up to the hospital and they agreed to taper him off over the next week (he can’t go cold turkey because doing so could cause seizures). anyways, he stayed the night (and didn’t sleep...so that’s 2 nights) and tests were normal so the next day i came to see him and he seemed to have some moments of clarity and i thought we made real progress and that my dads mind might be coming back. before i took him home and i asked them to give him medicine to help him sleep. big mistake. he got home that day and took it before bed...it had the opposite effect. he didn’t sleep again. this is 3 days of no sleep. maybe an hour here and there. he kept waking my mom and sister up and hid their car keys. he got aggressive and threatened to hit my sisters kid claiming that he was trying to steal the house? so today i come over and take him back to the hospital demanding answers. fun fact - my dad hates hospitals. the only reason he went every time is because he forgot he went the other times thankfully. i take him today and it got ugly. i told them they needed to sedate him and keep him for my families safety and so he can finally get sleep. they gave him ativan (the same stuff that made him not sleep in the first place) and about 15-20 mins later he started getting anxious and not making sense. he said i was his lawyer and i was being a bad friend by making him be there. he asked for us to leave so we could get a burger and then come back. i explained we couldn’t do that and he got angry. then shit hit the fan. he tried to leave. security had to try and escort him back to his room and sedate him. he forgot i was his son and said if i came any closer he’d fight me. he said i was a terrible lawyer and that he’d know if i was his son. he was super confused and agitated. i just don’t know what else to do. is it dementia, effects from his medication over time, mold poisoning, lead poisoning? i forgot to mention in november his medicine dosages went up - it was around december that he started getting confused here and there but no one knew. also, they are renovating the kitchen and the floor is ripped up and exposed. could it be toxins or mold? the house was built in the 40’s...could it be lead? the doctors brushed me off when i mentioned either and didn’t test for it. i’m just frustrated and don’t know how to help get my dad back. is it stress related psychosis?i just feel like health care, apart from surgery, is a joke at this point. any suggestions or positive thoughts?

My grandmother recently died from Alzheimer’s and my grandfather has dementia.
don’t really know what i’m looking forward here, but i have to share this somewhere.. my grandmother had been living with alzheimer’s for over 10 years. it of course started with forgetting simple things and slowly got worse over time. i lived with my grandparents up until spring of 2018 and saw her slowly decline every day. when i moved out, she was still mostly my grandmother. she knew she was starting to lose her memories and would say her brain isn’t working right. after moving, i still went to visit at least once per week. she fell and broke her hip in october 2018 that required surgery. the anesthesia sped up her decline. my grandfather had to take care of her a lot, and the stress and lack of sleep is when his dementia “started” and he has no short term memory.whenever i had to go longer periods of time between seeing her, there was a drastic change in her the next time i saw her. covid hit last year, and i went 3 weeks without seeing her. she was a lot worse off when i finally went to see her again. i decided to keep seeing her, being very careful not to expose myself to covid. i had my first baby sept 3, 2020. before having my baby, my grandmother was still able to form sentences and knew who i was, even if she couldn’t remember my name. when i finally went back to see her after having my baby, she was sleeping most of the day, only getting up to eat.late november, my grandfather started to get highly agitated and one night it was so bad that my grandmother tried getting out the front door (like she has multiple times in the past). this time though, it got physical and both of them ended up on the floor. my grandfather broke his shoulder. he was sent to the hospital, and then rehab. when he got back home, he wasn’t the same. lots of dosing off, tremors, couldn’t walk. the rehab didn’t do anything and may have been neglecting him. he ended up back in the hospital after he was too weak to even get out of bed.during the time he was in the hospital, my grandmother was actually better. waking earlier, doing more, but couldn’t really form coherent sentences. a little while after my grandfather came home and started to regain his strength, my grandmother started to get highly agitated all the time. she finally got really weak and blood in urine and had to send her to the hospital about 3 weeks ago. diagnosed as uti. she didn’t eat for a while, but then finally did. she was going to be released to come home on hospice, but at the last minute wanted to send her to a hospice facility to try to get her agitation under control. she got there sept 31 and was still eating food that week until saturday feb 6th. on sunday, she was unresponsive. no one was able to visit her at the hospital, and we all thought she’d be back home that sunday the 6th, do no one went to see her at the hospice before she became unresponsive. my dad and aunt went that monday and she was given 72 hours. tuesday, no one went. wednesday morning, they still said she had 72 hours, but took a turn got the worse in late afternoon. i was finally able to visit her wednesday evening, as well as a lot of close family that she saw all the time. she passed away that night after we all left.my grandfather was heartbroken when he found out, but with his short term memory, he doesn’t remember and keeps asking where she is at. every time he is reminded, you can tell it hurts him by the look on his face. the funeral for my grandmother is set for tuesday morning. i don’t know how he will handle it. we all think he is going to go soon too.with all of this, my aunt blames herself. for not realizing my grandmother needed more help than my grandfather was able to give, how raking care of her for 2 years wore him down. blames herself for sending him to rehab. she thinks she killed my grandmother by sending her to hospice instead of bringing her home. for not seeing the signs of the uti sooner, etc. i am heartbroken too. one of the last couple times i saw her, something amazing happened. i was holding my daughter on my lap with my grandmother standing in front of us playing with the baby. out of nowhere, between mumbles, she clearly said “you love your great grandma don’t you?”  even on her late stage alzheimer’s, she was able to figure out that my daughter was her great granddaughter and form a complete coherent sentence. i will always remember that moment.

How do you deal with the changes when the negativity is pointed at you, constant, &amp; they refuse help?
within two minutes of waking up this morning my mom pointedly accused me of not taking out the trash last night.  i took out the trash last night and she saw me do it.  it's like this everyday and even though i'm almost positive of what's going on, i'm having a hard time accepting the changes that are occurring.  my husband and i believe my mother has frontotemporal dementia, stage 3/4ish.  my mom has never had a great memory but it's come to the point now that her house is in the beginning stages of hoarding.  some of it is due to an unwillingness to throw or give things away, but by and large it's because she forgets to put things away.  she's constantly accusing me of not doing things i did or moving things when in fact she moved it, put it down, and forgot about it.  she's meaner than she used to be, the jokes at my expense seem nonstop sometimes.  she never apologizes or says "please" to me, but does when she's addressing my husband.   i'm constantly trying to keep her on task, because the state of her house bothers her as well.  she gets mad at me if i stick to a plan that we had made the previous day, because she doesn't remember making that plan and it no longer makes sense to her.  i have to remind her more than i'd like that certain terms are offensive and not publicly (or otherwise) acceptable.  she's getting more and more paranoid and fearful as time goes on.  and while not diagnosed, i can guarantee she has ocpd as well.  she has 7 of the 8 symptoms according to the dsm5 ([ so she is unbearably controlling at times.  and i am borderline ocpd myself, just shy of being diagnosable according to my therapist, so i know what it looks like.i understand that it's not her fault what's happening, that she can't create new memories like we can.  but her nastiness, while short in duration for each occurrence, occurs so damn often now that coupled with her controlling behaviors and refusal to be seen because "she's just getting old", makes being around her for extended periods of time so difficult.  and right now i don't have much of a choice in the matter due to unfortunate circumstances.  i want to be patient and kind but she's either being mean/rude to me or monopolizing my time because she's completely oblivious to anything else going on around her.  and i know i'm going to regret these feeling someday when she's gone so i very much want to reset myself, if you will.  but bad feelings started festering a long time ago and she aggravates the shit out of my own mental health problems.  but between all of her crap and crap in my own personal life, i've completely lost patience for everyone, and when it comes to her i end up feeling terrible.  i just wish she would consent to seeing a doctor about it, because even if nothing changed, at least then i think i'd feel like she gave a shit about how she might be affecting other people.tldr: how do i let go of the negativity directed towards me from my mom's dementia and ocpd so that i don't lose patience with her?

i just want to quickly say that this is my first reddit post, so i'm not really sure what i'm doing but i needed to ask someone for help, at least.my grandpa has parkinson's and dementia. i knew he had the former since he was diagnosed a few years ago, but i only learned about the latter when my mom slipped up and mentioned it while we were talking about him. i think she wanted to hide that from me so i wouldn't be even more concerned about him. before, none of this really affected him much other than his hands shaking and him being a bit forgetful sometimes, but recently it's gotten so much worse. he's a very religious man and always has been, but now at least twice whenever i see him he'll go on very emotional rants about how i have to read the bible and pray every day, and i have to listen to god and all sorts of religious things. on at least three occasions (that i know of) he's gotten really mad and called my grandma the devil, and one of those times he went out the door and started walking down the road. my grandma absolutely does not help the situation at all. i don't know much about dementia or anything similar, but i do know that you're not supposed to yell at them or tell them that they're wrong about something they insist they're right about, and my grandma does exactly that. nearly everyone in the family has tried to tell her this, but she hasn't changed anything. he'll say he sees/ hears things, and my grandma will tell him he's crazy. he's also convinced that people are going to come and take him away to a care home, and my grandma will sometimes tell him that she just might call them to come get him if he doesn't stop. i feel horrible that can't do anything to help him, other than just visit my grandparents as much as i can. i live an hour to an hour and a half away and my grandma won't allow pets in the house, and i don't feel comfortable leaving my dog alone for so long (my mom is still there, but she's at work most of the day and my dog has severe separation anxiety). i'm doing school online, so i can bring my computer and still do my classes while i'm visiting them, that way i can stay longer than just a weekend.my grandpa says he sees and hears things all the time, too. he told my grandma that there's a motorcycle that drives past the house all the time, when there's nothing there. one night he woke my grandma up at around 3 in the morning saying he just had to chase some people out of the house. today, my aunt came to visit and she and my grandma were talking in the kitchen. the light from the window reflected off of her bracelet and onto the ceiling. my grandpa and i were sitting at the table and he tapped my shoulder and quietly asked me if i saw it. i just nodded and told him that it was from aunt's bracelet, and he just kind of discreetly shook his head and told me it was someone outside the house with a mirror. i know this is terrible, but i really don't know what to do or say around him, and it makes me really uncomfortable. i don't handle things like this well, and hearing my mom cry all the time because she's losing her dad makes it so much worse. i just don't know how i should act around him or talk to him. does anyone have any advice or anything to make it even a little bit easier?

Advice for helping my Mama.
hello everyone. i don't really have folks to talk with this about but this community seems nice. my mama has been diagnosed with dementia by her primary doctor. we are trying to find the $2,000 needed for the exam ordered by her doctor. we were living with her abusive ex boyfriend until i was able to safely bring her and myself to my granny's home. it has been....tough. i've watched some caregiver videos but at times i just can't help but cry. my mama had always been wonder woman to me. she has been with me through some very rough times and kept me safe when we were living on next to nothing. she is strong and willful.now? she cries almost nightly. she becomes fixated on questions and repeats herself at least twenty times despite my giving her the same answer. the other day, i dealt with the two same questions on and off for nine hours before i talked her into going to bed. she worries and gets extremely sad or very, very angry. then an hour later? she's forgotten it.it's a weird spot to be in and i've asked the doctors for advice on getting her to eat or shower but they don't really have any advice. she has always been someone who showers daily and eats three meals a day. currently, it's lucky if we convince her to shower once a week. eating...eating us a constant battle. she will not eat unless meals are homemade (something she never cared about before) but then she will complain she has too much food and eat maybe half a portion, insisting she 'just ate' despite having had nothing since the day prior.i will say, she's suddenly very into snacks? like chips and peanuts. she will eat a few, especially fritos. i kind of laugh at the amount of fritos i have to buy when i go to the store because i can get her to eat some of those with dips as a night time snack.does anyone have any advice on how to make this easier? i feel bad not being able to give her answers to everything but she asks constantly about "our plan" and has suddenly gotten the notion that she's going to die soon (she heard my granny talking to my cousin about living wills). she also gets very, very worked up/fixed on the idea that we are going to put her in a home or "facility for crazy people"? but we've never said such a thing, which makes me think her crazy ex texted it to her. also, are there any sort of games that may help? mama always loved card games so i'm buying some playing cards. i've also thought about maybe getting scrabble? something to engage her mind more as she sits and seems to just stare off or look at the same messages on her phone repeatedly.thank you for letting me ramble. it feels good to actually say that yeah, this sucks and i do need some help cause i don't have all the answers.

Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?
tl; dr: what are the pros and cons of hiring someone (probably a stranger) to serve as a remote assistant to a senior citizen with memory loss?my mother is elderly (over 80) and has started to have short-term memory loss. it's gotten more noticeable in the last 6 months or so, and she has started to acknowledge it. my brother and i both live at a distance from her, though he is close enough that he can make the round-trip in a day, and he visits every few weeks. she is not home-bound, she drives well, and is very intelligent. we do not think she is any danger to herself. due to the pandemic, she is alone a lot of the time, especially now that it is winter and she can't easily have visitors outside in the yard. friends and relatives phone her often--one of them daily, several multiple times a week. she has local friends who bring her groceries weekly. she is also able to run to the grocery store herself, where she is cautious about going very early and making the trip short. however, she is not great about remembering to wash her hands, remove her mask properly, etc.she needs help with computer and iphone issues fairly regularly. she's always been tech challenged but it is more critical now, with phone and zoom being the main ways of interacting with people during the pandemic. she reaches out to my brother a lot for tech help (and to me occasionally on it). she reaches out to me on financial questions fairly regularly and sometimes on medical. my brother and i both observed her memory issues getting worse. i began pursuing trying to get a diagnosis and any medical help that seems appropriate. she was able to get a zoom appointment with her family doctor, who seemed excellent. (i attended, too.) he prescribed comprehensive blood testing. everything was normal. he has referred her to a neurologist. that will be next--she would prefer to wait until after she's vaccinated. i made sure she registered for the vaccine as soon as she became eligible.just when her memory issues got to the point that i thought she should get medical evaluation, my brother began  advocating for her to get a remote assistant to help her with technology problems, scheduling household repairs and maintenance, remembering appointments, and keeping track of medical issues. he would like to hire someone overseas (inexpensive).my mother is not eager to have a remote assistant. she thinks that will just be someone to supervise and have to try to share everything with electronically. her biggest source of frustration is technology, and second is trying to get things done where she has to depend on other people being reliable and doing the job well. she has a lot of trouble scanning documents or emailing photos of things.i asked my brother if the reason he wants a remote assistant is because her questions are becoming burdensome to him. he said no but i think he has backed away from that answer. my husband, who works in it and is super patient, has offered to help her with computer issues. she is happy to have that resource and thinks the world of my husband, but she hasn't reached out to him yet. i think she is used to contacting my brother and i don't think he has discouraged her from doing so. here's why i'm posting: i am concerned about the safety of a stranger knowing that she lives alone and has memory issues. that person would know when she has an appointment and is out of the house and could also potentially try to scam her in other ways, such as financially. (at this point, my mother controls her own finances, though she is gradually bringing me in to help.)when my brother first suggested the remote assistant, i raised my safety concerns with him. i also suggested that if we do hire someone, we should set the cost aside. we both know that she is well off and cost is not an issue for her--she is happy to pay well for work for her. i have said we should put safety first and hire someone one of us knows and trusts (i gave him 3 names of underemployed friends who might be interested) or perhaps a friend of a friend who is well-vetted. my brother's position is that anyone can rip you off whether you know them or not. i subsequently also offered to help more (which i am doing) and i have offered my husband's help with the technology issues (which my brother has not responded to--instead he's emailing me things like medical releases we should give a  remote assistant).  sorry this post is so long. i would love any advice on any of the following: whether i'm being overly concerned about my mother's safety, approaches to dealing with my brother on this assuming that i'm not being overly concerned, possible alternative ways to address my mother's issues, any stories of success or failure using remote assistants, and anything i might be missing. thank you in advance!

Am I Paranoid?
i made a post on here a little while back talking about being concerned about my dad, and i just wanted to post that again with a couple updates.my dad is 60 years old, and i don’t know if i should be concerned or not. he’s done and said some weird things that have caught me off guard, which i’ll list below. i’m just wondering…am i paranoid? should i even be worried? these lapses have taken place over the last couple months, and they don’t seem to be consistent, with some of them being one-offs, and most days he seems to be okay. he swears he’s fine, but i can’t help but he worried.• has been getting disoriented driving in familiar places, taking odd routes or forgetting which way we usually go. this has happened quite a few times since last summer.• has trouble with short-term memory. for example, one time i asked him to grab my belt out of the bathroom while he was in there, and within two minutes he forgot. things like this where he’s been told something multiple times and forgets (make sure to close blinds, don’t leave dirty clothes out, etc) happen very often.• forgets phone/keys/wallet in the car when going inside somewhere. this doesn’t happen too often, but it’s happened multiple times in the last few months. my mom and i often double check that he has them.• there was one particular instance that he had me hold his keys, then when he took them back when he needed them. they got stuck on my finger, so he had to put extra effort into retrieving his keys. within minutes, he forgot about the interaction and thought i had slipped the keys into his pocket without him knowing. this only happened once, but it worried me.• the same night as the aforementioned keys incident, we went to taco bell, and he forgot what i usually order (which is a burrito), and when i asked what i usually get, he hesitantly said “…taco?” i haven’t gotten a taco from taco bell in a long time. again, this only happened once.• has been putting things in weird places, using things then putting it back somewhere else. the most recent instance of this was him putting a swiffer duster on top of the fridge, even though we put it in the stairwell. this has been happening for years, so it could just be a habit of his.• recently, he’s seemed more irritable, and overall down. this could be from stress, but supposedly this is also a symptom of dementia/alzheimer’s, so i’m a little concerned.• he just seems out of it, or in a daze, in general. he’s still very much competent, but he just seems slow and glazed over.• just the other day, he used the wrong type of gravy cooking dinner, even though they are different colors.• just today, he paused while typing what ended up being a two sentence that i would think would be fairly simple to come up with, saying he would check something at work and get back to the person. he stopped for about 30 seconds, he might have been thinking of different wording, but i’ve heard having trouble with words is a symptom.• just today he also said the word “oven” instead of “microwave,” but he immediately corrected himself.should i be worried? am i overthinking things? it could be age, it could be stress, but i don’t know. he says he’s fine, but i’m just not sure. please tell me if my concerns are valid. thank you :)

Does this sound like dementia? Repeating the same phrase over and over
my grandmother lives alone in a different country and we therefore keep in contact through weekly telephone calls. last week we had a normal conversation, however today something extremely alarming occurred. my mother rang my grandmother this morning and all was normal until around 2 minutes into the conversation my mother suddenly starts shouting “what’s wrong with you? are you okay?” continuously. after a minute of this she hangs up the phone and is in tears. i comfort her and ask her what happened. she said my grandmother and her had a normal conversation until my grandmother said the phrase “so i went to the doctors last week for a scan and the results came back normal” (this scan was just a general check up on her health). my grandmother apparently would not stop saying this phrase over and over again no matter what my mother said to her. i told my mum it was probably not the best idea to shout at her but that i would give a go talking to her instead. my phone call with went something along these lines: me: hello! how are you?grandmother (g): i’m doing well thank you how are you?[1 minute of normal conversation] me: so mum is a little upset right now, shes worried about you. can you tell me about the phone conversation you just had with her? g: yes, i told her that i went to the doctors and my scans came out normal. i don’t understand why she’s upset. you would think i said something really strange if she’s worried about meme: oh okay, must have been a miscommunication. by the way how are you liking the new shampoo we sent to your house? g: you would think i said something really strange if she’s worried about meme: yes i know, but how’s the new shampoo? g: you would think i said something really strange if she’s worried about me (this is when i realise she is doing the same thing to me) i tried to change the topic of conversation 5 different times but had no luck. she just continued with that phrase over and over. even when i attempted to say goodbye she was still saying the same thing, i unfortunately ended up having to hang up on her. we have no idea what could have caused this and no family members can check up on her until the morning (it is the middle of the night for them). the instant onset of this is what is concerning us, she was fine up until last week. we briefly managed to speak to someone who is in frequent face to face contact with her and they said she has been fine, except perhaps a little forgetful (although she has always been a bit of a forgetful person) but nothing of concern. i’m more concerned that my grandmother has had a traumatic head injury of sort but unfortunately she is the type to never let us know if something is wrong as she tells us she does not want us to worry. we are planning to call her again when it is morning for her. anyone had any experience with elders suddenly repeating the same phrase over and over again? and was this onset as immediate as the one my grandmother is experiencing?

Advice on My Mom--OCD Role in "Pseudo Dementia"
hi,my mom is 67 years old. she has had several severe bouts of sepsis in the past 5 years, but is otherwise fairly heathly. in the summer of 2019, seemingly out of nowhere, she changed. she hasn't been the same since. to give some background, ocd runs in the family. (her sister has it, to the point of needing medication and disability. her doctors used to say it was one of the worst cases they've ever seen.) my mom has also been diagnosed with mild ocd and ptsd years ago, but has always been fully functioning and never "needed" meds . anyway, two summers ago, she became obsessed with her memory. upset when she forgot little things, mispronounced a word, etc., she became intensely hard on herself. she started eating only "brain healthy" foods and lost about 20 lbs. this eventually led to days on end of research on dementia and alzheimer's. she spends hours a day, entire days, taking brain tests online and playing memory/concentration games. as time went on, it has worsened. she now claims she is "sun-downing" whenever her moods become out of control. she spends hours crying, praying, telling me to prepare for the diagnosis. she tells me it's okay if i put her in a home because she doesn't want me to see her unable to remember me. she won't talk to people, including my boyfriend's family, neighbors, etc. because she fears she'll repeat herself or say something "stupid".she has had mris. they showed some blood vessel issues, but her neurologist said they're totally normal for her age. but, my mom, being dr. google, has now confirmed (in her mind) that she has vascular dementia. she has also spoken to several other docs about her symptoms. she did well on a cognitive test. she told the doctor "that's just because i practice this one every day at home on the internet". finally, the latest doc (i'm not sure of his title), brought up the subject of ocd and stressed to her that she has ocd, which she's always had, only for whatever reason it's now taken the shape of pseudodementia. i feel incredibly sad and confused over this situation. covid-19 and the fact that i moved out (in 2018) have seemed to make it worse. i am wracked with guilt. i have no one to turn to. i cannot seem to be able to help her, convince her that she is fine, or more importantly convince her to seek help in the form of therapy or meds. i truly do not see any signs of true memory loss, just obsession over it. she keeps saying, "by next year, i will decline...by next year, i won't know who you are", etc. it feels like she wants this. it feels like she's wasting precious years, where she's in the best shape health wise that she's been in a while, on a figment of her imagination, and so some times i am incredibly angry at her and frustrated.  if you're still here, thank you for taking the time to read. has anyone been through something similar themselves or with a loved one? i really appreciate any and all feedback.

Help?
several months ago my mother (72, copd) and aunt (65, mild t.b.i. 10+ years ago) retired because of covid. they live together alone in my aunt's house and i temporarily moved in to help with the transition and the bills. i was completely blown away- my aunt, although younger, has been presenting marked dementia symptoms which i attribute to the tbi she got years ago in a car accident.  she can't make a meal or a shopping list, can't write her own name or any coherent sentence, can't use a tv remote or phone, and sometimes forgets how to use a seatbelt, leaves the stove on, to name a few. she can smile, talk and be jovial but conversations frequently become completely fabricated nonsense made up on the spot.  unable to follow simple instructions. i'm making sure the bills are being paid in her accounts. she wants me to put a new battery in her car so she can drive. that is absolutely not happening. she's in complete denial anything is wrong so poa is going to me a battle, i assume.&amp;#x200b;my mom has just been diagnosed with alzheimer's and been told she shouldn't drive anymore.  at least she's not in denial and graciously surrendered the keys. forgetting words and leaving the stove on is her main presentation; she's not near as bad as her sister. i just now had to start helping her with her accounts. &amp;#x200b;i (36/m) am not equipped to deal with this. i work long construction hours. i have no siblings or cousins to spread the load, it's just the tree of us. i'm managing their two budgets plus my own. i don't know the first place to call, who to ask for. i straight up just don't know what the fk to do and i'd be panicking right now if that would accomplish anything but it won't, so i write this hail mary instead. any insights/ advice would be invaluable at this juncture..       thank you

my mother (65) has always had some undiagnosed mental issues(depression,anxiety at the least). she was in a bad wreck around 10 years ago and suffered a concussion. at that time i discovered she was taking a lot of prescription pills that she had hid from us (pain pills, ativan, anti depressants). in my opinion she was over prescribed and addicted and possibly abusing the pills. the last 10 years have just been a train wreck. lots of ups and downs with her moods, health issues, sleeping all day, severe depression, confusion and disoriented. her pain pills were cut out about 3 years and we thought for sure she would be herself again. she was a little better but still out there. she suffered a bad fall last year and broke a lot of bones and was in the hospital a while for surgery and rehab. the dr did advise that ativan could be the culprit in her fall and confusion.  we finally got her healed and off the pain medicine again and then she had another issue that required pain medicine. it’s just constantly something.  anyway her primary dr is still prescribing her the ativan.  that’s all she’s on right now but she’s worse than she’s ever been. she is unbearable to be around. she’s not herself and constantly guilting you or being selfish. she’s hallucinating.  she says she sees girls. she will not sleep at night. she will be awake at 6 am but sleep all day. she has lost so much weight and looks terrible. she doesn’t even know what day it is most times. she’s can repeat a story from 30 years ago but can’t remember any medicine she takes and constantly searching for things she has misplaced. she has forgot to turn the oven off several times and is no longer allowed to cook by herself. i have begged her to get help and she refuses. when we went to the hospital a year ago for her fall i stayed with her every night and she was so mad at me and my dad for talking to the drs about her confusion or behavior.  she cried and guilted us for taking her to that specific hospital.  the doctors had a serious talk with her about the ativan and recommended her going to a treatment center. she did not go but i think that’s why she refuses to see a doctor about her issues now, fear of being locked up. i have no idea what to do anymore. i cry myself to sleep basically mourning my mother who is still alive. she is not herself. we have always been so close and i just don’t know how to help her. i am getting bitter with my dad for not forcing her to be truthful with a doctor or getting her proper care. i truly believe this is early signs of dementia however i am not getting much support as my family thinks it’s from prescribed medication she refuses to quit taking so they are angry with her.  i’ve pleaded with her to consult with a dr and she will not claim anything is wrong with her and makes excuses for her behavior, confusion and hallucinations. she’s so quick to go to the dr with anything else but not when it comes to her mental health or memory.  everything is always other people’s fault. she’s so child like. anyway i need help on how to get her to be honest about her symptoms and her current state with a dr. i cannot just sit and watch my mom decline like this

Mum stuck in diagnosis limbo (Scotland)
hi there, just wondering if anyone has any advice or reassurance or really anything because i'm feeling really lost right now.my mum is 55 years old, and she's always had a whole lot of health problems (nerve problems, t1 diabetes, cancer, autoimmune conditions, circulation problems, severe depression and anxiety, you name it the list goes on) it's hard to say exactly when her dementia onset as many of the early symptoms likely blended in with all her other conditions (struggling to walk and dropping things? well she's in a lot of pain and her hands are ruined. forgetting words and other things? brain fog from her meds and depression. apathy? she's been depressed for years. seeing insects everywhere? she's on too many meds. she doesn't cook or do any housework anymore? depression or laziness. she's gone off a lot of food and doesn't eat much any more? nausea probably. etc.) but for a bit over a year now it's been undeniable that something was really wrong. she stopped being able to manage her health conditions, which caused particular problems with her diabetes and she ended up hospitalised a lot. her speech started to get affected, and she repeated stuff a lot. she was noticeably slowing cognitively, she was acting strange and at times paranoid/delusional. she stopped caring at all about her appearance, way more than normal. she was unreliable and couldn't seem to remember anything properly (for example if you asked if she had eaten, taken her meds or if anyone had phoned she couldn't answer accurately), and eventually we realised she wasn't at all safe to leave the house on her own. there were other things as well but this post is long enough lol. so in around october she was finally admitted to a psych ward for evaluation after my dad finally got her therapist to understand that something was very wrong. she's been in there since then and has deteriorated in a number of ways (incontinence, increased mobility issues, falls, speech is even less clear and fluent etc.) and they've put her on medication to calm her down as she was restless and agitated before, but otherwise it feels like they gave up the diagnostic process in late november. they did all the standard tests to rule out infections and deficiencies etc. as well as brain scans which apparently showed a bit of vascular damage but as her blood pressure is apparently fine it can't be vascular dementia. i'm worries they don't really has the experience or resources to handle a case like my mum, where it's potentially a slightly rarer form of dementia and where diagnosis will be difficult due to no one really knowing what happened in the early stages. does anyone have any advice as to what i should do/ask for? tl;dr: mum (55) has been in a psychiatric hospital since october for suspected dementia, but due to a large number of previous health conditions diagnosis has been especially complicated, and i'm worried the doctors have all but given up there is no super clear cause at this point.

TLDR : I cured my dementia (Not CLICKBAIT)
hey there everyone. my name is mustafa and i'm 23. 6 months ago i was on the verge of ending my life .at a very young age where everyone is striving and working hard for a better life. unfortunately for me everything went on pause in 2018 i got diagnosed with osteoarthritis aka (disk degeneration)that's where i had to be friend chronic pain..my past 2.5 years was filled with so much pain that i lost everything in my life.my relationships went down hill , my finances were all spent on finding a cure , uni failed me since i was not able to study due to pain and so much more i sucked it all up cuz i was told there's nothing you can do about it just like alzheimer's. anyways 2020 march arrives and that's when sh*t hits the fan and got fired my job at a restaurant because i forget alot of orders and instructions that i've been given.i realized my brain is not working right. it's like i have conversation with someone in the next minute or two i realize i would forget 90% of what we talked about. let alone just that i couldn't perform normal calculations in my head . man that felt so weird coming from someone who has graduated from a levels 5 years ago with straight up a's and b's.long story short i went through different doctors trying to find what's going on and i would always make sure i'd have my phone recorder on cuz the next minute i'd step out i'd legit forget what they just told me.after weeks of visits i knew that there no hope for me man . literally every doctor said something .i got diagnosed with adhd , depression , anxiety.and the one i hated the most was "oh i think it's all in your head". yes sure...i tried all the meds from adderall to anti depressants you name it. they just threw pills week after week. hoping one day i come by and talk about how they helped me..unfortunately none did.i wanted to see how bad my brain was so  i found a test called moca.i think alot of you should know what this is . it's a test doctors put people on if they have cognitive decline. no doctor wanted to test me out or do a scan on my brain so i did the test on my own and my score was literally 5/30. man i knew life was over for me and my parents would have to go through this with me as well which was horrifying.time was passing by and things getting worse day by day for some reason i'd be staring at the window for no reason for minutes.days pass and weird words come out of my mouth and i'd stutter trying to put one sentence together. i think it's called aphasia.i know i'm talking so much about my symptoms but i'm trying to show you how bad my case is. but you might wonder how the hell am i typing this entire post if i had dementia..i'll gladly explain and it's why i'm putting this out.6 months ago that's when i was at rock bottom i discovered a book called "the end of alzheimer's" by dr dale bredesen.i was so desperate that if someone told me the cure is to eat a plate of shit . i would do it regardless if it's true or not. it's called desperation for a solution.anyways dr dale details everything a person needs to know about this disease but not just that. he's been able to reverse his clients cognitive decline with a protocol that he has extensively put out in his book .i was skeptical but i wanted something that gives me hope so i decided to follow.  jesus man 6 months in and i swear on my mom's life that it f*cking works.i have recently done the cognitive test and my moca score was 30/30.i'm able to remember conversations , my vocabulary increased , aphasia is vanishing , i can understand movies and so much more..i highly recommend anyone who's watching a loved one die day by day to give this book a shot or hell maybe you yourself are experiencing symptoms of memory loss too . there's hope for everyone no matter how far they are ...i'm not the first one who has come back to life but in the book he shares different stories of his clients who show obvious results and they have gone back to normal life..i feel sad at time i walk by a nursing home next to my house and i see a bunch of elderly probably with severe alzheimer's stuck where they are and never get to truely come back to life just like i did.anyways for me it's been 6 months and i can't say i'm fully back 100% to where i was but jesus i'm so happy things turned around when it seemed impossible..it's a journey and it takes times i can't imagine the how my next years will be. i'm looking forward to uni again 😊yeah and also i forgot to mention that my chronic pain has subsided . i finally live a pain free life. i swear the only reason i posted this is so that someone reads this and hopefully gives the book a shot . we all know how hopeless it is to hear someone go through dementia. if you got any question i'll gladly answer ☺️

A "Bittersavory" day
it has taken me a few days to collect my thoughts, but i think it's time i put something in writing. i hope this doesn't turn out to be too long.my wife suffers from ftd. in some ways it might be more accurate to say every one around her suffers from her ftd; it doesn't seem to bother her at all. it finally reached the point that we had to put her into full time nursing care (a nursing home). i had kept her at home hiring nurses to come in and watch her during the daytime while i was at work, but she clearly needed more attention. i won't go into all the details, but most dementia patients eventually get to that point.wednesday this past week, we admitted her into the nursing home. that was a bit of an ordeal, but it needed to happen.on my way home, i needed to stop by the grocery store and pick up a few items. while i was shopping i happened to walk down the aisle where the cookies were located. i stopped for a second and looked at them. and i had a thought:  "i could buy cookies if i wanted to. i haven't bought cookies for years because if i did, my wife would simply eat the whole package as soon as we got back home.  i could buy a package and a few days later, i could open it and have one or two. and then i could put the package away and if i wanted another cookie later in the week, the package would still be there."  ultimately, i didn't buy any cookies. i wasn't that tempted and i am trying to watch what i eat. but i could have if i wanted. and that's the point. that's the thought that struck me that day. i shared this moment of clarity via text message with my daughter and she said that i would probably experience a number of these moments over the coming weeks and months. things that i'm now free to do that i haven't been able to do for so long that i've almost forgotten that i'm able to do the. using a public restroom, for example. for the past few years, if it's just me and my wife out somewhere in public, i would avoid using a men's restroom because invariably she would follow me in. my daughter said, you'll probably find moments of "freedom" when you realize you can do things, but you'll also experience moments where something will remind you of what you've lost. be prepared to deal with those moments, as well.i'm certain she's right.later that day, she shares something on facebook that i thought i'd pass along here.  reflecting back on the decision to put my wife into the nursing home, my daughter said that there needs to be a word other than "bittersweet" for days like that day.  there was nothing sweet about it. it was bitter, yes. bitter because this horrible disease has taken the wife and mother away from us and she's no longer here. but there was also the knowledge that we were doing the right thing.  my daughter suggested that "bittersavory" might be a good word for those times.  the times when you must do something that is wholly unpleasant, but you know deep down it is the right thing to do.that's the word i'm leaving you with, today.  "bittersavory."  feel free to share your bittersavory moments and use the word to help you deal with those times.my heart goes out to all of you that post on this subreddit that are losing a loved one to some form of dementia or other degenerative disease.  hard decisions have to be made.  may god grant you the strength, the courage and the resolve to do the right thing, no matter how bitter and unpleasant that thing is.have a blessed new year and may you find peace and joy in the moments that avail themselves to those feelings.  tell those closest to you that you love them while they can still feel and experience that love. and don't just tell them; show them your love for them.

I lost a grandmother and grandfather to dementia and now my dad’s showing signs
tw: suicide/depression/ptsd mentioni’m 27 m. my grandmother (dad’s side) passed when i was a teenager and i was shielded from that by my youth. but around that same time, my grandfather (mom’s side) suffered several strokes after suicide attempts and never regained the same level of functionality. i became his carer 2 or 3 years ago with my parents and took care of him throughout quarantine. we eventually saw him through 24/7 hospice care in our home, in very intense shifts, 7 days a week until he passed. that experience was one of the most traumatic of my life and neither i nor my parents have fully recovered from it. i planned to visit my boyfriend for a week for thanksgiving, but my older brother (who i live with) got covid while i was away. he gave it to my parents so i had to quarantine at my boyfriend’s house for over a month until they stopped being contagious. my mom texted me a few times mentioning how much my dad’s forgetting. he’s undiagnosed though seemed like he’s been showing minor signs of dementia for years now. he’s been pretty functional and it always seemed many years off. when i got back home from my boyfriend’s though, he was losing thoughts as he’s talking about them. he wanted to cook and kept forgetting how long to set the timer for as he was setting it. he’s still able to work and converse and get his points across. he has to use phrases like “hand clock” instead of “watch” much more often than before and basic communication is now very easily confusable. but he’s still functional and present. i honestly don’t know how to cope with this though. i just watched my grandfather slowly lose his ability to do anything at all before passing this august. i can’t go through that with my dad. i don’t know where he’ll be in just a year at this rate. i feel my time with him is already ticking down. i’m so scared with this realization honestly, and feeling guilty for every moment i’m not spending with him while i still can. i know that lamenting what’s to come won’t prepare me or make it any easier when it does come. i want to savor the time i have with good memories while i have it. but i have ptsd and depression and often don’t have the wherewithal to stay positive or make the best use of my time. this just feels so bleak, i don’t know how to get through this.

obligatory apologies for format due to mobile and for the long post.  i do not wish to self diagnose and not suggesting i have dementia but i feel i have a real problem paying attention and staying focused and i was wondering if there is any advice out there from medical professionals, family members or others that suffer from similar issues.  i (45m) have noticed a marked decline in my memory, intelligence and concentration.  this is affecting my professional and personal life.  it's hard for me to articulate but here's a few examples: in the last few years i have become extremely forgetful and am finding it very difficult to concentrate even on the simplest of tasks.  i find myself wandering in circles in the house and my attention span is quite limited.  if i don't write things down or make a note in my phone then i forget.  my vocabulary is becoming simpler when talking and i find i have to edit emails and messages a lot more for them to make sense.   i am constantly losing things.  i've lost count of how many times i've lost my wallet in the past few years.  i've left money in the atm. left my car doors open and forever leave my car unlocked.  i am forever leaving the oven on and the fridge door open. i've left the hand brake off in my car and it rolled down the driveway and wrote off a neighbours car.  i used to have a phenomenal memory especially with numbers.  i could memorise phone numbers after using them once, same as job numbers at work.  there are thousands of combinations of 9 digit numbers that consist of  location, job type and activity performed. basically every section of a street in the city has an allocated number and before i would only need to have used it once and i remember it.  same as employee numbers and vehicle registration and plant numbers.  i was a bit of a rain man and my coworkers would refer to me as such.   unfortunately now i have to consult the books or i make errors that potentially cost a lot of money.   the tldr version is i used to have an excellent memory and vocabulary and now i don't.  i would now classify my memory as poor and my vocabulary when speaking is below average.  also i used to speak a couple of languages and now i even have trouble recalling basic english terms.  it's quite distressing and exceedingly frustrating.  what makes it worse is my wife is currently overseas indefinitely as she went to her home country last christmas for an extended visit and got caught up in the pandemic border closures and close community quarantine.  the consulate has been closed since april i think and there's no timeframe for it to be reopened. she usually takes care of me and while i'm no invalid and can take care of myself i am getting worse and it's a little scary that i don't have someone to double check things for me.  i am well aware that i need to consult a doctor in order to get a proper diagnosis and i am drawing  no conclusions as to what is the cause.  i'm posting here simply because the symptoms i suffer are eerily similar to dementia.  the thing is nobody in my family has suffered from it. my mother is elderly and a little senile but it's normal old lady senility and she's not forgetful anymore than someone of her age.  i need some advice, preferably from someone that works with people that exhibit cognitive decline.

Grandmother with early/mid state dementia. I'm mentally drained. (Long vent)
i'll take all kinds of advice, tips, words of comfort i can get. because i'm just overwhelmed and exhausted and out of ideas.my grandma had some sort of neurological issues from childhood on (i think brain damage?) which get worse over time and possibly even a form of mental disability/learning disability.well, and additionally dementia. i think you can imagine all those things combined are a little messy.however, the main problem is she isn't in a state where she really forgets a lot of things yet. she's still mentally 'there'.but her cognitive abilities are noticably declining.she logically doesn't understand a lot of things anymore which can cause a lot of problems.you can tell her a, she will understand b and go on to tell everyone c. basically how small-town-gossip works, but.. the entire town in just one person. luckily by now all of our family members became aware of that, so if anyone gets a call where she tells a super dramatic story how one of us had an injury at home or had something horrible happen, we will ask someone else about it before we take it seriously.i also had a short discussion with her today about me moving out for work somewhere next year and i had to notice, she doesn't understand what "moving out from home" really means. she pictures it like a boarding school kinda thing, where i'll be there on weekdays but come home every weekend and through the holidays. and that it's just a temporary thing. she was also shocked by the fact i'm taking my pets with me.so once that comes near, it's gonna hella messy. often times she will also tell you about something, but she lacks the words to describe it, so you will have zero idea what she's even talking about.obviously we try to make her describe it in different ways, so we can kinda figure it out, but usually that doesn't work either. in the end you just stand there and try to act like you're totally on board. which can also become problematic, because sometimes it's actually something rather important but you just won't know.i just ran out of ideas how to deal with her.i feel bad for becoming more distant, but i can't handle being around her for too long. at least not when my grandpa isn't there as well.he's the only one who can make sense of her behavior sometimes and knows how to put a stop on it if she's taken away by her thoughts.you can't really have a normal conversation with her. 15 minutes and i got a huge headache. but you also can't treat her differently than any other person because she still picks up on that. she still does most of her tasks around the house which is obviously important because of consistency and just keeping her busy, but it's hard to tell when it's time to step in and how much is safe for her to do on her own. especially because she also has physical health problems, including rheumatism.we try to include her in everything going on.we also gave her an iphone because typing on a normal phone was too painful (and took too long if there was ever an emergency) and included her in our family group on whatsapp. she has an ipad to play games and read the news on. (obviously without access to any bank accounts, email,... anything important)that works well for the most part, but it starts to get a little more complicated. i remember one time she found an article online about how ladybugs start eating humans at night... and she believed it.... she also doesn't understand when a text message is clearly a joke and when to take it seriously. a while ago my brother sent a photo of his girlfriend digging a hole on their yard with the caption "if anyone has some bodies left to hide.... now is your time😁". she didn't actually think they were hiding corpses, but she also didn't fully understand it's just a stupid joke.and those things keep getting worse.if her state was already more severe, we could restrain her access to the internet, whatsapp etc., but for now that would be an overstep. and she absolutely needs a phone for emergencies.so we're currently caught in this weird in-between state where we can't take a lot of safety measures with her or do basically anything; where you can't treat her differently, but treating her the same as anyone else doesn't quite work anymore; where you see more and more problems coming up, but there's not much you can do yet. neither for her, nor to make it easier for yourself.it's just exhausting.and it's hard to balance between being there for them and making sure you're not sacrificing your own sanity.

my mother is a stay at home care giver for my grandmother (84) who has had dementia for.... many many years. this has become something i'm used to, i will be forgotten, mistaken for my aunt or mother, i'm used to it. but in the last 48 hours everything has taken a sudden turn. my grandmother started to have delusions. my mom told me today she hasn't been able to sleep for more than 4 hours at a time because my grandmother keeps getting up and walking around the house yelling. but it wasn't untill she told me exactly what she was saying that it really broke my heart."where is my mom? i want my mom!" "my mom's car is outside, someone needs to call her! she's walking home alone in the cold, she needs her car!" "i want to see my mom, where is my mom?" "call my mom i want to talk to my mom!" "where are my brothers, why is no one home""why is no one home for christmas, where is everyone?""where am i? why am i alone?"my mom and aunt immediately started doing research into what to do and how to handle it. they ended up enlisting my cousin to call and tell her that he picked up her mom and she was at his house. she immediately started asking to talk to her, and he simply said that she was sleeping and would return her call later.i've never really had anyone with similar experiences to talk to. i'm reaching out for any help or information anyone might think is worth giving, or generally just to talk. i also feel terrible for my mom and all the stress she's under. needed to vent/unsure what to do at this point.

Guess I shouldn't quit my day job ... or advocate for myself. Yikes.
so i (26f) am in the process of selling my father (with dementia)'s house, we have showings scheduled all weekend and are staying in an airbnb. everything went so harmoniously the first part of our trip. unnaturally so. my fiance (27m) and i were waiting like there was a ticking time bomb about to go off, knowing something would go wrong. he'd overestimate his capacity or lose his temper or all of the above. lo and behold, it happened. today i am running on four hours of sleep and communicated several times to everyone that i need today to rest, i do not feel capable of long car trips or walks and i've had some very emotionally distressing personal things happen in the past 48 hours. of course, this is the day my dad woke up early and made tea and had a lot of energy and desire to be out and about. he gets antsy easily and usually at home, is able to spend time outdoors/work in the garden. (he also isn't great at sensing what his body is realistically capable of doing without hurting himself, which has been an ongoing source of stress) he said he wanted to go for a walk. i explained that my fiance or i could go with him, but i personally do not feel up to it, and can't speak for if my fiance does. he was okay with, but not thrilled with, the idea. so my dad said "well i'll just go by myself" which led to a whooole discussion about how he might not recall where the airbnb is, i don't want him getting lost, or losing track of time - there's times he'll be walking around all day without being aware of it. then he got stuck on this as me taking away his independence, and keeps saying in a loop "all you want me to do is sit and watch tv" (which yes, would be so much easier, and usually satistifes him when he realizes he wore himself out) he ended up leaving for a walk. we set conditions; if he wasn't back in 30 minutes, my fiance would look for him. since i was so frustrated, i forgot to make sure he had a mask and the address of the airbnb. immediately i realized this, wrote down the address, and had my fiance bring it to him. he had to walk pretty far; apparently he was walking fast - he asked someone if they'd recently "seen someone who looks just like me" - they said "yeah, the guy not wearing a mask?" :( :( (side note - we live in the bay area, where we've had a mask mandate since march, this has been an ongoing source of difficulty for him to remember and comply with consistently)my dad came back in better spirits not long after, but felt insulted that i needed to make sure he had the address. i had apologized and de-escalated, and was ready to let everything go, then he kept trying to argue with me. so i said "i'm going to listen to music and work on house stuff and not engage in this conversation anymore", and stopped. i gave him some time before talking to him again and offering to make some tea for us. he accepted and we talked for a few minutes, somehow the subject of me singing came up. he said "i've never heard you sing" - he has. i was extremely into choir in high school, i remember singing to him songs in german and italian that i knew at the time, and played guitar/sang for him too. at the time he was never impressed and would talk about other singers he liked more. but since he insisted, i let him know i had some songs that i wrote available to listen to on youtube, and agreed to play one (with the caveat that they were like 8-10 years old, i was a teenager, not highly skilled, etc). my fiance at least had nice things to say. i noticed it had a lot more views than i remembered when i was younger so that was a boost to my self-esteem! then my dad says "don't quit your day job!" ... i really have been wanting to get back into singing/playing guitar, i stopped due to lack of confidence in myself, i really don't need my art to be insulted by anyone right now, especially not my dad.i know his distorted perception of reality could very well apply to my singing, and that he never got to be around when i was a child to understand that's not something you ever say to your child, no matter how old they are, when they show you their art. i don't know if he said that to intentionally try to get a rise out of me, or if he really thinks that's an acceptable thing to say.  my fiance understanably also got upset seeing my own father insult my music (he's a musician too and 100% gets how hard it is) and we all ended up arguing again :( i was able to de-escalate by focusing on the nice things my fiance said to me, and his offer to give me constructive feedback in the future, and by disregarding my dad continually insisting that he did not insult me. i just want to have some peace and calm and not have our relationship be so tumultous. the whole reason i'm selling the house is to be able to pay for his care; he definitely needs in-home help, or to be put in a facility (which is our long term goal). i also am going to be stuck financially relying on him as we move to a lower cost of living area; i have poa so logistically i can handle it, but i am so not looking forward to him dangling that over my head and saying that means he can say or do whatever he wants with no repurcussions.   i know this is a lot. does anyone have tips for coping with stressful situations like this, or how to set boundaries that i be treated with respect in a way that doesn't further escalate the situation?

Grandfather in advanced stage
i'm not sure what the intent of this post is. just wanted to get this out somewhere. my grandfather who turned 93 this year is now in advanced stage of his dementia (which was diagnosed 2-3 years back). today my parents took him to the hospital because he was dehydrated, not eating, and non-cooperative. i'm afraid he is not going to make it and i can't stop crying even though we knew for a while that this is what it's going to look like. to give some background, i live in another country, far away from my family. my grandfather has lived with us his whole life (and my whole life since i was born). he looked after me my whole childhood when my parents would go to work, from wiping my butt to cooking me emergency meals, to solving my exams and helping me study he was always there. my mom retired from her job few years back and i moved to another country about 3 years ago. his dementia symptoms were sort of always there (forgetfulness, anger, etc) but we always attributed that to general ageing. when it got worse, my parents had him diagnosed as we found out he has dementia. my parents have been caring for him 24/7 and i have so much love and respect for my family seeing the way they have been handling it. he's my dad's father but my mom has been the primary caretaker for him and she cares for him like she would for a baby, she even says he's her baby now. it's incredible and very humbling to look at my parents dealing with this even though they are themselves getting older (mid fifties and sixty). their entire lives for last 2 years have been revolving around him. my mom feeds him, cleans him, takes care of his daily medications, entertains him and now even sleeps in his room so he doesn't accidentally hurt himself. my dad is still working a job but mostly from home now so he helps a lot as well and together my parents couldn't have done a better job. i feel horrible that they have to deal with this but i haven't seen them complain a bit about it ever. even when my grandfather throws fits (sometimes even hitting them, though it's more like a baby's fit) they take it sportingly because they know that he's not doing it intentionally and it's out of his control. i'm just so proud of my parents and i love them so much but it kills me to see how demanding this is for them and i can't go there now because of the complications from the pandemic. even now as he's in the hospital, my mom told me she misses him because she is so used to having him around and now that he's not there she doesn't have much to do. my dad is with him in the hospital now but i'm way too scared to ask for updates. no outcome looks like a good one. although this is so painful for me, i am only grateful that i have such amazing parents who are sticking up for their parent in the hardest of times. i  just came here to rant that i cannot imagine my life without my grandpa because he's always been there (even right in the next room for most of my life), but it might soon be time to let him go :(

Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?
hi all,my dad was diagnosed with mci (pre-dementia?) early in 2019. things are going well, but i could use some advice on one set of symptoms: a lack of interest in things he used to enjoy and a generally passive attitude toward physical decline.  brief history: he used to go to the gym if not every day, every other day. he was chatty. he walked the dog. he ran errands and loved keeping track of appointments on the house calendar. he worked part-time.this is pre-2019. early in the diagnosis there was a period where things were very dire. suicide attempt, manic episodes, hospitalization. things have improved incredibly since then and i am so grateful. now, the only concern is how we (mom and i) should react to the stabilized "new" way of life. most of the day he spends watching tv. whatever's on, pretty much from morning to night. he doesn't like leaving the house. he declines offers to go on walks. he declined the idea of getting an exercise bike. he drinks beer and forgets how many he's had, he forgets to eat. physically, has rapidly started showing his age and losing muscle mass. mentally, his long-term memory is stable but his short-term memory (what did you have for lunch?) is gone. he often admits he's just passing time. he has resisted and declined therapy.does this sound familiar to anyone? what's the best way to respond? one thing i've come to realize as i type is that the "approach" so far has been to try and coerce him back to his old way of life: chores, walks, phone calls to friends. this strikes me as very unempathetic and i am embarrassed to admit it. not surprisingly, it has generated more fights than anything else. ultimately if this lifestyle makes him happy, and he chooses it, i can make myself comfortable. i just don't get the sense that he is happy. i worry he's wasting away on purpose. if there are resources you've found helpful or terms i should research i would really appreciate that. any kind of response is welcome as this is a new and pretty painful dimension of my life right now. thank you.

Mother living alone, minimal help, mental state rapidly deteriorating. I'm worried about her hurting herself or others and am not sure what to do.
my mother has been living with [dystonia]( for approximately the last dozen years.  this has been a nightmare unto itself.  as a part of her dystonia treatment, she takes a range of drugs in addition to medicinal botox treatment (to stop the muscle movements) every 10 weeks.  i've known that she abuses these drugs - most notably klonopin and trazodone - for a long time.  her doctors are also well aware, and continue to prescribe them.  in the last 2-3 years, the botox has begun to effect her ability to move her mouth to speak.  my mothers solution to this has been to doctor-bounce until she found a doctor willing to prescribe her stimulants.  she is now taking so much modafinil and adderall (in addition to klonopin) that she speaks / slurs at the rate of a high-speed radio ad.  her doctors know that she is taking far more than prescribed - to the point of hitting legal limits - but are, under pressure from her, tweaking prescriptions and continue to fill her drug fix.&amp;#x200b;the combination of the drugs and the underlying illness have been devastating.  she forgets everything - including how much of her drugs she has taken, leading her to take more.  she's also incredibly abrasive (and frankly, a bitch) to literally everyone, taking a huge toll on her support network.  she has sort of 1 friend left, who is now mostly checked out after she broke his nose after something stupid (got her the wrong coffee order, something like that).  i am her only family left - my father / sister, her siblings, and her parents have all given up on her after she's done terrible things to them. she got into a fistfight with her long-time housekeeper, after accusing her of stealing all of her jewelry.  i flew down to help with the situation, and we found all of the jewelry hidden, by my mother, around the house.  crazy places - diamond earrings in the freezer, pearl necklaces under the cutting boards, gold bands in the couch cushions.  i bought her a safe, and assembled all of the jewelry in there.&amp;#x200b;earlier this year she tried to kill herself.  she called me first.  i was 1,000 miles away and called the local police.  she got into a fist fight with the local police, who arrested her, and had her committed to a psych ward.  on the order of a judge, she got out of the psych ward in march, and proceeded to buy a gun.  she's lost the gun multiple times, and has accused various people of stealing it.  as of today, she still has the gun.  i've told her to put it in the safe, and don't know if she's complied.&amp;#x200b;additionally, with her disease and the drugs, she's damaged her kidneys and stomach, and now has severe [gastroparesis]( which prevents her from eating most things and requires active care to her diet which she's not taking.  as a result, she is now bedridden 50% of the time, and struggles keeping her balance / going up and down her stairs.  despite this, she still drives, and has multiple reckless driving citations which her excellent lawyer has somehow gotten her out of / she still has a license.&amp;#x200b;this week, she's almost burned her house down twice - once cooking pasta, requiring a fire department visit, and again by exploding an electric kettle by putting it over a stovetop burner.&amp;#x200b;i can't stand to keep watching this, but truly do not know what to do.  i called her doctor that knows her best / is prescribing all of her drugs and asked him to call me back.  he called her instead of me, and she is now furious that i tried to go around her back.  she has a part time assistant who is in for a few hours a week who keeps me posted + has stuck around despite being treated terribly (for now), but she is also at the end of her rope.  if she quits / is fired, my mother will be 100% alone, and im convinced a danger to herself and others.&amp;#x200b;what do i do?  what can i do?  how do i stop this?

Father is not receiving proper care from his caregiver (wife). I have been left in the dark and do not know what to do to get him the help he needs.
my father had a stroke 6 or so years ago that left him with vision and some mental impairments. from what i understood at the time, his stroke would most likely lead to dementia.i do not live near him, but talk to him almost everyday on the phone. i had some concerns he was having some memory loss problems by some of the things he would say. i figured if anything was really wrong, his wife would inform me. i was wrong. when i've asked to talk with her on the phone, she says she can't because, "he's always around." the most i've gotten from her was that, "your dad is a pain in the ass." it's kind of a long story, but his wife never wanted to take any help or advice i had to offer over the years, so i just let them be and handle their situation as they saw fit.i recently got a call from her daughter saying things were really bad there and she doesn't know what to do. my father had been behaving really bizarre and his wife wouldn't take him to the va.a few weeks ago, i took a trip there to assess the situation. they are living in filth. my father seemed ok, although really paranoid. i explained to her what needed to be done to get her help as a caregiver through the va. i offered to have someone come in to clean their house and suggested different resources to take the weight off of her. no advice or help was taken.this morning, i received a call from my father saying that, "this is going to sound crazy, but we can't find our house. we've been looking all night, and i'm in a house, but it's not mine." i asked to speak to his wife, who agreed with him that they didn't know where their house was (to not upset him). i asked her what was going on. she will not tell me, says it's a long story. i pushed on why she's not taking him to the doctor or hospital. she says she doesn't want to do that and she's worried he'll get baker acted. she assured me they would see his doctor tomorrow.now, this has been going on for sometime as i come to find out. i want my father to get the help he needs, but his wife won't even tell anyone his doctor's name or number. i am at a lost as to what to do since she's his caregiver/spouse and i have no say/choice as to if he receives proper help. i am truly concerned for both of their safety. i'd appreciate any advice or resources. i'd like to add, they have no money, so hiring help or going to specialists is not an option. my father's been going to the va for years, but his wife will not use any of the va's resources. thanks

My grandmother is developing memory problems. I want to believe that it isn't dementia, and that there might be some hope for recovery. Am I being optimistic, or in denial?
my grandmother is 83 years old, and over the past month or two, she's been developing issues with her short-term memory. a few weeks ago, she developed a false memory of a recent telephone conversation that never happened in which my sister told her that she doesn't love her. then there was another instance from a couple days ago, relayed to me from my mom, in which she asked the date towards the beginning of the conversation, and then asked for it again towards the end. my mother believes that it is the beginning of dementia, and there's no getting better for my grandmother. i personally don't think we should lose hope so quickly.first of all, my grandmother recently had a minor stroke. although it was caught early on, a stroke is a stroke, and even the mildest ones can shake things up in the brain - sometimes temporarily, sometimes not. it seems as though her memory issues really began around the time that she got it, so i think it's a real possibility that her memory issues might be related.the other thing that gives me a bit of hope is the fact that over the past month, my grandmother's cognitive state seems to have improved slightly. she's not 100% back to the way she was before, but from what i gather, she's not confabulating false memories anymore either. when i interact with her on the phone, she's the same as she's ever been. i think we need to see how things progress, and if her memory issues don't go away within the next few months, then she should probably see a specialist to determine where her short-term memory loss may be coming from.however, my mother is adamant that my grandmother is developing dementia, and that there's no getting better for her. i've done research on memory loss in old age online, its causes, and what can be done to slow its progression (if not reverse it outright). when i sent my mother some links, her response was like this: "uau, your grandmother is getting dementia. her mind is failing because she's old. you need to stop denying it and just accept the reality of it. she's not getting any better." i told her that even in cases of dementia, there are treatment options that can help slow its progression. she shot me down: "no. her memory is going and there's nothing any of us can do about it. you're really grasping at straws here. it's okay to be optimistic, but you need to live in the real world." when i suggested that she should go see a specialist sometime to assess her memory issues and determine what their cause might be, my mom shot down the idea: "uau, bringing her to a specialist isn't going to do anything! it's not gonna make her better! you need to stop living in denial and just accept it, your grandmother is getting old!" even though my mom might be right, these conversations really depress me. i'm trying to keep hope alive, and she's doing everything she possibly can to extinguish it. and look, i'm not saying that my grandmother *isn't* developing dementia - she may be. she's 83 years old, and she's going to be 84 next year. memory loss is a normal part of getting old, alzheimer's or no. but i also don't want to throw up my arms and give in until we're absolutely certain, beyond any semblance of a doubt, that her condition can neither be treated nor go away on its own.is my optimistic outlook reasonable, or am i in denial? i don't think it's wrong to hope for a best-case scenario even with my grandmother's advanced age being taken into consideration.

I’m done.
well, at least i wish i was. i’m 31 years old and helping my dad care for his father with dementia. i have very little say in my grandfather’s care. i’m essentially just here in case my dad needs a break or needs to go out. yes, we have a nurse that comes in twice a week so we can both get out of the house, but covid limits our options in regards to safety. we can’t just take a vacation because america is irresponsible as fuck, so forget it. i’m just ready to shove the man in a home and be done. i’m tired of cleaning up urine, putting on diapers, and listening to him yell and scream in the night about how he doesn’t have any clothes to put on. i’m checked out. i want to bang my head against the wall until i am physically unable to anymore. i do not want to be here, but i can’t afford to move out and my dad physically cannot care for his father alone. i just want out. i can’t believe this is my life. let it end. and before you try to help me, you can’t. i have no say in his care. my aunt is a stupid selfish bitch who treats me like a child. she’s flat out told me i have no say. i don’t even know why i stayed after she said that to me. did i mention she’s coming for thanksgiving? my entire family is going to die of covid if they get it. she’s so incredibly selfish. i hate my life right now.

Caring for my mother with dementia.
mending the broken pieces in the summer of 2014 my mother was diagnosed with dementia. at that time she was 63 and living with my grandmother in southern california. later that year, my sister and i made the decision to bring her out to colorado to live with me, until her death in spring of 2019. i find myself today, almost 7 years since her diagnosis, at a loss, unable to grasp who she was, or what she really meant to me. i have become completely numb, totally incapable of love. not knowing how to feel things anymore. i’m never particularly happy, never particularly sad. everything is just grey. recent events in my life have finally put large cracks in the dam holding back all the emotions i have been harboring, throughout the years. knowing what i was about to face, writing this story, was always the plan. somehow i knew it’s exactly what i needed to find myself again. this is the sorry about her and what i experienced, as i start to peel back the layers, understanding them and finally taking the time feel them. to begin this story, i must capture the essence of her and the relationship we had. i was born into this world by an extraordinary woman, not only was she a god fearing moral person, she was the person that always protected me. she never deceived me. in times of confusion, she would always steer me down the right path. she was mother, she was my rock! i don’t think i can recall a time she ever yelled at me in anger. don’t get me wrong, i did get yelled at as a kid, no! david was the most common phrase in my house growing up. it was never out of anger tho, only frustration from what i had just done, or was about to do. i was a handful, always into something. turn you head for a second and i was taking something apart, climbing up on the kitchen countertop or being a ham, performing a circus act in the hallway. i was a tornado of discovery, driven by an active imagination, with enough energy to fuel a power plant. how she survived, the trials and tribulations i put her through, i will never know. all that i know is that she did it with grace. she completely knew me, inside and out and had this peaceful way to guide me. i was born with a very strong will, she must have learned early on, the only way to lead me was by example. it was always the why and never the how. what it took for her to always remain loving and clam, in the midst of the chaos, i would create. this is what makes her the most extraordinary person i have ever known. what it truly feels like to be loved by your mother, is the love you can see on her eyes the second you walk into the room. time completely stops and all you can feel is love she has for you. this is how my mother loved me. the first year i’ll never forget the moment i decided she was coming to live with me. we were on a family vacation in hawaii and i stopped by her room to check on her. she was washing her contact lenses in the the sink. she already had one in her eye while washing the other vigorously under the running water. looking at me with a puffy red, squinted eye she said, “honey, this really burns”. she was washing the contact lens in the tap water of the sink. she must have been in there for a half hour, repeating the same process. moving her away from the sink, i grabbed a hand towel and ran it under some warm water. calmly placing it over her eyes, i reassured her everything was going to be ok. we then headed to the eye doc for a last minute eye exam. we got her pair of glasses, some pain relief eye drops and were on our way. seeing my mother in panic of pain and her not knowing how to stop it, was the moment reality set in. it was very similar to the “loosing cabin pressure” sene in fight club. that moment i knew it was my job to take over. a week later, she came out to colorado. oh man did my mom love elvis, our vacation in hawaii was epic. we saw a elvis impersonator and she thought he was the real deal. it was like a time warp back to the 60’s for her. singing and dancing the whole time, she couldn’t sit still. after the show she got to meet him, we took some pictures for her and he gave her his scarf. just before we left he gave her a kiss on the cheek. she was completely glowing the rest of the trip. the scarf he gave her was wrapped around her neck or on her wrist the rest of the year. i must have washed that thing a thousand times. i tried to make everything about elvis when we got home. picked up a giant diner statue at a swap meet and tons of vinyl records. elvis was playing regularly around the house this year. there’s a 50’s diner close to my house, where we would have breakfast a couple times a week. she always had the same thing, strawberry french toast with scrambled eggs and a strawberry milkshake. i remember being very ambitious that year, i was on a mission to find a solution that will slow the progression of her disease. we went to doctor after doctor trying to get a solid plan of attack. her insurance was still a california hmo plan the and was nothing but thorn in my side. every doctor had a different opinion and they all seemed scared of their own shadows. they were all unwilling to try alternative medications or treatments i found in europe. after countless visits in multiple practices we found a young doctor willing to try something new. he had a let’s give it a try and see attitude. this was a breath of fresh air and i started to get my hopes up again. two weeks later he left the practice and we couldn’t see him anymore. we had to start all over again, that was a very depressing moment, i started smoking again that day. i was on a job site talking about my mom with a client and she turned me on to a article about peter falk. apparently peter developed early onset dementia after a dental visit and died soon after. knowing my mom suffered from periodontal disease her whole life, i scheduled a dental check up for her the next day. the appointment a the dental office went very well. the staff was amazing, i was able to stay by her side the entire time keeping her calm and making her laugh as a means of being distraction. after a panoramic x-ray, the doctor had a ton of questions. i remember the doctor thinking she had been in a horrific car accident or something. the x-rays looked like a scene from a science fiction horror movie, screws and wires everywhere. my mom had a cosmetic surgery to correct a overbite just a year before. i didn’t know how extensive it really was until that day. they also had her on a daily dose of benadryl for almost a year. with the connections to benadryl and dementia, i found during a previous hunt. i convinced myself, that’s exactly what’s to blame. i told myself this countless times and started to become angry. chain smoking a pack of cigarettes later, i realized i had created a false hope. when that hope was crushed, i just started to blame. after some deep soul searching, i remembered what i was taught growing up. my mother taught me, nothing is to be gained from anger but a battle fueled by rage. the only thing you can hope to accomplish with that mindset is, annihilation. battles are won though compassion and understanding. she would have told me, “life’s a crap shoot, there are no guarantees for anyone, just make the best with what you have and move forward.”she had another had saying, “when the going gets tough, the tough get going.” that i never really grasped it until that moment. my outlook on the situation completely changed and it only became about making the best of it. nobody is to blame, it just is. if she’s happy and safe, that’s all that matters.getting back to this mindset is exactly what i needed to be reminded of today. sometimes life beats me down and i loose site of who i am. mom and i were starting to get a routine going then. it took a couple weeks to figure it out. 7am is breakfast. she likes to have a cheese omelet with a slice of toast most days. i can usually sneak in a protein shake, if she’s hungry enough to eat the whole omelet. the nanny comes at 8:30 to give her a bath and hang out for a couple hours. that usually lasts until 10. i’d head out to work until 1 and usually come back to mom in her room changing clothes. she’ll put on everything in her closet clean or dirty. it’s very hard to keep track of the clean clothes vs the dirty ones. it’s ok for now i’ll just do laundry every day, she has fun playing dress up, i thought to myself. we usually head out to lunch around 2. there’s a local bar/restaurant that know us well. we always sit in the same spot and she always gets the same food grilled cheese and a heineken. we hang out for about 45min while i control the music form an app in my phone. she had no idea i’m doing this and gets surprised every time elvis comes on. we make it back to the house, walk around the half block to see the horses, she calls them the big dogs and finish the day with friends on tv until she’s ready for bed. it’s one of her favorites and will keep her calm if she has a beer in her hand. this routine stays relatively consistent the whole year. i start to notice little bits of her cognitive function disappearing, she looses about 10 words each week. this is pretty hard to watch unfold. conversations started with complete sentences and her, mostly aware of her surroundings. now she just has a few little phrases to describe everything and no idea where she is. i first started to pay close attention to the decline when we were brushing our teeth in the main bathroom together. i handed her a toothbrush with some paste on it. i always make a quick joke. this time it was, now this isn’t for your nose. that one always made her laugh. this time she didn’t, she instead smeared the paste all over her face. looking at her completely confused, it felt like my heart hit the floor. it took everting i had to keep it together. i called her a silly goose and said, that’s not supposed to go there, as i washed her face with a towel. i was completely overwhelmed by sadness. i smoked a couple cigarettes in the garage and continued on with the day. that was the first year. i’ll post more in the comments as i write about it.

I need help
please. please. i think i have dementia. i'm really young, 16 years old. i know it's unheard of for a person at such a young age to get dementia, but hear me out. what if i break the world record? what if i end up being the record breaker for who got dementia the youngest? that sounds incredinly arrogant, but i'm not. i do not want dementia. i do not... please. please. please.when i was young, i would constantly fall and hit my head. now, you may ask, how is that relevant? because i read that there's this thing called chronic traumatic encephalopathy. it's something people who've suffered head injuries get, and it leads to early dementia.and before you say, so what? that doesn't mean anything. fuck fuck fuck fuck i'm scared. please, help. so i've been unable to concentrate since last year. okay, not unable, but it's hard. and it's hard to think coherently. like one time i could be thinking about something, and the next my mind is blank. or maybe i'm asking myself what the hell i was thinming again. like sometimes, my train of thought goes too deep, and when i go back to the premise my mind's blank. and this is just an example, and i'm scared. my mind is blank most of the time. i have to literally force myself to think. it's hard to hold conversations too, but that might be because of anxiety... anyway. i miss the old days where thoughts came naturally. came fluidly. not artificially. not repeated thoughts in place of fruitful conclusions or inferences or links to other topics. i miss those days. now i struggle. it's an internal fucking battle. it's like trying to break through a wall in my head. you know the feeling? oh, and my memory, as in not thought memory if you know what i'm saying but my memory as in what it's generally regarded as. i can't remember shit. when i for example want to fill my water bottle. i would wash it, put it by the sink, and leave, with my water bottle still by the sink— and unfilled. or whenever i'm asked to remember what a person told me and i struggle to remember it. or when i talk to others and i forgot our subject. ok, as i said, that might just be anxiety, but it just screams something deeper. or when. look i can't even remember. what the fuck?????oh and here's a little something. last year, my absolute dumb fuck of a self thought it a good idea to hit myself in the head multiple times because i had the idea that if i did that, maybe i'd be able to be normal again. yeah, that didn't help. it probably even made my condition worse.don't let my wall of text deceive you. the amout of time i took to create this took at least 30 minutes, or even longer. please tell me what is wrong. please say i am wrong. please. i'm too young. i want to have a life. i want a job. i want meaning. i don't want to be a husk, and i don't mean this to offend anyone. please. i'd rather die than be incapacitated. an invalid. please please help. please. i can't express my desperation clearly and urgently enough through text. i hope you don't think i'm trolling. fuck. please don't. please.

SEETHING...
i think that's the word to describe how i feel today. i don't think in my entire life i have felt genuine anger over something so illusive and indefinable \~ other than the hideous word "dementia". i hate even the word today. it is stealing more bits and pieces than i am prepared to part with. i hate that i don't know why my daughter brought two little girls with her today and both of them called me nee\~nee. i thought i had only one very young granddaughter. nope, i have two. i forgot the precious little 3 or 4 year old one. i only knew the six year old. my husband was looking at pictures and starting talking about when we went to graceland for our 25th wedding anniversary, almost 40 years ago. looked at the pics and could not believe that was me at graceland. no memory of it at all. it's 2:00 in the morning and i asked my hubs why we didn't eat dinner tonight. he said we did. nope. don't even remember eating tonight. matter of fact not all day. extended family issues. got phone calls today and all facts are fuzzy and i'm jotting things down trying to keep it all straight. i had a total meltdown over something that didn't even happen that i thought did happen. my son was very gentle and said they would be more careful in the future and it so was not his fault or anyone else's for that matter. just \~ dementia. it nibbles and snacks at my memory, little by little and it seems like it is suddenly taking a devouring voracious bite out of all that is me! i hate dementia. i hate the word and everything it steals from everyone. i just need to cry.

This week has been awful
i've posted recently but i need someplace to vent about this week.  my sister is our mothers primary care giver. she needed to fly out to seattle and help her boyfriend load up a uhaul with their stuff and he is moving in with her and mom. i live a state away and have been working from home so it made sense for me to bring my home office to moms and stay the week while my sister was gone.  it has been so fucking stressful. first, we thought mom had a stroke (we being me and my sisters best friend who used to work taking care of ill inmates at a prison) so we called 911. half her face was slack when she got up from her nap and she wouldn't raise her right arm. thankfully it wasn't a stroke and she seemed fine by the time the ambulance arrived.  then i noticed mom had a very large wound in her elbow. the next day i could see into her arm! the hole was all the way in and i could see under her skin and see her elbow bone! we called 911 again. they came and got her and the er just sent her back home with the same f'n bandage we sent her with and an antibiotic she has to take every 12 hours and has to sit up for 30 minutes after taking it and drink lots of water. i struggle to get water into this woman and she sleeps so much!  my sisters friend isn't able to help me as much as she did the first few days. i am not used to seeing mom this far gone because i only come up once a month and she is worse each time i come. i feel alone and overwhelmed. i haven't showered this week at all, forget to eat and my legs hurt from all the running back and forth in the house. and all this while trying to work a full time job from 8-5 mon-fri that is high demand and i have 9 hour long conference calls that i am hosting and the primary speaker on.  i'm struggling so hard. i really hope i can get a shower tonight. i did make myself eat something today at least.  my sister was supposed to be home today but because of poor planning on her part, she didn't even leave washington until today and has a 30+ hour drive to oklahoma. i've already requested monday off work so i can recharge from this experience.  i don't expect anything from this post. i really just needed to vent about the situation. i've cried more this week than i have in years. i have mad respect for you all who care for your loved ones full time and for my sister who is always here with mom.  it hurts to see my mom this far gone. :(

i was told my neighbor has dementia, and i really need advice.
she’s always been very off. trespassing on my and other’s property, constantly coming over for no reason, looking in my windows, in my shed, etc. for years. a few days ago there was an incident of her tampering with mail, and again trespassing on my property. over the past two years, she has clearly been declining, but she’s done this type of behavior for over 20 years. i’m 22, and i live with my mom. we’re both tired of having to tell her to not trespass, to leave us alone. we both are getting to the point where we don’t even feel safe because she’s always doing something. (when i was younger she used to go outside if i was on the phone and listen in on my phone calls.) the other day her son told us she “has dementia” and “has no idea what she’s doing” but like i said, this behavior is not new, it’s just worse now. she was of sound mind 20 years ago doing these things. he said she’s “harmless” and i told him dementia is no excuse for her to be on my property or making anyone in the neighborhood uncomfortable. she lives with her very elderly husband who is also out of it. they live alone and both still drive. i’m appalled by how her son is handling this situation. he is probably in his 40s. her and her husband should not be living alone together, and they should absolutely not be driving. they could kill someone. my question is, what do i do? one of my other neighbors had told her husband he cannot let her go outside alone, because she’s at the point where she forgets where she is and who people are. she’s not currently violent, but i’m afraid she will turn violent or walk into my house if my doors are unlocked. one day i even found her on my porch. this behavior isn’t okay, and i’m worried she’ll end up hurting herself accidentally or someone else.

I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it.
this is my first post, and i am filled with guilt. please bear with me. it is long for context.my dad has been diagnosed with dementia, and i have long suspected that he is a narcissist. i had a very superficial relationship with him prior to his formal diagnosis due to his narcissistic traits. his other children do not speak to him much because of this, and they have not been willing to help. i have been his sole caretaker since 2020. this is the hardest thing i have ever done as he is verbally and psychologically abusive.today, the pharmacy delayed a prescription that my dad started in my absence. he stated that he had gone to the doctor and spoke with a pa, who switched him back to one of his former heart medications. this would be the second refill of the renewed prescription. i thought about it for a while, and i started to wonder if the prescription was delayed because my dad is not supposed to be taking this medication at all. this would not be a surprise. my father has stopped and started medications randomly as well as created scenarios around why he started/stopped the meds in the past. i went to him and told him that the refill may have been delayed due to a possible drug interaction, and that i would ask the pharmacist tomorrow. this led to a long conversation where he asserted that he had already been taking this medication for 30 days and that it wouldn't make sense for the pharmacy to take issue now. i disagreed. i said that i was here 30 days ago, and that he did not have that medication in his medication bag. he argued a bit, so i asked for the empty bottle. he said he must have thrown it away. i abruptly ended the conversation, as i felt like i was falling into the "reasoning" trap that caregivers are told to avoid so that the patient doesn't get agitated.i thought about it alone some more, and suddenly remembered that i did see the new medication 30 days ago. i had asked him about it then, and he told me who refilled it. his story didn't line up in a few ways, so i checked the refill date and it was indeed recent. so it did not seem like he just randomly opened one of his old pill bottles and start taking it. i had been relieved and forgot all about it.upon realizing i was wrong, i felt awful. i had been so stern with him and suggested that what he was saying about having taken the medication for a month already was wrong. i weighed telling him. i need him to trust me, so i felt it really important to be honest. but i also worried that this would make him more adamant about being correct when he truly does mess up his meds. the need for him to trust me won out, and i went to him and told him that i was mistaken, and that i do remember seeing the medication in his bag.he gave me a sort of sly smile that i have never seen before. he said, "do you see i'm not senile?" i never said he was senile, but he does have dementia and it manifests quite a bit in sometimes serious ways. i just said "i never said that. i just want to make sure you're not taking medications that interact." i turned to go and then he said, "i don't play with my medications. i take those right." that stopped me in my tracks. crap. he *doesn't* take his medications right. he takes the wrongs one/takes them improperly quite a bit, and his mixing up of medications was the chief concern of his doctors when he was discharged from the hospital. it was the reason why they said he needed a caretaker in the first place. i know caregivers make mistakes, but i think this one was particularly disastrous. i tried to let him no that he has occasionally been mistaken about his medications, and i just try to double check things now. this led to a really, really, bad argument that i had to walk away from. he does not agree that he ever suddenly stopped meds. (he has, and it scared me.)i feel guilty and like i do not know what i am doing. i have probably just destroyed my chance at him cooperating with me regarding his medications long terms. it was so hard to even get him to stick to a medication schedule, use his pill box, and not take whichever meds he feels like.sorry for the length. i just feel so disappointed in myself and worried about how this will impact the future. i don't even know what i am asking for here. maybe i just needed to share.

I don’t like the person my mom is now. I feel so much guilt.
my mom is 91 and has alzheimer’s and vascular dementia. the  last three years have been the worst. my 94 year old father still cares for her at home. my mom has always been a bit of a narcissist and everyone has always had to be very careful to not make her angry. but prior to the dementia, i was able to spend quality time with her and we would enjoy each other’s company. but now she is so mean and paranoid and takes her frustration out on everyone, especially my father. i know it’s the disease. but it is so hard to even try to have a conversation with her now because she hates everyone. she has only one friend who still talks to her. i live about four hours away from her and have not been able to visit her since february. i call her a couple of times each week. last year i was visiting her and my father about every other month, but the last few visits were cut short because she would get so angry with me over nothing and would insist i leave and not come back. within a week she would forget and say it never happened or it was my father’s fault. but now she says the most hurtful things to me and she constantly curses at my dad and constantly says he’s having affairs and is trying to kill her. my dad is a saint, does everything from shopping, cooking, cleaning and taking care of the house and yard. he never complains and never talks back when she yells and screams at him. i hate seeing her act this way. and i know... it’s the dementia. and i feel so guilty because i don’t want to be around her now. she doesn’t let me talk to dad in person or on the phone unless she is there to hear everything. my dad has to call me from his cell when he’s away from the house if he wants to talk about how my mom is doing. i feel so sad and miss the person she used to be. but no matter how much i try to talk about positive experiences from the past, she quickly turns the conversation to how much she hates my dad and me because she says i always take his side. i feel like there is nothing we can talk about anymore. she is always angry and hurtful. i know i am just venting. thanks for listening.

Just wanted to share a dream I had about my grandma.
i’ve had many dreams about her, most were nightmares which my family reckons is caused by when i was her carer. i had zero training and taking care of my grandma as she deteriorated was very much a learning experience that left me in a very bad place by the time she was moved into a care home.  usually my dreams of her would be her crying out to me at night and me not being able to move or get to her. or her coming back from the care home and me being told i have to care for her again (i love my grandma but i couldn’t bare to do it again) but this dream was different.i was on a train and i spotted my grandma walking down the cart looking for a seat. at first i was freaked out because my first thought was “how did she get out of the care home and how is she walking!?” as my grandma was pretty much bed bound by the time she was moved to the carehome. i called out to her and she started calling me by my mums name and sat down beside me. i can’t remember much of our conversation but she was very confused thinking another random person sat opposite us was my sister and i just went along with it because that’s the one thing i remember doing whilst i cared for her. she snuggled up to me and seemed content, for the first time in a while i didn’t feel anxiety when speaking with her but i remember thinking about what i was going to do when we reached our destination and how i was going to get her around as she has such poor mobility. eventually we arrived at our stop and i helped my grandma off the train and i turned to look for a member of staff to see if they could find us a wheelchair or point me to a phone but instead i saw my grandad’s car with him standing beside it smiling. my grandad died about 10 years ago but he felt so real and looked exactly as i remember him. i asked him why he was here and he said “i just want to say how proud i am of you. it’s okay, i’ll take it from here.” i gave him a hug and a kiss on the cheek as told him how much i love and miss him and he said the same. he got my grandma into his car and they drove away. i woke up and i thought i’d feel sad but i feel happy? i get emotional but it’s just been so long since i’ve seen my granddad and he really felt like he was right in front of me. i always hoped that he would feel proud of me for what i was doing and he’d be watching me from afar somehow. im by no means religious but i do like to think we aren’t entirely gone when we die, even if it’s just to live in others memories and dreams. my grandma has said a few times to my mum that she’s going to meet my grandad at the bus stop and i honestly feel like when people die they go with those that they loved the most or at least that’s what i like to think. my granddad loved trains and vehicles in general so it was so fitting to see him collecting her from the station. i’m just rambling now but i don’t have anyone to share it with right now and i wanted to make a note of it while it was still fresh in my mind so i don’t forget it. i know it was only a dream but it’s given me so much comfort and inner piece and i really feel like i needed that.

How do you tell when things have gone south, when they were never good to begin with?
i know this is another post asking "does my loved one have dementia?" but i don't know where else to turn.my grandma has always been tough and at yes difficult. she's blunt to you but sensitive about herself. loud and boisterous, yet sulky and pouty if you accidentally offend her over the smallest thing. i love her, but she is complex.my job became work from home so i moved across the state to live with her during covid. i was immediately shocked with just how, well, unpleasant she acted. irritable, snide over small things. but she's always been a difficult person so i thought it was the stress of a global pandemic and me being at home with her.then she forgot about something we did last december. it wasn't a big deal, so i just reminded her again. later she told me it confused her that she couldn't remember that event--even that didn't worry me. we all forget little things, right?then one day, quite out of the blue, she accuses me of forging her signature on something. i was shocked to say the least. i gently reminded her that the document she was referring to, she was out of town and i asked if i could sign on her behalf. i doubt i'm the first child or grandchild to sign for a parent/grandparent when they weren't available! she didn't believe me. i pointed out this document required her ssn, how could i have known that if she didn't tell me it (i don't have access to these type of documents of hers)? she was silent.the moment that got me reflecting on this happened tonight. we are out of town and she got into a fight with my dad over some childhood memories. the overall memories were right, but dad kept correcting her on small things. "no mom we lived at x not y then" or "that wasn't when i was in highschool, it was when i was a little boy, mom" and so on. she became upset and offended, and turned on me saying that when we get home to [city], i should move out. the problem is that the city she mentions... i've never lived. it's the city she grew up in. she has never, ever, ever mixed up something like that before. i feel sick. how do i know if her mood has changed, if she's always been moody and sort of dark? how do i know what's normal memory loss with age, and what's abnormal? she's very very smart, could she have been hiding this for some time? when do you take her to a doctor, and does she need to be the one to make an appointment etc? what do i even say to her?

i know this is another post asking "does my loved one have dementia?" but i don't know where else to turn.my grandma has always been tough and at yes difficult. she's blunt to you but sensitive about herself. loud and boisterous, yet sulky and pouty if you accidentally offend her over the smallest thing. i love her, but she is complex.my job became work from home so i moved across the state to live with her during covid. i was immediately shocked with just how, well, unpleasant she acted. irritable, snide over small things. but she's always been a difficult person so i thought it was the stress of a global pandemic and me being at home with her.then she forgot about something we did last december. it wasn't a big deal, so i just reminded her again. later she told me it confused her that she couldn't remember that event--even that didn't worry me. we all forget little things, right?then one day, quite out of the blue, she accuses me of forging her signature on something. i was shocked to say the least. i gently reminded her that the document she was referring to, she was out of town and i asked if i could sign on her behalf. i doubt i'm the first child or grandchild to sign for a parent/grandparent when they weren't available! she didn't believe me. i pointed out this document required her ssn, how could i have known that if she didn't tell me it (i don't have access to these type of documents of hers)? she was silent.the moment that got me reflecting on this happened tonight. we are out of town and she got into a fight with my dad over some childhood memories. the overall memories were right, but dad kept correcting her on small things. "no mom we lived at x not y then" or "that wasn't when i was in highschool, it was when i was a little boy, mom" and so on. she became upset and offended, and turned on me saying that when we get home to [city], i should move out. the problem is that the city she mentions... i've never lived. it's the city she grew up in. she has never, ever, ever mixed up something like that before. i feel sick. how do i know if her mood has changed, if she's always been moody and sort of dark? how do i know what's normal memory loss with age, and what's abnormal? she's very very smart, could she have been hiding this for some time? when do you take her to a doctor, and does she need to be the one to make an appointment etc? what do i even say to her?

Mother with early-onset Alzheimer's and I'm feeling completely lost.
throwaway because i don't want such a personal text on my main account.i'm  35m. my mother (59f) has finally been diagnosed with early-onset  alzheimers a few weeks ago. she had been having symptoms for a few  years, which we always attributed to the strong medications she takes  for a rare vascular disease she has. her dementia progressed very, very  quickly. just two years ago she was a little forgetful but you could  have a normal conversation with her, she still drove herself to errands,  etc. one year later she's completely taken by the dementia, having very  aggressive episodes (she tries to hit my father constantly - she's  never been aggressive before), paranoia, can't hold a memory for more  than 5 minutes, forgets she's already home and gives tantrums wanting to  "go home". you know, all the symptoms of alzheimer in a moderate to  late stage.i live about 200 miles  away from her. she lives in a small countryside town with my father and  my elderly grandmother (her mother). i had been sort of a distant son  for the past decade because of relationship issues i had with them  growing up. nothing really traumatic, but my upbringing drove me away  from them. i moved to a big city and visited them about 3 or 4 times a  year, talking weekly-ish on the phone. now this is happening and i'm  getting closer to them again, especially my father, to give him support.  he is taking this pretty badly and is getting desperate, not knowing  how to deal with her condition. nobody is prepared for this. i'm trying  to visit them at least once a month, but covid makes me very afraid to  go. they're in a small town with very few cases, while i live in my  country's largest city with tens of thousands of cases. my fear is  unknowingly bringing the virus to them, since they all have high-risk  conditions if they're infected.my  father (63m) had to quit his job to become her 24/7 caregiver.  thankfully i have a good job in the city and i'm able to help them  financially, but i'm not rich by any means. he's still a few years away  from being eligible for retirement. i feel like she's getting quite  close to having to be put in a long-term care facility, which is crazy  expensive in my country. at the same time, she still has some good days  and we'd feel awful to send her away.to  add insult to injury, she has a lot of sisters but apart from one,  they're all ganging up against my father and making the situation worse.  we don't want their help, we just need them to not be part of the  problem. this is the hardest situation we have ever dealt with in our  lives and they keep making it worse out of pettiness, ignorance and  family drama.anyway, i guess i  just wanted to vent. i know plenty of people here are or have been in  similar situations. i'm open to advice or any kind of feedback.thank you for reading.

Very concerned about my dad
so, for reference, i am actually a registered nurse.  i'm not a psyc nurse, but working in the er exposes me to a good bit of alzheimer's and dementia patients.  i know this sounds bad, but when you see bad illnesses and death a lot, you kinda become numb to it.  i became very good at separating work from home, and actually having a family memeber with dementia just never crossed my mind.my day, 64 years old, fell a few months ago.  after the fall, he lost a lot of memory from things in the past year.  obviously i, as well as his doctor, agreed it was likely memory loss due to a concussion. fast forward a few months.  the memory has not returned.  a few weeks after the fall, i threw him a little birthday party.  yesterday when it was brought up, he had no memory of it.  he thought my 5 month old was over a year old.  so these things seem small, but my dad forgets nothing. like i didn't get away with anything as a teenager.  he worked in criminal justixe and did a lot of undercover work.  he could remember the license plate number of cars passing by our house hours later.  he is a very very sharp person.  at his last neurogist appoitment the doctor mentioned alzheimer's.  as a nurse, i believe she was very unprofessional and insensitive to my parents. you don't just casually mention "oh maybe he has dementia or alzhimers, we will wait and see." of course he is upset.it really hit me last night that thus could be real.  my mom is in denial, but i see the signs.  little things he forgets, as well as big things.  he cant remember that he stayed at my house 2 night while i was in labor.  he forgot that his best friend had an aneurysm and was airlifted for major surgery.  he is trying so hard to remember things, but ye cant.  does this look like the begining of dementia? i think i know ths answer, but i just need to hear it.  being a nurse is a wonderful career and i am great with my patients, but it is a different ball game when it is family.  i feel lost and scared.  i know how thus disease can progress.  he is so independent and i can't imagime how he would feel to loose that.  any advice, stories, or insights are welcome.  thanks in advance.  and if i have 10000 misspelled words, forgive me.  i'm typing fast and have been up all night.

I feel so guilty, angry, and relieved.
i posted several months ago about my grandma who had dementia who eventually passed away in may after a severe decline that occurred seemingly without warning. she and i were extremely close when i was younger. she and now just my grandpa live on my street so i was always at their house growing up and everyone knew i’m the favorite grandchild. it was neither hidden nor thrown out there on purpose to rub in anyone’s face. everyone just knew.last night i was thinking about her and ran across a post where multiple people suggested those who were interested to listen to a youtube video that used music to represent the stages of dementia, but only if you were in the right space mentally. i should’ve listened. i listened to it and read the description box and it hurt me knowing that it was probably an excellent explanation of what she and others have gone through or are currently going through. at the very end when she had no idea that she was in the house she’d been in most of her life, my grandpa, my mom, and myself were the only ones she knew each and every time she saw us. the day she got home from the hospital, i came to visit and she knew who i was right away and tried so hard to carry on a normal conversation with me, asking me how i was and where i’d been. she studied me intently and told my aunt (her daughter who she couldn’t remember) that she was just looking at how pretty i was. i left the room and told everyone how she knew who i was because i didn’t get my hopes up for her to remember me. even though i didn’t mean to hurt their feelings, i’m sure i secretly did. i went back in with my mom who asked her if she knew who i was. she said, ”well yes, that’s [my name].” as if it was so obvious and she didn’t know why she was being asked. she had also forgotten she’d just seen me a few minutes before that and her eyes perked up. when it was time for them to pick her up to take her to the nursing home, i went in to tell her goodbye and my cousin said, “look, there’s [my legal name].” my grandma looked at me and corrected her, calling me the nickname she always had. it brings me joy knowing what few brain cells remained had me embedded deeply.she was in a lot of pain and hallucinated. it was just hard for me to digest seeing the woman who had taken care of me needing care from me. now that she’s gone, i’m really feeling it. by “it,” i mean guilt, anger, and relief.i feel guilty for being relieved that i am now able to carry on normal adult conversations without being asked the same question, verbatim, 40 times in an hour. i mean, for fucks sake, how many times do i have to tell you the party is next saturday, not this saturday? i am proud of myself for never getting too frustrated and saying, “you’ve already said/asked that!” i’d stay up all night to make sure she didn’t wander off in her car. luckily, she gave up her keys willingly, unlike her own mother who suffered the same fate. since i was pretty young when her symptoms exhibited themselves, it’s so frustrating and makes me angry when i try to think back at memories i had with her before the disease overwhelmed her and killed her while still leaving her alive because they are truly so far and few between. i’m just feeling some mixed emotions. it sucks. thanks for reading.

Could this have been dementia? (Sexually Inappropriate Behavior)
for the past four years i’ve lived with my grandparents as their caretaker. about a month ago, my grandma had a stroke and after a couple of weeks, unfortunately did not recover from it and passed away. content warning for in appropriate touching:two days before she died, while i was home alone with grandpa, he asked me if i would continue to stay with him as his caretaker after grandma passed away. i said yes, of course. he then got up for a hug, while i sat back in a recliner, so i didn’t think anything of it at first when his hand kept brushing my breast. i figured it was an awkward position for a hug, so i got up and stood up to hug him properly. but he kept touching my breasts and then my butt. tried to take my shirt off. started kissing my neck and saying things like “this feels good” and “you want to lay down with me?” i was in complete shock and let it go on for too long because i didn’t want to believe what was happening. but eventually i pulled away and made an excuse to leave and called mom. she called my uncle who came and talked to grandpa. i wasn’t there for the talk but when uncle came back out he said grandpa’s explanation was that i had been a lot more affectionate and said “i love you” a lot more lately, and grandpa just “had to see” if that meant something. (my explanation for my affections is that grandma was dying and i had realized i needed to be more affectionate to the people i love a lot more because life is too short.) mom later told me that a few days before the incident, grandpa talked to her about me living with him and apparently thought it would look suspicious to other people, which confused mom. like what’s suspicious about your granddaughter continuing to take care of you after she took care of you and your wife for four years? and grandpa had said “you know i’d never do anything to her.” and mom just kind of looked at him like “... i don’t think you’re her type. you’re too old and she’s gay.” said in a lighthearted joking way. but it’s made me realize that he has been thinking this way of me for multiple days. once my uncle and mom came to talk to him he expressed regret and said he doesn’t know what came over him. he also said some alarming things like “i don’t have any reason to live.” and we took away all his guns. my family has kept me away from him and i haven’t seen him since the funeral last month. mom stays with him now, he hasn’t done anything inappropriate to her and she says he just stays quiet and watches tv all day. he’s asked for us to forget about what happened and for me to come back. my folks have said no, even if i did want to do that. i’ve been doing research on dementia and have also started a job working with elderly patients. i’ve been wanting to blame this all on dementia, that it’s not the real grandpa that did this. it would be so much easier on me to think that. but grandpa hasn’t shown any of the warning signs of dementia. he’s sharp and does his bills and organizes his medicine and does all his daily tasks no problem. his personality is the same. i know inappropriate sexual behavior is common in those with dementia, but is that the case here? do people with dementia plan out the sexual behavior days in advance while knowing who the person is the entire time?or is it the grief of losing his wife of 65 years that caused him to do this? is that a possibility?i’m just grasping at straws here. i don’t want to believe that was the real grandpa that would do something like this.

I'm at a loss, what do I do? Serious advice/recommendation needed! (Explicit language)
us. i (34f, not living with, but visiting daily during the week) need some advice to help my mom. my dad has been very forgetful, he's happy one minute, pissed the next. he has days where he's awesome and aware and the story teller i remember from when i was a kid. then there are days when he thinks my mom has run off to be with "that guy" (no idea 🤷) again. my kids and i always go over after they get out of school, help with dinner, and go home, usually spending 3 or 4 hours per day. my mom used to work in nursing homes and has done a ton of home health jobs, and she's positive he's got dementia/ altzheimers.examples;he has a heart problem and should not be walking more than two miles per day. he walked to myuncle's house 7 times in the past 4 months, which is nearly twenty miles one way. on three of those occasions, he passed out walking home. doesn't remember any of it. he says he walks because she (my mom) doesn't answer him when he asks her to take him. he has never asked. i feel like this would be a good time to mention that he doesn't drive anymore because he went out and couldn't get home by himself, it took over a year to get my mom to admit it's not normal.he regularly confuses my son for my brother, who has been dead twenty years this july.he regularly calls my daughter by my name.he will be telling a story, get partially through and get angry because whoever he was talking to is telling the story wrong. yes, you read that right.he took off and was gone (this happens often, he walks) for several hours. when he came back he was really tired, but he told my best friend (who lives there to help out) that the third house he walked into, the guy told him to get the eff out of his house or he was calling the police. apparently he was looking for one of the cats.another time he told us that he had been up to the local high school watching the track meet. and that he thought it was (my brother's) track and field day, but he just couldn't find him anywhere. again, july my brother has been dead twenty years.he really treats my mom like she's literal garbage most of the time. he does it to me too, but if i'm not there, she gets it worse. it's not physical that i've ever seen. i don't really know that she would tell me if he did get physical.the problem is, when mom tries to talk to the doctor in front of dad, he gets pissed. says he's fine, just a little forgetful. he gets mad about a lot of things, really.anyway, i'm at a loss for what to do to help my mom.  i'm hoping that someone else has some helpful information about what to do next. my mom does not want to put him in a nursing home, so please don't jump to that.

My grandfather is causing more grief than my grandmother and she's the one with dementia.
i want to preface this, because it's probably going to make my grandfather sound like a bad person, and he's absolutely not.  he's one of the kindest, most generous, and loving people i've known in my life.  the issue is, he's 89, obviously slightly old school, and doesn't really know how to deal with my grandmother having dementia.  all my grandfather has done the past year is complain.  every. single. chance. he. gets.  it's almost impossible to have a normal conversation with him anymore, unless my grandmother is in the room.  he constantly wants to get family members alone and then goes on and on and on complaining about my grandmother and how difficult she is.  she forgot this today, she did that, she said this, she got mad at me for that, etc. etc.  it's getting to the point where none of us want to be alone with him.  and again, he's not a bad person, he loves my grandmother, he just has no idea how to cope with this.  what makes it worse, is my grandmother isn't even that bad yet.  she forgets things a bit, repeats herself a couple times a conversation, had trouble focusing sometimes, can't read the newspaper for more than a few minutes, and she can be kind of snappy.  but otherwise, she's "with it."  she knows who she is, who we all are, what's going on in the world, etc.  the most annoying part of this and my grandfather not really knowing how to emotionally cope with this......he is perhaps making things worse than they have to be.  for one, he's never taken her to a specialist.  their pcp "diagnosed" her based solely on what my grandfather told him.  we've begged him to take her to a specialist, but he insists he trusts his pcp (even though we all think he's a shit doctor and he has terrible reviews online).  she doesn't really follow the typical progression for dementia, and she's on a lot of medications for other issues that cause things like memory loss, anxiety, etc.  the family feels like that needs to be ruled out, but he refuses to bring her to a specialist.  we've also told him she might be a lot better on an anti-anxiety medication.  she has always had anxiety issues.  she had basically a mental breakdown back in her early 30's.  her anxiety is twice as bad these days, but she takes nothing for it.  he keeps saying "he'll see about that" but never follows through.  has anyone dealt with a parent or grandparent that was similar?  i'm really not sure what can be done.  i don't think any of us could get some type of medical proxy because despite these bad decisions my grandfather is technically of sound mind.  and on top of that, their pcp only gave my grandmother an "unofficial" diagnosis.  he didn't put it in her records, and they never spoke to her about it.  she insists she's fine.

i want to preface this, because it's probably going to make my grandfather sound like a bad person, and he's absolutely not.  he's one of the kindest, most generous, and loving people i've known in my life.  the issue is, he's 89, obviously slightly old school, and doesn't really know how to deal with my grandmother having dementia.  all my grandfather has done the past year is complain.  every. single. chance. he. gets.  it's almost impossible to have a normal conversation with him anymore, unless my grandmother is in the room.  he constantly wants to get family members alone and then goes on and on and on complaining about my grandmother and how difficult she is.  she forgot this today, she did that, she said this, she got mad at me for that, etc. etc.  it's getting to the point where none of us want to be alone with him.  and again, he's not a bad person, he loves my grandmother, he just has no idea how to cope with this.  what makes it worse, is my grandmother isn't even that bad yet.  she forgets things a bit, repeats herself a couple times a conversation, had trouble focusing sometimes, can't read the newspaper for more than a few minutes, and she can be kind of snappy.  but otherwise, she's "with it."  she knows who she is, who we all are, what's going on in the world, etc.  the most annoying part of this and my grandfather not really knowing how to emotionally cope with this......he is perhaps making things worse than they have to be.  for one, he's never taken her to a specialist.  their pcp "diagnosed" her based solely on what my grandfather told him.  we've begged him to take her to a specialist, but he insists he trusts his pcp (even though we all think he's a shit doctor and he has terrible reviews online).  she doesn't really follow the typical progression for dementia, and she's on a lot of medications for other issues that cause things like memory loss, anxiety, etc.  the family feels like that needs to be ruled out, but he refuses to bring her to a specialist.  we've also told him she might be a lot better on an anti-anxiety medication.  she has always had anxiety issues.  she had basically a mental breakdown back in her early 30's.  her anxiety is twice as bad these days, but she takes nothing for it.  he keeps saying "he'll see about that" but never follows through.  has anyone dealt with a parent or grandparent that was similar?  i'm really not sure what can be done.  i don't think any of us could get some type of medical proxy because despite these bad decisions my grandfather is technically of sound mind.  and on top of that, their pcp only gave my grandmother an "unofficial" diagnosis.  he didn't put it in her records, and they never spoke to her about it.  she insists she's fine.

MIL &amp; memory loss
i absolutely adore my mother in law. she’s the nicest lady around. over the past 5 years i’ve watched her decline. at first when i was getting to know her, i thought the repeated questions were normal. but over the years it’s become much more than that. we don’t live in the same city as our parents, but we come down and visit as much as we can. i tend to be the kid spending the most time with her, especially one on one. we come down multiple times a year and when my husband goes off with his dad, i’m with her. i see it first hand how bad it is. finally at the beginning of this year i convinced my husband it’s something the siblings need to sit down and talk to her about. i was really hoping someone would take this seriously and get her into a doctor and maybe we could do something to slow the decline down. they all sat down and in my opinion, beat around the bush. told her she needs to get healthy and go to the doctor and maybe get hormones. they agreed it would be the first step. but here we are months later and nothing has changed and no ones talking about it anymore. during the whole conversation that took place with her, i was at the house but not in the room, and she kept saying i needed to be apart of the conversation too. i really am like one of her own. but i’ve never felt comfortable talking to her about this. both of her parents had memory issues, one dementia and the other alzheimer’s. i know she’s scared. she forgot the garage code last time we were here and when i put it in she said “please don’t tell them i freaked out” talking about her husband and son. i just don’t know what to do. i am tired of feeling like nobody is taking this seriously but i don’t want to step on anyone’s toes. i truly know if this was my mom i would not be able to sit around without trying everything. i think everyone feels like there’s nothing they can do because they watched it happen to her parents. she’s not even 60..

Wife is Struggling with her Mom
my 44f wife came to the conclusion we needed to sell our home of 15 years and have a new house built that has independent, pseudo separate quarters for her momher mom is 81 and has memory loss over the last few years everyone has noticed.  wife took her to the doctor a few months ago and she started aricept but the doctor thought she could still drivewe sold the house and are moving out.  the new house won’t be ready until november.   wife’s plan was to live with her for 3 months, move in to our new house, then mil would sell her housethe move in went badly.  my mil has a 4 bedroom house for just her and a dog.  she has baseline ocd/ neat freak.  she doesn’t have the best social skills but has always been very loving to her daughter and grand daughter as well as nice to me.  my daughter 13 and wife moved in and i have been living in our original house- leaving in one weekour original house is 8 miles from my mother in laws house and the new house being constructed is 400 yards away from where mil lives now my wife says her mom has been mean, accusatory, extra stubborn, called my daughter foul names.  she thinks people are hiding her keys and screwing up her tv.  she doesn’t like the extra stuff in her house.  she has changed her mind about wanting to live with us.  she helped pick out the new build.  my wife can’t seem to take this very new mean streak as anything but personally my wife broke down and is now moving herself out and my daughter out to a friend’s home.   we couldn’t back out of the sale and are moving anywayit cost us a lot of money to make this move out of our house and a lot of stress and chaos to move.  my daughter is angry at being called bad names and her grandmother hurting her momat this point my mil shouldn’t be driving in my opinion what i thought would be a easy transition for power of attorney is likely not going to be amicable. mil,s mother (wife’s grandmother) had bad dementia and died at 95. mil is very healthy otherwise i have tried to encourage my wife to learn about the illness and support and coping.  she is somewhat open to it but the stress of full time job and all the moving have her worn outi knew when they moved in the extra clutter, bodies, dirt, changes would not be good.  this move in plus time have set my mil backmy mil told us she was taking aricept but stopped (or never started).  my wife’s sister lives 45 min away and is unhelpful and one of the least friendly people on this planet i didn’t want to do any of this.  i wanted to keep our very nice home- make it her home too with any modifications necessary and let her move in when she was ready or had to.  i went with this alternate plan as it was important to my wife when she arrived at this- two months agoi am spewing all this out as i was looking for advice and don’t have anyone to talk to who understands all thisthank you

Something is wrong with my grandfather...
ok, so, i didn't really knew how to talk about that, and especially where to talk about that. a good friend suggested me this subreddit, and maybe people here will be able to tell me if something is wrong (what i believe).the problem is going on for years and is literally driving me crazy. the rest of my family (not a lot) is only taking notice of this until recently, but i really never told them anything before, because i was afraid they would just take it personally and/or see it as disrespect towards my grandfather. i can't remember when it started, but i know he wasn't always like that. he has always been light minded (for example he would forget his cellphone everywhere, lost his keys, etc) but it seemed just like a personality trait, sure a bit annoying, but not problematic.he would always tell me stories of the past repeatedly though, again and again and again, using the same words order and the same phrases, the same rhetoric effects (if i may say so), etc. it was a bit odd and annoying, but well, whatever? it's just an old man drivelling.i would often search online about drivel, and way to cope with it, but to most people it was just something nice old men would do and something they could share during family time. but it's not really my case. what i should say to be understood, is that i have frequent contacts with my grandparents. when i was home (or when i'm spending time home), i can see them up to 5-6 time per week, i also have them on the phone every day, so it's just not family dinners' drivelling that i'll describe next. it is every day life.since maybe 2-3 years, my grandfather started to repeat things that were not memories, but rather recent things crossing his mind, and also, to speak in a weird manner in a way that just saying something like: "the weather is hot today, i didn't liked it" could take up to 4-5 minutes of him repeating it with different formulations and insisting on details, etc.to give some examples:— every time i would tell him i go to the gym, he'd ask me how far from my place it is... he would literally ask me this question multiple times a week. recently, my gym has closed (because of the coronavirus crisis, they just could keep up) and when i told him that, he just said to me that they should go fuck themselves (i'm not exaggerating, he literally said that) and would keep asking me during few weeks if i returned to the gym (and told me a second time only that they should go fuck themselves, the rest of the time he would just say that they were liars and just closed because they wanted to steal their customers' money).— he's literally obsessed by (some times imaginary) problems occurring with his computer, and for example, these last 2 months, he has been asking to me 3/4 times per week why a certain software cannot be uninstalled, he ask it to me using the same words and the same voice intonation, i tell him i don't know, but he keep asking again and again.— he has spent the entire months of july and august telling me every single day the same things when i would call him: that he can't stand how hot the weather is and that he can't stand the flies.— recently he had seen an old tv series called "space: 1999" during his evenings, he would watch 1 or 2 episodes. so, every day, when i'd call him, he'd ask if i ever saw it, he would tell me he was about to watch it and that it was good, and didn't remembered the title so he was something saying random and approximative things. now that he's over with it, he's watching something else from an old dvd we bought when i was a kid. so he told me for 3-4 days straight that he was watching it and that we never opened it since then, and ask me if i remember.— talking about film, he's watching a lot of film, and also reading science fiction books. he has a lot of books, but every time he's talking to me about the same 4-5 sagas and telling me to read them and explain to me the plot every time (with the same words and same descriptions again, it's important to insist on that). another thing that he do a lot: he say to me that he watched a movie the day before. and when he say that, i automatically know that he will say one of these two things right after: 1. it was shit, it was a science fiction movie with americans killing aliens and winning, it's always the same, i stoped it before the end. 2. it was a good movie, i don't remember the title, i won't tell you what it was about to avoid spoiling you, but you should watch it it was good.— as i said, when he's talking about a simple thing, it can takes minutes to just tell it. he's using odd formulations and repetitive sentences. for example, he tell something, then tell the exact same thing 2 or 3 times more by just changing the phrases/words order a little, or says things like "it's annoying, it annoys me" or things like that.there are a lot of other things i could talk about, but i think you got the idea. he's on a loop and i don't know what is the problem. he refuse to see a physician, now that the rest of the family took notice of it and want to do something.&amp;#x200b;what are you thoughts?

Assisted Living?
at this point, i'm not sure if my mother (75) can continue to live alone. she has moderate dementia and a ton of mental instability that goes with that and previous mental issues. we installed a camera in her living room as that is where she spends most of her time and worried she'd fall down and not get up. she has a friend that comes and helps her with medication every morning and without that friend setting up the medication in the mon-sun box, she wouldn't know what to take, why to take it, and how to take it. i'm the epoa and mpoa and have since taken over her finances as she either forgets to pay a bill, pays too much, or struggles to balance the checkbook.   the paranoia seems to be getting a bit worse as she's just convinced every day that someone is going to show up in a white coat and take her to an awful nursing home, so much so that she calls everyone she can remember to ask if that's going to happen. she also accuses this friend of stealing her money, but now that i have access to her accounts- i can see that it's not happening. physically she is fine, she can move fairly well and with her medications, her vitals are good. however i'm concerned for her well being mentally. just last night, she woke up at midnight and went to go check the mail (which she normally does when she wakes up at like 5-6am after she eats). for reference, the mailbox is a block or so away from her house. she didn't have a grasp on the time she woke up or even why she felt the need to walk in the dark like that. she also said she saw lights coming from the mountain.   i live 5 hours away or so and the rest of her family is even further. it seems to me that she would probably do best going into some type of living situation but i don't really know where to start. for one, she lives in a manufactured home, which she owns but not the land so she won't get much for that. she lives on roughly $2,000 a month she gets for social security but seems to have just enough in her bank account to where she doesn't qualify for medicaid. i've reached out to a few programs in her area but they seem to be "profit" driven for these private assisted living homes, she also kind of lives in a rural area of washington state. i know some of you went through similar stuff, thoughts? feedback? ideas? what worked for you? is she just kinda screwed and we should wait until she gets really hurt and has to go into a nursing home?

Support and encouragement needed
my dad was diagnosed with lewy body dementia and early-onset alzheimer’s almost 3 years ago and his disease is progressing quickly. he’s only 66. he’s in a memory care unit 1100 miles from me (my so and i are a military family) and i’m really struggling with not being able to see him or help him. i call 3 times a week and it’s obvious the days of lucid conversations are behind us. most days he knows who i am but gets confused on “when” we are. tuesday he came to the phone and said “[name], did you clean your room?” like he used to when i was a child.lately he’s been fixated on boxing (something he’s always enjoyed watching) during our talks and asks about my “bouts” during tournaments, despite my never having been a boxer. he’ll ask what time they start, i’ll tell him a time, and he asks if they’ll be in the pod (the nurses’ station in his unit), and i’ll tell him yes and ask questions like is he’s going to cheer for me. i always go along with his hallucinations because i don’t want to confuse or upset him. our calls often end with my telling him i’ll see him later that day and we’ll go to dinner and see a movie. he’s always excited about that and i feel split on it: awful because i can’t actually do it, happy that i can make him happy in the moment. logically i know he forgets immediately afterward and doesn’t even remember our talks after we hang up but that knowledge doesn’t make it easier.my siblings and mother and i are on a weekly call schedule. i have the most free time so i call the most often. i’ve ordered him cds of some of his favorite bands and the staff says he listens to them in his room. they say he’s pleasant and cracks jokes and whistles a lot. they do frequent mass testing for covid and his have been negative every time, thank god.when i was in town for a week in mid july, i went to visit through a glass door every day. i just wanted to hug him and hold his hand. i completely understand why i couldn’t for his safety. it was hard to hear him since he was speaking quietly and sometimes he’d cry and i couldn’t do anything to comfort him. i’m just at a loss for how i can help him or make him happy. i know i can’t do a lot. i just need some help with this. i’m a fixer and this isn’t something i can fix. i’m in therapy but it’s not doing much. i keep a journal recording our conversations and my thoughts and feelings, which makes me feel a little better because i want to be able to look back and remember what we discussed, even if it didn’t make much sense. in a nutshell, i need to know how to deal with this without having a nervous breakdown. if anyone has any suggestions on how i can make my dad happy from a distance or any tips on keeping my sanity, please help me. i’m a mess.

How do I help my dad (61)?
i've been debating making this post for a while, but its gotten to the point where i am not sure what to do anymore. this is a long one folks, i apologize for the novel i am about to write in advance...over the last couple of years myself (m28), my sister and my mom have noticed a change in my dad since he lost his job about 3 years ago (he got fired for fighting with his boss, and knowing him he probably said a bunch of things he should not have said). when it is brought up he says he wasn't fired, that he "manufactured getting let go" to maximize getting severance until he reached his retirement age. since then, we have noticed him changing for the worse and after doing research, the things we are noticing with him are pointing towards some form of dementia.most of the changes we have noticed have been personality and attitude changes and include examples such as:* his filter has pretty much completely gone, to the point where he is making comments he would not have made in the past. (ex: during the george floyd incident, he has made comments like "black people they do it to themselves" which is something he never would have said in years past.)* his mood changes from one minute to the next. he could be having a calm discussion one minute, then someone could say something and he immediately blows up and starts swearing up a storm.* he argues with everyone constantly, whether it be with my sister for wanting to get a hammock in the backyard and him not thinking it will fit in her small car, or on facebook with people who have differing opinions than him.* when he has a argument with someone in the house, he shuts them out and ignores them for long periods of time. (he ignored my mom for 3 months barely saying anything more than mean, snarky remarks because she said something that went against what he thought)* when he argues with one person in the house, he ignores and shuts everyone out to the point where he is currently not sleeping in the same bed as my mom because he misunderstood something my sister was telling him and lead to an argument between my dad and my sister.* my sister has told me that he has made remarks lately that everyone thinks he is stupid. this not the case as my dad is a very smart and logical man and everyone in our house knows it.we have also noticed some memory issues that lead me to believe that he has some sort of dementia, especially because his dad had dementia for a number of years before he died. the memory issues include:* he has misplaced his car keys, when they have a spot on a hook right as you walk in the front door that he always uses. * there are multiple incidents where he has said something in the past, and when we reference that specific quote he will tell us he never said that. (my parents were arguing and my mom brought up the fact that he mentioned in the past that he was going to serve her divorce papers, and he got extremely angry and kept saying that he never said that).* just last week, he went out to the store and when he came home he did not take his shoes off when coming in (as a family we always take our shoes off in the house when we come inside) for over 5 hours. when we bring up to him that he is forgetting things like his car keys, or his shoes on in the house for 5 hours, he gets very defensive and starts saying things like "i just forgot about it, can't i forget things for god's sake." him and i share a family doctor, so i made a call to him to see if there was anything he could do to help get my dad in to do some tests such as calling him in for a physical which my dad has not done in a number of years. the doctor said that they do not make calls for patients to come in for physicals and that the only way he could help him is if my dad went in himself with his concerns. i was very frustrated to hear this because i know many doctors will make the call as a way to get patients exhibiting signs of dementia into the offices to start the diagnosis process. i decided i would sit my dad down and have an earnest discussion with him about my family and my suspicions, which is big because in my family we do not have emotional conversations about anything (he comes from an english family that always pushed their feelings down more and more). so i sit him down and bring up the fact that i think he is showing signs of some sort of dementia, and that i think it wouldn't hurt to go make an appointment with the doctor to get some tests done. he was caught a bit blindsided by my words and thought there wasn't anything wrong mentally (we have other family issues that he says is contributing to his outbursts and such). i told him i would go with him to the appointment and support him but i walked away from the conversation with the understanding that he wasn't making the appointment. at this point, i don't know what else i can do in this situation because it seems the only way to get the ball rolling on tackling the potential problem of dementia is if he makes that step of going into the doctor's for an appointment, does anyone have any ideas of what i could do next to help my dad? i really am at a loss for how to handle this situation, as his demeanour and the way his acts is getting to the point that i do not want to go by the house anymore. thanks for taking the time to read my story, i really appreciate being able to vent my frustrations here!tldr: my family suspect that my dad has some type of dementia as it runs in his side of the family. his personality and memory has changed for the worse over the last couple of years, and he refuses to acknowledge that there is anything wrong, and he refuses to go to the doctor's when i talk to him about it.

Guys, my mom is in such a horrible situation and I’m at a total loss... Has anyone had any experience talking to the Alzheimer’s Association?
hey y’all. my mom is in the moderate level of alzheimer’s, creeping closer into the severe. it’s been a year since her diagnosis, but several years of losing cognitive function after suffering the trauma of breaking her femur and the process of going under anesthesia for surgery. quick context of her life: my dad left when i was 7, i’m now 35. i have 4 older siblings, with the oldest 11 years my senior. mom didn’t get remarried until about 9 years ago, after we were all married &amp; moved out/away. she married the widower of a woman she was very close friends with for 30+ years... she had never shown any interest in being with anyone my whole life after my dad. she was more interested in being involved with me and my siblings lives. classic selfless single mother. but when her friend died suddenly a decade or so ago, the widower started coming around and wanting to spend time with my mom. she resisted it so hard. but he was persistent and eventually “won her over”. i think she thought it would be wrong to get with her late friend’s husband. my mom is also the classic good catholic girl; had only ever been with my dad, etc. and that catholic guilt &amp; worrying what other people would think made her very hesitant to start dating him. so, in my opinion, her choice to finally marry him was a combination of fear and security. my mom always struggled with money. worked 3 jobs, a total hustler, but always in debt because she wanted to give all us kids everything. she’s never been fully mentally strong and healthy. depression &amp; anxiety, that i used to think was just caused by my dad cheating &amp; leaving her, but i’ve come to realize is just ever-present in her family history and upbringing. nevertheless, she thought “wow, this is a nice man that wants to be with me, who showers me with gifts and takes me on fancy trips, and who seems really happy and funny and fun — surely this can’t be a bad thing to have financial stability and to be with someone who will take care of me, to have companionship, etc.” and honestly, for the first 4ish years it was great. the first time in my life i wasn’t just worried about my mom and the fact that she was alone and didn’t have anyone to count on (besides her kids).fast forward to now. her husband has lost more and more of his hearing - which has been a big frustration for both of them in communicating. but sometimes i think he exaggerates and uses it as an excuse. because oftentimes he will hear things from other people but have to shout “what?!” when it’s my mom who is talking....but long story short, he is a terrible, horrible caregiver. he’ll admit it too. but he does nothing to fix it. for over a year now, my sisters and i have been giving him books, sending him resources, suggesting things to make his life easier... guys, i can’t stress enough to you how dense this man is. he’s 74 and a boomer to his core. his emotional intelligence is non-existent. once at the doctors office he &amp; i were talking to a nurse and a social worker in a room away from my mom and he went into this thing about how he worked for lockheed his whole life and how he is a “problem-solver” — and he just can’t get my mom to realize what is happening; how much he has to repeat things and how frustrating all her “crazy” behaviors are; and wanted them to tell him “how to make her understand what’s going on with her”.... the nurses and i looked at each other curiously and we all essentially told him “you can’t do anything. you have to adjust, you have to change your behavior.” he just stared blankly like “no, i don’t accept this answer. you women are idiots, so i guess i’ll have to figure it out myself.” he doesn’t read the books, he doesn’t talk to anyone about his feelings. he just blows up at my mom. recently, a friend of my moms was on the phone (mom must’ve called or picked up &amp; not realize someone was there, put the phone down without hanging it up) and this woman heard my mom’s husband yelling at her. something like “you’re driving me crazy today! crazy crazy crazy!” i’ve heard him do it too, when i’m in town and stay at their house. he is mean. very cold and impatient. don’t get me wrong, my mom can be mean too. but it’s not her fault anymore. she’s only mean when she feels out of control in a situation. she’s lovely when i’m there and she feels taken care of and loved. he’s not kind to her, not affectionate. he used to leave her alone at home constantly, even though my sisters and i repeatedly asked him not to. he’d drive 2 hours to go to the casino and just not tell anyone. and before you ask, no he’s not in serious cognitive decline. he still works and does complicated financial stuff and all that. he’s not an idiot in that sense, just when it comes to thinking about anyone but himself. the other day he lost her at the doctor’s office. not the brain doc, but apparently they didn’t know she had dementia and let her leave to go find him, since he couldn’t come in and was waiting in the lobby. after an hour he finally went to look for her and found her talking to the valet trying to find her car. she hasn’t driven in 2 years probably. we had a conference call with her brain doc a few days ago, to go over her new test results. at one point he (the husband) was talking directly to my mom, trying to explain why it was important to have home heath care come in (she hates it) and why they were saying she needs 24/7 care. it was great because he spoke to her exactly as he always does - not yelling, but very curt and uncompassionate. it was amazing because after he was done talking, the doc/nurse/social worker all started talking to him about learning how to communicate with her better, suggested all the same resources we’ve been telling him about for a year. i don’t think it mattered though. he’s not gonna change. it was like pulling teeth to get him to start having home health care come in. he only started having someone come like a month ago, after my sisters found out about him yelling at her while the family friend heard. it’s only a few hours a week and it’s basically just so he can leave the house. when he’s home he’s rarely even in the same room with her, and when he is it’s not for her benefit or anything. he can’t remember to give her medication everyday. i got him a $100 auto pill box thing, did everything i could to get him started with it. i found it in its original box, in the garage with other crap they don’t use.here’s a quick list of all the things i’ve tried to implement to make my mom as healthy as possible and to make his life easier, all of which he has either stopped after i leave or never started in the first place:-auto pill box-cod liver oil capsules -eating mushrooms, drinking green tea, taking tumeric w/black pepper in a capsule (all just good for general brain health)-daily walks with her dog, they live super close to a few parks too.-getting a sleep apnea machine so she sleeps better, which is really important for brain health... sleep is like the brains way to flush out all the garbage that builds up everyday. -having a white board by her bed where she looks everyday to remind her of things.-an apple watch to keep track of her, alert if she falls, etc. or any life alert type device.-simplifying their home which is way too cluttered, simplifying the phones and tv setup so she can easily use. it fucking never works when i’m there. -letting her go to therapy so she can at least talk to someone. we have a therapist that many of us have seen at different points and who is just an overall comforting presence. but he thinks it’s a waste since she won’t remember. -having a good pharmacologist managing her medications, since no one seems to be doing it regularly enough — she needs to be getting meds on time yes, but she also needs to be on the right combination of meds and have them monitored more regularly so at least that part isn’t hurting more than helping... there is an amazing doc that could do this about 4 minutes from their house. -oh, and she has this little dog that she absolutely adores. her husband is constantly giving it people food. i can’t even tell you how many times i’ve explained to him that he can’t do that. the dog weighs probably 9lbs. it’s a teeny tiny little lap dog. he feeds it cheese, leftover steak or chicken from whatever restaurant they went to the night before, and most recently i observed him feeding the dog a twinkie. .....this is what we’re dealing with. a fox news consuming, truth-denying, stubborn, arrogant (and honestly, pretty damn racist) moron who simply refuses to take any of us seriously. and just to connect the racism to how it effects my mom, he said some incredibly racist things to my mom’s first home health care nurse. sisters were there to hear and were mortified. i know hhc people are not gonna let stuff like that interfere with the care they give but jfc.... i want the people who are taking care of my mom to be treated with respect too. bottom line: i don’t think he loves her nor cares about what happens to her. he doesn’t give her any more time and thought than he absolutely has to, and even then it’s not enough. she calls me or my sisters or my brothers 10 times a day, just begging us to help her. she thinks she can fix it herself by being different. she doesn’t understand that she can’t. and he won’t listen or adapt. i know she doesn’t wanna be married to him anymore if it continues as it is. he would basically have to be a totally different person for her to be happy with him. she can’t remember something you said 5 minutes ago, but she is not forgetting how shitty her husband makes her feel. emotional memory goes last, and it’s just seems clear to me that whatever is broken in their relationship is unfixable, unless there’s a miracle. or that their relationship was superficial from both sides, and now the husband is just done with her bc all he wanted was someone to take care of him after he lost his wife of 40 years. whatever it is, i just don’t think their 9 years together is enough to carry them through to the end. i think he’s done. i just wish he’d admit it and let us take care of her. i really don’t think a real divorce is necessary or even a good idea at all — i’d be happy to help take care of her as much as i can, but i can’t afford all that i’d need to do it all. my best ideas right now are just to go home and get her, bring her to my house to stay for a bit and see what happens. or for her to go stay with either of my two sisters who live close to her. but they say as soon as she leaves the house, even for a quick errand, she just wants to go home. :/ i live 4.5 hours from her, but my living situation is ideal i think. 35 acres, beautiful outdoors and lots of animals, healthy fresh food, and no children of my own. i’m here basically all the time, we’re far away from the busy road. my husband is a wonderful cook. my sisters &amp; brothers all have kids. 3 are nearby her but the 2nd brother is across the country. ugh.... it’s just awful y’all. i don’t know what the right thing to do is. i feel like i’ve tried everything. who do i call and talk to? who knows what to do when the person with dementia has a spouse who doesn’t seem to give a shit about them? i’ve thought about adult protective services, but what does that even do? i don’t want them to take my mom or anything. if she is forced to move into a facility, she will absolutely give up the will to live. one of her sisters died a few years back — same thing. but her daughter (my cousin) put her in a home that was hours away from their family. mom was the only one visiting her, and even then she had to travel to another state. i don’t want my mom to feel so sad and hopeless. but i’m the youngest of 5 kids — i’ve never been the one leading the pack. i’m the one who always goes another way and goes against the grain. right now though i just feel frozen. like we’re all just waiting for something bad or serious enough to happen to force someone to make a stand and take control. if you got this far, thank you for reading. i’m not even sure if i made sense or asked a clear question. i guess i just need to know what my options are; what are the resources i can use that i’m not aware of; has anyone else heard of a situation like this? thanks so much for any advice y’all can offer. i can’t imagine a worse time (in my life) for this covid stuff: it was so bad at first when everyone had to stay away. but her emotional health became too fragile and we finally had to realize she’ll die from loneliness if she doesn’t die of covid, so now my sisters come more regularly and wear masks, try to stay in the backyard, etc. to all of you caregivers out there who’ve been forced to stay away because of this pandemic, i feel your pain. this was so hard already — we really didn’t need or deserve to have this virus totally screw this situation up any more than it already is. love to all y’all. and thanks again.

How do non rich people handle this?
my father is 66 and only just recently got the formal dementia diagnosis. he also has diabetes and was basically blind in one eye. at the time he was just being kind of forgetful or mixing up people in his memories. he had gotten the surgery to fix his eye and it just must’ve jump started everything. i am in my mid 20s, single, and live across the country basically paycheck to paycheck in a one bedroom apartment. my step mom (married 12 ish years, dated prior- have known each other a very long time) lives with him in a two bedroom apartment. my sister, 11 years my senior, has a husband and a child about to enter high school. we all live very paycheck to paycheck lives. my dad has hit the stages of extreme paranoia and anger/threats of violence. my poor step mom is terrified and kept up all night. none of us can handle his behavior. when he last threatened my step mom about a month ago while also wandering until they convinced him to calm down and get home, we began looking at costs. we all were ready to place him somewhere. it’s sad but our main concern is making sure he does not hurt anyone else. however when we saw the price range, we were blown away with how expensive it is. seriously what is the alternative? he’s no longer my father mentally. my step mom is terrified of him. i am afraid he’s going to somehow hurt her. how do people deal with this type of behavior when they can’t afford assisted living? sorry if i sound dumb but i really didn’t think i’d be thinking about any of this at 26 and i have never felt like more of a child in my life.

How to support my mother while she is caring for stepdad with Alzheimer’s?
i think the title makes it clear but there’s a bit more to it. stepdad was diagnosed a year ago with early onset and he’s been gradually getting worse. it’s getting upsetting. mom has hired someone to help him twice a week and is planning to find a nursing home for him. she takes good care of him and makes sure that he gets exercise and stimulation. but in the mean time, i’m really worried about her own well-being and how she’s coping. dementia does not run in either sides of my family or in any of my extended family. it’s something we’ve never faced. i dread visiting because i know my mom isn’t okay. it’s almost easier to talk to my stepdad than it is my mom. my mom is constantly negative, she absolutely cannot see the other side of things. she hates his children. she always reminds my stepdad that he forgets. yesterday, he got a call from his daughter and she was so angry about it. i thought it was sweet. she said his daughter is thinking about moving back and i said she should, mom disagreed. when stepdad tried to tell us about his conversation, she kept interrupting him with “we know that, you already told us.”it’s so upsetting for me to see her treat him this way (and i really don’t even have a close relationship with him). i know that her anger isn’t on purpose. i live an hour away so i’m not able to be there as much, i have no idea what it is like to live with him. and i know it’s gotten harder since mom moved to working from home because of covid. i suppose i could use some insight into what my mom is going through, because i can’t relate. i’m struggling a lot right now because i feel like a bad daughter, but i also know that i need to draw boundaries for my own sake.

Initial symptoms?
hello, everyone.   i've never posted on reddit before, so i apologise if i do anything wrong, or against the reddit social etiquette. however, lately, i've been falling into a mild morbid curiosity with dementia, and listened to the album *everwhere at the end of time,* which, though disturbing - intrigued me and made me truly feel sympathy for people who have been affected by this disease - either by having it or having loved ones have it. anyways - it led me to research dementia more and i've had a sudden realisation that my grandmother seems to be having some potential would-be symptoms. for reference; she's an alcoholic in her late 60s/early 70s and has smoked her entire life. my family have tried to get her to stop drinking. she lies about it a lot and pretends she isn't, but we know she drinks. the point of me mentioning this is i read alcoholism and smoking increase chances of dementia happening. anyways, some things she's been doing;\- she confuses family members. at first, this has just been confusing my cousins and me - which i always assumed was a "normal old person thing" since she has 4 grandchildren. however she's started doing it with my dad, my uncle, other members of the family, etc.\- she has always been meek and feeble. but the few times i've seen her, recently, she's been even more sad and quiet than usual. "recently" meaning within the past 2-3 years. she tries to make small talk, sometimes, but these days (i last saw her about 2 weeks ago at my uncle's house for a birthday party) she hardly even seems to be keeping up with conversations - it feels, to me, like she's just nodding her head and pretending to understand what everyone else is talking about. sometimes it takes several times to get her attention and get her to snap out of her mind. \- she struggles with making decisions. whether big or small, she cannot be trusted to make choices by herself because she'll change her mind from one second to the next. she's engaged, but she seems to *sometimes* utterly hate her fiance (other times she's perfectly happy) , and it's been told to us by my uncle that apparently she's gotten violent with him before (with her fiance), i.e throwing things, etc. we always assumed that's because she was drunk, but now it has me wondering...\- she forgets she does things. like, sometimes simple things, but for example, she will drink, or lately; buy cigarettes, smoke them, and then lie about it, except it truly feels like she is convinced she did not smoke at all, even though the corner shop vendor saw her do it (and he knows my uncle and told him about her smoking)\- though not too common, there are times when she'll call my father up late at night crying and screaming about how evil my uncle is. granted, my uncle *is* a shitty excuse for a human being (petty thief who we're pretty sure has a drug problem, 3 kids, and crazy schemes) however it usually always turns out she's either making things up, lying or exaggerating, except when she's talking about it (usually at night) she seems utterly convinced he did this or did that.   not long after this, if my dad tries to solve/figure out the situation that my grandma is deeply distressed by, my grandmother will suddenly be perfectly okay and is at my uncle's beck-and-call once again, stating that she herself was just 'overreacting'. \- lastly, she just...'feels' like she has her head lost in a fog? like she's there, physically with us - but it scarcely feels like she's *there*. this situation is...specific, i suppose. everyone in my family assumed (including me) this was just her heavy drinking influencing her because alcoholism has been her signature thing since before i was born (i'm 18). however now i'm growing up and realising things have been going downhill for quite a while, now, and now i'm starting to feel nervous.i'm sorry if i'm bothering anyone - thank you for reading, if you got this far. i've never known anyone with dementia, before, so i have no idea how it manifests itself besides research. hopefully, of course, my anxious thoughts and analysation of her is wrong and she's perfectly okay - except i can't help but feel like it's very well possible.people in both sides of my family generally don't make it to 80. be it because of liver failure, cancer, tumours, heart disease or other - so we've never really had a chance to even 'see' if it's a hereditary condition since most people in my family have not survived to an age where dementia becomes more commonly developed.i apologise if i seemed in any way disrespectful, as well.  i'm very much worried about her - we've had a rocky relationship due to her substance abuse problems, but she's still my grandmother and growing up as her first grandchild i have many fond memories with her. tldr; i'm wondering about initial dementia symptoms in women aged 60 - 70+, in fear my alcoholic and life-long smoker grandmother might be developing it.

How's this for an interesting title? My mom uses Depends. They are not "dependable". I want to know what things are like for her. Not to sound weird but I took her Depends for a spin...
not impressed at all! this may be tmi, but a lot of you go through so much with your loved ones, it might not be. the ones i tried were size xl "maximum" absorbency.  that is bs! unless you have been blessed with a bladder of a chickadee, it just doesn't work for mom... i found they were glorified  stretchy one use underwear with a thick pad that is about absorbent as an overnight maxipad.  i'm sure they are perfect for small leaks, but if there is maximum urine, forget it!  i won't go into too many details, but pj's and bed protection under her is all wet.  we (a close friend and i) kind of make jokes about the female astronaut who wore astronaut underwear while she drove cross country to find someone she was stalking... something similar to that would really rock! now for the 2nd use for them, it is ridiculous. if she can't race her arthritic body to the bathroom quick enough, well, forget it.  she has to cut them off, its a mess, and its just not right! especially if its loose bm.  so tell me, are there better ones to use? some with velcro?  she doubles them up at night. she has arthritis and for her at night changing them is quite a feat.  its very sad. she still has independence.  she would even go out for a drive, but is embarrassed to go.can we get samples of other kinds? what do you recommend? are there kind of special underwear to wear over the disposable ones?  astronaut "underwear " would not fit our budget but i am dying to make it easier for her!help??

My MIL. 86yo and poop
it’s so hard to get my mother n law to wash her hands after she goes to the bathroom.  my wife goes in with her mom to get her to wash her hands, but now my mother n law says they are clean.  she insist only using 2 squares to clean herself then picks the rest of her poop out. after that she wipes her hands on her clothing and refuses to wash her hands. she goes to the bathroom all through the night so when we get up in the morning there’s poop hand prints on the walls, doors, refrigerator, coffee pot , counter tops, door knobs.  she goes through about 15-20 pairs of underwear even with the pads.  she refuses to take a bath. my wife can talk her into taking a bath about every two weeks. we have a dry erase board where we put the date, day and if it’s bath day. she even looks is at her hands with poop on them and says my hands aren’t dirty.  ughso frustrating.  my wife and i have to clean the bathroom every time we walk by just to keep the house from smelling.  every morning she is in the bathroom at least 20 times - i actually think she forgets she just went and goes again.  i got upset with her the other day, she promised my wife she would take a bath as written on her board and she said she didn’t.  i told her she smelled like poop and she was going to make herself sick as well as us too.  so get in there and take a bath.  i’ve resorted to just squirting soap in her hands when she’s not looking just to get her to wash them.  she’s also started scraping the food that she hasn’t eaten back in the pot. so if we have stew or chili, she just scrapes what’s left in her bowl back into the pot.  yuck. not sure what to do.  any suggestions.

86 y/o MIL in final stages of Dementia. Bed ridden. She still understands "Squeeze my Hand", but does she really understand or am I only wishing so?
first off let me start off by saying i am no stranger to dementia or alzheimer's.  my mom's sister died of early onset alzheimer's at age 56. (she was diagnosed at 50), and we watched as the disease swiftly took her and although it was 19 years ago, i have never forgotten.  now my mil, who is 86, was just brought home to die on july 6th.  that was her final wish.  she wanted to die at home.  she is currently in the final stages and i am all too familiar with what that looks like.  my husband however, is not.  so i calmly show him to look for facial expressions and respond to them in a way that you are somehow able to communicate with her  and how she searches you with her eyes.  but she can barely talk.  she mouths "yes" when you ask her something, but other than that, she says nothing.  however, if you say something to her, and you ask "if you understand, squeeze my hand".  she will squeeze your hand! repeatedly.  she doesn't grip it, she squeezes on and off on and off.i want to believe she is still in there somewhere knowing we are there.  i also played some music for her. when i played some music that she knew from back home in europe, she blinked her eyes, and looked directly at me and they lit right up.  but then it was like she was gone again when her eyes drifted off somewhere else.  i can't bare to see my husband as he watched his last living parent die of such a horrific disease.  i know what the disease does and i know what it looks like, but i can't relate to him, as it was never a parent i have lost but only a relative (who for all intents and purposes i was extremely close to).i just need some support on how to help him start to accept and get used to how she is at this point in time and this is how it's gonna look like as she transitions into the death stage.  she is currently only sipping water from a tiny sponge and eating baby food.  her eating or drinking has not stopped yet.i am just grasping at straws here.  i found this sub in hopes i could just let my feelings out. thanks for listening.

Advice on getting my mom help?
i am writing this because i’m taking on trying to help my mom’s mental health/cognitive situation sorted out and, frankly could use some insight and support.about five years ago, my family started noticing that my mom was repeating the same stories, seemingly forgetting conversations she’d had with us and having some issues recalling names etc. she’s 69 now so my sister, aunt and i didn’t think much of it at first, that maybe she was just experiencing some age-related decline but  that it was likely nothing to get too worried about. we also noticed, independently of one another, that her already volatile moods (her side of the family has a history of bipolar disorder and we’ve long suspected she’s got some of those traits) started getting worse. she has stormed out of family gatherings for no known reason, had screaming fits where she has rolled on the front lawn because my sister didn’t appreciate her babysitting my nephew enough and had multiple episodes of that nature. the trouble is, because we’ve all had difficult run-ins with her and we have all had very busy lives far away, we have had only occasional contact with her. mom, who has essentially lived alone on a mountain for the better part of a decade, hasn’t worked, had hobbies or done much of anything for almost all of that time because she got a good deal when my parents divorced and hasn’t had to worry about money. she really has not been good about keeping herself occupied, and because of her sometimes cruel and manipulative demeanor, she has been pretty isolated. she is a histrionic person in terms of personality, but fails at close relationships because she lashes out those closest to her all the time (and always has).about a year ago, after speaking with her on the phone a few times, i started to feel like things had taken a turn. when i asked her, she didn’t have recollection of basic things (when she’d last been out, what she’d eaten that day, when she’d last taken the dog for a walk). i was concerned enough that i found time to visit her and, when i got to her house, i was shocked at just how bad things had become. it was clear she was starting to not take care of basic things like hygiene, feeding herself etc. her dog was both severely overweight and seemingly ravenously hungry i later found out that it was because she would forget to feed him for days at a time and then, alternatively, forget she had fed him and over feed him some days. when i had conversations with her, she would repeat the same story/anecdote, often within a few minutes and then completely forget everything we’d talked about moments later. whenever i mentioned that we were going over something we had just discussed, she lashed out and accused my of gaslighting her. it was shocking and i felt terribly guilty that i’d distanced myself enough from her to not notice how bad it was getting. on the drive home from that trip, i called my sister and aunt together to get their input on the situation and find out what they’d noticed. like me, they had each been distancing themselves from her due to episodes of cruelty and hostility. i should also say that my mom has, until recently, been very cunning and sharp in her interpersonal relationships, which i think did a lot to cover her decline effectively from everyone around her. she is sharp in many ways but her memory is rendering that cunning part of her less and less effective. on that call with my sister and aunt, i found out that she’d gotten lost multiple times on familiar drives, gotten in major fights with each of them multiple times after seemingly small memory lapses were acknowledged, had major mood swings and even made half-hearted suicide threats with them.cut to a few months ago. i had a contract job come to an end and managed to arrange some things so i could come live here in nc with my mom in her house for the time being and hopefully get some treatment figured out. it hasn’t been easy and i’m met with constant resistance, but i’ve managed to get her to see her primary care doc, a psychiatric nurse practitioner, have a neuropsychological exam (as referred by her primary doc), got her a ct scan and, as of late week, finally got her to a neurologist. the primary doc had apparently expressed concerns about her memory to her in september of last year but my mom never followed up or told anyone. the neuropsych testing showed severe short-term memory loss of an unknown cause and also revealed a lot of the ways she guesses/fabricates to cover those memory losses. according to the testing, she retains virtually no information (of different types) minutes after learning it which tracks very much with my experience of conversations with her etc. the ct scan was clean but the neurologist ordered an mri which will happen monday. the psychiatric nurse practitioner, her primary doc and neuropsych tester all also brought up mood lability and histrionics, so much so that the tester put “suspected bipolar disorder” in his written test report.so far, everyone thinks we are probably dealing with a mood disorder and some form of dementia, both of which are feeding each other. she was prescribed 2 mg of abilify but hated taking a drug for a mood disorder and demanded to go off it, and then was prescribed aricept yesterday to hopefully curb some of the memory loss and associated mood issues.i realize this is a wall of text, but i needed to let it out and hopefully hear some encouragement. right now it feels like i’m fighting against my mom to try to get her help and, really, without getting her declared incompetent (which i really don’t want to do unless i absolutely have to) i am powerless to actually mandate anything. i should also state, she doesn’t really have a valid powers of attorney for either medical or general duties. my mom thinks she’s fine and continues to think it’s everyone else making it up. i know that there is a part of her that’s terrified but she covers it with meanness at almost every step. i’m frustrated/fried and feel stuck with what to do next.

constant resistance, but i’ve managed to get her to see her primary care doc, a psychiatric nurse practitioner, have a neuropsychological exam (as referred by her primary doc), got her a ct scan and, as of late week, finally got her to a neurologist. the primary doc had apparently expressed concerns about her memory to her in september of last year but my mom never followed up or told anyone. the neuropsych testing showed severe short-term memory loss of an unknown cause and also revealed a lot of the ways she guesses/fabricates to cover those memory losses. according to the testing, she retains virtually no information (of different types) minutes after learning it which tracks very much with my experience of conversations with her etc. the ct scan was clean but the neurologist ordered an mri which will happen monday. the psychiatric nurse practitioner, her primary doc and neuropsych tester all also brought up mood lability and histrionics, so much so that the tester put “suspected bipolar disorder” in his written test report.so far, everyone thinks we are probably dealing with a mood disorder and some form of dementia, both of which are feeding each other. she was prescribed 2 mg of abilify but hated taking a drug for a mood disorder and demanded to go off it, and then was prescribed aricept yesterday to hopefully curb some of the memory loss and associated mood issues.i realize this is a wall of text, but i needed to let it out and hopefully hear some encouragement. right now it feels like i’m fighting against my mom to try to get her help and, really, without getting her declared incompetent (which i really don’t want to do unless i absolutely have to) i am powerless to actually mandate anything. i should also state, she doesn’t really have a valid powers of attorney for either medical or general duties. my mom thinks she’s fine and continues to think it’s everyone else making it up. i know that there is a part of her that’s terrified but she covers it with meanness at almost every step. i’m frustrated/fried and feel stuck with what to do next.

I don't know how to stop being angry that my mom doesn't feel like the mom I've known my whole life. (early dementia)
my mom is in her early 70s and it's hard for me to see how childlike she's become. i know this is early days and that a lot of my mom's personality is there but the woman i used to have long conversations with...it's harder for her to follow or engage. which leaves us with superficial stuff including inane questions that is partial nosiness on her part but i'm sure is her attempt at making easy conversation. i have this emotional boundary wall up between her and myself because i'm not sure she knows she has dementia. my dad has made some comments to my husband that she does but when i tried to bring it up with my dad he brushed me off. supposedly they get tested in the summer and so this month i hope they are getting tested. she has a hard time remembering stuff such that having identical ten minute or so conversations (occasionally) on two days close together (i can't remember if it was two back to back days or if it was three days apart) doesn't even trigger any deja vu. she simply forgot the exact same conversation. she does stuff that oftentimes is very innocent or with a childlike joy but it also comes across to me as selfish or her being the center of everyone's world. and if i could simply act like she was a young child i feel like i could handle it better.but it's so hard because this person is not my mom!  obviously she is and yet she isn't. and i am so angry and have so much frustration and grief that i have to keep her at an arm's length because i know she's not capable of logic in a lot of situations or taking in evidence or being more aware of being considerste of other's feelings.  and it sucks because it totally feels like punching down when i get pissed off at her for stuff she has childlike joy for but also comes across to me as very selfish and inconsiderate.i know she can tell at least sometimes when she has messed up and it pains her. and then i feel, not necessarily remorse because i know she was in the wrong but just so shitty that i can't let things roll off my back more easily like i could if this wasn't my mom. my husband's dad also has dementia and i can deal with his batshit crazy fairly well. but my mom...you know? it just hurts so badly and i know that her dementia is very likely going to get worse or it could be as bad as alzheimer's and so this time with her, while she still retsins a lot of her personality and joy, it's important to appreciate it and use this time with her.but i just feel like the bond is very badly damaged because her form of batshit crazy (besides the day to day memory issues or being inconsiderate) is religious/political stuff like watching political/religious conspiracy videos or subscribing to emails that are just insane along the same line. luckily, as far as i can tell, i've gotten her to stop watching fox so for the most part she's stopped parroting stuff. but she also thinks she's some kind of spiritual warfare expert, so just imagine going a couple weeks with things being fine and then my dad feeling very poorly physically and wanting to skip a church meeting and then my mom railing at him about how that's the voice of satan. like truly what the fuck stuff that they never would have pulled growing up or even ten years ago.  we've been able to discuss evil and how you have to search yourself and talk to god for guidance but her arrogance just amps up to 11 and she honestly thinks telling someone who's in much worse physical shaoe than her and in a lot of pain that not going to a church meeting is basically bowing down to satan's influence.i will lose my patience at stuff like that but like i said, largely it just feels like punching down because her ability to interact and understand reality is...well, if you didn't know her you'd probably just think she's completely normal, but seeing it up close over the past few months (because i'm staying with them rather than coming in for a week or two a few times a year) it's really clear and disturbing.i wish i could just stop having the ability to cry or that i could deaden the grief inside me to just suck it up and interact with her and appreciate the time i have with her.

I’ve tried everything with my grandma to get her the help she needs and she flat out refuses. What can I do?
my (29f) grandma (73f) has been staying with me and my mom for the past five months. in february, she was in horrible condition. we had just found out about her dementia and she called us in a panic about it. told us a man broke into her house and that she was at the police station. they were going to take her home but she refused and they were going to just put her out. at the time, i think covid was ramping up but we didn’t know that yet. regardless, my mom insisted on picking her up several hours away to get her. since then with the stay at home orders in both states and with her condition, we’ve been basically keeping her inside.....which she hates. she has diabetes, hbp, and a really bad knee. with all of that, she still wakes up every morning in full clothing with her duffle in hand ready to “get away from us.” as she puts it. she can’t take care of herself, she wasn’t eating before she stayed with us. she’ll get on the phone and talk to family and strangers for hours rather than talk to us. she’ll tell them we’re ignoring her and that my mom took thousands of dollars from her. and whenever i try to calm her down, she calls me a liar and that i’m in this with her. i’m at my wits end. she refuses to go to a doctor. she won’t go to be evaluated, so we don’t even know what type of dementia she has. she refuses a poa any time we mention it. she keeps saying she’d rather be alone again and i tell her she literally can’t be alone. she gets angry at me! i try to make up a story or coax her into help but she refuses again. she forgets about covid every day as well. one day she even said that it “can’t be that bad.” very frustrating. i think the worst thing is the berating my mom gets from her. i see people mention how their loved one changed personalities due to dementia. well, my grandma has always been this way. i remember her just berating my mom through my childhood, always bringing up the past and never getting over anything. my mom is definitely getting caregiver burnout as well. i’m trying to pick up where she leaves off but it’s so hard. my grandma doesn’t believe a thing we say at all and i’m unsure where to turn. what advice could you all give? i’ve been trying everything!

Something is wrong with my mom and I don't even know how to tackle this one.
my mom turns 60 in a few weeks. so my wife and i flew her out to where we live so we can celebrate with her and spend time with her. i saw her six months ago and she was completely normal. not a single alarming thing about her in any way. six months later (now), and i don't even know her. from the second we picked her up from the airport i could tell something was off. i brushed it off as a long day of travel. but then it continued into the second day, third day, fourth day...  my mom for a long time has had memory problems. getting caught up in trying to remember names of my friends, names of movies, names of our dogs, etc. it's not like it would completely escape her mind. it was just a common thing for her to yell for one of the dogs and get their names mixed up. or she'll be telling a story about a new movie she watched with someone massive like brad pitt and she just can not think of his name until she sat there and thought about it (she very much knows who brad pitt is. so it's not like she just isn't up to date with culture related things). these things were common and i feel terrible to admit that growing up i just thought she was dumb.   as i got older, i started to understand that it has to be something off. i spoke to my dad privately begging him to take her to the doctor just for good measure, but he brushes the entire thing off. my father isn't a good person and is so caught up with himself that i don't think he sees how bad it's gotten since that discussion a few years ago.  on this trip, she is entirely different. it's much more advanced then stumbling over an actor's name. i could tell her a story about a magnet on my fridge and then 30 minutes later she asks what the magnet is. we played board games and mid game she would forget how to play, or have no awareness that it was her turn. along with that, and this could be completely unrelated, she is sleeping insane amounts of time. my mom's "sleeping in" was 9am before. now, she sleeps until 12-1 in the afternoon.   i am learning more details about some sort of medicine she is on for her arthritis. it could be unrelated as well. but i need to find out more information concerning it before i rule anything out.   **my question to this community is...what do i do?**she lives 2,000 miles away and i have no idea what she does or doesn't do. after this trip, it's going to be a while before i see her again because of a very busy work and personal life i am about to have. my biggest fear is that after all these red flags i have watched for 20 years and now her very strange behavior, will be so bad by the next time i see her that i won't be able to do anything. she is here now. what can be done now about this that i can make sure before she leaves she is in a sound mind or overall health? i am so worried and any advice or insight could change her life.   thank you.

When to put into someone into dementia care?
hello. thanks in advance for any replies; people’s generosity here is amazing. my mother has alzheimer’s and lives alone in a central, busy area of sydney (i see her twice a week and she gets a couple of visits from friends). she’s been managing at home okay, although i handle almost everything for her. she still goes out to get a coffee everyday and most days to the supermarket to buy food (just fruit, cheese etc) or gets takeaway. otherwise she’s at home. her memory is very poor, both short-term (in a restaurant she’ll ask if we’re going to order literally 1min after we’ve just ordered) and long-term (forgets that her brother has died, where she grew up as a child). her movements are very limited; everything she needs is within 50m of her house—which is basically the supermarket, her doctor, one favourite restaurant. but, she has just started to get confused about where these places are or how to get to them. she also knows where she lives but couldn’t tell you her address. her gerontologist said it’s probably time to put her into a home. his main concerned are getting lost, getting hit by traffic, or falls—mine too! but my mother also seems quite sprightly and ‘aware’. i toured an aged cafe facility this week and the vast majority of people looked severely incapacitated. it would be shocking to her to be amongst them.my question is: when is the right time to put someone in a home? mum can still organise food for herself, do basic shopping with cash—can’t remember how to use a credit card—even some basic reading. but she is increasingly confused. often asks me if she is dreaming or ‘is this really happening’. the last few weeks she has asked several times when i’ve called ‘is this my home? i know i’ve lived here a long while, but is it my home? i can’t remember where my home is’. she’s also starting to experience urinary incontinence. despite all this she’s quite happy and totally unperturbed by her condition. i could certainly organise a carer for a couple of hours a day to take her out to the shops to ensure she doesn’t get lost, actually puts her shopping in the fridge, helps her to be careful walking etc, although i’ve suggested this but she insists she’s completely fine and able to manage (right after asking me if this is a dream!). of course mum would also forget they’ve been 30mins after they visit and is still likely to ‘pop out’ to grab a coffee. ie it’s not guarantee she won’t still get lost, get hit by a car etc. moving her will be quite traumatic i think. but the reality is she will have to go into care at some point and it would be worse to go in with a broken hip. was there a turning point that made you decide to move someone into a home? thanks for any advice or thoughts.

Help with hallucinations, aggression, night time restlessness and how to redirect (Vascular dementia)
hi! been a lurker for a while and it’s been amazing. it has made me felt like i am not alone in this journey. sorry in advance if this might be long... im just starting out as a caretaker for my grandma. my mom and i (f 20) take care of my grandma (f 70) who has vascular dementia. she had hallucinations before about “suspicious people” who had “pointy eyes” holding rosaries. she thought they were planning something bad about our family so she would keep asking me, my dad or my mom who let them in and why did we allow unknown people into the house. i never know what to answer... but i try to explain that what she thinks is a person is actually a chair, or a lamp, or a vase. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. she got started on seroquel (quetiapine) which has honestly helped significantly to lessen these hallucinations although sometimes she still has them. what am i supposed to respond to her? she would call my mom or i into the room and say there’s someone staring at her or talking to her. we always try to be reassuring and say that no one we don’t know can ever get in the house because we’re like 5 people living here and watching my grandma. next, when she gets mad, she is m a d. she would really throw things (almost threw a glass at my mom), and rush to the person she’s mad at (idk what she would do as i always physically stop her before she gets to them because im afraid of what she can do). sometimes her madness lasts for hours or even the whole day (im amazed at how she remembers this for the whole day). we’d allow her time/space for herself to cool down for hours and get surprised when she returns to the kitchen still mad and kinda heavily handing kitchenware. other time she is mad that we cannot go out (due to covid) so she shouts at our maid asking for the key to let her out. what we’ve been doing, as per advice of her neuro, is to take her to the gate of our village and let the guard explain to her and tell her she cant go out. this works sometimes however she will just forget it within the day and repeat the same thing tomorrow. she is also still smart and can “lie” to the guard about where shes going just to let her out. i’ve tried redirection twice during these “mad” moments and they’ve worked so far... but while we are talking about my redirected topic she would insert a small line like “yeah i was mad about —- earlier because —-“ and i’d just have us go back to topic. bringing me to my third question, how to redirect? i guess it comes easy for talkative people however i really did not have much conversations w my grandma before this so i dont know what to talk about... what do you guys use to redirect? snacks dont work. she has no hobbies. used to love gardening and cooking but has stopped. she just watches tv all day. would also appreciate suggestions on what activities to do :(( havent tried puzzles but i think shes not interested although ill try. lastly, she wakes up multiple times in the middle of the night to urinate (nocturia due to diabetes). sometimes she goes straight to bed, usually walks around for a while opening cabinets and checking if there are people outside the room (none). if its bad, she wakes my mom and i up saying we aren’t home we fell asleep in — (a hospital, a shop, a church, etc) and we have to go home since its night time. my mom and i try to act asleep as much as we can but when she really tries to wake us up we say we are home we are sleeping and i show her the time on my phone. sometimes this works. if not, i invite her into the living room to show her our family pictures to prove this is our house and this has worked 2 out of 2 times i’ve tried. sorry if this was so long... i just need advice as a newbie in handling all of the things that come with this disease. sadly we are grieving them already even though they are alive. thank you in advance for all the advice

CBD oil helped my dad communicate and think more clearly. Amazing, just amazing.
i cannot believe this... my dad has frontotemporal dementia (we think, per spect scan), as well as small vessel disease (microangiopathy affecting white matter). i have a feeling we are talking about symptoms from the latter. his short term memory has been awful. repetitive, stereotyped phrases - i mean the same four to six phrases repeated in loops every two minutes. absolutely no ability to follow a complex conversation or plot. forgetting events that occurred an hour ago, forgetting the weather an hour ago. my brother and i decided to try cbd oil. our initial goal was to try to address restlessness and roaming, this has been our main safety concern. [one]( study suggests it might help... so although there were moments when he still would rather be out walking when at home - he did have urgency to get out a couple times - once persuaded to stay he settled down and didn’t fidget, poke at things, or dig through papers and drawers the way he usually does. he quietly and calmly sat and read the paper, and then he calmly and quietly watched the news on tv. like, i haven’t seen this before. he did say he felt tired. the big and incredible and totally unanticipated change is in his communication. suddenly, he’s elaborating on this thoughts, with detail. suddenly he’s able to be more creative in his responses. he can *engage* spontaneously and naturally with a conversational partner. he’s lucid and present. the cognitive clock has turned back about five years. i’ve never seen anything like this happen before, with any medication, in anyone, it’s really incredible. i asked him to read something. he was fluent and fast, compared to his previous slow, halting efforts. let me say also that i’m not usually a huge cannabis product proponent, i mean i acknowledged it could have health benefits but always side-eyed the thousand things people say it can cure. well this has shocked me. i’m delighted.  i have a feeling it’s got to do with increased or changed blood flow. we’re giving him 15 mg twice a day. here are some studies that support this effect we’re seeing ^ here the hippocampus (where memory is processed) is getting more blood flow, along with the [pcc]( and the [parahippocampal complex]( - structure involved in emotion and episodic memory, among other things. [this]( study saw great improvements in behavior problems and rigidity in severely demented patients. here they used a small amount of thc along with cbd. we may try this, perhaps it will help more with agitation. i will say that i took him for a walk shortly after his second dose today, and he felt a bit dizzy. it was extremely hot though, i’m not sure if that’s partly why. hopefully the weather will be better tomorrow and we can see if it’s that or if we should reduce the dose. but i got to see my old dad today. my mind is blown, i can’t believe it. (i posted the other day, apologies if it’s too much.) absolute game changer.

Small Rant...My Grandmother insists on cooking for me EVERY night of the week I feel bad because 90% of the time it goes in the trash.
so, most people grew up loving their grandmothers cooking, right?  i know i did as a kid.  she had some good recipes.  my grandmother is soon to be 88 and in the early stages of dementia, but her cooking has really suffered.  she use to go two weeks without making the same meal twice, now she's gotten stuck on literally just five recipes....and not the best ones.  now i live only two blocks away, and she insists that i come and pick up food from her every night.  i feel terrible because i can't eat these same five meals every day of the week over and over and over.  90% of the time it sits in my fridge for a few days until it goes bad.  i tried telling her before i don't want to get food from her every night, but she thought i was just trying to be "nice" and told me not to worry, she's use to cooking for a family and can't cook for her and my grandfather......which makes things worse because she's literally giving me enough food for three other people and i live alone.  i'm throwing out hundreds of dollars a month in food that she's cooking, but she just won't stop.  and the thing is, i love to cook (and i've been told i'm pretty damn good at it).  i like cooking nice, healthy, modern dishes.  the five meals she makes are more like 1950's/60's american staples.  not the healthiest, and not the tastiest either because she's forgetting ingredients.  some weeks she'll cook fried pork chops twice.  now don't get me wrong, a nice friend pork chop is great here and there.  but she's giving me four at a time.....what the hell am i suppose to do with eight fried pork chops in a week!?tonight she made beef stew.  it's 80 degrees out.  why in the world would anyone want beef stew in the summer!?yesterday was the weekly roast beef.  which she now cooks *well done* "for safety".  the worst part is i feel so god damn bad about it.  she's spending an hour or more in the kitchen every afternoon cooking, at 88 years old and with dementia, and i'm here just tossing it in the trash most nights....

I'm new. Need help planning for neurologist appointment.
tl;dr - i'm putting it here at the top because it's silly to make you scroll through screens of text for it.i need help preparing. i've finally got dad to agree to see a neurologist. i've got one shot to keep this ball rolling to get a diagnosis and get some help. what do i tell the doctor? what will be super important for him to know? what will be kind of helpful? what's not helpful at all?dad can come off as a normal, sweet but quirky old guy. but there's a lot going on at home.i'm trying my hardest to keep him independent and healthy but i've got to get at least a home healthy aid in there to keep him on track. now the long partabout 16 years ago, i noticed the first change in my father. he started telling folks he was raised in a rural town on the outskirts of our metro area where his grandparents lived. he was actually raised in the worst neighborhood in the inner-city area of our metro. he started speaking with a southern drawl for a while. he would pronounce dinosaur as di-nuh-sour and try to teach that to my toddler son. from that point until now i've noticed a marked decline in language skills. he forgets nouns and objects are described by their function.about ten years ago, when my mom/his wife was sick she had a commode at the house. he referred to it as her "potty chair". several of us attempted to correct him by over-pronouncing commode to him hoping he'd get the hint. she passed after being ill for four months. during the funeral planning, he told the funeral directory he wanted a second autopsy done because my mom was in perfect health when she went into the hospital and he didn't agree with the first autopsy's findings. in the next few minutes, the funeral home is calling medical examiners from across the state. he's puzzled. i asked everyone to step out for a few moments. he doesn't realize that his words indicated he believed by mother was killed by the hospital and he's threatening legal action. for the record, my mother was obese, probably morbidly; had what she thought was the flu for nearly a week and hadn't drunk any fluids for 3 days. at that point she was transported to the er, her heart beat irregular, dehydrated and found to have a bowel obstruction and required emergency surgery. she's lucky she made it to the er let alone survive the surgery.the hoarding started shortly after mom passed away. three bedroom house with narrow walk ways cutting through all the stuff. it was about this time the humming started. he would hum while watching tv, sitting at the dinner table, wherever. he once hummed very loudly at my daughter's dance recital. i told him to stop and he denied he was doing it. people three, four, five rows ahead of us were turning around and glaring at him.he fell in with a window washer who is a sovereign citizen. this character is a part of the republic for the united states. the believe the current us government is a corporation and they are the true and faithful government. for several years, dad would have a tuesday night conference call with all the other self-appointed representatives and senators and discuss how they would take control of the federal government's assets once society collapsed. this window washer acted as an agent to purchase us$300 worth of iraqi dinar. this dinar would be worth us$300 million when the dinar were turned in during a special redemption time frame. of course, the dinar were turned in but no us currency was returned.one fall i mentioned i had prepped my portable kerosene heater for winter in the event of a power outage. during a call a few days later, he mentioned he brought his heater inside to prepare it for winter. he started it in the family room and had flames shooting up to the ceiling. at that point, i realized i had to watch everything i said and start thinking ahead of him.five or six years ago, he started dealing with incontinence. he fashioned cloth diapers for himself using material my mom used in crafts and sewing projects. he'd fold these in 42 layers of cloth. he was very proud of this number for some reason. it looked like a football stuffed in the front of his pants. it took me three years to get him to switch to depends. then he switched to cloth baby diapers when he found those in the back of a closet at home. he used those until a year ago when his personal physician came to his apartment and forced him to toss those out. he'd been drying them in the bathroom without washing them. the smell was overwhelming and management at his retirement center approached me. he started using depends again and drying out partially used depends on the bathroom floor. the overwhelming smell was back immediately and again generated a phone call from management.three years ago, he placed a corn bag in the microwave to warm it. they are common in my area and are used to warm a bed during cold winter nights or as a heating pad for pain relief. one night he got it hot enough to start a fire. he burnt a hole through the fleece sweater he was wearing and a hole through the blanket he'd covered himself with. he suffered a second degree burn on his left pectoral region.about two years ago, he suffered a tia in the early morning hours. my younger brother who lived with him at the time found dad's glasses in a dinner plate sized spot of blood on the floor, found my dad bleeding from his lip, tried to had dad his glasses 3 times, set them on the bathroom counter and left to get breakfast. at 2pm that day my family and i arrived to find him with dried blood on his face and took him to the er because his behavior was very odd. mri and other tests performed. doctors said he'd had a tia. because he wasn't safe at home anymore i put my foot down and moved him to the town i now live in.since arriving here, he's started hoarding clothes from the senior center clothing giveaway. he started collecting stuffed animals there as well and giving them to his special friend june. june's family requested this end because they were concerned about mites, lice and other bugs on the donations. management at his retirement center asked me to speak with him. he stopped giving her stuffed animals and instead gave her dresses and sweaters. june's family collected two 30 gallon garbage bags full of sweaters and dresses and gave them to management. this time the manager and i sat down with dad and he agreed to stop. immediately following that meeting he told me, "now i'm not saying you and your wife have to do this but the clothing giveaway has a lot of bras and panties and mens' underwear you could get for free." i cannot think of anything more repulsive than wearing someone else's used underwear.he frequently asks me what i know about a letter he received in the mail. i ask what the letter was about, who it was from, etc. i get unspecific details such as from that one place or that group or i think it was those people i talked to the other day. when he receives an explanation of benefits from the insurance company, he'll ask why he's getting a bill. when i explain it's not a bill, he argues with me.if you've read this far, thank you. thank you...

My mom had dementia
my mom had a rare form of dementia. it used to be called picks disease. now it’s called frontal temporal lobe dementia. anyway, my mom got it rather young. it caused so much drama, and fighting! eventually, it was the cause of my parents divorce. my mom was so paranoid of my dad, that she thought he was trying to kill her! (at this time i was going in ninth grade) i was manipulated into thinking my dad was trying to kill her. i didn’t know any better. i didn’t know she was sick! my poor dad got arrested (don’t worry he got out that night)! she had been arrested before for stealing. one time she got arrested for stealing l, while i was waiting for her to lick up a prescription for me since i was home sick. (this was before the whole craziness about the paranoia) i didn’t know she was sick at all. i feel so bad that i was manipulated by her. after my ninth grade year, i ended up moving in with my dad. the divorce took nearly ten years! her lawyer was horrible! he was clearly taking advantage of her! anyway, when i finally realized and believed that she was sick, i felt absolutely horrible! she had this illness for years! she never did forget who i was. (i am so grateful for that!) eventually, she stopped being paranoid of my dad (thankfully)! my older sister did become her guardian/(i forgot what the right word is). she was eventually put in a special home. my sister was able to visit her way more than i could due to my job at the time. my mom died on thanksgiving two or three years ago. i felt so bad that i couldn’t see her more. but my mom knew i loved her. she died with a smile on her face and still knew who my sister, my dad, and i were. my mom was such a wonderful person! she was a truly amazing person! i was so luck to have a mother like her. i miss her every single day. i did get to see her. just not as much as i wish i could have.

hi all. my mom, 73, was diagnosed last year with early onset dementia. she probably could have been diagnosed at least 3 years before that. my dad, also 73, is her primary caregiver. i live about 45 min from them with my own family.ok, so here's where i'm looking for advice. in my opinion my mom shouldn't be left alone and needs to have the house child proofed. if she has a headache, she finds and takes whatever medicine she sees first. she will turn on the oven, presumably to cook, and then forget it. my dad is a night owl and later sleeper meaning there are a few hours in the morning when my mom is awake, doing god knows what, and he is sleeping. mom is also hiding her medicine; she missed 4 night time doses last week alone. this puts my dad in the position to have to be more like a jailer, but he is not comfortable with that. he doesn't make her take her meds in front of him. he will still leave her home alone to go to the store and things like that. and, i think, she is starting to become violent with him. this is my main worry.i cannot force my dad to do anything and i know that. i have tried to help, offered to come over or for mom to come to my house while dad does stuff. i've offered to go to doctor appointments. i've been turned down consistently. at what point, though, do i need to step in to ensure my father's safety and sanity? i've been avoiding telling my dad what he must do, things which seem so obvious to me, because i am not her primary caregiver. i am becoming increasingly concerned for my dad's well being, though. any advice on how to make sure both of my parents are getting the care they need?

Emotional Memory and Dementia
it was not talked about, i never saw the program or ticket, but i knew. i could remember.when i was little my parents took me to see a local theatre production of rogers and hammerstein’s, cinderella. i was too little to remember anything that happened, from where we sat in the theatre, to which theatre we were in, to what dress i wore, yet i remember. these memories are not from seeing the program, or photographs from the day, or having conversations about it with my parents. there was something special about that experience that tapped into my emotional memory, pulling me in and allowing me to become apart of its narrative, or for it to become apart of mine. the power of storytelling, sound, sight, smell, touch, and creativity all were engaged during that experience, that has allowed me, almost 30 years later to remember this live theatre experience. i think it is why, when asked about my “start” in theatre, in aging, in therapeutics, i respond with this answer, speaking to that time when my parents took me to see something that tapped into my emotional memory, my creativity, my imagination. this experience pulled out of me an emotional reaction, giving something that should have been forgotten, life. what is it about some elements of our life that we remember so vividly, so purely, so warmly without the aid of family stories, photographs, or other prompts that enriches our lives? whis is it that allows each one of us to have expereinces where are emotions run with such strength that it can almost out pace dementia? this is sort of a messy question, but truly, do we understand the full power of emotional memory? do we know how we can use emotional memory to help someone living with dementia, live fully alive?early on in my work with dementia, i recognized the power emotional memory could hold, long before i knew anything about its research and support, the instinct and the results i saw were more than enough. as i worked to become relational with others in a way that would not require them to remember my name, title, the reason for being with them, i found ways to help them tap into that part of there lives, and frequently we found a common connection, a place of beauty, a place of warmth. the emotional memory, and engaging the senses, are, for me, the two pillars of successfully working with those living with dementia. filled out with creativity, imagination, and seeing the person for all they have and can continue to be and become, these two pillars are powerful! i saw how when we created something new, together, even if it was a reflection on something we both loved, a bond was formed and even on the bad days when one would not remember me, i would bring up our shared connection and suddenly i was no longer someone to fear, to fight with, to be alarmed by, but someone to smile with, to hold hands with, to spend a moment with as we move to the next part of the day. in a small way, i was recreating that theatre experience for us, by creating something that didn’t require logical or linear thinking. i normally fight for logical and critcial thinking, but this is an area where the emotions are the shining star. there is a great emphasis on improv and dementia right now. programs are popping up all over the country and beyond. it is used both as a teaching tool for care partners, but also as programming in memory cafés, life enrichment calendars, and in partnership with community organizations. last summer i wrote about these programs and my opinion about them remains strong. as we look for tools to help us understand emotional memory on a very simple level, engaging in improv workshops for those living with dementia shows us what each person can do, can remember, and can engage with and in. it always amazes me how someone can transition from not remembering much about their life, to telling me the full story of their college career, their parents, their 40th wedding anniversary, simply and clearly, by allowing the creativity and movement of play bring out stories that cause you to forget about dementia. these stories are not always joyful however, the stories of war vets often come out and haunt you as you move through the workshop and head home. it shows us where we are lacking in care for those living with dementia who are also veterans.early on in my work with dementia, i recognized the power emotional memory could hold, long before i knew anything about its research and support, the instinct and the results i saw were more than enough. as i worked to become relational with others in a way that would not require them to remember my name, title, the reason for being with them, i found ways to help them tap into that part of there lives, and frequently we found a common connection, a place of beauty, a place of warmth. the emotional memory, and engaging the senses, are, for me, the two pillars of successfully working with those living with dementia. filled out with creativity, imagination, and seeing the person for all they have and can continue to be and become, these two pillars are powerful! i saw how when we created something new, together, even if it was a reflection on something we both loved, a bond was formed and even on the bad days when one would not remember me, i would bring up our shared connection and suddenly i was no longer someone to fear, to fight with, to be alarmed by, but someone to smile with, to hold hands with, to spend a moment with as we move to the next part of the day. in a small way, i was recreating that theatre experience for us, by creating something that didn’t require logical or linear thinking. i normally fight for logical and critical thinking, but this is an area where the emotions are the shining star. &amp;#x200b;originally posted at dementialettersproject.com

I suspect that my mother has dementia, but..
hello everyone.it all started when i came to visit my mother and step-father abroad this year. my mother was always on the strange end, and she also has adhd so she was never quite “normal”. but during my visit (ongoing, it has been 6 months together now) i noticed that something was off. something that adhd doesn’t quite cover. after observing her a little more my gut told me there was a cognitive issue going on, and i started researching that which pointed to dementia, and the signs fit like a glove.. first of all, her driving got way worse but she blamed it on having to drive a bigger car. it got better after switching cars but she still sometimes freaks out and requires directions from her husband.. which didn’t happen ever when i was young. secondly, she never spoke good english but she used to teach english. now she requires audio lessons almost every day to keep her skills intact, which seem to deteriorate anyway. she can barely form meaningful english sentences, and she has difficulty finding the right words in native and pauses or goes uhmmm or just says “the thing” a lot.. today, she forgot what niagara falls was called and said namibia falls. the other day during a conversation about making a cake, she said “we have pineapple in the fridge” and i replied “oh cool, we can use strawberry, banana and pineapple” which made her look dead confused and utter almost like a reflex, “which one was pineapple?” as if she had totally forgot the fruit.. when confronted she said she thought i meant the opiod called pineapple (?????) so she got confused... while discussing making a cake... the other day she used 5 different plates for a batch of dough because she couldnt work out which one it could fit in. when confronted, she said she has bad sight (she has 2 different pair of glasses yet fails with things like this or frequently purchases wrong items at the supermarket. she also refuses to wear glasses most of the time..) she forgot the safe keys on the kitchen table. and most weirdly, she used to very rarely drink and frown upon it but she seems to do it a couple times a week now. she used to cringe at the sight of sweets but asks me to bake something daily. she even ate chips, which she used to call “disgusting factory-made poison” when i ate it. her impulsivity also got overall worse. there are more examples but these are the prominent. the issue is; my mother is also very abusive and narcissistic, and when i voiced my concern about this she verbally attacked me and her husband pretended to listen for 2 seconds and said i’m just exaggerating. my mother is now actively trying harder to hide the symptoms and manipulate my father against me, and my father seems dangerously oblivious. i don’t have a strong enough bond with my mother to care but nonetheless my gut is telling me she needs help asap and i cannot shake off this concern. what should i do? the only advice i have gotten so far has been that i cannot help a person unless they accept it. but standing aside doing nothing just doesn’t feel right... what if i’m right? what then?....

And now for something completely different - I'm the one with dementia posting in here.
hey all.i've lurked in here for quite awhile (since i was first diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia) and i see a ton of care givers, but no one with active dementia doing the posting.some of you are fucking saints. like, seriously. you've given up chunks of your life to take care of a loved one, and sometimes not a loved one, but you do it out of some sense of loyalty or duty or it's your job.some of you shouldn't be trusted with a teaspoon and are ungrateful wretches who i hope get to be cared for some day by someone just like you.and some of you are a mix who really need a support system because you're awesome, but doing harm because you simply don't know better.in any regard, in this case, i'm the 'nutty' one. i'm the one with dementia. i still am able to care for myself, and i live alone and really don't know anyone. when i got diagnosed, my friends fled, proving they weren't really friends anyway.it's a bit freaky at times, because i can get lost in my own 'giant' 680 sq. ft. apartment. i'll be 48 in 2 weeks. i've lost my license and therefore a lot of my freedom. i used to be a champion kayaker and still am a good writer - but i sometimes don't get the words right anymore and have to re-read a lot. and i lose my train of thought a lot. i love to play games, but sometimes forget how.i used to be an avid reader, but my books now collect dust. i can't follow them and often forget i'm reading them at all. movies are hilarious because i'm the cheapest movie watcher there is: just get me to watch the same movie 5 times over. i sometimes realise i've watched it before (especially if i really really like it), but don't remember enough of it, so can watch it again, sometimes the same day.things i used to enjoy, i don't do anymore because it's just to much effort and too confusing.it's really fucked up to read posts in this forum, btw. i'm the person you're looking after. or will be, some day. some day, i'll be that person so far gone, i won't know or understand or even care what's going on. i've had some of those episodes you describe, where someone freaks out and you post in here in tears and your frustration is so thick, i can nearly taste it off the words.i live alone. i don't have kids. i was a career woman, you see. i made a lot of money. and it was for shit. it's all shit. i wish i could live my life over again. maybe i could avoid the head traumas that happened decades ago that's causing my issues now. who knows? maybe i would have said 'screw you' to the corporate ladder i wasted all my time climbing and enjoyed life more. i have no idea. it doesn't matter anymore.i just want y'all to know that on the other side of the screaming or confused person you're looking after was someone who once was so full of colour. even if you didn't realise it, they were. they were once full of all colours and textures and life, and now it's ash. we're scared. we have moments of lucidity where the fog clears away just for a moment and we know. we know we're messed up and all of that intelligence snaps back into place, but it's too short and only for a moment, and we're back to being freaked out again and don't know why. we know something is wrong - i sure as hell do. i was the one who sounded the alarm when i realised that my photographic memory and 165 iq no longer applied to anything anymore, and i felt as stupid as a rambling reddit post.i still have my sense of humour so far. i can still function, though i'm highly ticked at losing the ability to drive, but it's better than killing someone or getting lost. i don't know how much longer i'll be able to write like this. a year? 4 years? no idea.but until then, i'll keep reading and writing nonsensical stuff and i leave this here to thank every one of you who looks after someone like me. i won't be able to thank you then. i'll probably hate you and think you're taking things away from me. i'll blame you for things you've never done. so thank you. your dad thanks you. your mom thanks you. your aunts &amp; uncles &amp; siblings &amp; grandparents &amp; friends all thank you. and a special love for those care givers who aren't even related to those they look after. please know you're not forgotten and remember that we're just alarmed &amp; frightened &amp; fighting for that next lucid moment, as fleeting as it is.

my sister texted me yesterday.  mom and dad were at her place a few days ago and she was helping him with his computer.  said that he was having a very difficult time following along with what she was doing, forgetting things.  mom says he's been getting increasingly forgetful for a while, and quarantine seems to be making it worse.  he's in his early 80s, so it was expected that sooner or latter the inevitable slide towards the long night would come sooner or later, but now it's here for me and my family.he hasn't seen a doctor yet, he hasn't gotten any sort of diagnosis or treatment plan.  he's still able to take care of himself, but we don't know how long that will last.  my mom is having to deal with a man who has always been difficult, but who is now slowly fading.  i can't even really talk to her because they live in a small house and she can't go out without him.next week my sister and i are going to go over to their home and i'm going to try to talk to mom and come up with some sort of a plan.  but i've studied this, and i've worked in patient care, and i know that there is never a happy ending to this story.  i don't want him to forget who his family is, or the things he's accomplished, or the people he's helped.  i don't want him to be a drain on my mom, a woman who has taken care of him for sixty years and deserves her own rest.  is it selfish of me to hope that if he really does have dementia that something comes along and kills him before it gets too far gone?  like a heart attack or some kind of fast acting cancer that isn't treatable?  i think i'd want that for myself but then i'm still relatively young and won't have to think about myself in that situation for years yet.  i don't want to lose my father or my mother, even tho i know it's going to happen regardless, but i especially don't want to lose either of them bit by bit.i had a beautiful cat that i rescued off the street when i was younger.  she was my best friend, and she always took care of me when i needed it.  then she started losing weight, and a trip to the vet found a mass in her abdomen.  that was the worst day of my life, since i knew it would be the last day i had her in it.  but i am at least able to find some solace in the fact that it took her quickly, and almost painlessly up until the moment she died in my arms.  she never lost her instincts, or her personality, or her dignity.  i had that for my cat, i want that for my mom and dad.  they're good people who devoted their lives to the service of others.  and i don't know what to do.

Dad (50) diagnosed with FDA and mom doesn't accept his condition
hi and thank you in advance for reading my long text! my father was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (fda) a couple weeks ago. we (me &amp; my siblings) started to notice his weird behaviour almost three years ago, but for my mothers actions the diagnose was put off for many years.dad had always had a good memory and he was this "jack of all trades" since had done pretty much everything both at home and at work. however, three years ago he started to forget small, kinda meaningless things, such as where he used to sit in the dining table, what he was supposed to buy from the store, how to unlock his phone, how the accounting was made at work etc... seeing these things made us children really worried and we asked our mom countless times to take him to see the doctor. here comes the catch: my mother is the kind of person who thinks that bad things will go away by not paying attention to them. she also wants to give everyone else the impression that our family is flawless. so she never took him to the doctor.after almost 2 years of seeing our fathers worsening condition he lost his job. things got pretty ruff between our parents: mom couldn't handle that the man who had always been this smart, helpful and funny person became slow and in need of continuous supervising. she started nagging and being very mean to him like he was doing everything intentionally. by the peer pressure of our family, after almost 3 years of the first signs, mom finally took him to see the doctor. while they tested him for months, she was telling around how there wouldn't be anything wrong with him and the doctors appointments were just going to be a waste of money. as we anticipated, there in fact was something wrong with him. after the doctors appointments my mom failed to tell anyone that he had gotten a dementia diagnose. my sister found out by seeing the doctors papers in our parents house and my mom just laughed it off by saying something like "oh yeah he has this umm.. something frontal or so dementia." she doesn't talk about his illness unless we ask her something, so it seems like she's just trying to ignore the fact that it exists. when i asked her about dad's diagnose she said that she hadn't read about it and asked me to "google it yourself." my brother is a doctor and he has tried to push my mother to seek peer support groups in our area, but she laughs it off by saying they're useless. today the illness is in this state that mom needs to supervise dad 24/7. i can clearly see the toll it takes on her but she doesn't accept any help and still keeps ignoring his illness by for example planning stressfull vacations and chores for him. i feel sorry for dad since all he hears everyday is nagging and yelling about how he is "fooling around" and forgetting things or doing things incorrectly. she tries to teach him the correct way of doing things but doesn't seem to understand that he won't remember. i would love to talk about the illness openly among our family, but it feels like it's some kind of taboo. we are all still young (parents in their 50's, i'm 20 and my siblings 26 &amp; 25) and i don't know how i can help while still keeping my mental health in order: this feels really overwhelming especially when everyone is just ignoring the fact that dad's not going to be around for much longer. i'm not completely sure what i'm trying to achieve with this post, maybe some peer support or ideas on how to help my mother to accept dad's worsening condition or something...? anyways thank you for reading this, it feels actually so good to open up about this to someone. also english is not my first language, so sorry for all the misspelling. tldr; dad diagnosed with fda and mother doesn't know how to handle it. need support or advice.

Dad has always been a doormat, and he can’t say “no” to grandma
this is more like a rant but i’m definitely open to any suggestions. grandma has dementia and she constantly forgets that we’re in a lockdown for the pandemic.  she’s living with my dad now who wants to keep a closer eye on her. due to her forgetfulness, she always complains about being bored and *demands* to get out to do things like grocery shopping and do things outside. my dad and i agree that under no circumstances she’s allowed to go out. if she screams or even is bored to death, then let her be. she needs to stay home 100000% until this is all over. no exceptions. she’s in that age rage where she will die if she contacts the virus. but my dad is a doormat his whole life. he never says no to anyone. he will always comply if anyone instructs him to do things. this personality trait has costed him a marriage and also his job. anyway, i found out yesterday that he brought her to the grocery store and out and about. he kept telling me that grandma was complaining about being stuck at home and bored. i was furious. i told him it doesn’t matter what she said. it’s him who needs to be making the decisions for her, not the other way around. he should’ve been more stern and said no. he should be that last line of defense. i understand that this is hard for him to see his own mother deteriorating like this, and needs time to adjust. and i might have also lumped his doormat personality into this and clouded my judgment. but i don’t know. it seems like if he’s constantly letting my grandma go out like that, it’s imposing dangers to her own health. i don’t know how to deal with all this.

How to deal with Mom not following proper virus precautions &amp; keeping my family safe?
i'm really stressed about how to take care of my mom right now. i was a stats major and have been watching and preparing for the virus since january, since on top of being the main caregiver to my mom, myself and my 2 kids have a genetic condition that would make getting this virus serious. every time i went to each store for the last time, i offered to buy my mom anything she needed or wanted. she always said she had enough and would get confused and angry. even though she refused anything, i did buy extra cat supplies, meds, and incontinence products for her and a few case lots of canned foods. i felt safe still going to her house and caring for her since she was not driving and the 2 other people that check on her are not working and have minimal contact with others. somehow she got her doctor to allow her to drive short distances again, she is just allowed to drive a few miles. she claimed since i was not going out she needed to get essentials and meds. she had plenty of meds, and essentials, maybe not the brand she likes (but how many of us are lucky enough to be able to buy the brand of toilet paper or frozen vegies we normally do?). she decided to go back to pt which is at the hospital last month, who knows why?. we have only one hospital for a huge rural area. it is overwhelmed right now with cases and all non essential stuff was cancelled. they offered pt at home, i got it approved and set up (with a pt she likes)  but she refuses and the hospital is keeping 2 pt on staff and are somehow allowing her to go even though they are only suppose to be emergency staff. there are countless people and wheelchairs and equipment she comes in contact with and she can't shower on her own, forgets to change clothes, does not wash her hands or use sanitizer. same issue with shopping. she has dishwasher soap but does not like the brand. she went to 3 stores and she can;t walk well so she will call for help, hang on to a stranger to help her in the store , ride on the cart and not find the item and have another stranger help her in back to the car. again she never washes her hands, forgets to change clothes for days (or says she does but i know it is the same clothes)  and rarely showers unless she has help. the two people who check on her, one would help her shower if i could not, will not go inside because of how much risk she has put herself in. i feel scared to go over. our family has been inside for over a month. my husband went to get perishable grocery pick up once. my doctor said i should not go over since my last lab work was not good (liver issues, first time in my life, great timing) . my mom has had a chronic cough for years and other medical issues so it is hard to tell if she is sick. i keep begging her to stay in , get pt at home, but she won't. i feel too scared to go over but i don't want to leave her alone. 4 months ago i struggled between budgeting my time to give my kids enough time and my mom enough time and it was hard, now i feel like it is a life or death choice of who i am with.  i talk to her everyday, but have not been going over. she has plenty of what she needs (again maybe not the preferred brand) and while one of the people that used to check on her won;t go physically help her shower, she still brings out her trash, brings in packages to the garage, and cleans the cat box.  my doctor said if my mom agreed to do at home pt and stay at home (since i know she will never be good with her hygiene ) then after 10 days i could start up spending days with her. i feel so bad , i know she is okay by facetime daily but i feel so guilty for not being there.

My 3 year old and I live with my stage 6 grandmother and tonight she slapped me in front of him.
it wasn't hard, painful or really very violent, but i was shocked by it. my kid was being a toddler and he's in this power rangers  phase where he play fights. well grandma has no patience for it. so my voice was raised trying to get my kid to cool it, threatening to start giving his toys away if he wont stop hitting. then grandma starts telling me she feels awful. this isn't new, and i have a hard time not rolling my eyes when she gets like this. super paranoid and anxious for no good reason because she feels alone even though i make a lot of effort to include her in the evening activities. honestly, i expect it anymore around the time this occurs (after 5), because it's when my dad (her son) leaves for the day to go home. anyways. i try really hard to be empathetic and get her to come sit on the couch with us (with my toddler being loud and needy all at the same time). she didn't even make it to the couch and asks me to take her to the er.my immediate reaction was no. of course it was no. she's being ridiculous and paranoid. they wouldn't help her. and with this covid-19 i am definitely not showing up to the er with my 85 year old grandmother and 3 year old.well, she of course hated my response starts walking away to find a phone or car keys maybe i don't know. i got up and walked over to her trying to explain my reasoning for not going to the er. she yelled "oh shutup" and slapped me as soon as i tried to stop her. i grabbed her slapping hand and shoulder with my other and told her not to slap me.  that i'm an adult and not 13 and i am responsible for her, and i'm making this decision right now.  could i have handled the situation better? yeah sure and if i didn't have a 3 year old battling for the affection card at the same fucking time i probably would have. i got her to sit down in front of jeopardy with my kid, who picked up on my covid explanation and starts saying "no grandma you not go to hospital you die." i held her for a while. gave her some cbd oil. after a few minutes she says she's starting to feel better. i dont know if it was the cbd or the physical touch but something helped her come out of the mania.i can't live like this anymore. i'm concerned she's going to hit my child back when he's play fighting. i don't like how she treats me in front of him. shes a model of bad behavior, especially about food. i cant get her to eat anything but these expensive yogurt parfaits from the grocery and icecream most days. so she goes to bed hungry and no amount of medication helps when you're hungry. which means she wakes up and roams the house. but she literally refuses all the food i offer. and frankly i'm done trying to cook special for her because every time i do she rejects it anyways. she forgets who we are to her frequently. calls my dad her dead husband's name or just simply forgets his name (her son). she gets so anxious when my dad leaves for the day that i dont know how she could possibly live in a care home without being put back on the heavy medication we've worked hard to get her off because she was like a zombie on it. the list of things is a mile long. but basically its really fucking hard to be around this 24/7 now that we're all on social distancing time.my dad is resistant to my moving out because that would mean either he moves in or we put her in a home. with this covid stuff we're all anti homes right now. but i'm losing my mind.  i didn't agree to care for her when i first moved in here 3 years ago. it just became what was expected as we realized grandma was losing her mind. i dont know if i'm looking for advice or just needed to vent.tl;dr// she was in a paranoid mania and told me to shut up and slapped me as i tried to explain why i wouldn't take her to the er. she doesn't know who we are to her a lot of the time anymore. wont eat proper meals. is a model of bad behavior for my 3 year old. i'm going insane having no break from this because of social distancing and i want out but my dad is all "well it's not in your head" no i just have to carry the weight of it. and also he doesn't want to have to move in here and take on the job full time.

Please help. My mom has very obvious dementia/cognitive impairment, but she denies this. She drives me crazy because she's always confused and can barely have a conversation.
here's a list of some weird things she does. the main point is, she lacks normal self awareness, is confused all the time, and cannot communicate properly. when you tell her something, it is like it gets filtered by her, and then her answer is based on what she thought you were saying. so communication is nearly impossible. she's also very paranoid and thinks everyone is doing things to annoy her. when they're actually just doing their own thing. she thinks everything has to do with her. she's obviously a narcissist as well. here's a list of her weird quirks.edit: a great example of her: we argued once in my room. i asked her to leave. instead, she steps forward towards me. i say again. please leave. she steps forward again. when i try to walk out she blocks me. she's trying to get me to do something so she can call the police. she has assaulted me in the past too. grabbed my arm and grabbed my chin and yelled "fuck you". i reported this to the police and they said it isn't considered assault. i'm sure if i was a husband and did that to my wife, i'd have been arrested. looks back at me when i crack my knuckles to show her annoyance. is like dr. jekyll and mr. hyde. super nice and loving when happy. but turns into a literal psychopath when angry. i have videos of this. it's clear from the video, that she enjoys when people suffer, if she's mad at them at the time. you can't being up anything to her if it's about her or her actions. immediately starts excusing her behavior and usually gets angry and starts an argument. i could say something as simply as "can you please lock the door after going outside?". that turns into "i have done everything for you and this is how you treat me". "i'm sorry i'm such a horrible mother".repeats things multiple times. says "i like this movie" 3x within 2 minutes.randomly announces what she bought me, despite my already seeing it. or announces that she did some cleaning and you're supposed to thank her.stares at me from across the room. when i meet her gaze, she will break the awkwardness by asking you a question that shows she cares. like "how's your back".wears improper clothes for cold weather yet complains about the cold.at night wears thin dress yet she always complains about cold.can't find things that are right in front of her. thinks it's funny and cute.can't remember things well. forgets entire events. answers questions in a way that indicates she is assuming what you meant rather than actually what you mean. she always presumes the motive or intent, rather than just listen. and the motive or intent is always against her. she looks for insults and if she implicates that you might be insulting her, she goes off.repeats a few dozen quotes throughout the day. unaware of her surroundings. does a fake 'startle' when she's "surprised" and thinks it's funny.drives poorly. will look left or right and drift into another lane. or at least drifts around her lane.loses things frequently. rarely knows where her keys are especially. thinks it's hilarious. makes snide remarks to others while driving.leaves lights on, and when asked about it, says it wasn't her. she forgets that she ever turned the lights on. has left the stove on 3 times. takes a long time to finish a sentence. stutters and stops at every word or two, as if she already forgot what she was going to say. always trys to "help", even when it's not wanted. if you decline her "help", she either says in a manic voice "i'm a helper!" and laughs like it's funny. or, she gets upset and slaps her thighs in exasperation, or says passive aggressively "ok, whatever".thinks (knows) that people do passive aggressive things to her. like if someone stops at the road, and puts on their seatbelt, she says they're "putting on a big "display"" for her. when they're actually just going about their day, not thinking of her at all. drove into oncoming traffic at an intersection, and denied that she did anything wrong. the lane in the middle was yellow. stops at intersections when she doesn't have a stop sign. grabbed my thigh tightly when she couldn't stop the car. i reacted like anyone who gets their thigh grabbed, and said woah what are you doing? she got frustrated and yelled "i was trying to stop!". as if grabbing my thigh and stopping the car are synonymous. update: she asked me about it later. she asked how i am and i said better. she complained about my reaction to grabbing my thigh. i said i was just startled. then she went on about how i didn't say thank you for paying for tommy, even though he's "not her dog". now she's having a pity party. saying she might as well just leave. and she said "and you come home and make sure to go right on to your phone".any inquiry or question is always met with a sigh or slap of the thigh in exasperation. as if your very question and existence make her unable to live. melodramatic is an understatement.doesn't want to waste electricity with a florescent bulb, in a commercial refrigerator that has 4 items in it, and those could be stored elsewhere. the cooler uses probably 30x more electricity than the bulb. (illogical thinking)"i'm glad you're happy, because i can't be right now". indirectly admitting to believing that external circumstances can and do affect your mood and attitude. e.g., things are going well so i'm happy. things are going bad and so i'm not happy.does things based on flawed logic and distorted thinking. we need to leave the back door unlocked because what if we lock ourselves out. wait, so you would rather leave a door unlocked, than remember to have keys on you either all the time or when you leave? most people don't worry about locking themselves out because forgetting things (keys, locked door) is not normal. rarely locks doors at home. leaves her car door unlocked at home almost every time.everything she does is ok. if you do it it's wrong. literally anything you can think of, this is true. she sounds like an elephant walking upstairs. but if i drop something, she runs upstairs and tells "what was that!?". god forbid i ask her to be quiet. she would start a tirade on me about all my flaws. it's like she can't take a drop of criticism. i'd appreciate any help.

Beginning to end-stage dementia in just weeks after stroke, no middle stage
hi everybody,i wanted to share my grandfather’s story in regards to dealing with dementia because i’ve found over the last 2 months that after all of my research and all of the online communities i’ve turned to, a lot of the information i received didn’t apply to us. it became more and more evident to me that people really are unique in how the same disease can affect countless people in different ways. my grandpa had been struggling with short-term memory loss for about 3-4 years. very standard stuff: couldn’t remember where he kept his keys and wallet even though they’ve been in the same spot for 40 years. a few times he took his truck to the shop, but a few hours later panicked because he thought his truck got stolen from his driveway.there were no other dementia signs, just the short term memory loss. early last month my grandma got up in the morning and asked my grandpa if he was ready to go to the grocery store. my grandpa said “i didn’t realize it was saturday and forgot we grocery shop on saturdays. go ahead without me.”my grandma returned home with the groceries to find out my grandfather had a stroke while she was grocery shopping. fast-forward 7 weeks and he has a few days left to live. the stroke caused the dementia to escalate from early stages to late stages. in the last 7 weeks weve seen him hallucinate, cry out for help for hours at a time, forget the names and faces of everybody around him, become delusional, lose the ability to walk without constantly falling, lose the ability to feed himself, lose the ability to sleep, and last week he stopped talking, stopped understanding us, and now he cannot eat or drink anything. two weeks ago he was able to sing and laugh and crack jokes. seven weeks ago he was able to drive himself to the grocery store and shop, go to the bank by himself, he was knowledgeable about world affairs and politics, able to have intelligent conversations, he was completely “normal” except for maybe asking the same question 4 or 5 times (he used to ask me 4 or 5 times in a day if it had snowed recently where i live). since he hasn’t eaten or had anything to drink in a week, he likely won’t live much longer. we (and the doctor) would be surprised if he lived 3 more days. he is very “out of it” and extremely frail and thin. he looks like a skeleton and is exhibiting signs of approaching death. not everybody gets a clear-cut beginning, middle and end stage of dementia. not everybody exhibits all of the dementia signs. it was so hard for me to understand that because everything online shows a clear stage-by-stage guide to dementia. but after having experienced this situation, i’ve come to learn that the people who kept reminding me that “everybody is different” were all right. i so badly just wanted a chart that would break everything down for me so i could follow the chart step-by-step, but it really doesn’t work that way. i’ve found that my family and i have been driving ourselves crazy trying to narrow down exactly when he will die. we feel like we need to know so we can be prepared and so we all can be there with him when it happens. but unfortunately we don’t get that luxury. my advice: take it a day at a time and at the end of the day be thankful you got one more day.

hi everybody,i wanted to share my grandfather’s story in regards to dealing with dementia because i’ve found over the last 2 months that after all of my research and all of the online communities i’ve turned to, a lot of the information i received didn’t apply to us. it became more and more evident to me that people really are unique in how the same disease can affect countless people in different ways. my grandpa had been struggling with short-term memory loss for about 3-4 years. very standard stuff: couldn’t remember where he kept his keys and wallet even though they’ve been in the same spot for 40 years. a few times he took his truck to the shop, but a few hours later panicked because he thought his truck got stolen from his driveway.there were no other dementia signs, just the short term memory loss. early last month my grandma got up in the morning and asked my grandpa if he was ready to go to the grocery store. my grandpa said “i didn’t realize it was saturday and forgot we grocery shop on saturdays. go ahead without me.”my grandma returned home with the groceries to find out my grandfather had a stroke while she was grocery shopping. fast-forward 7 weeks and he has a few days left to live. the stroke caused the dementia to escalate from early stages to late stages. in the last 7 weeks weve seen him hallucinate, cry out for help for hours at a time, forget the names and faces of everybody around him, become delusional, lose the ability to walk without constantly falling, lose the ability to feed himself, lose the ability to sleep, and last week he stopped talking, stopped understanding us, and now he cannot eat or drink anything. two weeks ago he was able to sing and laugh and crack jokes. seven weeks ago he was able to drive himself to the grocery store and shop, go to the bank by himself, he was knowledgeable about world affairs and politics, able to have intelligent conversations, he was completely “normal” except for maybe asking the same question 4 or 5 times (he used to ask me 4 or 5 times in a day if it had snowed recently where i live). since he hasn’t eaten or had anything to drink in a week, he likely won’t live much longer. we (and the doctor) would be surprised if he lived 3 more days. he is very “out of it” and extremely frail and thin. he looks like a skeleton and is exhibiting signs of approaching death. not everybody gets a clear-cut beginning, middle and end stage of dementia. not everybody exhibits all of the dementia signs. it was so hard for me to understand that because everything online shows a clear stage-by-stage guide to dementia. but after having experienced this situation, i’ve come to learn that the people who kept reminding me that “everybody is different” were all right. i so badly just wanted a chart that would break everything down for me so i could follow the chart step-by-step, but it really doesn’t work that way. i’ve found that my family and i have been driving ourselves crazy trying to narrow down exactly when he will die. we feel like we need to know so we can be prepared and so we all can be there with him when it happens. but unfortunately we don’t get that luxury. my advice: take it a day at a time and at the end of the day be thankful you got one more day.

My grandmother doesn’t know I’m her grandson anymore.
tl;dr:basically, my grandma has dementia and doesn’t remember that i’m her grandson. she knows me as “that nice boy” and that’s it. i don’t know how to handle that and i broke down tonight because i really thought about it. any advice on how to cope or kind words would immensely help. on my 18th birthday last year i got a call from my grandmother. i missed the call so i decided to step outside of the restaurant and call her back. i called and she picked up the phone. i said to her, “thank you for calling to wish me a happy birthday, grandma!” instantly she answered with confusion. “i didn’t call anyone to wish them a happy birthday. who is this?” for about 10 minutes we went back and forth with me telling her who i was and how i was related to her and who’s related to me. i eventually decided that she wasn’t going to remember and i was gone from my birthday dinner for a while. i said goodbye and hung up. a few seconds later, i sat down on the steps of the restaurant and broke down into tears. i didn’t know how to handle it. i texted my girlfriend to come outside and she calmed me down before we went back in. now, the family has known that my grandmother’s had dimensia (particularly sundowners which means it gets worse when the sun goes down) for a long time, but i had never experienced this before. i knew that she had trouble remembering family members that she hadn’t seen or heard from in a while, but i never thought that she’d forget me. after that call i don’t think i ever called her again. this wasn’t to be rude. it was to just avoid having to deal with the emotional pain again.we recently moved to pennsylvania to be closer to her and to my grandparents on my dad’s side. most weeks i’ll go over with my mother and have dinner with her and my cousin (who’s basically her caretaker). whenever we go over, she always calls me “that nice boy”, or “that nice boy who always visits”. tonight it hit me again that she doesn’t know who i am and that’s why she calls me, “that nice boy”. she calls me this to tell me that she thinks i’m some nice young man who just likes to stop by for dinner every once in a while.i don’t know how to cope with this and if anyone has advice or kind words, it’d be much appreciated.

My mother was recently diagnosed, and we are having to move her across the country.
tldr: my 62yr old mother has severe alcoholism which has affected her cognitive function permanently. my sister and i are moving her from her home in wa to ok to live with my sister. i am very worried the sudden change will negatively impact her. my mother spent the last 15 ish years in a downward spiral. we all distanced ourselves from her due to this. she was very negative and self destructive. her domestic partner now caretaker called us when things got bad financially. she had a property in another state that she stopped paying for, and was taken by the bank. when they got the final notice he saw it, brought it up with her, she seemed very confused and couldn't give her a straight answer. she started to gradually lose function in her legs nothing wheelchair severe but losing feeling in her feet and motor skills. she lost her job because she was forgetting she had to work or would get sidetracked on the way to work and get lost. so he gets us involved. she has not been drinking for over a year(that we know of.) my older sister has taken control of her "estate" to make sure she's not losing money, she has become the person in control of her medical stuff. her caretaker was once her boyfriend (of ten years) has gotten to the point where he is tapped out emotionally. i would say things have drastically gotten worse in the last three months to where she doesn't remember conversations or activities from the day before. she doesn't remember what happens at her doctors appointments, and she lately has been waking up thinking she lives in a town where her and my dad bought their first house 40 years ago. she also lives on the complete opposite side of the country from us (she's in wa, we are nc, ok.) so it makes keeping tabs on her tricky. obviously we have taken moving her with the covid-19 issue into consideration. she lives on an island off the coast of washington where the virus is not prevalent. after speaking with her doctors is was a "damned if you do, damned if you don't. but better to get her sooner rather than later. "so. we have decided in the last month to move her in with my sister. she is a stay at home mom, and would be able to be with her every day. in two weeks we have 4 days to pack up everything and fly her back with us to ok without her bf. he is on board with everything. she doesn't remember any part of it, but is reminded of it daily. in her mind is still so in love with him. i'm very worried that a big change like this is going to negatively impact her. it's a really difficult situation, because he is really good at calming her down. she really isolated herself from us over the last 5 years. however she is still our mom somewhere in there. if anyone has any tips or thoughts about how we can make this sudden transition easy on her it would be greatly appreciated.

I'm scared
hey, y'all. i'm a 25-year-old male, and i've been suffering from memory, cognitive and personality changes. it started with memory problems. forgetting to put food back in the fridge, forgetting to lock the door, forgetting to flush the toilet(i know, gross and it's extremely embarrassing!). i can never remember the date. people aren't very understanding and just get angry at me as if i'm intentionally doing it to spite them.  which is frustrating and part of why i'm withdrawing.the cognition problems started last year and have been progressively getting worse. i have a hard time understanding what people are saying right away. leading to awkward silences and misunderstandings. finally, my personality has become really bizarre. i use to pride myself in my ability to talk to anyone. now, i can't even maintain conversations with close friends. this is the most depressing part and has made me think of suicide. doctors have done an mri, ct and blood work. which has all come back normal. i recently had a neuropsychological test done, but have yet to receive the results. is it possible to have dementia at my age? i feel that if i do, i'm still in the very early stages. i'm just scared that my studies will be affected and that i won't be able to work and become homeless. labeled as a nut-job no one takes seriously. sorry for the long post. even if i don't have this disease, i feel that i've already experienced a snippet of it and wouldn't wish on anyone.

Dementia in My Family
i am a 31 year old male living in florida.  about a few years ago i realized that i have developed dementia, and since have been seeing a psychiatrist (since 2015) when i had a major episodes of "lost feelings" and panic after taking a medication called   risperdal (**risperidone**).although i strongly believe i have dementia, my psychiatric who put me on celexa and zyprexa believes otherwise. he tells me only old people get this devastating disease.now, for about 1-2 years i am seeing my mother and father with symptoms of dementia, especially my father. here is an example.  my father and i waited for my mother to come back to the car, so my father turns off the key and removes the key.  when my mother arrives back to the car, my father thhought the key was in the ignition. another example with my father, he forgets what road he is on, and i tell him "you dont know where you are? you have lived here since 2005." his response is that he doesnt go on this part of john young parkway much. another example with my father is that he forgets to take his phone with him sometimes when he leaves the house, and forgets his wallet even less often. he also always keeps his phone in his right front shirt pocket, and sometimes reaches there for his phone, forgetting that he already removed it and put it on the cars cup holder.some of the examples of my mother include that she lately started having big panic attacks and is forgetful. she forgets and her memory isn't sharp as it used to be.  she has also lost interest in going out and working like she has done all of her life, and is extremely depressed for no reason.as for me, i have a mild case of all of these symptoms. when i am not on celexa and zyprexa i'm completely demented.for the past few years i have been starting to think that someone has done this to me, my mom and my dad, and i can only think of two people. suspect number two lived with us all of our lives and was raised by us. suspect number one always slept over our house, did lots of cocaine in secret and cooked for us. he would cook various types of dishes for us at his home in gainesville, fl and would bring it to us here in orlando. he may have had something against us so he poisoned our food that he cooked for us.  \[[here is where i need your help.  who should i talk to about this? i am afraid to talk about this to anyone out here, in fear of them thinking i am crazy. i'm not crazy.. i'm very critical and analytical. i used to be an it guy so troubleshooting is what i'm great at. i need some advice.&amp;#x200b;jason

Dementia &amp; my dad
hello everyone,i'm writing this after i wrote the wall of text below. my dad is in his late 60's, he was diagnosed with dementia about 3/4 years ago. in the last half year i noticed things going south with my father fast. i felt the need to share my thoughts because i never do. sorry for the way to long and uncoordinated story, it could be way shorter. i tried to rationalize my thoughts and situation(i'd like to think i'm pragmatic and this brings peace to my mind) and just started writng my thoughts. it was kinda fun to do actually, the anonimity helps. english is not my first language so forgive any mistakes  :')growing up my father was always working, he would do anything for you when you needed him, but in day-to-day life we didn't see eachother much and a lot of the care for me and my siblings was done by my mother. when i was young my mother and i didn't get along well, this was mostly my fault for being a stubborn adolescent. i can now realize how much effort she put into helping me grow up but then i tried to put as much distance between us as possible. she can be very controlling and trying to manage things(she pretty much controlled everything in the familiy's affairs). i think a lot of that has to do with my father not taking this responsibility as much and she sorta grew in this position. i know that sounds negative towards her, though i'd like her to relax more i know see means the best, always. after high school i moved to a different city for school. this was around the time my father got the diagnosis. after around a year or so my father had to retire because they started noticing my father forgetting things which made him not suitable for work anymore. now he finally has time to relax, get a hobby etc but all the initiative left my father. he stopped doing anything by himself. expcept his daily routine. we live on a farmhouse and we have horses. it's the on thing he always made time for, it was his only past time activity. he takes care of the horses and does chores outside, while completely living in his own world and sorta 'zoning out'. he loses tools a lot and is probably searching for something he lost about 2/3 hours a day. checking the same spots over and over and looking lost. he reads the newspaper 4 times a day and eats his standard food. he almost never leaves the house and although my mother tries a lot to keep him socialized by inviting people etc, and i try to be there as much as possible. he has to few interractions with people. at this point my mother has to think for two people all the time, she takes control over everything that happens with my father. my father needs some guidance so it somewhat needed, but when my father does something wrong/forgot something she gets angry at him and pushes him a lot. i know she doesn't mean it, and a lot has to do with the fatigue/stress/negative state of mind she's in. i can see it puts my fathers brain in overdrive and it hurting him. lately he can react angrily back aswell, in my entire childhood i can maybe remember one time he got angry. i had to move back to my parents place for a few months because my lease ended and i didn't have anything lined up. this meant long commutes but at least i could spent more time with my parents. my mother had someone to talk to about things, which helped her a lot and i tried spending time with my father. i recently got a new place to live again and tbh i feel like shit for leaving those two alone. i know things will go south again and i hate seeing my parents being unhappy, but travelling 3,5 hours every day next to my internship and being there for other people all the time fuck'd me up. lost weight, slept awful which eats you up in combination with an office job and i seriously hated life all-around. i was in a bad mood and i noticed i sometimes would deflect that on my father... i know at that moment that it's wrong but i get this angry feeling and i gues someone with dementia is an easy target to deflect on. to give this thread some purpose instead of me being emo i'll end with a question.does anyone else experience this? due to fatigue/depresive thoughts getting irritated and putting pressure on the person with dementia when they do something wrong/lost something/forget something? e.g.: he/she loses the car keys. i fucking hate myself afterwards. i want my father to have the best remaining years he can have. much, much love to anyone dealing with this fucked up disease, in a way it spreads to the brains of closed ones of the dement person.

Usually okay, but mom not remembering me is starting to get to me...
i guess i've just been having a hard time recently and her forgetting me every few minutes is tough. and i worry about the times when she says, "no" to the staff at her doctor's office when they ask, "is that your daughter?" i have this irrational fear that someone will call the police and arrest me for kidnapping a sick old lady. i carry my dpoa with me at all times and i imagine being forced to show it to a cop just to prove she's my mom. it's silly, but my head's a bit all over the place right now. some of it is that it hurts that she remembers my siblings, but not me. i know it's a disease and that this shouldn't hurt my feelings, but there you go.i don't call her "mom" anymore after an outburst a few months ago when she screamed, "don't you call me mom. you're just some girl i don't like who takes care of me." and that was kind of a wake-up call so she's not "mom" anymore. i call her "kid" at all times like, "come on, kid, the elevator is this way." it helps avoid all the confusion and conflict. i'm just some girl who takes care of her.and maybe she'd start to remember me if i called her "mom"? or maybe she'd just scream at me again. there's this weird feeling that i'm not me anymore because i spend every day taking care of someone who doesn't know who i and doesn't believe me when i say i'm her daughter. almost like i'm not exactly real anymore? is that weird? i kind of snapped at her today and cursed, too. and none of that helps, but it felt nice to assert that i'm *me*. i always feel guilty when i lose my temper because i know there are a million better ways for both of us to handle it all. okay, rant over. didn't mean to vent so long, but just wanted to get this off my chest. thanks for listening and being a really helpful group. i've felt better since joining and reading everyone's posts.

[Possible trigger warning for death] It's been nearly 9 months and I'm more full of regret and sadness
hi all. i've posted here from old accounts, even walking those with family in home hospice through what to expect. my grandmother passed last year. she had dementia (likely vascular) but i think the stroke that triggered it is what ended up taking her. her end stage symptoms were very much like my great aunt who passed months after a massive stroke. nonetheless, i miss her (no shit). it feels surreal that she developed dementia. i feel so guilty not spending more time with her though i was one of 4 main caregivers for her. i felt so much anxiety, nervousness and apprehension around her. i was so scared of how others would treat her. i was so wrapped up in my anxieties that i didn't think to just...be there. i wish i could've seen if she remembered my grandfather. i wish i hadn't waited until she was nearly in hospice to say i loved her every time i left her room. i try to tell myself that it's just normal to feel this way but i don't know. i feel wrong for feeling angry and sad because my grandmother didn't forget us. she knew me, my sister, my mom, most, if not all her siblings, etc. she had her off days (and man, sometimes there were stretches of them) but overall, she was so...motherly and just easy going. she knew she had dementia (at least about 2 years into a 4 year diagnosis) and knew she needed care and i can't help but wonder how that was for her. i guess i'm only writing this here because you all know what it feels like to lose someone twice. my family and i have answers many don't with this disease-what triggered the dementia likely, what likely triggered the thing that triggered the dementia, etc. we weren't strangers to my grandmother on her passing. i'd move heaven and earth for just one more moment to feel her hands, tell her i love her and hear her call our names a million times just to say "i don't need anything; i was wondering what you were doing?"for those going down this path: if i can answer any questions, please let me know; absorb the pain, the pleasure, the sad and funny parts. this was my first big familial loss and i know i'll get to a better point eventually but fuck this disease and i pray a cure comes before my parents get too much older.

Any thoughts on what might be going on with my mom?
* age: 61* sex/gender: female* height and weight: maybe 5'4, roughly 120 pounds* race/ethnicity: caucasian* geographic location (eg. canada): new england* pre-existing medical issues (if any): none* current medications (if any): none that i know of besides maybe a vitamin or two* duration of complaint (how long has this been happening): gradually worsening for about 15 yearsmy mom has, seemingly, been having worsening memory and cognitive abilities for about 15 years now. it's been pretty gradual and it's hard to quantify, ultimately, but i know she's worse now than she was a few years ago, and that a few years ago she was worse than the few years prior, etc. some background: she's had lots of emotional trauma in her life. i know there were some extended family issues when she was younger but the biggest ones are that her biological father committed suicide when she was maybe in her late teens, one of her brothers committed suicide when she was in her early 20s, her longterm boyfriend left her with a pregnancy (me) when she was in her late 20s, and then her husband of 12 years died very unexpectedly in 2002. i don't know if she sought counseling for the suicides but i am fairly positive she hasn't had any counseling since my dad's death in 2002.at this point she's almost 62 and seems to have serious memory issues as well as some cognitive issues. it's hard to know if it sounds like dementia/alzheimer's or if it's a result of isolation/stubbornness.she lives alone. she has really no friends that i know of. she sees a few family members on occasion but mostly she only sees her boss. her job causes her to have an odd schedule (mostly working 5pm until 10pm or later on weekdays and then scattered hours on weekends) and she doesn't have co-workers in the traditional sense so she is rarely with other people. she's extremely set in her routine and seems to get very anxious if she strays from it at all.she can't (well, can, but refuses to) do things like park downtown on her own, do longer drives on her own, basically do anything that falls outside of her routine of work/tv/sleep/groceries unless she is accompanied by someone else. she forgets things pretty frequently. she will repeat the same phrase or same story in a very short span of time (like within 5-10 minutes) seemingly without realizing she's doing so, or she'll forget something told to her just a few minutes before, even forgetting it multiple times in the span of a conversation. i've also noticed her re-telling stories and changing up details, almost like embellishing them, but it doesn't seem to be a lie, rather just a misremembering, or even merging details of a real story with things like books/movies she's seen, if that makes sense.if we play a new board or card game she can't remember whose turn it is, what the rules are, how many cards to put down, etc, even when she's told 6, 7, 8 times. she has stories and phrases she will repeat every time she sees a person for weeks on end. i'm also fairly sure she posts things on facebook (like articles, photos, etc) and then likes them later because she's not even aware it's her own post. or she'll respond to a text by calling me and then, a couple hours later, she'll respond to the text with a text... as if she doesn't remember we already talked.she has trouble following conversations even with just one person but she gets totally lost if there are more people involved. i have a 6-month-old and she's been making comments about him eating totally inappropriate things -- like candy or frosties from wendy's -- since he was a week old, not in a joking way but like she truly doesn't realize it, even when i've told her at least a dozen times that he can't eat things like that. she just doesn't seem to retain the information at all.almost every time she says a quote from a movie or tv show she can't initially remember who said it or what it's from, just that it's from something. i found out recently that she has at least a half dozen or more e-mails, and i suspect it's partly because she ends up forgetting her password and can't figure out how to get a new one -- technology in general completely baffles her. she also has the most scattered password cheat sheet at her house (a piece of 8x11 paper that is covered in emails/passwords written in every direction/size, it's so jumbled). when things like that happen -- she can't get into her e-mail -- she gets extremely frustrated and flustered very quickly. same with when she's driving, she has wicked road rage. a lot of her memory loss stuff almost seems like she's just not paying attention to begin with, but either way that seems like a problem. i know this isn't a ton to go on and no one can definitively diagnose her based on this, but... any ideas? have you experienced something similar? if so, what the hell did you do?

* age: 61* sex/gender: female* height and weight: maybe 5'4, roughly 120 pounds* race/ethnicity: caucasian* geographic location (eg. canada): new england* pre-existing medical issues (if any): none* current medications (if any): none that i know of besides maybe a vitamin or two* duration of complaint (how long has this been happening): gradually worsening for about 15 yearsmy mom has, seemingly, been having worsening memory and cognitive abilities for about 15 years now. it's been pretty gradual and it's hard to quantify, ultimately, but i know she's worse now than she was a few years ago, and that a few years ago she was worse than the few years prior, etc. some background: she's had lots of emotional trauma in her life. i know there were some extended family issues when she was younger but the biggest ones are that her biological father committed suicide when she was maybe in her late teens, one of her brothers committed suicide when she was in her early 20s, her longterm boyfriend left her with a pregnancy (me) when she was in her late 20s, and then her husband of 12 years died very unexpectedly in 2002. i don't know if she sought counseling for the suicides but i am fairly positive she hasn't had any counseling since my dad's death in 2002.at this point she's almost 62 and seems to have serious memory issues as well as some cognitive issues. it's hard to know if it sounds like dementia/alzheimer's or if it's a result of isolation/stubbornness.she lives alone. she has really no friends that i know of. she sees a few family members on occasion but mostly she only sees her boss. her job causes her to have an odd schedule (mostly working 5pm until 10pm or later on weekdays and then scattered hours on weekends) and she doesn't have co-workers in the traditional sense so she is rarely with other people. she's extremely set in her routine and seems to get very anxious if she strays from it at all.she can't (well, can, but refuses to) do things like park downtown on her own, do longer drives on her own, basically do anything that falls outside of her routine of work/tv/sleep/groceries unless she is accompanied by someone else. she forgets things pretty frequently. she will repeat the same phrase or same story in a very short span of time (like within 5-10 minutes) seemingly without realizing she's doing so, or she'll forget something told to her just a few minutes before, even forgetting it multiple times in the span of a conversation. i've also noticed her re-telling stories and changing up details, almost like embellishing them, but it doesn't seem to be a lie, rather just a misremembering, or even merging details of a real story with things like books/movies she's seen, if that makes sense.if we play a new board or card game she can't remember whose turn it is, what the rules are, how many cards to put down, etc, even when she's told 6, 7, 8 times. she has stories and phrases she will repeat every time she sees a person for weeks on end. i'm also fairly sure she posts things on facebook (like articles, photos, etc) and then likes them later because she's not even aware it's her own post. or she'll respond to a text by calling me and then, a couple hours later, she'll respond to the text with a text... as if she doesn't remember we already talked.she has trouble following conversations even with just one person but she gets totally lost if there are more people involved. i have a 6-month-old and she's been making comments about him eating totally inappropriate things -- like candy or frosties from wendy's -- since he was a week old, not in a joking way but like she truly doesn't realize it, even when i've told her at least a dozen times that he can't eat things like that. she just doesn't seem to retain the information at all.almost every time she says a quote from a movie or tv show she can't initially remember who said it or what it's from, just that it's from something. i found out recently that she has at least a half dozen or more e-mails, and i suspect it's partly because she ends up forgetting her password and can't figure out how to get a new one -- technology in general completely baffles her. she also has the most scattered password cheat sheet at her house (a piece of 8x11 paper that is covered in emails/passwords written in every direction/size, it's so jumbled). when things like that happen -- she can't get into her e-mail -- she gets extremely frustrated and flustered very quickly. same with when she's driving, she has wicked road rage. a lot of her memory loss stuff almost seems like she's just not paying attention to begin with, but either way that seems like a problem. i know this isn't a ton to go on and no one can definitively diagnose her based on this, but... any ideas? have you experienced something similar? if so, what the hell did you do?

Looking for advice from anyone that's been in a similar situation
my grandmother has recently been diagnosed with vascular dementia though the diagnosis had been a long time coming. i'm hoping for some advice about our family's situation and to see if anyone has been in a similar one. my grandmother has never been what you would call a good person. she was a terrible mother to my mum and aunt, neglectful, spiteful and vicious. my mum left home at 16 and they didn't speak for years, my aunt left the country around the same time and never came back only visiting once every 20 years or so. my mum and my grandmother made a sort of reconciliation when my grandfather (another piece of work) died almost 30 years ago but it's always been a difficult relationship. my grandmother has never been the slightest bit interested in me and so i reacted more or less the same to her when i was growing up.the woman is the embodiment of bitter. she was set to be wealthy but her family disowned her when she married my grandfather. i think it's this that's set her up to be how she is. when she's around family she never has a good word to say about anyone, everything is shit, all of us are useless. she's the most selfish, ignorant, self-centered cow i've ever met in my life. this was all before the dementia. she never wanted much to do with us before it. this changed about two years ago when she started struggling and we all stepped up, because, even though she's an absolute horror, family is family i guess. so, for the past 2 years all of our lives have revolved pretty much solely around her. my mum and dad visit her three times a day, home help comes in twice a day, she has a cleaner, her breakfast and lunch are delivered by meals on wheels and my dad cooks her evening meal. i visit after work and provide lifts to places, took her shopping before she got to frail to go out, and generally try to help. all she does is criticise, even before she really started to decline mentally nothing was good enough. when i visit all i get is either a torrent of abuse (i know this is a symptom but she did this before the dementia), or backhanded snide, bitchiness, she's even nastier to my mum and honestly it takes me all i've got to bite my tongue sometimes and not retort. i hate how she treats my mum especially knowing the history (including some truly horrific things my mum doesn't know i know because my aunt told me). it's getting harder and harder to be empathetic with this woman. tonight's visit she was just gunning for a fight as soon as my mum and i walked in. she's resentful of the fact we both work (she's never worked a day in her life having gone from wealth to choosing to live on benefits instead of working) and started bitching about the fact we never visited during the day and she was sitting "lost and lonely" all day (in reality my mum had already been in twice, she had a "lunch club" at church, her carers had been in twice, my dad had been in with her dinner). i understand she may have forgotten but honestly sometimes she really is just trying to be a cow and laying on guilt trips - it's been her modus operandi for decades. we've all been trying to just let it slide, never stoop to her level and be as sympathetic as possible but bloody hell it's getting tough.honestly, i'm exhausted, my mum is struggling big time, it's causing a lot of problems between my parents now too because their whole lives revolve around my grandmother, who my dad has always had little patience for anyway because of how she's treated my mum. there's only the three of us dealing with this as all other family live abroad and have nothing to do with her. she's first on the list (allegedly) for getting into a home (at her request) but even this isn't good enough and we should have been "trying harder" to get her a place one minute and the next are the world's worst c\*\*ts for not having her live with me or my parents. my parents already have my dad's mum living with them and honestly i just don't want her living in my house. she's dirty, takes pride in not washing, and shits everywhere. again, this has been something she did long before dementia, (like in her 30s she was slovenly and gross as well apparently).if you're still reading, thank you for sticking with me. i've left a lot out because it's long enough as it is, but basically i'd like to know if anyone else has had a family member that has always been awful and now they're duty bound, for lack of a better term, to look after them because of dementia. how did you cope with it?

How do you cope with the spite and paranoia?
my 91 yo mother has alzheimer’s and vascular dementia. her memory loss and paranoia have been getting worse over the last year. she has always refused to believe she has dementia. my 93 yo father takes care of her at home. he does everything, cooking, cleaning, running errands. i visit every 6-8 weeks. my mom now hates my dad. she says the most horrible things about him and accuses him of things he would never do. she thinks he is having affairs every time he leaves the house. she says he is trying to kill her and she won’t take any meds or eat the food he prepares half the time. she wants a divorce and wants him to leave. she is very frail and prone to falls and depends on him for everything. she is so mean and spiteful now. i know this is all due to the dementia. i just returned from visiting them and had to cut my trip short to just one night because now my mom is treating me the same way she treats my dad. there is no reasoning with her anymore. my mom has always had a mean streak. she would hold everyone emotionally hostage whenever someone would cross her while i was growing up. but these situations were few and far between. but now it seems to be the norm. this mean side of her appears to be taking over. during the few hours i was there she told me repeatedly she didn’t want me there and she no longer has a daughter. i am conspiring with my dad to kill her or lock her up. she said the most hurtful things to me. i just couldn’t take it and had to leave. again, i know this is the disease, not my mom. but i can’t be around her when she is like this. she might call me in a few days to apologize or will have forgotten everything that happened. but i am afraid that’s not going to happen this time. she only trusts my brother now mainly because he isn’t around her as much. she has alienated all her friends. we don’t know what to do. my dad refuses to put her in assisted living unless he goes with her and he’s not ready for that. i love my mom but i can’t be around her now. we don’t know what to do.

Possible stroke; dementia or delirium?
my grandmother is 74 and has been in the hospital since jan 4th. she was taken to the emergency room because she thought she had a blood clot in her leg. they searched and could not find one, however, her kidney function was low, her heart was at 30bpm and she had a uti. in the last 6 months, we have found out she has stage 3 lung cancer, 6 crushed vertebrae in her neck (which she cannot have surgery for because she is too weak), nerve damage in her neck and a broken foot. after a few days in icu, she was stable and they sent her to a rehab facility. two days inside the rehab facility and they rushed her back to the er due to her heart dropping back down to 30bpm, stroke team responded and they called my mom to go up there. they have not confirmed nor denied her having a stroke, regardless of the stroke team responding. ever since that episode, she has been irritable, hallucinating, paranoid, refusing to eat, and refusing all medication. she was saying off the wall things and acting abnormal for days, such as...1. she believes her night nurse has 3 girlfriends and he is neglecting her to spend time with them in the lobby2. pointing outside the window and counting fires3. her roommate is spying on her for the doctor 4. refused to let them do a scope to find internal bleeding out of fear that they are going inside her brain 5. saying things like “it’s a good day to die”, “pray for me because i’m dying tonight”6. being abnormally combative with nurses....hitting them with pop bottles and spraying it all over her room7. didn’t eat or drink anything for 3 days 8. sitting in her room with no tv, no ipad, no light on and refused to go to sleep for 3 days she was incontinent for days, couldn’t walk or even pick her head up off her pillow and continuously ripped out her iv until they put her in soft restraints. they actually had her set up to go to a long term facility until a nurse was able to get through to her and convince her to start taking her medication again, which my grandma hesitantly agreed to take just 1 pill. it has been 3 days since she took that 1 pill. nurse convinced her to take all of her medication the last 2 days. today, she is walking, talking, laughing, smiling, using the bathroom on her own, and eating. even though it has been some progress, she still isn’t acting quite right. she still firmly believes that a room down the hall had a fire and she could smell the burning body. will not touch the pop that is still sealed because she thinks nurses are trying to drug her. still believes they are spying on her to look inside of her brain, definitely thinks they tried forcing her to sign paperwork to cut into her skull. recognizes things like she gets paid the 25th, but forgets that the 25th was yesterday. she thinks i am taking her to the casino in a couple days. we haven’t gotten much insight on what is wrong since my grandmother refuses to let them draw bloodwork for labs and will not give another urinalysis. the whole month has been a rollercoaster of ups and downs and i’m not sure what to think. does this sound like dementia caused by stroke? i really appreciate any advice or piece of information you have to offer.

Is this dementia?
my husband is about 70 years. he still works as an attorney, handles our taxes and finances and seems competent doing so. over the last two years he has become a presumably racist trumpy and this is a definite behavioral change. our daughter has written him off completely for a very particular reason. he has refused ( i choose this word purposely) to  remember details of her life. he questions her repeatedly about minor things, gets answers and forgets them. her last straw happened at a christmas eve dinner where he once again ignored her previous answers but remembered every intimate detail of his good friend's life. the fact is the fellow is a blowhard. he enjoys being the center of conversation. he waits for a pause in order to interject and take over any conversation. i doubt he really cares about or processes the information he gets from other people, at least not in any long term way. as an attorney he needs to listen to clients so i know he is capable of doing so. i have been diabetic for nearly ten years. we have had hundreds of conversations about what i can and can't eat. when i came home last night he said he saw my medication on the counter and asked me if i was diabetic. now i know how my daughter feels. i'm outraged. is it possible he has ignored every conversation for nearly ten years. knowing him, yes i think it's possible, but really? is dementia sporadic? does it effect only a few areas of life before becoming more global? i should add that a few years ago i had him evaluated by a neurologist and nothing organic was found. the neurologist (who is also a friend) said it's possible he's just an asshole.

heads up, this is going to be a bit of sleep deprived rant, but it's intention is a cry for help - my grandmother was diagnosed with ftd at 52, lived 10 years, mostly in a zombie like state and finally passed in 2008. this was obviously gut wrenching and also alarming given how young she was. fast forward to 2018 and my mom (at age 60), starts showing some of the same signs my grandmother did - socially inappropriate, angry outbursts, forgetful, going in the shower with articles of clothing still on, lack of empathy, etc. i thought at first she was just getting old and ornery, but it finally clicked. once it did, i couldn't believe i didn't put it together before. she hasn't been to a doctor for any of this or been diagnosed, but it seems fairly obvious what is going on. my mom currently handles everything - the bills, the taxes, the laundry, everything including taking care of her own aging dad.i talked to my step-dad and he also has seen these changes and is scared. he is a tough guy, so once i knew he knew something was wrong and is scared, my world sort of fell apart because now i know it's real. since this reality has sunk in, i'm in a full panic 24/7. i have not slept without waking up every hour in a heart thumping panic in weeks. what keeps me up are these realities and questions -   * my mom doesn't know anything is wrong. we don't want to tell her because we think she will commit suicide, but this poses many problems stated below. i also wonder if not telling her is ethically the right thing to do here. * her driving is fine now, but i want those who are getting in the car with her to know her condition before they decide to ride in it. i don't want her driving my kid, nor any others i care about, but how do we tell her this without letting on what is happening? what happens if she plows into a bunch of kids on the side of the road - that will haunt me as something i could have prevented.* we don't know what paperwork needs doing, but we know she does not have a will and is a homeowner with her husband, my step dad. what paper work should we get her to fill out now while she can and how do we convincer her to without telling her something is wrong? do we need poa's for anything? how does one get poa, fill out a form? where do we get the form and how do we make if official? so many other questions about paperwork.* **will i also get this?**  this sends a cold chill down my spine. the more i've read trying to find something comforting, the more i fall into total hopeless despair. i know i have a 50% chance, and for me and my pessimistic attitude, that means i will or already have it. **i feel suicidal over this**. i have never felt suicidal before until now. i'm 39 and have a wife and a young child and feel like the sooner i do it the better to try and give them as long as time as possible without me so that they can get over my death sooner. i know i can get the dna test, but i'm too much of a coward to get it. i realize this makes no sense if i am suicidal anyways. i also have an older sister who feels the same way. this is all so tragic given my younger sister did commit suicide years ago, and now the remaining of us also want to follow. life is bleak.* i feel like we should give my mom the option of suicide while we still can. i feel like as a family we should give her permission to do so and let her do things on her terms. i don't know how this would go down or the legalities involved but i feel like it should be her right to do so. i live in ca and there is no death with dignity conditions in the law here that allows for suicide of the demented. * how am i going to hold down a job carrying all this? i provide the sole income in our household. i need to help my stepdad with all this and can barely manage my own suicidal thoughts and anxiety. i also have a chronic illness that has me in pain 24/7 on top of it all. * how do i help my stepdad? i don't even know what needs doing or how to help myself. and because we are hiding this, i cant just call him all the time and talk it out - me and my stepdad never called each other before all this so my mom would be suspicious.* i need sleep. i take 600mg of gabapentin a day, lots of cbd oil in the am and in the pm, magnesium, chamomile tea, meditate, go to church, read books before bed, nothing helps and i'm going insane over it. or perhaps this is my own dementia starting?i know this is a lot, but if there is anyone out there that can give me some advice on what to do next, or how to cope, encouragement, anything i would appreciate it greatly. i feel lost and hopeless, without a future, sad for my kid, a useless coward and utterly defeated.

Family in Denial
hello all! i need some advice, words of wisdom, etc. regarding my family's current situation. my grandmother has dementia. she currently lives alone in a condo (set up like an apartment complex) and has aides that come in 4x weekly for 4 hours. she can't drive, can't prepare meals, doesn't understand basic hygiene, etc. she has periods of paranoia (which actually started years ago and is unrelated to the dementia), and she has significant memory loss both long and short term. sometines she remembers people, but only the people she sees regularly and only if she's expecting them.before her dementia got this bad, she was adamant that she would *never* go into an assisted living and that she would rather die sooner and live at home. my mom and uncle essentially assured her they would try to make that happen. well, fast forward one year and here we are. she clearly can't care for herself. she has aides 4x a week, but i feel she needs 24 hr. care. my mom and uncle disagree. they want to try to keep her at home. their reasons are "that's what she wanted", "she'll be unhappy" and "it'll be a big adjustment for everyone". i feel that these are excuses, and that she is unsafe (adult services has been called multiple times by different people but they don't want to get involved). additionally, my grandmother straight up refused to take any medication and denied her diagnosis for 3 years, screaming and threatening anyone who tried to talk to her about it. so honestly, i feel like she can't always get what she wants, at the cost of us worrying about her every day. also, she can afford an assisted living- and a nice one at that. as of today, she could afford the best in the area, but not if we increase the private care. that cost will essentially eat up her savings, especially if she lives for any amount of time. so, my question is- how to i confront my mom and uncle? how do i convince them or at least try to show them 1.) how unsafe and possibly unethical is it to let her live by herself and 2.) how stressful it is on all of us to worry about her everyday.other possibly important details1.) most of the family lives out of state, except for myself and my mom.2.) my grandmother cannot move in with either of us. my mom and i work full time and have our own health issues. also my home life (husband + 2 dogs) wouldn't  be healthy with her living here. 3.) my mom, uncle, and i are all equal poas. i know, strange. my grandmother has always been strange in her decisions, and decided 10 years ago to have all of us be equal.tl;dr- grandmother has dementia that is worsening. her 2 children are in denial about her needing assisted living.

Looking for advice. Husband may be suffering.
hello.my husband is relatively young (62), but has been showing signs of either dementia or early-onset alzheimer's and i'd appreciate any feedback you'd care to offer.this is not simple forgetfulness, although that is definitely a thing. his behavior is becoming more and more bizarre. when we first met (13 years ago), he was very jovial, outgoing, engaged and humorous. in recent years, he's gone quite dark. always disconnected from life, obsessing over youtube vids and ignoring his online business. he goes into fits of minor rage if he drinks. he is dismissive of me and our relationship. he is - quite literally - eating himself to death, having gained a good 80 pounds in recent years. he is forgetful, yes. but, he is constantly confused, drives erratically, loses things constantly, and is losing basic communication skills at an alarming rate. if i say, "wow, it got cold this morning.", he won't acknowledge the statement but will reply with, "wow. it got cold this morning."there were friends here the other night and they were talking about a mutual acquaintance. my husband went into long, elaborate stories (all false) about the person they were talking about. i was gobsmacked. nothing he was saying was anywhere close to reality. i have no idea where any of that came from.i have to repeat things three to four times for him to understand. he has forgone cleanliness entirely. he is losing language skills rapidly. we live in central america and he knew spanish when we came here 6 years ago. now, he can't speak a word of it. he is disinterested that it seems as though he just can't keep up. and, our life is pretty mellow.i know he's unhappy and i don't get that. we are in the best place of our lives. he is completely disconnected from it all. but, is this a senility thing or a depression thing? there is no way on earth he would ever submit to cognitive testing, so i need to understand what i can do to help him - or talk him into seeing a qualified professional. i think the latter is very unlikely.i'm worried that the next time he takes the car into town will be the last time. i love this man, but he has turned into someone i simply don't recognize. i don't want sympathy. i just want to help him, if i can.what can you recommend i do?

Admitting parent to secure dementia facility this Xmas
approximately 2 years ago my mother was diagnosed with dementia by her geriatrition. of course the signs were there long before this, the repetition of stories, forgetting of names and tasks. initially these mental blanks were easily dismissed as "chemo brain" as mum had battled and beaten breast cancer, but deep down we all knew. mum had witnessed it first hand with her grandmother then with her mother, her father and in more recent years all her 3 siblings (but its not hereditary or genetic).prior to mums diagnosis there was the obligatory mild cognitive disorder (mcd) label, which like bad body odour causes people to steer clear. many of mums so called "friends" became more absent on those celebratory occassions to which they were invited and more forgetful in terms of inviting my mother to gatherings to which they were hosting. at first i was angry at them for excluding my mother, fortunately mum wasn't angry, mum wasn't aware. i set aside my anger at these fairweather friends, when our paths crossed  i looked into their eyes and saw fear and envy, fear of themselves falling into the clutches of dementia and the envy of wondering if their children would be there to support them through this journey. over time most of mum's acquaintances no longer maintained eye contact when we crossed paths, they quickly look away, anywhere else but to their destiny as if mum was their mirrored reflection. my father was supportive until he was hospitalized due to an unrelated condition and developed the uti dementia or delerium. over time dad recovered and returned home and the delirium subsided although he would be diagnosed firstly mcd then six months later dementia.when my mother received her dementia diagnosis we held a family meeting where my brother and i promised we would keep mum at home as long as we could, provided she was safe, mum took some comfort in that committment and life continued. there were subtle changes like accompanied visits to medical appointments, shopping in pairs instead of alone and assistance with stairs and uneven ground. we began to notice my mother withdraw from conversations and struggle with fine motor skills tasks. her frustrations grew as her hands and body wouldnt do what her brain wanted.my father struggled with the evolving nature of their 50+ year relationship, moving from husband to carer and the ultimately to the target of her frustrations and anger. my mother struggled with intimacy after revealing a childhood assault she had kept to herself over the years. my father also struggled knowing that his fate would be not to dissimilar from that of my mother. the fact he held a front row ticket seat simply amplified the cruelty.six months ago mum was assessed level 4 requiring a secure position in a residential dementia program, we stepped up the supervision and mum literally did nothing alone. we began key locking the security doors when mum began waking early (2am) and dressing for shopping trips. the decision was made 4 weeks ago when dad inadvertently looked away and mum prepared and attempted to eat boiling noodles resulting in quite bad burns to her chest.it was now time and in the intervening time we have toured and researched several facilities involving mum and dad in the process. final acceptance for a position was received thursday for an admission this friday 27th december. after several years of holding christmases with my parents  due to the inevitable, the inevitable has arrived.all being ok with my parents physical health this wont be the last christmas we share, but given recent events in respect to memories i suspect they will never be the same as the christmases we have shared.i take some comfort in the fact that my mother is becoming more oblivious to some of  the changes in her life, but i worry for my father whom we expect to struggle much more than my mother with his dementia, although dads most recent geriatrition appointment ended with dad proclaiming he was cured of dementia as the dr had proclaimed "there was nothing else he could do for my father. "as we enter this christmas my immediate family is struggling to come to terms with events, i have attempted to always be honest and upfront with my teenage children about the nature and progression of this disease. i remind them that the behaviours of my parents are symptomatic of the disease not the person. an acquaintance advised me of the perils of this particular journey to which i was initially indifferent. this disease has tested my resolve and the strength of the relationship with my loved ones, a test i believe i have passed and with my brother have honoured our committment to our mother. i will sleep better knowing she is safe and her needs are being met, but i know that in a short time she will lose her memory of herself and those she loves and that will be shattering for my father and my siblings.as i look back over the last 2 and half years and the effort involved i take a deep breath as i realise that its now going to be dad's turn and i suspect this ride is going to be a lot rougher..

Getting over animosity to care for someone?
my mil's deterioration coincided with the birth of my child. there were many stressors that occurred (death of her mom, sickness of her husband, flood that destroyed our community, etc). her husband died recently and either she has gone downhill fast or she was worse than we thought. my husband wants us to move in with her. she is willing to give us the master bedroom because she doesn't want to be in it anymore and it is fairly large with its own bathroom and a large closet we could turn into a kids room. the problem is i have a lot of mental issues surrounding her. i want to get over them because  i know how important she is to my husband and i do want to make sure she is okay and has the most comfortable end of life possible. the problem is i can't help how i -feel- and i have almost 3 years of built up animosity towards her and i fear moving in with her would be horrible for my own mental health. i had a very rough newborn stage. my baby cried nonstop, couldn't sleep on his back, had to be held all the time. i was lucky if i got to sleep 2 consecutive hours in the first year. i developed ppd and ocd like tendencies (imagining my baby dying in very vivid ways, having to make sure he was breathing every 5 minutes, etc) when i went to my husband for help he told me how great his mom was in caring for his disabled brother and i just needed to suck it up. when i went to her for help she told me she didn't know what i was talking about and her babies never did that and it was an awesome time. etc etc. i was completely ignored. no one helped me with anything and any requests i made (call before coming over) were completely ignored. i was really totally completely insane and no one seemed to even care or acknowledge it even though i was basically screaming it in their faces.  she revolves around my son when he is around and nonstop does things i don't want her to do (give him caffeine, feed him a ton of junk, is heavy handed on religion etc) probably is she doesn't remember what she has given him or that i don't want her to give him those things. if you press her on it she becomes dismissive or hostile etc so we've concluded there is no point because it just gives her bad vibes about us. she also sometimes forgets to close her front door and he has escaped out it without anyone knowing for a few minutes. i don't know what to do. i feel bad because i honestly don't know if i can take it. i don't have a family (not close to my mom or dad) or ever had anything. the only thing i've ever had is my baby and i feel like she tries to take him away, sometimes she even calls him by my husband's name, and i can't do anything about it because she is sick. this will be my only child and the only time i am able to experience being a mother and i don't want to feel like i am living in the shadow the entire time, but unfortunately i don't feel like i have a choice.  i finally feel like i am at a place where my mental health has been getting better but that this could send me to a precarious place. it isn't fair to my husband though as he is having a really hard time with the death of his dad and his mom's health. i have requested that he go live with her alone but he acts offended at that request.

(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?
i mention the uk because partly i'm wondering about resources the family (my sister, dad and i) could access or use.  tl:dr my nan had vascular dementia (early onset) and passed away in her 60s. my mum's (50s) exhibiting some worrying symptoms that may be due to post menopause/hrt but kinda seem like maybe they're not and i'm shitting myself. and looking for any options to deal with it.  long story:  my mum's mother passed away several years ago from (i believe) vascular dementia - we were told this is a hereditary type and more common in women?   a huge part of her problem was her total social isolation - my mum and her brother never got on with their mum (their dad died when they were teens) and left home asap. my grandmother stopped working when she had kids and never went back, lived in council housing that required very little interaction with people and claimed a pension (i assume i was younger and didn't get super involved at the time) church groups and other old lady clubs were constantly dropping by and checking in and asking if she wanted tea or her grass cut etc. she'd stubbornly tell them to piss off and she wasn't a charity case, eventually they stopped bothering.   from what i recall of visiting as a child she wasn't great - like nothing awful but 'children should be seen and not heard' quite old fashioned (you can't have children if you're not married!) and racist - the point is she wasn't the friendliest, made no effort to get out and stimulate herself and actively pushed people away who would have otherwise helped - even family.   part of this is why some of the signs took so long to be noticed - she was angry and snappy at the best of times and we only saw her a handful of times  a year.   anyway, i don't want to dwell on that to much, it's simply for context.  my mum recently (few years back) went through menopause (confirmed over by her gp) and during that period and ever since has just been...not right.   she can't organise herself (she used to run and manage a busy day care plus the household)&amp;#x200b;she forgets things unless they're listed or on a calendar, she needs reminding multiple times where she's supposed to be or what she's supposed to be doing. she get angry at people for reminding her, and angry at herself for having to be reminded.   she does things that make no sense (like my parents have two fridges and veggies always go in one of them, she'll put them in the wrong one - i know it seems minor but it's something she'd never have done before)  it reached a peak over the summer when she had some unexplained bleeding and went to the hospital for a few tests (nothing untoward just lady parts being lady parts and it all cleared up) she was a wreck. she had to be hand held to every appointment, my dad had to take notes for her, she got lost in the clearly signed hospital and (armchair psychologist here) i'd say she had a full blown anxiety attack and anxiety for several weeks, she compulsively made lists, lost track of them, made them again and then fished the shredded pieces out of the bin when we threw them out, whilst getting angry with us. she called me in tears because she got lost at the hospital and she kept calling herself stupid and 'better than this' i spent almost an hour calming her down and then having to speak to my dad to get up to date with her medical stuff so i could talk to insurance for her. the only minor upside is we had a small bonding moment over how awful anxiety is!  we put a lot of this down to menopause and hormones - i know first hand from my own experience with bc how fucking mental the wrong balance can make you! as part of the fix for above she had an iud - half of hrt therapy.  the 'final straw' came about a month and a half ago when she passed out in the kitchen, fell and knocked her tooth out - she was obviously shaken up and what bit of confidence she had is slowly leaving her (she wouldn't even ring the gp to make an appointment because she said she couldn't keep it straight in her head what she needed) and  since then we've spent the last few weeks back and forth to the gp convincing her to try the other half - oestrogen gel.  i went to one of the appointments with her and ....it was like taking my toddler, she just sat there quietly letting me explain these really intimate things to this gp, i felt awful and patronising, like i was stepping all over her. she just said thanks and could i text dad the details cause she'd already got a bit confused.  about 4 weeks ago she finally started and we've been holding our breath hoping that this is the answer, the gp did say it should start working almost right away even if it takes a few weeks to go full swing. she has a follow up in a couple weeks.  last week we went away as a family together and the length of time we spent together made it really apparent there is still something wrong.   she seemed almost 'off' half the time, she didn't read anything, she didn't talk much. she joined in with the things we did (like snooker) but got angry at what (in years gone by) would have been good natured ribbing (we're all terrible at snooker xd) she said 'the rules kept changing' .  she tried to make tea by putting tea bags directly into the kettle, and then claimed she didn't do it and got angry - honestly it felt like she really truly did not have any recollection of doing that action.   &amp;#x200b;she's not quite as bad as her mum in that she kept working up until redundancy about 15 to 20 years ago maybe. my dad earned enough to not worry about it and my mums always been a home maker, so she liked being home and my dad liked not having to do house stuff. since i had my son shes loved being able to care for him as well and it's one of the few things i see her really light up about.   she's never really been a hugely passionate person, she loved cross stitches and puzzles but her eye sight makes that hard, social wise she had my dad - both of them are just each others best friend and rarely socialise outside of the odd couple friend they have, so she doesn't have a lot of hobbies and she stopped driving years ago and is now too nervous about it to take it up again (and more recently she's got really anxious about the bus) she's almost voluntarily housebound weekdays. she cares for my son a couple days a week (and she is fantastic at that, although i am starting to worry slightly but it's like with him she switches back into old habits and has it together) and we're always over at the weekend (i love my mum to bits and the running joke is i never left home xd) so she's no where near as bad as my nan was - but it's still heavily reduced and very little mentally stimulating activities or things that really keep you on your toes yanno?  it's to late for her to go back to work (her career credentials have expired and regaining would be like starting from scratch as it's changed so much in childcare) she has very basic it skills (as much as i love her i wouldn't wish her on the office of my worst enemy!) and frankly she's just to nervous about everything to be of any use doing much. i'm worried the window for keeping her mind active and working has passed....and whilst i'm glad my son can help, the second i think he's in any chance of danger i'll send him to nursery full time (and my mum totally agrees, her biggest fear is accidentally hurting him)  i firmly think, regardless, she needs counselling for anxiety but getting my mother to understand my problems with anxiety and depression has been a long up hill struggle that only really achieved her acceptance that /i/ think i have a problem. i suggested she may need to talk to a professional and she just sort of brushes over it. my dad is only marginally better. she absolutely does not want to admit this is a problem, she may have a problem or that that problem may not be solvable with a course of tablets or similar.   and all of this is made harder by the fact all of us have full time jobs and i have a child to run around after as well. we will absolutely figure something out to run her where she needs to be if we have to, but regardless of intention and desire the fact remains we're all adults with families that also need care and time - luckily we all live about 3 miles apart!  i'm also aware we lose our patience with her and that makes it worse. my parents have always been sort of low key bickery but recently it's like every weekend is them snapping at each other and with the best will in the world, even knowing she might not be able to help, some of the stuff she does is maddening - i guess sometimes it's akin to asking my kid to get something and him getting distracted by a penny half way through - like i get it! but also dude come on! i asked you to go get your shoes!i try and help by cooking but then she loiters in the kitchen looking lost and helpless and i feel bad because now i feel like i'm taking away the things that made her feel useful &gt;&lt;  i'm so sorry for the huge ramble, i am so so scared this is early onset like my nan and there's nothing we can do except watch it get worse. i don't know where to ask for help, i don't know how to get her to come get help, i can't even talk to my dad and sister properly because we're all skirting round the issue hoping the gel will work and she'll start getting back to 'normal'. and i'm looking at my dad who's so far the opposite you'd probably peg him as early 40s and just wondering what the fuck he's going to with my mum over the next decade and then the rest of his life if this does go 'worst case scenario' .  i'm hoping to find some information about how i could approach an appointment to discuss this - should i make one for me alone (can i even discuss someone else in an appointment for me?) should i take her with me and ask to speak to the dr alone for a moment, should i just straight up mention it in front of her?  does anyone have any hrt experience that could tell me i'm just being an impatient twat and to let it work or adjust it?   is it better for my dad (as her husband) to try and seek help?   are there any uk counselling services for this, or is going through the gp the best?   are there any things we could passively encourage her towards that might help her mentally in terms of activities/hobbies/clubs etc without her feeling to 'old' or 'helpless'?

Can declines happen suddenly or is this something else?
my mother over the past few years has had symptoms of dementia that came on slowly and would get slightly worse slowly. it went from her saying a wrong name or forgetting maybe every 3rd visit to every second visit to every visit but that was over maybe 6 months. about 3 weeks ago my mom stopped wanting to eat. this was sudden. i usually stop at her favorite bakery and bring her a donut or fritter and she is happy and eats it right away. she refused to eat the bakery items. she also stopped watching tv. the tv used to be on 24/7 in her house.  again a few weeks before she was watching the animal and cooking shows she likes and then nothing. her confusion was so much worse. she says she tries to get out of bed and sit on the side of the bed and then she looks up and two hours went by and she does not know what happened. time seems to be a big confusion, suddenly she thinks it is night time and it is morning. she was sleeping constantly and complaining about dizzyness. her hygiene went downhill and she was not dressing properly for the weather or for modesty. she was having horrible time just walking around her house to go to the bathroom or get food. her walk was never fast before due to a bad knee replacement surgery but she could get around her home. i got her to agree to go to an urgent care and they sent her to the er. the er found fluid on her brain and the er doctor thought maybe something called normal pressure hydrocephelus? they admitted her and we live landlocked and there is only one neurologist and neurosurgeon for that hospital and for over 100 miles. the doctor said the fluid was not the issue, ran a few tests and wanted her to go to a rehab  facility to see if her self help skills, balance, walking etc could be improved. multiple people tried to talk her into this and she refused and we got the call she has checked herself out. i guess if she can answer like 5 question, her name, the president, her birthday where she is , they consider her "okay". my son was like why did they not ask her the time ! very true because i went to pick her up and she was upset because she thought it was night but it was 1pm and she was confused about the whole day's time frame. can she have really lose so much functioning in a few weeks. going from sitting and eating with you watching 90 day fiance (sometimes getting the couples names wrong or confused but still trying to interact)  to just not eating and starring at the wall? and having no interest in anything.  i have possible some serious surgery coming up, i am actually going to the surgeon in the morning to discuss it. myself and my husband and our kids (who cant drive) are the only caregivers. she has no friends and will not deal with any church help. she has good insurance and long term health care. should i try and get a second opinion about the fluid on the brain? travel is very hard , the closest second opinion is 120 miles away and it is a large city hospital that is overtaxed with patients and not the best choice but closest, the closest choices that would be research or university type hospitals are 300-400 miles. or is this just dementia getting worse rapidly?  the best way to describe it is like a horrible depression came on, she has no interest in anything, no desire to eat, and just sits there.thanks for any advice. i have a call into home health and i was able luckily on dec 7th able to make changes to her medicare so she will have more options for rehab/home health in 2020 before care before long term heath care can kick in. she had me sign paper long ago after my father passed about her medical care and end of life care. it was 25 years ago so i don't remember much. i do know she added my husband a few years ago. when i called medicare supplement plan they said they had me and my husband as authorized to make changes, and when i called for home health to come out and access her , they said i was listed to do that. i know before her last surgery she took out what she kept calling her pull the plug paperwork and went over her wishes and my husband and i were the 2 on that paper. i also had a checkbook to pay her bills with my name on it.  i put a call into her lawyer but it will be a few days. i do know the doctor said because she answered those 5 questions right, she had the choice to check herself out and i could not over ride it.

Is my grandmother showing signs of dementia if she's repeating herself?
knowing my grandmother, she is a bit rough of the edges. while she can be a caring person, her other side sometimes outshines the good side. (picture madea from tyler perry minus the guns)  some of the regular things that she usually does ever since i started for college was the following: - getting up at different times of the morning cleaning for no reason- raising a fuss over the littlest of things. - having mood swings where she is angry at one moment and she is content the next.- often be supicious about some stuff and tend to always accuse me of lying. she has however had her good days where she goes to work ok, shop and get groceries she needs, and is willing to travel 40+ miles if i am in need of something (as at the time, i was in college and 40 miles away) i am currently further away from getting my mfa and it has been almost a year since i visited her. my mom who is living with her usually has to deal with her attitude and whatnot, but i noticed something slightly differentsome of the noticeable changes were the following:-  i noticed she kept repeating questions like when i was going back and when i tell her when she corrects herself and even says that she thought it was one day when it was the next. - her normal tantrums were usual but were more frequently after she upgraded her flip phone to a smartphone. she was able to text easily but now we had to teach her to use the phone. nothing normal as i have seen most stories of grandparents adapting to technology. but whenever she ask for help she usually forgets how to do something and often get upset and "wanting to take it back because the phone was not acting right"(she needed a google account to access certain things and she was complaining about that)- she can still drive and apparently an outstanding teacher for pre-k and elementary schools. she forgot to get certain things and often make frequent trips out of the house. - whenever she is not driving she gets impatient and wants to drive back home, often rushing us. - it was a few occasions where she talked to herself. i don't think too much of it, as this is something that i usually do myself but it's more frequent for her. - she seems to thrive off of starting drama and hyping on it but lately, it's been more frequent. my mom, uncle and i were talking about this and we was wondering if she was developing the signs as my late great grandmother develop signs around her age (she is 65 and my great grandmother was in her first stages around 67). one thing for sure some of her actions mirrored her mother as my greatgrandmother loves to dump a bunch of sugar into things while my grandmother likes things sour and salty (while she did most of the cooking, my mom and i avoided her cooking because of the amount of salt it was in there. my mom is a diabetic so it would affect her while it made me gag eating something that taste like ocean water. i wanted to ask if these signs is what we should be worried about or should we keep observing and keeping a close eye. my family is normally the type to reach out to people but i wanted to see if there was a way to catch on to it before she winds up hurting herself driving, or at her job, etc. while i am away for grad school, i pretty much handle everything financially to help out while my mom and uncle is there with her.

Understanding the Types of Dementia
although "[dementia]( is often used interchangeably with terms such as alzheimer's disease or memory loss, it is actually an umbrella category of brain diseases that comprise more than 100 types of memory disorders.[dementia]( refers to a collection of symptoms that signal cognitive declines, such as short-term memory loss, language deficits, poor judgment, and changes in behavior.while [alzheimer's]( disease is the most common form of dementia, comprising 50 to 70 percent of all dementia diagnoses, some of the other forms of dementia we will focus on today include:* lewy body dementia (lbd)* frontotemporal dementia* vascular dementia* parkinson's disease dementia (pdd)it's important to understand the most prevalent types of dementia so you can begin to recognize the signs your loved one is exhibiting, arrange a medical assessment, and prepare for a potential move to a memory care community.## what is alzheimer's disease?neuropathologist aloysius alzheimer first identified the disease that bears his name in 1901. the most common form of dementia, alzheimer's disease (ad) currently affects 5.8 million americans, and this number is projected to reach 14 million by 2050.while many people assume [memory loss]( is a normal part of aging, alzheimer's disease is not inevitable. as we age, it may become more difficult to recall someone's name, and you may tend to misplace your reading glasses or leave your shopping list at home. but these forgetful moments are usually attributed to age-related memory loss and not necessarily signs of impending alzheimer's disease.part of the confusion around alzheimer's disease arises from the challenge in diagnosis. like lewy body dementia and frontotemporal dementia, alzheimer's disease can't be determined with complete accuracy while someone is alive.the biomarkers for ad — sticky plaques and tangles that accumulate in the brain from abnormally folded proteins, causing inflammation and cellular damage — can only be positively identified on autopsy. thus, doctors generally make an alzheimer's diagnosis by testing for and eliminating other possibilities.## what are the signs and symptoms of alzheimer's disease?ten signs and symptoms that a senior's memory loss might be alzheimer's include:1. disruptive memory loss. the inability to retain new information, forgetting important events, or needing to put reminder notes everywhere indicate a problem.2. problem-solving difficulties. mom can no longer follow a recipe she knows by heart, or dad can't balance the checkbook.3. getting lost driving to a familiar location.4. temporal or seasonal confusion: is it spring already?5. challenges with visual or spatial relationships: how far away is that sign?6. vocabulary issues: having trouble finding common words, such as calling a toaster, "the thing that makes bread dark."7. odd misplacement. it's one thing to leave your keys in a different room; quite another to place them in the freezer or dishwasher.8. loss of judgment. giving money to phone scammers, neglecting to bathe.9. social withdrawal.10. personality changes: confusion, anxiety, suspicion, fear. someone in the early stages of ad may become easily upset when out of their comfort zone.## what is the treatment for someone with alzheimer's disease?as with all types of dementia, and other health conditions in general, good nutrition, exercise, social engagement, mental stimulation and lifestyle choices that nurture the body, mind, and spirit may delay, slow the progression, or even prevent the onset of alzheimer's disease.let's examine them in turn:* healthy eating. here at the kensington place, fine dining is the cornerstone of our first-rate memory care. our culinary craftsman, tony ng, is devoted to delivering a mealtime experience that each senior will savor, not only for the delicious and nutritious cuisine but also for the presentation and variety. while heavily processed foods laden with sugar, salt and preservatives can actually [induce or increase memory loss]( the healthy meals tony prepares contain [memory-boosting foods]( such as leafy greens, cold-pressed olive oil, and mouth-watering salmon.* exercise. our life enrichment programs are renowned for offering an ever-changing calendar of events to residents seven days a week, from morning till evening. whether it's walking, dancing, yoga, or stretching, we encourage our residents to keep their bodies moving, which also [boosts brain health](* social engagement. building friendships and staying active has been shown to reduce stress, preserve wellness, keep the mind sharp, and increase feelings of worth, especially for seniors. and the bay area is [one of the best locations]( in the country for staying active, with parks, museums, classes, art galleries…there's something to interest everyone!* mental stimulation. while our life enrichment coordinators work full time with our core team to keep our senior residents active and engaged, there is a lot of options seniors can choose to do on their own to challenge their brains. solving puzzles and math problems, reading, and learning a new skill such as surfing the web, help light up the brain, decrease the buildup of plaque, and [keep alzheimer's at bay](## what is lewy body dementia (lbd)?up until a few years ago, lewy body dementia (lbd) was not a familiar term to the general public. even mds weren't necessarily familiar with it unless they specialized in geriatrics or neurology.however, lewy body dementia gained widespread attention in 2014, after beloved comedian and actor [robin williams]( chose to take his own life rather than slowly succumb to the disease.lewy body dementia is the second most common dementia after alzheimer's, accounting for up to a third of all cases, according to autopsy reports. there is not yet a cure, and symptoms tend to worsen over time.lbd comprises a spectrum of diseases involving an array of dementia and motor symptoms. identifying lewy body dementia can be challenging, because its pathology is similar to that of alzheimer's, while many symptoms appear to mimic parkinson's.however, there are notable distinguishing characteristics. unlike people with alzheimer's or parkinson's disease dementia, patients with lbd exhibit:* strong psychotic symptoms (hallucinations)* extreme sensitivity to antipsychotic medications* day-to-day symptom variabilityin addition, lewy body dementia is twice as common in men as in women (alzheimer's occurs equally in both genders) and is rarely genetically linked.## what are lewy bodies?lewy bodies are abnormal structures in the midbrain: microscopic protein deposits found in nerve cells that disrupt the brain's normal functioning, causing it to slowly deteriorate. frederick lewy, a colleague of aloysius alzheimer (for whom alzheimer's disease is named) first discovered them in 1912.while the presence of lewy bodies in the mid-brain has long been recognized as the hallmark of parkinson's disease, in the 1960s lewy bodies were discovered in the cortex (the brain's outer layer) of people with dementia.people with lewy body disease have lewy bodies in both the midbrain and cortex. lewy body disease patients often have the plaque characteristic of alzheimer's disease, while people with alzheimer's may also have cortical lewy bodies. this overlap leads to frequent misdiagnosis.## what are the signs and symptoms of lewy body dementia?many of the symptoms of lewy body dementia bear a striking resemblance to alzheimer's or parkinson's disease dementia. however, a physician familiar with lbd will be alert to the following signs that the illness is in fact lbd:* mental decline: reduced alertness and lowered attention span* visual hallucinations, usually related to people or animals. these hallucinations occur in 80 percent of lbd patients, often at night.* poor response to antipsychotic medications known as neuroleptics, which are usually given to people with mental health problems. in the case of an lbd patient, however, this class of drugs may actually amplify rigidity and confusion, and can even cause sudden death.* increasing problems handling the tasks of daily living* repeated falls* sleep disturbances, including insomnia and acting out dreams* delusions or depression* fluctuations in autonomic processes, including blood pressure, body temperature, urinary difficulties, constipation, and difficulty swallowing.if a patient exhibits some of the above symptoms, the additional presence of parkinson's motor symptoms can help facilitate a lewy body dementia diagnosis. these include:* tremors* muscle stiffness* difficulties with balance* shuffling gait, stooped posture, slow movements* restless leg syndrome.some of the cognitive symptoms found in both alzheimer's and lewy body dementia patients include:* behavioral changes* decreased judgment* confusion and temporal/spatial disorientation* difficulty following directions* decreased ability to communicate.since the lewy bodies themselves can only be identified by autopsy, accurate diagnosis relies heavily on physician awareness of the defining characteristics of the disease. a brain scan can detect mental deterioration, but not the actual lewy bodies.a thorough medical history that focuses on the pattern of symptoms and looks particularly for the hallucinations and sleep disturbances that are common to lbd patients is the optimal route for diagnosis, once other possible conditions have been ruled out.## what is the treatment for someone with lewy body dementia?being diagnosed with an incurable illness, especially one that involves dementia, can be an overwhelming experience. because lbd is a multi-system disease, with [treatment]( focusing primarily on symptom management, it's helpful to take as proactive an approach as possible from the outset. this means working with your physician to:* become informed. learn as much as you can about lewy body dementia and how it may affect your loved one, given the senior's health history, age, and lifestyle.* strengthen the senses. have your loved one's doctor evaluate each of his or her five senses — sound, sight, touch, taste, and smell — in order to identify and treat any abnormalities. then ask about exercises to improve them. by challenging themselves to enhance their senses, seniors will boost both mental and physical capabilities.* manage symptoms with behavioral changes. one example of symptom management in lbd involves low blood pressure (hypotension), a common lewy body dementia symptom that can lead to falls. to help stabilize blood pressure and minimize the risk of fall-related injuries, someone with lbd needs to:   * stay hydrated   * exercise   * avoid prolonged bed rest   * stand up slowly.* choose medications prudently. the potential benefits of any medication need to be carefully balanced with possible side effects that may occur. in people with lbd, the treatments for hallucinations, delusions, and behavioral disturbance tend to make the parkinson's symptoms worse; treating the parkinson's symptoms can make the delusions and behavior problems worse. however, depression and sleep disorders can and should be treated with medications that the patient can safely tolerate.## what research is being done on lewy body dementia?the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds), a division of the national institutes of health, conducts and supports research on a wide array of dementia-related diseases, including lewy body dementia. the goal is to [learn more]( about diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of lbd. researchers are also exploring the lewy bodies themselves, in an effort to understand the mechanisms of disease formation and progression.one [study that made recent headlines]( used a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to diagnose lbd in living persons, with a high degree of accuracy. up until now, the only way to prove someone's symptoms were lewy body dementia was via a brain autopsy.## what is frontotemporal dementia?first described by arnold pick in 1892 and originally called pick's disease, [frontotemporal dementia]( (ftd) encompasses six types of dementia involving the frontal (behind your forehead) or temporal lobes (behind your ears).ftd causes the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, which control speech and behavior, to slowly atrophy, leading to an irreversible decline in mental functioning over a period of years.according to the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke, the following conditions are currently grouped together as frontotemporal dementias:* pick's disease,* primary progressive aphasia,* semantic dementia.while up to seven million americans may be afflicted with ftd, pick's disease accounts for just five percent of all progressive dementias. it is frequently misdiagnosed in the early stages as depression, mental illness or alzheimer's disease, because of the manner in which symptoms initially appear.## what causes frontotemporal dementia?as in lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia is the result of a build-up of protein in the affected areas of the brain. the accumulation of abnormal brain cells eventually leads to changes in character, socially inappropriate behavior, and poor decision making, progressing to severe impairment in intellect, memory, and speech.frontotemporal dementia typically strikes adults between the ages of 40 and 60 and is slightly more common in women than in men. while the cause is still unknown, there is a strong genetic component: about a third of ftds are hereditary.## what are the signs and symptoms of frontotemporal dementia?because the frontal lobes affect behavior and emotional response, people with ftd will usually show signs of changes in personality before they manifest evidence of dementia. this may begin as impulsiveness or a lack of inhibition. while the progression of symptoms in ftd is fortunately slow, symptoms do worsen over time.the following symptoms are typical of patients with frontotemporal dementia. more severe symptoms will appear in later stages of the illness:## behavioral changes* impulsivity* obsessive/compulsiveness (e.g., overeating or only eating one type of food)* drinking alcohol to excess (when not previously a problem)* rudeness or impatience, leading to aggression* poor judgment* withdrawal or seclusion* inability to function or interact in social situations* inability to hold a job* lack of attention to personal hygiene* sexual exhibitionism or promiscuity## emotional changes* abrupt mood changes* lack of warmth, concern, or empathy* indifference to events or to one's environment* easily distracted; difficulty maintaining a line of thought* unaware of the changes in behavior* decreased interest in personal care## language changes* reduced quality of speech: shrinking vocabulary, difficulty finding a word* difficulty speaking or understanding speech (aphasia)* repeating words others say (echolalia)* weak, uncoordinated speech sounds* decreased ability to read or write* complete loss of speech (mute)## neurological/physical problems* increased muscle rigidity or stiffness* difficulty moving about* lack of coordination* general weakness* memory loss* urinary incontinence## how is frontotemporal dementia diagnosed?as with lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementias can only be conclusively determined by a post-mortem examination of the brain. careful symptomatic evaluation, together with brain scans and eegs, are the best methods currently available for reaching a probable diagnosis. these techniques can help ascertain whether the presenting condition is likely to be ftd or a related disorder, such as alzheimer's disease.if at least three of the following five distinguishing characteristics are present in the early stages, the diagnosis is likely to be ftd rather than alzheimer's:* onset before age 65* initial personality changes* loss of normal controls, e.g., gluttony, hypersexuality* lack of inhibition* roaming behavior.also, as compared with alzheimer's disease, obvious mental impairment and memory loss occur later in frontotemporal dementia patients than in alzheimer's patients.## what is the treatment for frontotemporal dementia?while there is no specific treatment for ftd, a [supportive environment]( can yield surprising bright spots. for example, at the university of california/san francisco medical center's memory and aging center, doctors discovered a small group of frontotemporal dementia patients who [developed new creative skills]( in music and art. the artistic talents emerged when the brain cell loss occurred predominantly in the left frontal lobe, which controls functions such as language.as the ability to communicate through words declined, these patients' brains somehow accessed other realms of self-expression. so exploring and encouraging the development of latent skills is one way in which ftd patients can maintain their quality of life, and possibly slow the progress of mental deterioration.in addition, consider the following steps to help manage the symptoms of ftd:* sensory function aids, such as eyeglasses, hearing aids, etc.* behavior modification that rewards positive behaviors* speech therapy and/or occupational therapy* medication to control behaviors that can be dangerous to oneself or others. antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) may offer some relief from apathy and depression, and help reduce food cravings, loss of impulse control and compulsive activity.## what research is being done on frontotemporal dementias?the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds), and other branches of the national institutes of health conduct regular research related to frontotemporal dementia. they also support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. their goal is to learn more about the causes, diagnosis, treatment, and possible prevention of pick's disease and other ftds.the ninds is currently recruiting patients for a number of [clinical trials]( that will explore various treatments for the frontotemporal dementias, including pick's disease and primary progressive aphasia, as well as related dementias.## what is vascular dementia?conditions that commonly occur as we age, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes, block the arteries and impede blood flow to the brain, creating what is known as [vascular dementia](if vital oxygen and nutrients can't reach the brain easily, parts of the brain die. this is called an infarct and is similar to what happens in a heart attack, or myocardial infarction. when brain tissue dies, the person begins to exhibit signs of cognitive impairment.while nearly as common as alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia remains under-diagnosed, in part because the symptoms mimic many other conditions.## what are the signs and symptoms of vascular dementia?the signs and symptoms of vascular dementia can look remarkably similar to those of other dementias.## physical symptoms include:* tremors (common in parkinson’s disease dementia and lbd)* leg or arm weakness* balance problems (common in ftd)* shuffling steps (common in most dementias)* loss of bladder or bowel control (common in many dementias in the later stages)## mental symptoms include:* sluggish thinking and forgetfulness (common to all dementias)* hallucinations and delusions (common in lbd)* depression and irritability (common in alzheimer's)* personality changes (common in parkinson's disease dementia and ftd)* confusion (common to all dementias)## behavioral symptoms include:* language problems and slurred speech (common in ftd)* inappropriate emotional response (common in most dementias)* difficulty planning or following instructions (common in alzheimer's and most dementias)* becoming lost in familiar surroundings (common to most dementias).## what is the treatment for someone with vascular dementia?although there is currently no cure for vascular dementia, by addressing the factors that lead to mini-strokes, such as high blood pressure or diabetes, a senior may be able to arrest or even reverse some symptoms, preventing memory loss and the need for memory care.treatment modalities such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy can help someone with vascular dementia to regain some or all lost functions following a stroke. in addition, some of the medications used to treat the cognitive symptoms of alzheimer's disease appear to work for vascular dementia as well, since many of the symptoms overlap.what is most important is minimizing the risk of having additional strokes, which will worsen vascular dementia symptoms.as with alzheimer's treatment suggestions, the best course of action is positive lifestyle changes. someone exhibiting signs of vascular dementia would be well advised to:* quit smoking* maintain their optimal weight* eat healthfully* reduce salt intake to manage blood pressure* reduce alcohol consumption* engage in moderate exercise* stay socially active* stimulate their brain with puzzles, games, reading, and other mental activities that help keep the mind sharp.## what is parkinson's disease dementia?parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that is chronic and progressive. the hallmarks include muscle tremors, stiff or rigid movement, gait and balance problems, and cognitive impairment. non-motor symptoms can include difficulty sleeping, constipation, anxiety, depression, and fatigue.approximately one million americans are living with parkinson's disease. one of the better-known advocates for parkinson's research is actor michael j. fox of "back to the future" fame. now in his late 50s, fox was diagnosed with parkinson's disease at just 29. while most people develop symptoms after age 50, fox is one of the 10-20 percent with [early onset parkinson's disease](though parkinson's disease dementia (pdd) affects only 20-30 percent of parkinson's patients in the early stages of the disease, cognitive decline tends to become apparent as the disease progresses and the brain changes that parkinson's causes gradually spread, affecting memory and judgment.## what causes parkinson's disease dementia (pdd)?abnormal microscopic protein deposits of alpha-synuclein, whose normal function is not yet known, lead to parkinson's disease dementia. these deposits are known as lewy bodies, after frederick h. lewy, the neurologist who discovered them while working with neuropathologist aloysius alzheimer in the early 1900s.although parkinson's disease dementia is [one of the lewy body dementias]( (lbd), it is not to be confused with dementia with lewy bodies, which can include alzheimer's or vascular dementia (see below). lewy bodies are found in both brain disorders (pdd and lbd), which indicates that they may be linked to the same underlying abnormalities in brain processing.additionally, many people diagnosed with either parkinson's disease dementia or lewy body dementia also have the plaques and tangles that are the biomarkers of alzheimer's disease.## what are the signs and symptoms of parkinson's disease dementia?although researchers and physicians typically focus on the movement disorders that define parkinson's disease, loved ones observe personality changes in those who are developing parkinson's disease dementia.as the american parkinson disease association (apda) notes, the concept of a "[parkinson personality]( is controversial, because the idea that disease could alter who we are makes us uncomfortable. however, states the apda, "there is no question that the brain is changing because of parkinson's disease. because a substantial part of our personality relies on our brain function, it is not a stretch of logic to ask if a changing brain produces a changing personality."## what is the treatment for parkinson's disease dementia?there are presently no treatments to arrest brain cell damage in parkinson's disease dementia; however, memory care focuses on reducing and relieving symptoms.the kensington place redwood city is uniquely positioned to care for residents with various types of dementia, including parkinson's disease dementia. our extensive team of health care professionals, as well as our alliances with community senior care programs and resources, make the kensington your premier partner in providing unsurpassed memory care for your loved one.because exercise remediates many age-related physical and mental health conditions, our community offers some parkinson's-specific programs. one example is energized fitness for parkinson's, in partnership with the [parkinson foundation]( and [genesis rehab](research shows that various forms of exercise, such as treadmill training, dance, stationary bicycle training, tai chi, and cognitive training combined with motor training involving stretching and strengthening exercises have been effective in promoting the [preservation or improvement of cognitive function]( in patients with parkinson's disease. treadmill training showed the most improvements.the kensington has also sponsored webinars on parkinson's disease dementia, such as [abc's of dbs (deep brain stimulation)]( in which board-certified neurosurgeon zachary levine, md, shares powerful, practical information about how this new technology can help seniors with memory loss due to pdd.## memory care as individual as your loved oneat the kensington place redwood city, we're committed to providing an optimal life experience for each of our memory care residents. memory care is our sole focus, which is why we have thoughtfully designed a memory care program geared for the entire family.we believe the degree of memory loss is an important consideration when planning care. we empathize with both residents and their loved ones, each confronting the challenges and changes involved with memory loss.kensington place offers a full spectrum of memory care support across two specialized "neighborhoods," depending on a resident's stage of memory loss and specific care needs. these cozy environments enable residents to remain comfortable and safe while participating as fully as possible in our [life enrichment]( activities and events.we're also fortunate to be located in a very senior-friendly community, which supports older residents with a range of services to complement life at the kensington place.if your loved one is experiencing memory loss, we invite you to visit with us and see how the kensington place stands apart from other memory care communities, both in understanding and in serving those with [dementia]( we honor the

shown to reduce stress, preserve wellness, keep the mind sharp, and increase feelings of worth, especially for seniors. and the bay area is [one of the best locations]( in the country for staying active, with parks, museums, classes, art galleries…there's something to interest everyone!* mental stimulation. while our life enrichment coordinators work full time with our core team to keep our senior residents active and engaged, there is a lot of options seniors can choose to do on their own to challenge their brains. solving puzzles and math problems, reading, and learning a new skill such as surfing the web, help light up the brain, decrease the buildup of plaque, and [keep alzheimer's at bay](## what is lewy body dementia (lbd)?up until a few years ago, lewy body dementia (lbd) was not a familiar term to the general public. even mds weren't necessarily familiar with it unless they specialized in geriatrics or neurology.however, lewy body dementia gained widespread attention in 2014, after beloved comedian and actor [robin williams]( chose to take his own life rather than slowly succumb to the disease.lewy body dementia is the second most common dementia after alzheimer's, accounting for up to a third of all cases, according to autopsy reports. there is not yet a cure, and symptoms tend to worsen over time.lbd comprises a spectrum of diseases involving an array of dementia and motor symptoms. identifying lewy body dementia can be challenging, because its pathology is similar to that of alzheimer's, while many symptoms appear to mimic parkinson's.however, there are notable distinguishing characteristics. unlike people with alzheimer's or parkinson's disease dementia, patients with lbd exhibit:* strong psychotic symptoms (hallucinations)* extreme sensitivity to antipsychotic medications* day-to-day symptom variabilityin addition, lewy body dementia is twice as common in men as in women (alzheimer's occurs equally in both genders) and is rarely genetically linked.## what are lewy bodies?lewy bodies are abnormal structures in the midbrain: microscopic protein deposits found in nerve cells that disrupt the brain's normal functioning, causing it to slowly deteriorate. frederick lewy, a colleague of aloysius alzheimer (for whom alzheimer's disease is named) first discovered them in 1912.while the presence of lewy bodies in the mid-brain has long been recognized as the hallmark of parkinson's disease, in the 1960s lewy bodies were discovered in the cortex (the brain's outer layer) of people with dementia.people with lewy body disease have lewy bodies in both the midbrain and cortex. lewy body disease patients often have the plaque characteristic of alzheimer's disease, while people with alzheimer's may also have cortical lewy bodies. this overlap leads to frequent misdiagnosis.## what are the signs and symptoms of lewy body dementia?many of the symptoms of lewy body dementia bear a striking resemblance to alzheimer's or parkinson's disease dementia. however, a physician familiar with lbd will be alert to the following signs that the illness is in fact lbd:* mental decline: reduced alertness and lowered attention span* visual hallucinations, usually related to people or animals. these hallucinations occur in 80 percent of lbd patients, often at night.* poor response to antipsychotic medications known as neuroleptics, which are usually given to people with mental health problems. in the case of an lbd patient, however, this class of drugs may actually amplify rigidity and confusion, and can even cause sudden death.* increasing problems handling the tasks of daily living* repeated falls* sleep disturbances, including insomnia and acting out dreams* delusions or depression* fluctuations in autonomic processes, including blood pressure, body temperature, urinary difficulties, constipation, and difficulty swallowing.if a patient exhibits some of the above symptoms, the additional presence of parkinson's motor symptoms can help facilitate a lewy body dementia diagnosis. these include:* tremors* muscle stiffness* difficulties with balance* shuffling gait, stooped posture, slow movements* restless leg syndrome.some of the cognitive symptoms found in both alzheimer's and lewy body dementia patients include:* behavioral changes* decreased judgment* confusion and temporal/spatial disorientation* difficulty following directions* decreased ability to communicate.since the lewy bodies themselves can only be identified by autopsy, accurate diagnosis relies heavily on physician awareness of the defining characteristics of the disease. a brain scan can detect mental deterioration, but not the actual lewy bodies.a thorough medical history that focuses on the pattern of symptoms and looks particularly for the hallucinations and sleep disturbances that are common to lbd patients is the optimal route for diagnosis, once other possible conditions have been ruled out.## what is the treatment for someone with lewy body dementia?being diagnosed with an incurable illness, especially one that involves dementia, can be an overwhelming experience. because lbd is a multi-system disease, with [treatment]( focusing primarily on symptom management, it's helpful to take as proactive an approach as possible from the outset. this means working with your physician to:* become informed. learn as much as you can about lewy body dementia and how it may affect your loved one, given the senior's health history, age, and lifestyle.* strengthen the senses. have your loved one's doctor evaluate each of his or her five senses — sound, sight, touch, taste, and smell — in order to identify and treat any abnormalities. then ask about exercises to improve them. by challenging themselves to enhance their senses, seniors will boost both mental and physical capabilities.* manage symptoms with behavioral changes. one example of symptom management in lbd involves low blood pressure (hypotension), a common lewy body dementia symptom that can lead to falls. to help stabilize blood pressure and minimize the risk of fall-related injuries, someone with lbd needs to:   * stay hydrated   * exercise   * avoid prolonged bed rest   * stand up slowly.* choose medications prudently. the potential benefits of any medication need to be carefully balanced with possible side effects that may occur. in people with lbd, the treatments for hallucinations, delusions, and behavioral disturbance tend to make the parkinson's symptoms worse; treating the parkinson's symptoms can make the delusions and behavior problems worse. however, depression and sleep disorders can and should be treated with medications that the patient can safely tolerate.## what research is being done on lewy body dementia?the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds), a division of the national institutes of health, conducts and supports research on a wide array of dementia-related diseases, including lewy body dementia. the goal is to [learn more]( about diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of lbd. researchers are also exploring the lewy bodies themselves, in an effort to understand the mechanisms of disease formation and progression.one [study that made recent headlines]( used a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to diagnose lbd in living persons, with a high degree of accuracy. up until now, the only way to prove someone's symptoms were lewy body dementia was via a brain autopsy.## what is frontotemporal dementia?first described by arnold pick in 1892 and originally called pick's disease, [frontotemporal dementia]( (ftd) encompasses six types of dementia involving the frontal (behind your forehead) or temporal lobes (behind your ears).ftd causes the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, which control speech and behavior, to slowly atrophy, leading to an irreversible decline in mental functioning over a period of years.according to the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke, the following conditions are currently grouped together as frontotemporal dementias:* pick's disease,* primary progressive aphasia,* semantic dementia.while up to seven million americans may be afflicted with ftd, pick's disease accounts for just five percent of all progressive dementias. it is frequently misdiagnosed in the early stages as depression, mental illness or alzheimer's disease, because of the manner in which symptoms initially appear.## what causes frontotemporal dementia?as in lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia is the result of a build-up of protein in the affected areas of the brain. the accumulation of abnormal brain cells eventually leads to changes in character, socially inappropriate behavior, and poor decision making, progressing to severe impairment in intellect, memory, and speech.frontotemporal dementia typically strikes adults between the ages of 40 and 60 and is slightly more common in women than in men. while the cause is still unknown, there is a strong genetic component: about a third of ftds are hereditary.## what are the signs and symptoms of frontotemporal dementia?because the frontal lobes affect behavior and emotional response, people with ftd will usually show signs of changes in personality before they manifest evidence of dementia. this may begin as impulsiveness or a lack of inhibition. while the progression of symptoms in ftd is fortunately slow, symptoms do worsen over time.the following symptoms are typical of patients with frontotemporal dementia. more severe symptoms will appear in later stages of the illness:## behavioral changes* impulsivity* obsessive/compulsiveness (e.g., overeating or only eating one type of food)* drinking alcohol to excess (when not previously a problem)* rudeness or impatience, leading to aggression* poor judgment* withdrawal or seclusion* inability to function or interact in social situations* inability to hold a job* lack of attention to personal hygiene* sexual exhibitionism or promiscuity## emotional changes* abrupt mood changes* lack of warmth, concern, or empathy* indifference to events or to one's environment* easily distracted; difficulty maintaining a line of thought* unaware of the changes in behavior* decreased interest in personal care## language changes* reduced quality of speech: shrinking vocabulary, difficulty finding a word* difficulty speaking or understanding speech (aphasia)* repeating words others say (echolalia)* weak, uncoordinated speech sounds* decreased ability to read or write* complete loss of speech (mute)## neurological/physical problems* increased muscle rigidity or stiffness* difficulty moving about* lack of coordination* general weakness* memory loss* urinary incontinence## how is frontotemporal dementia diagnosed?as with lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementias can only be conclusively determined by a post-mortem examination of the brain. careful symptomatic evaluation, together with brain scans and eegs, are the best methods currently available for reaching a probable diagnosis. these techniques can help ascertain whether the presenting condition is likely to be ftd or a related disorder, such as alzheimer's disease.if at least three of the following five distinguishing characteristics are present in the early stages, the diagnosis is likely to be ftd rather than alzheimer's:* onset before age 65* initial personality changes* loss of normal controls, e.g., gluttony, hypersexuality* lack of inhibition* roaming behavior.also, as compared with alzheimer's disease, obvious mental impairment and memory loss occur later in frontotemporal dementia patients than in alzheimer's patients.## what is the treatment for frontotemporal dementia?while there is no specific treatment for ftd, a [supportive environment]( can yield surprising bright spots. for example, at the university of california/san francisco medical center's memory and aging center, doctors discovered a small group of frontotemporal dementia patients who [developed new creative skills]( in music and art. the artistic talents emerged when the brain cell loss occurred predominantly in the left frontal lobe, which controls functions such as language.as the ability to communicate through words declined, these patients' brains somehow accessed other realms of self-expression. so exploring and encouraging the development of latent skills is one way in which ftd patients can maintain their quality of life, and possibly slow the progress of mental deterioration.in addition, consider the following steps to help manage the symptoms of ftd:* sensory function aids, such as eyeglasses, hearing aids, etc.* behavior modification that rewards positive behaviors* speech therapy and/or occupational therapy* medication to control behaviors that can be dangerous to oneself or others. antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) may offer some relief from apathy and depression, and help reduce food cravings, loss of impulse control and compulsive activity.## what research is being done on frontotemporal dementias?the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds), and other branches of the national institutes of health conduct regular research related to frontotemporal dementia. they also support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. their goal is to learn more about the causes, diagnosis, treatment, and possible prevention of pick's disease and other ftds.the ninds is currently recruiting patients for a number of [clinical trials]( that will explore various treatments for the frontotemporal dementias, including pick's disease and primary progressive aphasia, as well as related dementias.## what is vascular dementia?conditions that commonly occur as we age, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes, block the arteries and impede blood flow to the brain, creating what is known as [vascular dementia](if vital oxygen and nutrients can't reach the brain easily, parts of the brain die. this is called an infarct and is similar to what happens in a heart attack, or myocardial infarction. when brain tissue dies, the person begins to exhibit signs of cognitive impairment.while nearly as common as alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia remains under-diagnosed, in part because the symptoms mimic many other conditions.## what are the signs and symptoms of vascular dementia?the signs and symptoms of vascular dementia can look remarkably similar to those of other dementias.## physical symptoms include:* tremors (common in parkinson’s disease dementia and lbd)* leg or arm weakness* balance problems (common in ftd)* shuffling steps (common in most dementias)* loss of bladder or bowel control (common in many dementias in the later stages)## mental symptoms include:* sluggish thinking and forgetfulness (common to all dementias)* hallucinations and delusions (common in lbd)* depression and irritability (common in alzheimer's)* personality changes (common in parkinson's disease dementia and ftd)* confusion (common to all dementias)## behavioral symptoms include:* language problems and slurred speech (common in ftd)* inappropriate emotional response (common in most dementias)* difficulty planning or following instructions (common in alzheimer's and most dementias)* becoming lost in familiar surroundings (common to most dementias).## what is the treatment for someone with vascular dementia?although there is currently no cure for vascular dementia, by addressing the factors that lead to mini-strokes, such as high blood pressure or diabetes, a senior may be able to arrest or even reverse some symptoms, preventing memory loss and the need for memory care.treatment modalities such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy can help someone with vascular dementia to regain some or all lost functions following a stroke. in addition, some of the medications used to treat the cognitive symptoms of alzheimer's disease appear to work for vascular dementia as well, since many of the symptoms overlap.what is most important is minimizing the risk of having additional strokes, which will worsen vascular dementia symptoms.as with alzheimer's treatment suggestions, the best course of action is positive lifestyle changes. someone exhibiting signs of vascular dementia would be well advised to:* quit smoking* maintain their optimal weight* eat healthfully* reduce salt intake to manage blood pressure* reduce alcohol consumption* engage in moderate exercise* stay socially active* stimulate their brain with puzzles, games, reading, and other mental activities that help keep the mind sharp.## what is parkinson's disease dementia?parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that is chronic and progressive. the hallmarks include muscle tremors, stiff or rigid movement, gait and balance problems, and cognitive impairment. non-motor symptoms can include difficulty sleeping, constipation, anxiety, depression, and fatigue.approximately one million americans are living with parkinson's disease. one of the better-known advocates for parkinson's research is actor michael j. fox of "back to the future" fame. now in his late 50s, fox was diagnosed with parkinson's disease at just 29. while most people develop symptoms after age 50, fox is one of the 10-20 percent with [early onset parkinson's disease](though parkinson's disease dementia (pdd) affects only 20-30 percent of parkinson's patients in the early stages of the disease, cognitive decline tends to become apparent as the disease progresses and the brain changes that parkinson's causes gradually spread, affecting memory and judgment.## what causes parkinson's disease dementia (pdd)?abnormal microscopic protein deposits of alpha-synuclein, whose normal function is not yet known, lead to parkinson's disease dementia. these deposits are known as lewy bodies, after frederick h. lewy, the neurologist who discovered them while working with neuropathologist aloysius alzheimer in the early 1900s.although parkinson's disease dementia is [one of the lewy body dementias]( (lbd), it is not to be confused with dementia with lewy bodies, which can include alzheimer's or vascular dementia (see below). lewy bodies are found in both brain disorders (pdd and lbd), which indicates that they may be linked to the same underlying abnormalities in brain processing.additionally, many people diagnosed with either parkinson's disease dementia or lewy body dementia also have the plaques and tangles that are the biomarkers of alzheimer's disease.## what are the signs and symptoms of parkinson's disease dementia?although researchers and physicians typically focus on the movement disorders that define parkinson's disease, loved ones observe personality changes in those who are developing parkinson's disease dementia.as the american parkinson disease association (apda) notes, the concept of a "[parkinson personality]( is controversial, because the idea that disease could alter who we are makes us uncomfortable. however, states the apda, "there is no question that the brain is changing because of parkinson's disease. because a substantial part of our personality relies on our brain function, it is not a stretch of logic to ask if a changing brain produces a changing personality."## what is the treatment for parkinson's disease dementia?there are presently no treatments to arrest brain cell damage in parkinson's disease dementia; however, memory care focuses on reducing and relieving symptoms.the kensington place redwood city is uniquely positioned to care for residents with various types of dementia, including parkinson's disease dementia. our extensive team of health care professionals, as well as our alliances with community senior care programs and resources, make the kensington your premier partner in providing unsurpassed memory care for your loved one.because exercise remediates many age-related physical and mental health conditions, our community offers some parkinson's-specific programs. one example is energized fitness for parkinson's, in partnership with the [parkinson foundation]( and [genesis rehab](research shows that various forms of exercise, such as treadmill training, dance, stationary bicycle training, tai chi, and cognitive training combined with motor training involving stretching and strengthening exercises have been effective in promoting the [preservation or improvement of cognitive function]( in patients with parkinson's disease. treadmill training showed the most improvements.the kensington has also sponsored webinars on parkinson's disease dementia, such as [abc's of dbs (deep brain stimulation)]( in which board-certified neurosurgeon zachary levine, md, shares powerful, practical information about how this new technology can help seniors with memory loss due to pdd.## memory care as individual as your loved oneat the kensington place redwood city, we're committed to providing an optimal life experience for each of our memory care residents. memory care is our sole focus, which is why we have thoughtfully designed a memory care program geared for the entire family.we believe the degree of memory loss is an important consideration when planning care. we empathize with both residents and their loved ones, each confronting the challenges and changes involved with memory loss.kensington place offers a full spectrum of memory care support across two specialized "neighborhoods," depending on a resident's stage of memory loss and specific care needs. these cozy environments enable residents to remain comfortable and safe while participating as fully as possible in our [life enrichment]( activities and events.we're also fortunate to be located in a very senior-friendly community, which supports older residents with a range of services to complement life at the kensington place.if your loved one is experiencing memory loss, we invite you to visit with us and see how the kensington place stands apart from other memory care communities, both in understanding and in serving those with [dementia]( we honor the past, savor the present, and are dedicated to making the times ahead manageable, comfortable and ultimately, peaceful.we look forward to meeting you soon.## recommended additional reading:* [mixed

Four Common Types of Dementia
the term ‘dementia’ is an umbrella term used to describe the symptoms of cognitive impairment.  and within the dementia umbrella, there are many different variations - alzheimer’s included.  most of us average folk don’t realize that all dementia is not alzheimer’s.  in fact, i would venture to say that the regular layman isn’t quite sure what the difference between alzheimer’s and dementia is.  don’t fret - i’ll explain it here!learning the difference between the varying levels of memory loss can be crucial to know [the do's and don'ts of dealing with behavior challenges. ]( will also come into play with [understanding the levels of care]( that are available to fit your loved one's needs, so they can live more comfortably.in this blog we will discuss the top 4 most common types of dementia. the good news for you is that at the kensington, we are very experienced with these areas of [memory care]( and more. *we welcome everyone!*1. **alzheimer’s disease.**  this is the most common type of dementia. i like to describe alzheimer’s as a slow process of going backwards in time. while it begins with short term memory loss (and thus, repeating oneself- because the person doesn’t remember what has just happened or what they’ve just said), the person essentially goes back to earlier days, because the days of the present are no longer remembered. long term memory remains strong while short term memory evaporates. this explains why someone ‘doesn’t recognize’ their spouse, for example. if the resident feels and believes that they are now 50 years old instead of 90, and a gray haired gentleman tells her that he is her husband, she may reject the idea vehemently. people with alzheimer’s demonstrate trouble with thinking and reasoning, and may have little or no orientation to time. they live in the present- emotionally- and may do things that make no sense at all. the process of alzheimer’s has been divided into 7 stages which begin with simple confusion and in later stages the person has lost significant abilities (to swallow, for example) and full time care is needed.2. **lewy body dementia** (or dementia with lewy bodies).  lewy body dementia is another very common, yet frequently misdiagnosed, or undiagnosed type of dementia. a simplified explanation for what lbd looks like is that it is described as a combination of parkinson’s symptoms with alzheimer’s symptoms. the stiffness or rigidity typically associated with parkinson’s combines with the cognitive decline associated with alzheimer’s. in addition to these outward traits, one of the primary identifying factors of lbd is visual hallucinations. the hallucinations typically are of smaller people (children) or animals, and are not upsetting to the person with lbd. problems with sleep patterns – waking throughout the night or the acting out of dreams are other identifying factors. people with lewy body also experience fluctuating cognition- meaning that they can have moments or periods of clarity, and make complete sense- followed by other times of confusion and nonsensical thinking. lewy body dementia causes its victims to be extremely sensitive to anti-psychotic medications which can typically help those with either parkinson’s or alzheimer’s. these medications can create potentially fatal conditions for those with lbd.3. **vascular dementia.**  this type of dementia- which is sometimes called “post stroke dementia” is quite different from alzheimer’s or lewy body dementia. vascular dementia is actually brain damage traced to cardiovascular problems, or mini-strokes that caused bleeding or harm in the brain. the most outstanding symptoms that identify vascular dementia are when drastic changes occur immediately following a stroke. changes can be in personality, thinking or reasoning- all depending on the area of the brain that has been affected. trouble with paying attention, organizing thoughts, or analyzing situations can all be symptoms of vascular dementia. so simply put, vascular dementia presents itself mostly through cognitive changes, which are the result of brain damage. the use of medications has been shown to prevent or slow further brain damage, therefore control the progress of vascular dementia.4. **fronto temporal dementia.**  ftd occurs when there is deterioration to the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. the person experiences problems with language, and significant changes in their personality and behavior. where the temporal lobe affects how one behaves or reacts in the world, based on outward input- the frontal lobe has to do with cognitive and emotional processes, and voluntary movement. the executive functions of the brain including planning, judging, or analyzing are all housed in the frontal lobe. when someone has ftd, they slowly withdraw into themselves. initially they may lose inhibitions, and behavior and actions can be shocking. as the disease progresses, they tend to lose interest in others around them, and their surroundings. their emotions become empty- there is a lack of sadness, or depression, and little to no awareness of the needs of others. verbal and communication skills are predominantly weak and decrease significantly over time.yes, there are many, many more types of dementia that are known. there is dementia resulting from years of alcohol misuse. there is dementia associated with parkinson’s disease. there is dementia that is a result of a traumatic brain injury. all in all, there are over 100 types of dementia being treated and researched today. an accurate diagnosis is critical to the treatment of someone with dementia, for obvious reasons.while cures for dementia continue to elude the medical world, that doesn’t prohibit us from learning about different dementias, and adapting our ways of thinking at the kensington [to love and care for those we know with dementia.](## recommended additional reading:* [what is a geriatric care manager?](*

I'm worried any opinion would be greatly appreciated.
so it's 5am when i'm writing this. i'm starting to get worried about my dad. he's 64, his wife died 3 years ago, and he went to rehab beginning of the year for opiate abuse. i don't know if the abuse can cause or trigger any form of dementia, but he's showing some weird signs. a few days ago i came back late and he was on the couch watching tv. i asked him a question about something, and he started talking about his military service in ussr (which is true). then, out of nowhere, he starts talking about something about australian people like it was part of the story even tho it was just something on the tv. all of a sudden, in the middle of a sentence, he goes dead quiet. he's silent for about 10 seconds, then looks at me and asks "were you saying something?" a few hours ago i go outside for a smoke. as i'm walking out, he asks me for his debit card. i asked him if i could have $5 for food tomorrow, which he agrees to. i give him back his debit card, and he goes to his room. i literally wait for about 15 minutes and he doesn't come back. i go to his room and he's just in the bathroom doing nothing. i ask him again for the money, and he gives me his debit card and says, "go have fun with your friends." what??? i told him that i just needed $5, so he gives me that. 30 minutes later, i'm outside smoking, and all of a sudden he comes outside. mind y'all, it's 40 degrees out, and he comes out in a t-shirt. he closes the front door and wanders around the front porch for a couple of minutes. then, he slowly walks towards my car (all while i'm looking directly at him) and tries to get in it. i tell him that that's my car, and then he asks me if i'm getting a ride to class tomorrow. (wtf???) he then tries to get into his car, and guess what? he forgot his car keys. i'm really concerned at this point so i tell him that it's not safe for him to drive and that he needs to go back inside. he says, "i can't i have to go to the field trip i have a field trip to go to." (he's a teacher irl) i go, "dad do you know what time it is?" he doesn't know, and is completely astonished that it's 1am. he locked himself out of the house, so i have to lead him back inside. i unlock the door, and he reaches for the top of the door to open it. (wtf?) i ask him if everything is alright, and he says that it's his sore throat. he's completely fine during the day, even tho his sleep schedule is a little messed up. but i'm really concerned because he could've hurt himself or someone else. i don't think he's good with money (we just had to take out a loan last month) and the house is a mess but he doesn't mind. i'm really worried about his mental health. any opinion or advice would be greatly appreciated.tldr: my dad is forgetting and acting confused and doing things without end goal. i'm only 21 idk if i can handle all this.

hi all,first, my apologies if this is the wrong sub for this. please take my post down if that’s the case.some context: my grandfather is in his 80’s and is in the beginning stages of dementia. he deals with periodic bouts of memory loss, confusion, and frequent angry outbursts. he also fractured his neck in a fall recently and will have severe mobility limitations for the rest of his life. other possibility relevant context: we are located in the us and i have power of attorney.the only activity that seems to calm him during moments where his dementia or pain acts up is access to his ipad. he plays gambling and billiards games that have in-app purchases and he racks up thousands of dollars in fees per month. his retirement income used to cover this habit but we are now going to have to divert those funds to in-home care.given his mobility limitations and the fact that these games are the only thing that bring him any peace, i’m trying to find an alternative for him as opposed to just taking the ipad away. my current plan is to install all of the parental controls that the ipad has available and turn off his ability to make in-app purchases. i’m also hoping to find replacement games that are either entirely free or only have a single up-front cost. given that context, i’m looking for suggestions regarding the following:1. is there a way to make absolutely sure that my grandfather won’t be able to make any purchases- even through the web browser on the ipad? will the parental controls be sufficient or do i need to take further steps? he has lucid moments where he’s very motivated and able to make purchases. he’s also pretty tech savvy in those moments and i’m afraid he’ll be able to get past restrictions i put into place.2. does anyone have experience with trying to move a fragile loved one away from these apps? i’m anticipating a strong negative reaction even if i replace the apps with similar ones. he still desires some level of autonomy and this will be taking away one of the last ways that he’s able to spend money. i don’t take that lightly.3. is there a website or something where i can find info on apps that don’t require in-app purchases? i’m afraid i’m going to accidentally download something that has in-app purchases and he’ll either spend money or become very angry that the app won’t let him play anymore.4. do you have any recommendations regarding resources for dealing with gambling addiction in seniors, tech access for seniors, or anything else that’s relevant here? are there other subs that might be helpful?any advice would be greatly appreciated. thanks in advance.

My(23f) dad (66) is finally doing a little better!
i'm sorry if i'm rambling a bit but i feel like getting some stuff of my chest if that's okay.also, english isn't my native language so if there are spelling/ grammatical mistakes i'm sorry.anyhow this past 2 years have been a rollercoaster.2 years ago my dad started going downhill really fast. his character changed, was depressed, didn't know how to do basic stuff, forgot a lot and every time i visited my parents the old house were i grew up in changed. it did not feel like a home anymore. family photos suddenly had our names written on it. bathroom doors couldn't be locked from the inside anymore, stickers on doors, post-its everywhere etc etc. you probably get what i mean.we (my brother, sister and i) suddenly had to 'babysit' my father. we had nightshifts, cause he wasn't able to sleep and at night he would have hallucinations. we had to feed him (he eats through a tube in his stomach and i do not know the english name for it). in the meantime the doctors, all the specialist, could still not find what was going on. last year his tube broke ,so his stomach fluid was leaking in the rest of his body. he had to have a very critical surgery but luckily they were on time even though we almost lost him that day.at the hospital everything got 10x worse. he did not recognize me, thought i was a hallucination. the staff realised that he couldn't live at home any more so he got placed in a nursing home. unfortunately quite far away but we tried to make the best out of it. we 'celebrated' christmas there and after that period of nearly dieing he again became very sick. the doctors told us he would probably not live more than 8 months and that he has lewy-body dementia.but here comes the good part! that was 11 months ago! in the meantime he transferred to a better and specialized nursing home and after this hectic period he really does seems to function better!we all live a lot closer, he loves his new room, became a member of the music club they have there and he is able to -sometines- make jokes again!i just had this realization that the last period was such an depressing one and i was even suicidal at some point but now it slowly seems all to fall in its place. i'm starting to accept the reality that he will not live as long as i once thought but i'm capable to enjoy the good moments with him.and overall dealing with it in a more healthy way! sorry for the long read but i haven't felt so positive in a long time and i never really talk about this stuff. just wanted to share for once.

Single parent with new diagnosis of dementia ...
this is my first reddit post and i have spent quite a few hours reading posts from others in this community so i hoped i might find some wisdom for my battle to come. a bit of background: my mother is 70 years old and has been divorced from my father for well over 40 years. she has always been a great mom and grandmother to my daughter and i love her tremendously. she has live many states away from me for the past 10 years but we remained close for most of those. in the meantime, my older brother (who has never really made good life choices) married someone he barely knew, they moved to the east coast and then began having issues. she cheated, he drank, she kicked him out, he continued to drink, they divorced (he did not want it) and he continued to drink. he then had to move to live with our mother as he had no real connections where they lived nor the funds to support himself. he continued to be a closeted alcoholic, worked sporadically while my mother paid the bills. long story on that, he quit working and went to "school" and after he graduated, quit drinking cold turkey, screwed his body up by doing so and ended up in the hospital with liver failure for 5 months. my mother was already showing some signs of cognitive issues like getting lost trying to get to the hospital, forgetting passwords and such but was still working full time. she then retired as she thought my brother would need help when he got home from the snf he was sent to for rehab. once he was home, he didn't share how hard it was for him to get around (obesity, lingering issues) nor did he share how quickly my mother was declining. she and i would talk once or twice a week and i noticed she would repeat stories or ask me the same question multiple times but my brother assured me they had seen the family dr and he said she was fine. everything came to a head last week when he admitted he had again began drinking (to cope with our mother he said) and ended up in the hospital again. that's when a family friend called me, told me about the filth and squalor they were living in and that my mother was in a really bad way. my brother finally admitted he had not been cooking, only having fast food delivered, because of the filth in the kitchen he was unable to clean and my mother did not have the cognitive ability to do. he was "embarrassed" of the situation and thought he could get a handle on things "eventually".  it then came out that my mother had seen the dr once in 6 months and my brother did not go in with her to the room so he had no idea if her memory issues were even discussed. this all came out over this past weekend and i scrambled to get a plane ticket to her location, her friend brought her to the airport and i loaded her back on the plane and brought her home with me leaving my brother there in hospital. i was heartsick at her condition. she was filthy, she smelled, her clothing was dirty .... it was a very unpleasant plane ride home. i bought her a new shirt at the airport and that helped some but i had no facilities to clean her up and a plane waiting to get her home. once home, i was able to get her clean and such but that was just the beginning. she had no underclothes, no clean clothes packed ... she had been taking out of date meds ... she had rashes and tangled matted hair. i have sorted all of these issues, she has seen a geriatrician and sees a neurologist next week. the geriatric dr i took her to here said yes , dementia but the neuro will have to make the final diagnosis. now for my dilemma. i work full time and spend several hrs a day commuting. i have to work, i am single and have a daughter in nursing school. i am taking some vacation time and can probably do fmla for another month but my mother is a complete care. she cannot find her way around my house, can never find the bathroom or the room she was given. she can't toilet herself because she does not clean herself after. she cannot bath herself, cook her meals .... her personality is there but her short term memory is shot. she asks the same things over and over, she shuffles rather than walks, and has delusions (like thinking my brother was home when he was still hospital before i could get to her). i know in my heart that she deserves to be in a memory care center where she can have others around her, stimulation that is not the tv, therapies for those with memory issues and a shot at some independence but here is enough of her in there that i know she is going to hate it.  she keeps telling me that when she gets back home she needs to get a job so she can help pay bills. it;s almost like she forgets everything else but what would make things easier for her/me. i have only been her sole caregiver for 3 days and already i have screwed up. she gets mad when i help her with her toileting because it "hurts her", i forgot her evening pills tonight, i have has zero opportunity to figure out a way to get her blood pressure taken morning and night per her new dr's wish. i am not a huge people person and as i age, i find having people around me (even family besides my child) for long periods of time makes me anxious and sick to my stomach. as my routines are disrupted, my ra flares, i get small anxiety attacks ... i don't want to put her in a home but i know it's the best thing for both of us. i do. i am just so heartsick and scared to upset her, to make her hate me ..... i think she is aware enough to know somehow that its not really an apartment and those people coming in and out helping her shower are not just helpful neighbors. all of this has just literally been dropped on me in the last 5 days and i feel like i am losing my mind already. i refuse to allow my daughter to disrupt her life by making huge sacrifices. she has been a big help but i want her to live her life to the fullest. she is 23 and i do not want this to suck her dry. oh, and another fun note ... my brother has been released now and is planning on moving here to my house in 3 weeks. he will be in no shape to care for my mother while i am at work and i do not want to be at work/commuting 10 hrs a day and then be to weary to take care of mom evenings/weekends. do i suck as a daughter? i think i know that if she was all there mentally she would not want this for me. i know for a fact i would hate my daughter being stuck taking care of me in her later years. i just can't help feeling guilty and heartsick at how scared/mad/upset/lonely mom will be in a care center. what do i do to make this ok in my head? i am not even sure in home care would be enough with everything she needs. i am working on getting her state aide here and there are some wonderful looking ltc memory centers close by ... we would all visit daily and she can even take a pet (if we clean up after it) ..... how do i know i am making the right choice even if it seems to (probably) devastate her?

Help for someone in denial???
hi all, new here! i believe my mil has dementia. she is 70. her cognitive function,  memory, and ability to complete daily tasks have been declining gradually over the last few year. some examples- forgetting her sons’ names, being disoriented to the day of the week or the month, forgetting our garage code that she used to use daily, and then writing down the letter “r” instead of the number 9 when i told it to her, getting lost on the way to our house and not being able to follow written directions or a map, etc....the worst symptom of all, though, is the paranoia. luckily it hasn’t been focused on any family members yet, but she has zeroed in on her neighbors. she believes they are trying to kill her pretty much daily. she also thinks they are stealing from her and messing with her car.  (of note, the exact same thing happened at her old place so we moved her only for it to happen again.) we’ve had her staying at our house for the last week and now she believes they have followed her here and have been terrorizing her by standing outside her window and yelling that they are going to shoot her. we obviously know this isn’t true since we live here and have dogs that would go crazy if that was really happening. we have tried gently to get her to see that none of this is happening, but to her it’s 100% real and there is no convincing her otherwise. she then gets mad at us for thinking she’s “crazy.” (we would never ever use that word, but that’s the word she uses.)so here’s my question.... she obviously needs help, but how do we convince her? she has no established doctor. i doubt she would sign a dpoa right now.  i did get her an appointment with a new pcp that she agreed to go to in order to get her back pain checked out. i asked over the phone if we could speak to a nurse or doctor beforehand to voice our concerns, but they wouldn’t allow it. is this standard practice? i understand with hipaa they cannot give us info on her, but that’s not what we are asking for. we just want to make sure they have the whole story so they can do their best assessment. i’m afraid that will be difficult to do while she’s in the room and i know she can hide her symptoms fairly well. i’d love any help or advice! this is all so incredibly frustrating and i know this journey is just beginning for us.

My Grandma has early onset dementia. It is making her behave irrationally and mean-spirited. She is often hurtful towards my family and I don't know if there's anything I can do.
i initially posted this on another sub but it was recommended that i post it here too! this is just a copy/paste of what i posted before. i guess i'm looking for advice and for a way to put this awful disease into perspective, and maybe just to get this off my chest too. as the title says, my 80-year-old grandma is in the early stages of dementia, as has been diagnosed by doctors (every so often she has to go back to the hospital to see how it's progressing). of course, this is making her very forgetful. her short-term memory is virtually non-existent. she takes medications but those can't reverse her regressing memory.my family tries to be understanding but it's not easy. she has lost all sense of rationality and thinks the entire world is against her. to give an example: my grandpa (her husband) had to undergo heart surgery yesterday (it went well!). she was there when the cardiologist told him he needed surgery last week. afterwards, she's been calmly told a hundred times that he was going to get surgery. yesterday, she was very upset at him for "not telling her", and accused him of "faking it because he's lazy and wants her to pamper him". when my mom tried to talk sense into her, she lashed out at my mom, telling her that "she always takes my grandpa's side" and "everyone is against her" (maybe i should mention that my grandma began to hate my grandpa, even though he tries his best to truly help and assist her). she stormed off and left my mom on the verge of tears. this is just one of dozens of examples i could be giving. i know it's not her talking, but the disease, but it's incredibly painful to hear her talk about my grandpa like that, or to witness her get angry at my mom. i understand that this must be very scary for her. she is losing her memory and, subsequently, her grip on the world. i know it's not her fault. but situations like this are incredibly painful for everyone concerned. she has always been a very proud woman and now she refuses to acknowledge that she's old and that there's something wrong with her. she adamantly refuses any sort of help, whether it be from therapists, nurses, or chat groups. going to a retirement home is completely out of the question.is there anything that i, and my family, can do, to avoid those kind of situations? or to at least make this entire ordeal a little more bearable? because this is awful for my grandparents, for my mom and her siblings, and for me to see my mom get hurt and my grandma no longer being the woman i knew while growing up.

my grandma has had dementia for around two years. but because a nursing home is way too expensive, my mom takes care of my grandma. we got her an apartment right outside our house. my grandma gets paid by my uncle for it.sometimes i feel really bad that i'm not always around my grandma simply because that's my grandma. growing up i loved seeing her. but our family hasn't always been close. infact, my entire family hardly got a long. i honestly cannot remember the last time i saw one of my cousins in person. but that's not what this is about... except that me and my mom are the only people to take care of her. except occasionally when my cousin (uncle's daughter) comes over with her kid.it infuriates me that nobody else in the family wants to help at all. i'll be honest, i don't talk to my grandma everyday even though she's in the apartment right behind our house but i watch over her when my mom has to go somewhere. to make sure she doesn't leave and get lost. infact a couple months ago, she managed to find a ride to her old farmhouse. my mom had to call the police. we couldn't find her for hours but turns out, the driver took her to the bank and took her to her old house which could have went extremely wrong. we had another incident where my mom had taken in my grandma's pocketbook and my grandma wrote on a piece of paper through the window that she was locked in and robbed and someone called the police.it's really frustrating to me. to see my grandma hardly know what's going on, to see my mom stress over her nearly everyday due to dementia changing my grandma's personality, and to feel like everything is put on my mom. my mom will only let me do so much because she's afraid that my grandma might get nasty with me on the wrong day.i don't know. for now, my mom is okay with taking care of her because i keep an eye on her aswell. but some days my grandma can really do my mom in. what keeps us pushing through this, is we know one day she will pass. so we lookout for her because of that. nobody wants to put her in a nursing home, not only because of how expensive it is, but my mom distinctively remembers my dad saying he'd never put her in a nursing home because he felt it was a horrible way to live the rest of your life.my dad passed away many years ago, as did my grandpa, so sometimes i just can't believe my mom and i are doing this. i can't believe life is the way it is. i want to help more, but i'm not sure how because like i said my mom only wants me to do so much. i try to come up with ideas. for example writing certain things where she'll obviously see it and she won't be tempted to leave because she forgot. but i don't know. i hate seeing my grandma like this and i hate that no one else wants to help even though they have mooched off of her. it's just me and my mom. it sucks.

Q’s For Caregivers &amp; Partners
what would improve your quality of life, caregivers of patients with early onset dementia? how do you cope with trying to support and comfort your loved one while they sundown, rage, not take care of themselves, or waste away apathetically? do you still love the person, and does their life still contribute meaning, when they have lost their former sense of self? what do you wish you had for support while dealing with early to mid stage eod?would it help if your loved one was “quarantined” to their own space in the home while sundowning? we have tried everything to manage the nightly memory loss, fear, and aggression together, short of a hospital admission. background: i’m a young person (30) with likely eod after multiple blunt force and anoxic head injuries, in the process of a diagnosis beyond pcs. my insurance situation is slowing us down due to roots in a blunt force trauma workplace accident for the most recent contributing event, and because we moved states to afford rent, after i could no longer work or function in society. i have no living supportive family to help. it’s a mess of red tape. i’d like to focus on what i can do for my partner while i am still somewhat capable. i’m rarely lucid. i’m obviously typing this lucid. i have enough self awareness to understand what is happening, but not enough to stop it. when i am aggressive, i am aware that i am out of control, but unable to stop the sundowning or the rage. it hits at exactly the same time every day, for the rest of the day. i am intensely fearful &amp; get frequently lost in public. i am really young, and recently started my life together with my partner, and i am heartbroken and afraid. it is heartbreaking to be lucid and cognizant to the emotional damage i often cause for my partner while sun-downing. i often forget everything that happened except for the feel of the memory &amp; i am reminded of how awful each episode was when i am lucid again. each day i lose a little more autonomy and my short term memory is shorter and shorter. i am increasingly agitated in public, i often jump around in periods of time or forget critical events in our lives. it’s a slow cycle of hell. we have not told our closest friends that my health is failing, and we have not planned for the future yet. it’s becoming rapidly obvious that we need to. i’m at the cusp of losing a lot of practical autonomy, as things need to renewed and transferred into our new state where we live. i’ve had several close calls with severe accidents when alone. i don’t think my partner fully grasps how helpless i feel at this point, or how little of my mind is actually functioning properly.i want to be sure my partner is supported, especially when medical appointments and treatment become a heavy parts of our lives. when insurance is transferred and approved, i feel like we have a heavy road ahead of us. i appreciate you all, and thank you for what you do for your loved ones. please know the person you love still loves you, even when they are experiencing difficulties.

I think my (28 M) dad (65 M) might be showing early signs. How to approach the conversation?
i am worried about my dad. over the past few years i have started to notice more instances of memory loss and problems holding conversations. in the back of my mind i think i've been chalking it up to him just "getting old," but a conversation we had today made things click and i want to have a talk with him about him getting some help. i am afraid the conversation may not go well, though, because he has become increasingly angry, defensive, and stubborn over the past few years and months.the memory loss started off small and has gotten worse as time has gone on. a few years ago he would have trouble coming up with words in conversation, but with some prompting he could figure it out and the conversation would continue.  this itself has become more frequent, but more and more he is losing his train of thought mid-conversation and i'll have to remind him what he was talking about. the worst part is that sometimes when he is telling a story, i will ask him questions during the story for clarification or to interject something related. a normal part of friendly conversation. but more and more when i do this he will snap at me for interrupting him because he will immediately forget what he was telling me. "now what was i talking about?..." and "can you just let me finish?!" have become regular lines in our conversations.there have been other things. for instance, in the past few weeks he has lost his phone twice and lost his wallet. he forgot my fiancee's name during conversation recently, and we've been dating for 8 years. he has also been making some questionable financial decisions. but the worst part is that his anger has gotten more out of control. he has always had the propensity to get angry in certain situations, but now he seems to have a much shorter fuse. he will get angry multiple times during normal conversations for seemingly no reason. and this seems to get worse later in the day and into the evening.he has gone through some rough things in his life. my twin brother committed suicide 4 years ago my dad took it extremely hard. he blames the recent increased anger on that situation. and it does seem like his mental state has started deteriorating more rapidly since that happened. he was in therapy for a while which helped, but he hasn't been recently. he has had problems in the past with mixing his anti-depressants with alcohol and marijuana, which could be contributing to some of the mental issues he's having. he's also gone through some emotional abuse from his father early in life which i think has contributed to his general anger throughout his life.whether the cause of his increased struggles is early stage dementia, alcohol/marijuana mixed with antidepressants, or just general emotional trauma taking its toll, i would still like him to go to the doctor and get checked out for dementia. the problem is, with his increased defensiveness and anger i think he might reject this and get upset with me for even suggesting it. i definitely want to be sure i communicate that i'm coming from a place of love and caring. i'll probably also frame it in terms of "there very well may be nothing wrong, but it would be good to get checked out just in case" because he has usually been proactive about going to the doctor to keep himself healthy in other cases. i'm also worried because he has always felt insecure about other people thinking he is stupid, so i hope he doesn't take the conversation in that way.i guess i'm wondering, was anyone else in a similar situation in the early stages with a loved one? do you have any advice for starting up this conversation with someone who might get angry at the idea that someone thinks they could have dementia? and what should i do if he does get angry and refuses to acknowledge there is a problem? any advice or related stories would be greatly appreciated.

My FU with my brother.
well,    today i fucked and completely pissed off my brother.  he and i have both been sharing time sitting with dad at night.  our wives have both been at home holding down the households while we are with dad.   some things happened and he was out for a while so it was just me staying with dad every night for about 4 weeks.  well he’s been able to come back to helping, but i didn’t want him to feel like i was all of a sudden taking advantage so i’ve been having him just help a couple of nights a week.   with that schedule, if i work late, he’s been staying.  my schedule has been work late, get up early, go sit with dad for an hour so he can get to work, then get off work and come sit with dad.   i’ve seen my family a total of 3-4 hours in 2 weeks.   dad hasn’t been sleeping well at night.  he’s got days and nights mixed up.his daily sitter left a list of groceries.   instead of going to get them, i just get a text of the list from his wife.   there’s no reason they couldn’t get them.   really really frustrating.   so i call my 16 year old son, who goes over to get the list and go shopping.  no big deal, he’s happy to do it, he gets to drive.i show up this morning, and one of the first things said is my son forgot a few things.   in reality, he didn’t forget anything,  he just didn’t look for it.   that really rubbed me the wrong way since my son had stopped what he was doing to come do something they could have easily done.   i sent a pretty rough text message to my wife venting my frustration, but i sent it to him instead.   yay.  the only support i have to help with dad and i just fucked that up.   i should have just shrugged off the frustration like i’ve been doing for months.  lesson learned, check text receivers.

Vent about late night angry calls and an impossible situation
my grandmother has vascular dementia.  her memory is still good. she mainly struggles with cognition and confusion and executive functions.  she lives far away from me.  my mother and i have tried for decades... literally decades to get her to move to be closer to us.  she'll agree and then pull the plug at the last minute every time.  we've spent so much money on this:  my mom bought an apartment for her but when my gm saw the apartment, she didn't like the finishes so she refused to move, i bought a house with a basement walkout apartment for her but she didn't like that the living area was separate from the rest of the house so she refused to move, i tried to get her to come back to a place of her choosing but she didn't want to fly - she wanted me to drive out and pick her up and drive her back 6,000 miles of driving!! - and when i said no, she refused to come back. these are just some of the examples, it's been so numerous over the years.she's living in an assisted living now and there's one aide she doesn't like.  the aide is gruff but she does her job.  she's just not coddling - she's a very to the point, blunt person. last night, at around 10pm my time, while i was out grocery shopping (super long day it was the only time i could get around to shopping) she called me multiple times frantic - screaming and crying into the phone yelling, "i'm going to kill myself!! i can't take this any more!! she always does this to me, i'm sick of it!!" i rush through the rest of the shopping, (forgot a bunch of things in my rush, left my coupon book in the shopping cart by accident and now that's gone) and call her back.  i ask her what happened and she says, "she doesn't take care of me, she takes care of everyone else but me." i asked for specifics of what happened, she said that the aide fed the other people first and didn't serve her what she liked to eat.  then, when she drank her whole glass of water, the aide didn't tell her she did a good job drinking her whole glass of water.  this aide isn't the type to do that sort of thing - she won't get special attention or be congratulated by this aide - but when i told my gm that, she insisted that she's not being taken care of there. she then started screaming that she wanted to move back to where i am.  i literally just went through this 7 months ago where she agreed to 100% move to me. i made her promise that she would actually come this time.  she assured me she would.  i spent thousands of dollars on an attorney and a deposit and plane tickets and in the last week, she refused to go.  i will not do that any more.  that was the last straw for me.  i have spent too much money on her whims.  it's not fair to my family to use our limited resources like that.then she went on a tirade about how all her companions have left her (i hired companions to take her out and be my eyes/ears out there and they quit frequently because she's mean to them) and how another resident hit her 3 times (he didn't hit her, he told her to leave him alone and when she wouldn't, he walked past her and his shoulder hit hers because she wouldn't move), and how another resident screams all night long (one resident screamed one night because she fell and the emts were trying to get her out to the ambulance) , etc.  she tells others these lies too and then they call me up, asking me why i haven't move her to me or why i leave her in such a deplorable home.  i don't have unlimited funds/resources/time to devote to her care. i have a young family, i watch/care for my other grandmother with advanced alzheimer's one day a week, and i have a full time job too. i don't understand why people just believe her!  i am at her beck and call.  i fly out to her multiple times a year.  next month will be my 5th trip out to her this year.  i ordered new furniture for her to be delivered while i'm out there, and she told me to return it all, she doesn't want it and don't bother coming out.  never mind all the time and money i spent on arranging all this because eff me and my life.  i can't go through the whole moving thing again.  what do i do?  how do i handle this? thank you for reading and for giving me space to vent.

Unpleasant people also get old
tl:dr caring for a dementia parent who abused you as a child is no picnici’m not sure what i want to say or what kind of a response if any i’m looking for, but sometimes you just have to put thoughts and feelings into words you know?my parents were not good parents. i stress that the abuse i suffered was not physical or sexual, but it was none the less abuse. i was the oldest child, smart, pretty, strong and well behaved and years of therapy have helped me see that this made me a constant threat to my parents’ self esteem. i was scapegoated, gaslit, mocked, humiliated, shamed and rejected on a daily basis from the age of 8 till i got the hell out. my brother had issues but was never disciplined because he was the only boy and my sister was the golden child because she nearly died as a baby. she will tell you she and my brother had totally different parents from me. because of factors too complex to list at this time of night, i kept them in my life with the incredible support of my partner. there was a sort of unspoken reconciliation based on mostly my hard work and determination and mom and i mostly got along though my dad could still be a challenge. my dad died of cancer nearly ten years ago and we convinced my mum to move near us. she was a good grandma whom my kids loved and my siblings had moved thousands of kms away. she had started to show signs of lewy body dementia then but we didn’t realize it until about two years ago. we then strongly suggested she move back in with us. i knew it would be hard especially with the abusive history but it was a task i was willing to take on. she was diagnosed just after she moved in and has been declining rather more rapidly than expected and i ended up giving up my job to give her quality of life while she still has time. most of the time it’s good. hard, but good and in some ways quite rewarding. but then there are days like today when it’s awful. i went up to her room to offer to read to her but she wasn’t interested. later she got confused about the time and wanted to go to bed. she goes to bed earlier and earlier each night but gets up earlier and earlier each morning which throws off her food and pill schedule. i reminded her that it wasn’t time yet and everything seemed fine. later i walked in to the living room and she was sitting in the dark and moping so i asked her what was wrong. that is literally all i did but out of nowhere she’s yelling at me and before i know it she is playing all the mind games from my childhood. i know it’s the dementia and i know all the things i am supposed to do but none of them work. she is still too with it to be distracted or lied to. talking in a calm voice doesn’t work, nothing works and finally i lose it and tell her off. and it sucks because i know it’s the wrong thing to do and she can’t help it. i know she is feeling anxious and ashamed because she is losing control of her life but there has always been a reason in her head why it is okay to treat me like this and she’s pretty lucid so it’s hard to blame the disease and....  it hurts oh it hurts. to give love to someone who has always withheld it is so..., i’m not sure there’s a word really. the saddest thing is i can’t wait for the day when she forgets who i am.

Not sure what to do about my father?
i (22f) have an older father (69m) who was diagnosed a couple years back i believe with alzheimers. he's always been the provider and currently is the one with the income (his retirement) my mom (actually sister in law but raised me, married my brother/his son who is deceased as of ten years) is trying to find a job to support herself and i have potential options to move out if i could. he refuses to acknowledge his disease, and doesn't want to go to a home and often talks of death. he's easily confused and forgetful but has lucid moments, except lately he's gotten worse and been forgetting words/speaking gibberish. he doesn't remember to feed himself often, needs help with his medication, wanders (especially at night), easily agitated and frustrated.. the tipping point was today, he was exceptionally confused about our cats of whom we have four. he counts them before bed, and often multiple times a day. he kept asking where the others were, and was reminded multiple times.. the others have been dead for a long time. i was in the dining room and he kept wandering around, asked where everyone was. so i ask "who? there isn't anyone else it's just us three?" "what about dee?""she never lived here, she lives out of town." (his sister is 90 and in a nursing home for the same thing)"what about johnny and peggy? are they living in the old house?""they don't live here either, they have nothing to do with us. they don't live in (our town) they never have.""oh, so where are we? do i have to drive home?""you live here, this is home.""your home, where do i live?""with me?"he generally thought we at some point somehow moved out of state or houses and he lived somewhere else. which then turned into:"i hope (mom) moves back then.""she didn't leave, she's here right now in her room."which reversed us back to the first part of the conversation until he said he'd figure it out in the morning.he's suddenly worse as if overnight, we rent this home so we have no where he could go when we can't stay anymore. i'm 22 and in no way able to care for him, my mom is 42 and took care of my i'll brother so i view it as unfair to make her do it.eventually i'd be moving in with my partner and mom doesn't want to stay here, we know he'll need to go to a home at some point eventually. i just don't know when. how do you make that call when they're still alert and aware but just confused?

my  dad had a head injury three years after fainting and another  bad fall last year but is otherwise healthy. he was diagnosed with a frontal lobe injury, but it’s acting like dementia ish symptoms.  he’s forgetful, short attention span, can’t drive, we had to turn the gas off in his home.  i’ve tried setting rides every week for him through sr services for repeated appointments that he wants, pt and psycologost, but but he misses them. “oh they didn’t come”. they did. i called.  he goes out with a aid twice a week to shop,  6hours total. and though i’m trying to create a predictable schedule for him, manages to find ways to need new appointments and sabotage the ones that are set.  it’s driving me insane. i’ve looked up services in my area of the usa (southwest). there’s no adult daycare in my area. he went to the sr ctr last week once: “it was just horrible. the people are so disorganized.”. if he gets lucky be might be able to afford some independent living place if his house that needs a lot of work can be rented, he could maybe squeak by. i can’t pay for it, neither can my sister, no one here has gotten a raise in years.  i called my state agency for aging. they referred me to the alzheimers association,  that referred me to a bunch of programs that don’t exist in my area.  a psychologist told me if he gets a dementia diagnosis his insurance might not pay for psych. his neurologist has referred him to a dementia specialist 50 miles away. my question for everyone: did a specific diagnosis actually help? and how. what the hell am i supposed to do???sorry about typos, on a phone. frustrated.

He went to a home today
some of you might remember my earlier post about my grandfather and the struggles we were having finding help for him. after hundreds of calls i finally got things rolling and he was put on the crisis list for a nursing home. he actually ended up being placed exactly where we wanted him which was a big surprise.today was his big day. i didn’t sleep much last night but he actually slept all night for the first time in months. he didn’t know he was going to a home. we had talked about it to try and prepare him but he didn’t understand and would forget very quickly anyway. surprisingly had zero issues getting him to the home and the nurse took him to see his room while we did the paperwork. we had a break after the first hour of paperwork and went to sit with him for a little bit. at that point all seemed good and we got started finishing the paperwork. after finishing the paperwork we sat with him again and at that point he had figured out what was going on. he asked “why am i here” and made several threats. at that point i thought it’d likely be best for us to leave and let him try to settle in and hopefully calm down. i got a nurse to distract him but just as we were leaving he said “i’ll see you when you decide to come back”.this whole situation has me feeling like shit. all the stress taking care of him and now i feel as if i’ve basically just abandoned him in some strange place. i know it’s for the best as we simply couldn’t take care of him anymore and it was taking one hell of a toll on us so really we didn’t have much choice. of course none of that makes this any easier. my grandfather raised me, he was/is basically my father. we did pretty much everything together and i’m so used to him being around. it’s only been a couple hours and i already miss him even though at this point i’ve come to hate him. i know i can’t but i have this urge to go back and get him and just pretend it never happened. it’ll get easier with time i know.just needed to vent a bit. this disease really is horrible. i’ve known several people with dementia over the years but never been this close to it. people don’t seem to realize just how devastating it is until they get this close to it. i know it’s changed my life forever and really opened my eyes as to how important it is to make sure things are in order in case it ever happens to me. at this point i just hope he doesn’t have to suffer much longer and that the home can try to keep him as happy as possible until the inevitable.

She saved my life. I protect hers.
hello, i'm currently 32 years of age. military veteran of nine years. i had no idea 50 days ago, that my life would take this turn for the better and it is such a glorious friendship and yet tragic relationship in a few ways. i have no children and divorced in 2016. i am one semester away from finishing up at university, and currently 50 days totally sober. i once thought that was impossible. i grew up under a narcissistic alcoholic father, codependent mother, abusive older sister, and have 2 forms of ptsd at present that i deal with by staying sober now. before i came to aa i was utterly lost, and spiralling out of control. i cut total contact with my n father a year ago, and my healing has begun. it's well underway. i met nancy at aa. she came from a very troubled background, and yet, has been sober 38 years no slips, raised a great son, and has a phd in adult education. and a great cat named itchy. he loves me. she was extremely lonely, and had other unmet needs that early dementia brings along. she offered me to reside with her in the spare bedroom and i accepted. we attend daily aa meetings 7x a week. and i have since being sober discovered i am actually a great cook! she was eating peanuts and hot dogs before i came along nearly every day. i've literally cooked 8 different meal varients for her: pot roast w veggies n potato, linguini alfredo with blackened chicken, pot roast with rice over green curry sauce, blackened chicken alfredo, baked lasagna...etc. i also would have been totally homeless without her help. i've got multiple grants, scholarships, va pension, and the gi bill coming in soon to help us out, and to repair the damage i did while drinking. i drive lyft 4x a week and wont have to soon as i plan on getting a career after graduation. i also got her cat on a diet and he has slimmed up bc he's being fed 2x a day with 3 kinds of food, instead of 6 or 9 meals a day that she was doing before bc she forgot how many times he had been fed during the day! lol omg this cat was bursting when i first arrived!!! fat boy! she has helped me work through to step 4 so far, i'm just happy to be needed, and she is thrilled to have me here! she loves my war stories and tales from my 9 years overseas, and we have a nightly "movie time." so far we have watched all of band of brothers, the pacific, and enemy at the gates, restrepo, 24 hours the benghazi movie, and generation kill lol. i tell her all the bullshit fake hollywood parts, and we also watched lone survivor. i also got her going to the gym with me at planet fitness 3x a week roughly. and i've put my bowflex weights on the porch that her and i use regularly. i also got her drinking a lot less coffee, and much more water.  less sugary drinks too, more high protein and we often go out for poke toki or healthy full breakfasts at new beginnings. i have never had a friend ever or relative that i connected with more than nancy. we are kindred souls. anything else i could be doing here? i also write sticky notes for her regularly. thanks for reading.

I'm afraid I'll forget my actual husband and expect to see my ex-husband when I'm elderly - anyone see it happen?
my post is meant sort of light heartedly, but sort of seriously too. i have a strong family history of dementia and alzheimer's (my mom and her mom). \-i've noticed my mom being forgetful since she was around 43yrs old (maybe earlier because i was just a kid then). she had to stop working because she would make mistakes as a dental assistant and forget important steps, even though she'd been working as a registered dental assistant for 27 years and knew her job inside and out beforehand. she still lives on her own by choice but i worry she will fall or burn the house down from leaving a burner on.\-my grandma had full blown alzheimer's and i recognized her dementia as early as age 68 when she was driving us to the mall and turned left onto the wrong side of the road (but i was a child then as well, so it may have started earlier for her too). now me. i'm only 34, but because i grew up around dementia almost my entire life, i'm keen to the signs. the little things. word recall getting harder and harder and harder. needing lists. needing alarms on my phone to alert me 15min before school or an activity is out so i don't forget to pick up my children, because i'm convinced i will forget. (my mom forgot me at school and daycare more than a few times, and my grandma locked me in a hot car on accident when i was a baby and had to call 911 to get me out). i've also had 2 episodes of aphasia around age 28 and 30 (it could have been because of a history of migraines, or maybe it was a mini-stroke - my grandma had those as well). i didn't get it checked out, i was still in a bad marriage and overrun by toddlers and not doing self-care.  **and now i have this issue: i was married for 8yrs. we have 3 children. \*i\* divorced him. i no longer wanted to be with him. i have no romantic feelings at all for him. i don't miss him but we do co-parent well. plus, we are both remarried. i've been remarried for 2 years. yet i \*still\* accidentally call my new husband by my ex-husband's name. i have caught myself so many times doing this. he seems understanding and doesn't mind. but i feel extremely embarrassed and it also makes me think of my mom and grandma.**i know it could just be like how people call their kids by the wrong name (i do that too). but i can't help but picture myself in the memory care section of the nursing home, asking for my husband (or a photo of him if he's dead lol) and expecting to see my ex, having no idea who my actual husband is. **like it's ingrained in my brain's long-term memory that my ex is my husband.** i make jokes about it to my husband, but it actually kind of bothers me!! lol i say it's just my dementia coming out to play a little early. my grandma always owned her dementia and when she had trouble with word recall or forming a sentence, she always laughed it off and said, "oh it's just my dementia" with a big grin. &lt;3 **tl;dr anyone in here see it happen where grandma asks for an ex-husband because she doesn't remember her actual husband? lol**

Feel like we are falling through the cracks
this might be long and i apologize because i don't post much.  my[48f] parents lived 600 miles away.  i talked to my mother everyday on the phone.  for the past 5 yrs, or so, i've noticed that she will repeat conversations everyday.  my dad got sick 2 yrs ago and i took a leave from work to help take care of him.  at this point i realized how badly my mother had gotten. she can't remember for more than a minute what somebody had said or if she had dr appts. it concerned me that she would forget to take her meds and yet a bigger fear was she would remember to take them and take then twice or 3 times.  while i was there for she got sick and became unresponsive. we called an ambulance and she went to the er. they ran a bunch of tests and eventually said she had an opioid overdose.  she was not on any opioids. i think she got into my dad's morphine.   i talked to her neurologist after my dad passed to get her declared incompetent and he would not.  he sees her for literally 10 mins every 6 mos and she would pass the cognition questions he would ask her. her memory has significantly declined since his passing. in february she fell and busted herself up pretty good.  ended up in a "rehab" nursing facility.  they did declare her incompetent and i have moved her to ms so i can stay with her.  they would not give me any paperwork.  they said it's different from state to state.  i've asked doctors here and they have referrals in for neurologist to see her but no appt had been made yet.  i've taken her keys away because 1.) she doesn't need to be driving and 2.) she forgot renew the registration.  the doctor has no advice on finding a geriatric social worker to get her some kind of help. i've asked other people in the medical field and nobody seems to know anything about geriatrics and this terrible disease. i feel like we have slipped through the cracks. i'm trying my best to take care of her.  my children help out because i work nights but i find myself getting frustrated literally answering the same question every 2 minutes. can anybody point me in the right direction to find some help for her?

at the end of my rope
my grandfather started showing serious signs of dementia about 5 years ago then kinda took a nose dive about a year ago and has been steadily getting worse. he doesn't understand anything, you can't reason with him at all. basically to him whatever is in his head is right and everyone else can fuck off. he's losing bladder control and we can't get him to shower or change his clothes no matter what we try so he absolutely reeks and stinks up the entire house and the truck if we go somewhere. people used to come visit but the condition of the house along with him hating everyone slowly drove everyone away so now it's just me and my grandmother trying to live with this madness. he'll try to fight with the tv and when we're out driving around he'll point at random houses and say "some asshole lives there" then talk about how he wants to fight/kill that person. the last month or so he's gotten far more aggressive and will occasionally just snap and try to fight me. the look he gets in his eyes when he snaps is something out of a horror movie. of course he'll forget everything after about a minute but the bad mood can last the entire day or even longer.&amp;#x200b;he does not have a doctor and never has. he farmed his entire life and is the type that would avoid doctors at all costs. i've called hundreds of doctors and every dementia related services i can find within my area and none of them will offer any sort of help. they all say they can't do anything without us having power of attorney and in his condition the only way to get that is through court. i've called multiple lawyers and the ones that actually wanted to help all quote $10,000+ which we absolutely do not have not to mention they've all said it'd take a minimum of 6 months. he would also have to be evaluated by a doctor for the courts which is pretty hard to do when he doesn't have a doctor, none are willing to see him and we simply cannot get him to one. he was in the er twice where they said they'd evaluate him and try to get us some help but they just end up sending him back home by ambulance and giving us a number for some service that keeps telling us they can't help.&amp;#x200b;i don't know what to do. i feel like i've simply run out of options and the way we're living is not healthy for any of us. he's obviously not at all healthy literally living in his own shit but i can also see the toll it's taking on my grandmother too. personally i've spent every day of the last month or so thinking about the best way to kill myself only to realize i'd be leaving my grandmother alone in this madness. i can't even get a decent sleep because i worry he's going to take off in the middle of the night. i don't understand why it's so hard to find even a little bit of help. i'm just feeling pretty hopeless at this point and every single day is worse then the last. i can't even find the energy to try and take care of myself properly or do household chores like mowing the grass

Can't believe I have to post about this, my mom has dementia. What do I do?
about a year ago i started getting particularly concerned about my mom who is now 72 yo and is otherwise healthy. she was forgetful and confused among other things. over the past year she's done tests and has had scans and has been meeting with a neurologist. i don't know specifics as i haven't been involved in that process and my dad has been the one to take care of these things. things have clearly been getting worse. she is no longer able to drive and she has weird hang ups about certain things and needs them to be explained to her multiple times. for example, i came to my parent's house (where i am now living short-term for unrelated reasons) and was about to leave again but she looked at my car keys and asked me how i was going to leave if i didn't have my car key. i showed her my car key and she looked so confused and then looked out into the drive way and asked which car i was going to take. this went on for a few minutes until she finally was able to put it together that the car key i was showing her belonged to my car in the driveway. she thought the car key i showed her belonged to another car and according to my dad she's been hung up on car keys for the last couple weeks. another thing that makes this difficult is that english is not her first language (korean is, but we are living in the us and are an english speaking family. none of us in my immediate family speak korean well enough to converse with her without english) and her communication skills in english are going very fast. she used to be fluent but i don't think i would say that she is anymore. i wonder if she is more mentally capable in korean than in english because she still talks on the phone and sees her korean friends all the time but this isn't something i can figure out for myself because i don't speak enough korean. have any of you dealt with a similar type language situation? &amp;#x200b;i really just don't know how to handle this. i'm young (26) and didn't think i'd have to be dealing with something like this soon even though my parents are on the older side for someone my age. my dad is retired and is around to take care of her now but i have plans to move to europe for work for at least a year and now i'm questioning if i should change that plan in order to be around her. i have no idea how quickly this is going to decline and i think i would regret it if i weren't around if she ends up losing a lot of her capacities when i'm gone. on the other hand, this is a really big move for me not just for my career but for personal reasons too. ugh. idk.

My grandmother with dementia lives at home and it is becoming an increasingly toxic environment
a lot of this is venting something that’s been on my mind heavy. any advice or kind words would be appreciated. tl;dr: my grandmothers mental and physical state is worsening, my short fused father is her main caregiver and it’s creating a toxic environment for dad grandma and my brother who lives with them. my dads nearby sister and out of state brother provide little to no help other than financially. my grandmother is 85 and i’ve been told by family that she has dementia. i lived with her my dad and my younger brother until last year, i moved out and they are still with her. she doesn’t speak english and i have a hard time communicating with her past basic conversation. a few years ago she started having more memory loss with just like not remembering the day or where she put things or leaving food on the stove. she began taking some medication that gave her angry mood swings (again something that i was told) where she would become very suspicious of us and blaming us for things that were missing. we’ve always had a kind of rocky relationship and i felt that i was getting the worst of it, one of the last straws being her accusing me of stealing $600 from her. from when i moved out almost a year ago i have noticed that she has become more confused. she started to confuse my dad for my uncle who lives in another state. she went through a period of believing my brother and i had another baby sibling also by my brothers name. she has had a couple of episodes, once standing at the front door and refusing to let my brother leave because she believed he stole her keys. she has now been confusing my dad with my late grandfather. he passed almost 2 years ago and she had refused to speak to him for many years. he was abusive to her and cheated on her  throughout their marriage until he left her. she now has aides that come in about 6 hours a day on the weekdays while my dad is working. a new younger woman came one day when my dad was working from home. grandma had an episode claiming she got home that day and found my dad and the aide having sex on the dining table and called her all kinds of names, claimed they were trying to poison her and screamed outside for help. my father recently eloped with a woman who works in the neighborhood that my grandma has known for years. they came home with lunch and plans for the 3 of them for the day but my grandma said she didn’t know who she was and demanded that she leave. my dad is the middle child and has a sister who is about 30 minutes away and a brother in another state. his sister (my aunt) has started spending the night once a week because my dad has been sleeping on a pull out couch in the living room for when my grandma needs help walking to the bathroom, so she comes once a week to give him a break. grandma also sometimes needs him to help her get dressed after using the bathroom. he says he wakes up 2-3 times every night. he loves to bike and isn’t able to go for rides after work like he used to because he needs to get home for my grandmas aide to leave. he has a short temper in general and him and my grandma would often get into yelling fights, or he would just get angry when she couldn’t find something and insisted she knew where it was. when i visited the day that she threw out his new wife, he was helping her into a chair and she asked me where my dad was. he immediately brought himself closer to her ear and yelled that he was my dad and that he was not her husband. i said she is confused. we had just talked 10 minutes before and she had already forgot. she said she cooked something and would give it to me and my mother before we left (she didn’t cook and my mother wasn’t there). she began asking me what i got for christmas and where i spent it (this was a week ago and we always spend it together) when i was finishing school (i dropped out 3 years ago). he said that he thinks sometimes she is confused but sometimes she knows exactly what she is doing and threw out his wife on purpose to have him alone, that she sometimes needed help getting dressed but other times *somehow* knew how to dress herself. throwing out his new wife seemed to be the last straw and he said it had him considering putting her in a nursing home. i think he is completely worn out and resenting her for everything he has to do. my dad is already not the type of person to be caring for an elderly person. he doesn’t have the patience or a nurturing kind of personality yet he is doing it 6-7 days a week. i think my aunt and uncle need to be doing more to put less responsibility on him. i’m the first person to understand feeling impatient and irritated with her but having the time away makes it infinitely more easy to be patient when i visit her. i would hate to see her be put in a home and i know she would hate it too but i think they all may be better off, including my brother who barely spends time at home to avoid the drama between the two of them. he yells at her and she doesn’t even have the capacity to understand why anymore and it’s been eating at me for the past few days. i want to bring her some kind of activity to do but her hands are also weak so i don’t know what would be good. i don’t know if it’s too much to want my aunt to spend more days there to care for her. any advice would be helpful.

Does this sound like a case of early onset Dementia?
my father is 47 turning 48 this year. i’m 20.my father is a completely different person than he was just a few years ago, and he’s very clearly mentally deteriorating. i suspected that he might suffer from a personality disorder, but now i’m thinking that it might be dementia.he has these symptoms: memory loss- sometimes he forgets what was said just 5 minutes before. he developed a recent habit of getting in my face to talk to me and i don’t like it because i like my personal space. i have told him to stop several times in the past but because he did it again, i screamed stop. he threw a tantrum and started screaming and cursing at me. then he said that i screamed “get the fuck out of my face” when i literally only screamed “stop.” my mom was there to verify this happened, and then he claimed that we conspire against him and will lie for each other. this isn’t true, it’s just ridiculous. he couldn’t appear more confused when we tried to explain to him that that’s not what happened. similar incidents have occurred in the past, but this is the first time i’ve seen him forget something that occurred literally minutes before. difficulty with visual and spatial abilities, such as getting lost while driving- yes. especially driving. as of late we have noticed that he needs to use a gps to get home although we’ve been to/returned a particular location without a gps in the past. he has also started taking unusual routes to get home that we have never taken before, even though we have taken our typical route all our lives.misplacing things- all the time. misplaces hats, keys, etc. loses self control and will often scream and become agitated if he can’t find things. that’s about it for cognitive changes. the personality changes are the most significant.personality changes- he now describes himself as “anal” on a daily basis. he never described himself as anal before and nobody would describe him as anal, either. suddenly he has felt the need for exact change, such as a $10 bill rather than two $5 bills. if he’s paying for a $10 item with a $20 bill, and the item comes out to $10.50, he will ask the cashier to put a small item back until his purchase is exactly $10. he was never like this before, nor would he have ever did this. the cashier was getting visibly annoyed but he wouldn’t stop. depression- he has this sense that everyone hates him or dislikes him, and i think it makes him depressed. he is rarely smiling, rarely happy. he doesn’t like to participate in recreational activities (he even recently said he doesn’t know what “fun” is) and he will never leave the house to do anything but to run errands or go to work. if either me or my mom try to get him to go with us somewhere, it becomes an argument. agitation- a fight will start at the drop of a pin. he throws temper tantrums and has no control over his emotions. again, this is relatively new behavior. he acts like he has the emotional control of a teenager or even a child than that of a fully grown adult. he takes everything as a personal attack and will resort to insulting his loved ones if he feels like he’s the victim of an attack. hallucinations- possibly. there was an incident last year where he was sick but refused to see a doctor because he said he hates doctors. in the past he never had an issue with seeing a doctor, but this time, it took arguments that lasted for days until he finally went. in the meantime he was saying things like “i don’t have much time left” because he truly thought he was going to die. it worsened when he said that he could no longer swallow his food because he would begin to choke. when he finally went to the doctor with this problem, he wasn’t diagnosed with anything. they said he was perfectly fine. all of a sudden he was able to swallow again and he bounced back within a day. i realize this isn’t a hallucination, but the “illness” was definitely created in his head. is this enough for him to see a doctor? my mom began to cry at the thought because he had some symptoms. it’s heartbreaking and painful for all of us. it’s like he’s an entirely different person. nobody could ever even conceive of bringing this up to him because he will throw a tantrum.

Help for my Father [70 years old, M] Very Serious!
hi everyone,my dad is 70 years old and i’m not sure if he has a mental illness such as borderline personality disorder, the beginning stages of dementia or the beginning stages of alzheimer’s. let me explain the situation. we moved as a family from los angeles to dallas in 2014. my mother became ill and lapsed into three comas from late 2014- and then passed away in july 2016. while my mother was in comas, my younger brother stole over 100,000 from my parents checking and savings accounts. i kept wondering why my father said he was broke all of the time and we finally realized my brother was stealing. shortly after my mom passed, my father went bats#it insane and called my mom’s family in l.a. one thing led to another and the court served him with two restraining orders. three months after my mother died, my dad started dating a woman he met at work. take into consideration my parents had been married for forty years. my dad dated this woman all of 2 months and told me and my brother that they were getting married and she was moving in. i immediately called my aunt, who flew out to texas and was able to talk some sense into my father. my dad has been obsessed with leaving dallas since my mother died. my fiancé and i were having to coordinate his whole move, with no help from my brother, but the worst part of the experience was the repetitious conversations about where we were going to move. i counted 57 times that i had to explain to my father that the house had to sell before we could even travel to the destinations we had chosen. it got so bad, that i became chronically depressed and it’s been hard to kick the depression. i am the one child who helps my father out with things he can no longer process, and instead of getting angry at my brother who almost bankrupted him, he goes off on me. three nights ago, he told my fiancé that if i didn’t let him borrow $500 for a home mortgage processing fee, he would throw me out of the house. my fiancé told me that five minutes later he came back upstairs, apologized, and said he didn’t understand why he was acting in that manner. he is usually rude to me, or overly emotional, where he will start crying, which can be awkward for me. i have been a social worker for many years but i mainly dealt with ptsd with co-occurring disorders. i believe he shows classic signs of bpd . he has emotionally turbulent relationships, he is erratic, he fears abandonment, he is ambivalent, he has shifting goals, he has been suicidal, has wild mood swings, feels empty, angered and loses his temper. bpd is rare in males, and because of his recent short and long term memory loss, i’m not sure if it’s bpd with dementia, or what his diagnosis might be? he will often forget to complete a task and blame me. my fiancé and i have been sticking around here because my brother still lives with my dad, stole 100 grand and texted me death threats against my dad. i was in houston and had to tell my dad to immediately leave the home. my dad refuses to throw my brother out. my dad also has tons of firearms and he has pointed a loaded gun at my brother, and has threatened to kill himself. yes, he sees a shrink, but the shrink isn’t helping and when i suggest getting therapy and a new shrink, he just shines me on. at this point i know he needs an evaluation. if it’s alzheimer’s, dementia, or severe mental illness, or all of the above, he needs help. for my own well being, i believe that i need to exit his home but only after i know it’s safe. can anyone relate to this?

Advise Needed - Father with Mid-Stage Dementia
i'm sure these get posted with some regularity, but wanted to see if i could get some general advice from other people that have gone through, going through, or treating people with the same symptoms we are dealing with.   a basic background.  my dad turns 80 this year and began showing signs of dementia that were noticeable about 4-5 years ago. started with the basic problems of forgetfulness and not being able to complete tasks (ex couldn't assemble a basic wagon for my son. this is someone who has performed manual labor and been a mechanic his whole life) then to forgetting who's house he was at - even if we were at his house.  he would always say, my brain just doesn't work like it did, and apologize.   this past weekend, mother's day weekend, is what spurred me to ask for advice here.  when he and i were alone, he asked what i thought of the lady he was with because they were getting pretty serious and he really liked her.  he said he thinks she is a great woman and asked if i'd be ok with that being my step-mother.  the issue with that is, that woman is my mom and they've been married for 40 years!  i told him that, and he said .. oh .. really? then asked if she was also the mom of my siblings.  i finally mentioned to my mom today that this happened.  i've been digesting it since then and could barely tell my wife with all the emotions attached to that conversation.  my mom told me that they went to dinner last night and on the way he asked her where she worked and occasionally will ask if she knows us kids.  they are getting some basic treatment from the va.  last time they went the dr said he couldn't tell of any signs of degradation, which there pretty obviously is.  i've told my mom to start looking into finances and get another appointment for a better assessment.   here are some questions i've been thinking in my head since a couple days ago:  1. how much longer (generally) until we seriously need to get him into assisted living?2. should he be driving?  3. as heartbreaking it is to ask, life expectancy?  4. should my family and i look to do any personal therapy? if so, what kind of therapist?5. general suggestions to try to enjoy my father as much as i can before either his mind goes further or body does? this may seem like a dumb question, but seems like it's getting harder and harder to connect.  6. what type of legal items do we need to start taking care of while he still has some memory and function left?tl:dr - sorry it was so long. dad is losing his memory and hoping for some advice. even if none, i think this at least gave me a place to vent and put down some thoughts.

Our journey through dementia....
i'm sitting down to write this because this journey is nearly ending and i had a breakdown discussing things in our imminent future: obituaries, funerals, blessing of the sick, last rites, etc. my grandmother is basically in the active phases of dying. it's been a little less (or about) 4 years since she was originally diagnosed but i truly think she might have had signs since 2012-2013 and was able to hide them. i remember her casually mentioning to my dad that she had once driven by the house 4 times because she couldn't recognize the house. this was far before we had a diagnosis. just my thoughts: i think one of the biggest things that didn't happen that i always heard happened was forgetting loved ones. she did forget the names of loved ones she hadn't seen in years or that weren't around much, but she never forgot my mom, sister, i or her sister that lives up here's name. she had blips where she would stumble over her sister's name but that's about it.declining wasn't linear....some things happened at a faster pace than others. for example, her ability to coherently put together sentences dropped very quickly whereas her motor skills were okayish for a long while. however, it seems when something fell off, it just went down to damn near bottom before leveling out for a while. dementia seems to be a long, slow mourning process. knowing that my grandmother's days are numbered, knowing she may not make it to next week hurts. i don't want to do anything at all but i can't stand seeing her like this. her breathing is irregular, she can't eat/drink/etc. she's sleep most of the time. unable to speak well. this is the opposite of what she used to be, who she used to be. however, while it hurts, i've mourned what will never be and what has been lost since her diagnosis. i knew the outcome but am far from prepared. i feel numb and scared but that's death i suppose. feelings, sicknesses, etc are more pronounced in dementia patients. utis can completely change a dementia patient until it has cleared. same with dehydration, or mental, physical, emotional stressors. when my mom got sick, my grandmother became a bit more withdrawn, concerned about my mom even if she couldn't properly verbalize it. finally (for now): while the person i once knew has long been gone, pieces of that personality came out every now and again and made me smile. those times where she showed that strong maternal instinct she always had make me feel a bit warm and at home. i don't have anyone to talk to so i put this here. i wish i could wake up and this be a bad dream. wake up to my grandmother cooking breakfast and drinking some coffee. go back pre-diagnosis, pre-dementia. hell, right now, i'd go back to a few months ago to her just calling someone in the house just to say she didn't need anything. i was blessed with this grandmother and man is it going to hurt knowing she's no longer here. i pray a cure is found so no more people have to suffer through this shit. never in my wildest dreams could i imagine this happening to our family.

Bothered even though I should brush it off.
i don’t have anyone to talk about these things with, so please excuse the enormous length of this rant. it’s basically a novel. (tl;dr at the bottom for convenience).    a little backstory: i just turned 27 (female). about two years ago, both of my parents passed away less than a month apart. i was extremely close to them and took care of them due to health issues from years of substance abuse. my maternal grandmother lived down the street from them. besides my elder brother who is not a great person and is irrelevant to this story, there’s no other family here in this state. everyone else—including my grandmother’s 3 sons (my uncles)—live up north.  one son hasn’t been heard from in 15 years, one son hasn’t seen her in 15 years but sometimes calls, and another son saw her two years ago for a day and hasn’t for about a decade before that (and he calls sometimes).   &amp;#x200b;when my parents passed away, i felt obligated to step up to the plate as my grandma has been showing signs of cognitive decline for years and as i said, there’s no one else around. she’s 91 now for reference. she has that typical depression-era coldness often found in people her age. she’s always been quite snooty, judgmental, and unaffectionate. she had expressed on numerous occasions that she’d rather die than go to a nursing home and i get that. while i could never establish a close bond with her, i do love her and care about her. i thought that since my parents were gone, i would just move her in with me to spare her that experience. i am used to caring for people and while she’s snooty, she has generally been pretty docile. over the years, her vascular dementia has inevitably advanced and she’s had a couple mini-strokes (tias).   &amp;#x200b;to sum up her entire current condition, she is pretty close to being bedridden. it’s just around the corner. she barely remembers moment to moment, conversations go in loops, she makes up stories, she has sundowners, sometimes she thinks i’m her sister, develops obsessions about time/date/year/holidays. she’s stuck on the week of christmas. i don’t correct her and just reply simply. i basically know the drill regarding how to interact with her and i’ve read all about it on dementia websites. every once in a while, she will surprise me by having a good day.  &amp;#x200b;she’s pretty immobile without aid and a walker; she can barely see; her hearing is awful; she wears diapers as she is totally incontinent and sometimes has bowl movement accidents of all varieties; makes messes with food that are worse than a toddler would make; is constantly picking in her nose, mouth, ears, and eyes; she somehow gets literal shit under her fingernails; she has skin cancer lesions which ooze; her skin cells get everywhere like snow. she’s basically a biohazard. i spend so much time cleaning her and cleaning up her room/bathroom to deal with all of that. from changing her diapers, to dressing her skin lesions, to scraping under her fingernails. everything. i do it all. i do have sitters who watch her while i’m at work/school and i have cameras set up so that i can see her from my phone. however, my whole life basically revolves around her and her care. i can’t venture too far and have to consider her every need. i signed up for this, and i understood these were things i needed to do. it still isn’t very fun and is quite frankly frustrating. being caretakers yourselves, i’m sure you get that.   &amp;#x200b;the gross things do suck, but they don’t bother me as much as her personality. i can clean her messes all day, but it’s interacting with her that is the most exhausting thing to do. she yells at me for changing her diaper and tells me that i better make it quick. if i say one thing, she has to say the opposite. for example, if it’s her idea to go to bed…i will say “great, i’ll help you into bed.” then immediately she forgets it was her idea and says it’s too early to go to bed, and acts like i’m \*utterly ridiculous\* for bringing it up. another example of her personality is that i brought her to an adult day care so that she could get some social interaction. when it was over, she stated that she’s above all of those people and they’re all retards who are not capable of conversing with her on her level. honestly, she was the worst and oldest one there. i observed her from afar and she talked to no one. she just sat there chewing on some cookies by herself, looking lost. somehow she forgets every single thing, but remembers that one time i brought her there. when i suggest it again, she says they’re all too stupid for her. in other words, she’s extremely narcissistic and always has been. when i was younger, she would say similar things to me. if we were in a store and i said i liked something, she would say “i don’t much care for it. i have expensive taste, you know.” what kind of thing is that to say to your kid granddaughter? she’s just always been snooty with little self-awareness. she has to say “oh-pal” for opal, or “ad-ver-tiss-mint” for advertisement. she’s not from some fancy place, she’s from harlem.     pride is definitely her sin of choice. her hearing is on borderline deafness (she refuses hearing aids). instead of admitting that she can’t hear me, she says i pronounce things weird because i’m from florida and she can’t understand me. it couldn’t possibly be her fault. um, what? so i talk a little louder and slower (but in a neutral or nice manner), and she accuses me of yelling at her. another thing is she loves to play the victim. i’m surprised at how manipulative she can be despite her severe dementia. i’m not sure she actually formulates this consciously (because i cannot say it enough, her dementia is almost end stage) but it just seems to be ingrained in her. she makes up stories to suit her playing the victim to the two sons who do call. they don’t really care about or know me on a personal level, and they don’t believe she’s as advanced as i say. i’d like to say now that i know she has no idea what she’s saying or doing. it’s not her fault at this point. i do not treat her poorly, do not correct her, try to make things as easy as possible for her, am gentle with her. i genuinely feel bad for her and know that aging must suck ass. i always find myself feeling immense pity for her despite thinking she’s narcissistic. \*this leads to the whole point of me making this post…\*     today i put her on the phone with one son who talks to her a couple times a month, and usually she doesn’t talk too much shit about me which surprises me. she does talk shit about everyone else (her other sons, people she used to know, people she makes up). sometimes she talks shit about the son she forgets she’s on the phone with, lol. anyway, the point is that today i heard her say that she needs to move in with a better person because i’m not good to her. she was laying her victim story on pretty thick. this is the first time she’s said something like that. i honestly couldn’t help but feel super angry, knowing that i am basically sacrificing some of my youthful years for \*her\* after just losing my parents who i am still grieving for every single day. i change her disgusting fucking diapers, cater to her every whim, and i’m not good enough? i know she can’t help that she said that. i know she has no idea what she’s doing. but holy hell, did that piss me right off. i think it pisses me off so much because i know her son will think it’s true. then it will spread to the rest of the family who has no fucking business with us at all. i’m not really looking for advice on how to handle her because i do it all by the book despite the thoughts inside my head that i have expressed to you. but if anyone can relate, it’d be cool to hear about that. i hope i never get like that. that’s the scariest part about it all…we could end up just like them one day. if i get like that, i hope i’m one of those cute, old sweeties. i really don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings or be a burden. also, it kinda sounds like i'm playing a victim here and i get that i might sound hypocritical. please keep in mind that these are my thoughts and i don't usually express them.     tl;dr: after years of caring for her in all ways possible, gma with vascular dementia is starting to tell distant family over the phone that i’m basically not treating her well so that she can better play a victim. it upset me even though i’m aware she doesn’t know what she’s doing. also, aging sucks!

I don't know how much longer I can deal with being a caretaker...
tl;dr : 5 day/24 hour caretaker/full time online college student/mother/homemaker, frustrated with this life, unfairly angry at my grandma for her loss of simple routine behaviors and for treating me and my kids in an almost abusive manner.  i know it's the disease, but i am drowning just trying to stay afloat.this ended up super long and it's a vent... i hope it's allowed.  sorry for any offense i may cause...hey y'all,i have been lurking here for the better part of a year and i feel like such a shit person for not being as understanding to the disease as many of you are.  i am so frustrated with my (maternal) grandma.  i have been taking care of her in exchange for rent to my parents for the last 2 years and 4 months.  my dad, because he is retired, helps out a bit, but is not a fan of being a caretaker so he can be as difficult as my grandma.  i have been caring for her, taking her to her appointments, washing her clothes, making sure she is fed, that she is taking her medication, and most importantly answering her questions and assuaging her fears.  &amp;#x200b;she has just, within the couple of months, begun another decline where she is becoming less and less sanitary.  she is not showering properly or regularly, though i am constantly reminding her when she gets up to shower before getting dressed, and it has now come to me getting all her clothes ready and walking her to the bathroom, she will shower but not wash or miss something, or get out of the shower and put on dirty clothes because she forgot that i gave her clean clothes.  when she uses the toilet, she will do one of two things, use too much paper and the toilets get clogged, or revert to her youth and throw dirty paper in the garbage can.  i have a 4 year old, and having dirty paper in the bathroom is putting a strain on me that i never knew i would have.  i am constantly disinfecting and cleaning her accidents, and i am so tired and i cannot bring myself to sit in on showers with her, nor can my mother, who is a nurse and her daughter.  &amp;#x200b;another thing that is getting to me is that she has sticky fingers.  i am always finding other peoples' things in her possession.  i have a ring that my boyfriend gave me about 5 years ago, if i forget it in the bathroom, she takes it thinking its hers and she will hide it so no one steals it and then won't remember where she put it.  she tries taking pots and pans and bowls from the kitchen thinking they are hers, and when i gently remind her that they are in fact my mom's, she gets angry with me saying specifically "you don't know!"  in fact, this is what prompted my posting here, she said that a bowl she was eating out of was hers, though she never had a bowl similar to it in her life, and she got angry and started saying that i didn't know and i wasn't here when she brought it for salsa or menudo or something.  i told her today that what she was saying was very rude and she didn't have to be so rude to me, and she yelled at me that i was picking on her.  &amp;#x200b;i am a full time student, i have two kids, i am starting my first job in a long time in less than 2 weeks, and my aunts and uncles are resistant to helping out.  i have one aunt who takes her for a weekend once a month, my parents are 'on-duty' on the weekends, and i am 'on-duty' for the rest of the time.  while i know that having my rent taken care of is nice, it's not really taking money out of anyone's pockets for me to live in my parents' house rent free (it's always been the deal that if i am in school, i would have a place rent free), but i was (up until i was hired) contributing around $700 a month to the family in food and household necessities, so in a way i was paying my way.  my aunt (who takes her once a month) was controlling her money, paying her remaining bills and such, but barely giving me or my parents any of my grandma's money to care for my grandma.  we came to find out that she was woefully mishandling the money and my uncle (my mom and aunt's brother) has taken over the money and is now giving us exactly none.  probably because he is trying to fix what my aunt broke, but being told that i can't use her bank card to buy her medications or to pay for some groceries to feed her, is draining on everyone in my house.  &amp;#x200b;the problem i have is that i could over look all of this, if i liked her more. she wasn't the nurturing person that you would expect grandmas to be.  i remember being yelled at a lot, watching her hit my sister for being difficult, yelling at my grandpa who i loved dearly, and just kind of being there and loving out of obligation.  don't get me wrong, i love her, but i am finding it really difficult to like her, especially now that she is beginning to treat my daughter (who is diagnosed with add, depression, ptsd, and slight anxiety) like crap.  she will start yelling at her because my tween kiddo is trying to gently remind her that she shouldn't put \[someone else's item\] in her walker pouch but instead somewhere else, and my grandma will bite her head off.  about two weeks ago she shouted at my 4 year old son in his face because he got upset that she bumped into him.  i was pissed.  i grew up being yelled at and hit, then i was in an abusive relationship for 4 years that nearly killed me, so i am hyper-sensitive to these behaviors and i refuse to have my children know that life.  i don't know what to do anymore.  i am so frustrated that i sometimes want to throw her messes in her face and yell at her that we are not her servants.  i never will, and in fact, 90% of the time that i have these thoughts i have a conversation with my grandpa (who passed nearly 7 years ago) to apologize for thinking about treating her like that because i am mumbling under my breath about how angry i am at her and i believe that he can hear me.anyhow, thanks for reading if you read this all.  i am just really frustrated and i have no outlet where i can just release without sounding ungrateful or resentful to my family.&amp;#x200b;(according to [this]( she is at stage 6, only diagnosed with senile dementia.)

I don't know how much longer I can deal with being a caretaker...
tl;dr : 5 day/24 hour caretaker/full time online college student/mother/homemaker, frustrated with this life, unfairly angry at my grandma for her loss of simple routine behaviors and for treating me and my kids in an almost abusive manner.  i know it's the disease, but i am drowning just trying to stay afloat.this ended up super long and it's a vent... i hope it's allowed.  sorry for any offense i may cause...hey y'all,i have been lurking here for the better part of a year and i feel like such a shit person for not being as understanding to the disease as many of you are.  i am so frustrated with my (maternal) grandma.  i have been taking care of her in exchange for rent to my parents for the last 2 years and 4 months.  my dad, because he is retired, helps out a bit, but is not a fan of being a caretaker so he can be as difficult as my grandma.  i have been caring for her, taking her to her appointments, washing her clothes, making sure she is fed, that she is taking her medication, and most importantly answering her questions and assuaging her fears.  &amp;#x200b;she has just, within the couple of months, begun another decline where she is becoming less and less sanitary.  she is not showering properly or regularly, though i am constantly reminding her when she gets up to shower before getting dressed, and it has now come to me getting all her clothes ready and walking her to the bathroom, she will shower but not wash or miss something, or get out of the shower and put on dirty clothes because she forgot that i gave her clean clothes.  when she uses the toilet, she will

Helping my dad cope and easing his mind
this may get long, and i apologize for that, but i want to share my story in the hopes of helping others. my dad is in a care center (my mom has been deceased for 10 years) due to his dementia. he’s always been a bit forgetful at times but it became increasingly apparent that he could no longer be relied upon to adequately take care of himself. we found an amazing facility that has memory care and he is well taken care of. of course, he keeps saying he hates it there and has nothing to do, but when he doesn’t know we’re there and can see what he’s doing, he’s having fun with activities and chatting with others. on to the real reason i’m writing this. he grew up on a small farm with an older brother and sister. the sister is in another state and the brother is here in the same town. 15 years ago (when dad was still clear headed) my uncle went to the farm and burned the buildings down. the house, the barns, all of them. they were rotted and leaning, the cows on the property were pushing them over, it was just an unsafe situation. there was nothing salvageable when he did this and it truly was the right thing to do.  the past year or so my dad has been exceedingly distraught about this. he keeps saying uncle “bill” burned the buildings last week and he shouldn’t have because they were in great shape, they just moved off the farm! *i need to mention that my dad knows everything and everyone, it’s just all on the same time plane. he lives down the street from my brother, when i’m actuality they lived in the same street 35 years apart. he knows both events happened, just not that there was any time between them. he has been upset and we’ve told him that uncle “bill” burned them down 15 years ago but he fights that thought. so, i decided to ask why he was so upset. he said it was because “bill didn’t even ask for my permission to do it!”  i decided i needed to fabricate a story to make him feel at ease. the story facts now are as follows (to make them easier to follow and understand):-bill asked me if it would be ok to burn the buildings (false) which eased dad’s mind -bill looked at every piece of wood (false) and saved those that were salvageable (true) but he told no one but me (false) so only i have access to any of the old wood (false)what i did do was go to the lobby of hobbies and buy a small bundle of old barn wood slats. i then fashioned them into a [cross]( i told dad that this wood is from his original home and that anytime he looks at it he can remember that he still has a piece of home with him. he hasn’t had a single issue since. i don’t even feel guilty for lying. it has put his mind at ease. he is no longer agitated or upset with his brother (who is understanding and compassionate) and he has a “piece of home” with him. one thing i’ve learned, as long as the lie doesn’t physically harm them (causing agitation or discomfort), whatever we can say or do to keep them happy is fine. i know one lady in the center who “won the lottery” every day that i see her. we chat about how she’s going to spend her money. it keeps her happy and she enjoys it. who am i to crush her joy?

How do I address my mom's cognitive difficulties with her?
i am an only child in my forties, the daughter of a 71 year-old woman. my dad and my mom divorced years ago, so she's on her own. i live in chicago. she lives in florida. in addition to other health problems (bad knees, obese, afib, pre-diabetic, cannot walk for more than a few minutes), i think my mom is having some cognitive problems. i have suspected this for about a year but having just returned from a trip to madrid has raised the level of my concerns. on friday, we split up in a huge department store because she couldn't walk. we agreed to meet at starbucks in the basement, a place where we had spent fifteen minutes just a half hour before. at the meeting place, i couldn't find her. i waited about ten minutes. she finally arrived looking confused and said she'd gotten lost. she looked totally out of it but blamed her bad sense of direction. it's in the basement. we'd just been there. there's only one starbucks in the store. it happened again on sunday. we were on a walking tour of a small town. she was on her own because she couldn't walk the tour. she was instructed to meet at xxxx place. i was on my own after the tour and saw her sitting down looking confused/about to cry. again, she got lost and didn't even try to ask people for help. when i ask her for help like - please go ask that woman where the bathroom is - she just stands there looking around. she forgets things i literally just told her minutes ago. i must have said, at least a dozen times, "i've already told you that, mom." when we got home last night, she sent me a long email about how disrespectful i was, how i hurt her feelings, treat her like a child, etc. i think her feelings are valid. i know i need to be gentle but i am at my wit's end doing things for my mom she should be doing herself. she even admitted in that email that her mind isn't as sharp as it used to be so i think she *may* be aware that there is a problem. my mom had a career for forty years, has a master's degree and was a badass in her time. now all she does is watch television, read sometimes and eat. i guess my question is how do i discuss her cognitive issues with her? she's an extremely defensive, passive aggressive person in general and every time i address her health problems, she accuses me of treating her like a child (don't even get me started on her weight or immobility). i am open to any and all suggestions. if nothing else, i appreciate you listening. thank you.

Grandmother [94] with severe dementia
this is going to be a rant? or not i’m not sure. anyways.i’m 22 this year and i live with my grandma who’s 94 this year and her dementia is rapidly declining. my late grandfather who lived with me as well had alzheimers/parkinsons so my family knows first hand experience of the symptoms. he passed away when i was 18 and i don’t have many memories with him because we were just kind of distant despite living in the same house, and he was non-verbal for the last few years of his life.in 2016, grandma showed signs of dementia soon after grandpa’s passing. it wasn’t so bad,  there were times where she put detergent in her sugar bowl or ask where the younger version of me is. in june 2018, she had a severe attack of arthritis and her foot went through necrosis. when she had to get her foot amputated, it was like her memory just went from 75% to 50% during her stay at the hospital. it was painful for the family to watch her lose her memories but she was still talking and i would always talk to her when i’m not at school and eat breakfast with her. in addition, i would help change her diapers and shower her. my father is her primary caretaker, although the aunts would come over during the day (when my father is working). miraculously, her foot healed up really fast too and she was going strong albeit the loss of memory.about 2 weeks ago, my grandma suffered from a stroke and heart attack within 2 days, and now she is unable to sit up, talk, or even stay awake for 5 minutes. she could mumble a few words like going to the toilet, comb, sit, and eat, but she cant hold a conversation. her eyes don’t look straight anymore, only on occasion when she’s lucid. previously her left arm and leg were very weak but now there’s some movement. i was too optimistic that as a sign of recovery and that she’ll go back to her own self but mentally she hasn’t showed any progress. i’m so sad because i was the apple of her eye (my grandma has 10 kids.. too many grandchildren to count) and she raised me. although the middle parts are blurry i still cherish the moments with her when she’s most forgetful. i can’t bear to see her like this. i still try to talk to her everyday and feed her, i am a big believer of positive reinforcement and tell her i love her and say nice things to her everyday even if she might not be able to hear me.i feel so helpless. there’s no telling when she will go, but my heart just hurts thinking about her regression which was so sudden.

Possible early dementia and too mean to deal with
about six or seven months ago, my husband and i and our children moved in with my mom (66). she had been in not-so-great health for a while and showing occasional signs of cognitive decline. i am her only child and my dad died 25 years ago and she never remarried. before we moved in with her i missed her and worried about her all the time.shortly after we moved in, i started seeing more bizarre behavior. her forgetfulness was increasing but she could still work 2 days a week and pay her bills, things like that. but what was deeply troubling was her anger and hatefulness. this was new. she particularly hated my husband in a paranoid way, frequently insinuating that he was abusive to me and the kids, telling me lies about him (or things she remembered wrong? she sometimes confabulates real memories into composite memories that didn't happen. i don't know.) if he breathed wrong, she would take offense and sulk. i wasn't exempt- if i disagreed with her about anything, in the most casual and polite way, she'd sulk for days. she'd give the grandchildren (5 and 1) the silent treatment just to get at me. every other day, she was sulking and/or being nasty. one time she didn't like that we made the 5 year old finish his hot dog before he could have dessert, and she threw her entire dinner in the sink and wrote on the walls in sharpie. we only were able to live there for a few months when one day she started banging on the walls and calling my aunts &amp; uncles, telling them that we had basically taken over the house and that we were mistreating her, that we don't let her sit in her chair (????), and who knows what else. when my uncle came over she was screaming that i had yelled at her for cussing (she doesn't cuss and i don't mind cussing, this did not happen) and that i yelled at her about the garbage cans (this was a confabulation. 3 nights prior, i had told her i don't mind being the one to take the trash out, and that she shouldn't worry about it. later that night, she was being mean to my husband for no reason again, and i asked her to stop. but i didn't yell)so, she was having a crazy episode of fury and now all my extended family was involved, so my family and i grabbed some stuff and got an apartment, and did not go back. she called and left nasty messages a few times right after. we have seen her 1 time since then (that was december 30th), on my 5 year old's birthday. she acted as if nothing had happened, as if our entire relationship wasn't destroyed. i know she didn't forget, she just didn't want to talk about it. i am having a lot of trouble deciding how to look at this. on the one hand, she is not the mother i grew up with. she very obviously is dealing with some sort of decline. i know it's hurting her badly to be suddenly alone and to not see her grandkids. i feel for her in that her entire immediate family is gone and rarely speaks to her now, and she probably doesn't have an accurate memory of whyon the other hand, she's not so far gone that she's oblivious to reality. like i said, she can take care of her affairs, work 2 days a week, and intentionally keep herself together long enough to fool people who don't live with her. so she has awareness most of the time. and i can't stomach the way she treated me and my family when all we wanted was to be there for her. if she had a diagnosis or was so far gone that she was obviously obviously losing her whole mind, i would feel worse and get over my anger and try to help her. i don't know what to do. i don't want to be spiteful or cruel to someone who is sick, but i am just so disturbed. please help. ps: she will not ever go to a doctor. never. if i even tell her to get checked out, she will be so offended it'll be another fiasco.

Thoughts on my mother-in-law and her condition?
let me give you a little history. my mil is 87 years old with the usual list of aches and ailments for a person her age. she doesn't get around real well because of a bad back and arthritis. she has had some short term memory loss but she was still pretty sharp mentally but something changed in early january 2019. she had several recurring urinary tract infections that can cause confusion and overall weakness and fatigue. in early january she fell at the assisted living facilty where she lived and sent her to the emergency room. she was admitted to the hospital for several days to get her uti under control. during that stay she started seeing things that weren't there. squirrels running across the hospital floor and bugs on my wife. she was released to a rehab facility for therapy and more things continued. some days  she would talk without making much sense. she "went" to a birthday party for a friend and saw him and his family and told us all about it. the friend died 20 years ago. her cousin doris started "working" at the rehab facility. doris died 5 years ago. she physically got weaker and more unstable. after a couple of weeks she was released back to her assisted living facility. two days later she had a day where she spoke in nothing buy unintelligible gibberish. she was alert and carrying on full conversations in gibberish. that night she fell and broke her wrist so back to the hospital she went. she quit talking gibberish but became more pleasant but still talked abut all types of crazy stuff that made no sense. she was happy and most of all she was not cold and did not complain about any physical aches and pains. ts woman has been cold for decades and she always complains about how bad she hurts so this was a total change of personality. she was released from the hospital to a long term skilled care nursing facility where she continued to be happy and smile and talked nonsense but she wasn't cold and didn't complain. this state lasted for several days and then two days ago she became more coherent, started talking and making sense, started complaining about aher aches and got cold again. she was more like her old self than she had been in weeks. she had not been diagnosed with dementia or alzheimer's but we feel like something is going on in her head because of the changes i've described. have any of you ever seen similar symptoms in a family member or friend?thanks for your time.

Wondering how to confront / not confront Mom about issues
i really don't know where else to go with this, as i feel there are so many ethical &amp; moral issues going on here, so i searched "dementia" on reddit &amp; found this group. i've been reading your posts, &amp; i see you all have a very positive support system. i hope maybe some of you could help me get some perspective on things.my sister &amp; i recently brought my mother on a family trip to disneyland. she's not well traveled, so it was definitely overwhelming to her in many ways, but there was a lot of behavior that became quite noticeable &amp; difficult to ignore. in discussing it with each other, it's been like pulling a string that is starting to unravel a much bigger sweater, each of us noticing things that may have seemed a tad weird at the outset, but with more information seem much more troubling.firstly, our mother is single &amp; lives alone. we have all had a strained relationship for years, to varying degrees, as my mother can be very passive-aggressive, very codependent, &amp; in my unprofessional opinion a certifiable narcissist. everything is about her, &amp; as we've grown up &amp; gotten our own lives, it's been more &amp; more difficult for her to insert herself into our lives, as we've become thriving independent adults with families. that said, my sister &amp; i have been in therapy for some time (separately) &amp; have vowed to try &amp; maintain the best relationship possible with our mother, while not giving in to her dysfunctional behaviors. in an effort to paint as complete a picture as possible for you, i am going to just list some of the trouble behavior from this past year, in hopes that you may see what we're seeing as familiar to your experiences.\- about a year ago, she lost her job "due to cutbacks" that she had for 7 years. i put that in quotes because my sister knows two people who work for the same company that say she was let go due to poor attitude &amp; an unwillingness to learn a new computer system that was being implemented, but we have not confronted her on this, as we feel its not really worth the humiliation or the argument. she has told both of us differing stories about two other jobs that she has since secured but quit due to the employer changing the job description after she was hired. (same excuse for both jobs) the first job, i believe was a complete lie, as she couldn't recall or tell me anything about where the office was when asked. (sign or just bad behavior?), &amp; she on one occasion told me that they were very strict about using social media or phones during work hours, but would then send me im's &amp; be seen on facebook for long stretches of time when she said she was at work. the second job, was supposedly near my sister's house, &amp; she would drive by the office, never once seeing my mother's car in the small parking lot. she once drove by my mother's home when she said she was at work, &amp; she was home in the middle of the day. again, not confronted. a month later, she told us she was putting in her notice, but at that point we both knew she hadn't been working for weeks.\- at christmas time, i was home (i live a few hours drive away) &amp; at her house, &amp; remarked that she had all of her pictures down from the walls in her kitchen &amp; living room. she said she was preparing to repaint those rooms. it seemed weird because when i asked her what colors, she couldn't give me an answer, stammered, &amp; changed the subject. ten days later, she called to say that her friend, a realtor, had been over for coffee that day &amp; told her that people were asking about her home, &amp; if she'd consider selling it, &amp; that she agreed, so that afternoon she sold the house. i know how real estate works, &amp; i find it hard to believe that a house can be sold within two hours of deciding to sell it. i looked up the mls listing &amp; it had been on the market since the first of december. she has no reason that we know of to lie about selling her house. we didn't grow up there. she purchased it 3 years ago. it's a weird thing to be shady about.\-on our trip, during our 6 day visit, i found her packing her bags on three occasions. when i asked her nicely what she was doing, she said "i'm packing to make sure we're ready to go." i would tell her, again, as normal sounding &amp; nice as possible, that we weren't leaving the next day, to which she would pause &amp; then say "oh, well, you know, just in case then." it was awkward as she was clearly putting things away &amp; staging her luggage next to the door, ready to go.\-we noticed that she does not eat much or healthily. she has lost a lot of weight (maybe 25 lbs on a frame of 150 to start) that was kind of hidden by her wearing loose clothes &amp; layers. she would, on average, eat a half a muffin for breakfast with coffee, the other half of the muffin for lunch along with a couple of chicken nuggets or fries she'd share with one of the kids, and one or two cookies or a handful of raisins for dinner. she would go to bed around 7pm, reading until about 8pm, &amp; then be up at about 5-6am. we think she has an eating disorder, but she dodges any discussion about food. she got upset a few times when we'd say "oh, i think it's time to break for lunch" or the like, saying things like "i can't believe how much you all eat!" she is very uncomfortable eating in front of others, &amp; often will just say things like "my body just isn't used to eating so much food like you kids." we eat a normal three meals a day. i don't know if calorie starvation or eating disorder plays into this, or if one is causing the other.\-she seems confused often, doesn't understand the concept of normal everyday things, or becomes dismissive if she feels she is being asked to clarify. examples: (1)we went on pirates of the caribbean twice, once on two different days. later in the week, during our flight home, she told me that she thought it as nice they had two different pirate rides, so the line wouldn't be so long. confused by her comment, i asked her what she meant, &amp; she reiterated that she thought there were two different pirates of the caribbean rides. i told her that it was the same one, just on different days. she got slightly indignant &amp; changed the subject.(2) while on the trip, she came into the room holding her charging cord for her phone &amp; asked if i had an adapter for it. i asked her why, &amp; she said that she couldn't get the end to fit in the opening of her phone. she was holding up the wrong end of the charger, so i pointed out that the other, smaller end went into the phone, and the usb end went into the plug-in. she literally stared at it for probably 15 seconds before saying "oh, this must be a new cord!" &amp; going back to her room. she's had that cord &amp; phone set up since we got her the phone over two years ago. (again, not trying to humiliate, but seeing a pattern of confusion)\- i recently changed jobs (in september) &amp; during our trip she asked me on two different occasions if i was seeking work since being let go of my job. i told her i had work, had not been let go, but rather moved jobs on my own volition, explained what i was doing &amp; where i was working, &amp; she said things like "oh, that's right, sometimes i forget to listen to the details." i think she's confusing what happened to her &amp; her job situation, with me changing jobs.i know that these may be very anecdotally trivial, or perhaps there's a logical reason for all of the issues. where my sister &amp; i are concerned is how we can approach this with her, given that she is already very secretive, lives independently, &amp; is in denial that anything is wrong. her mother died from alzheimer's related complications about 12 years ago. she began developing the symptoms around the same age my mom is now, however, went undiagnosed for some time, as the doctors originally thought there was a circulatory problem that meant she wasn't getting enough oxygen to the brain. i can understand if she is terrified this is happening to her, &amp; probably doesn't know quite what to do herself, but if we bring up anything to do with health, or her forgetfulness or confusion she immediately becomes defensive, &amp; shuts down communication. again, we've not had the best relationship over the years, so sometimes it's hard to tell a cruel snarky remark from honest defensiveness over something she may be aware of. my sister in particular, is starting to be concerned about leaving her children for any unsupervised time with my mother, as she has admitted recently that she got lost driving to the store, which is in a neighborhood she's lived in for decades. (the apartment she recently moved into is in the same neighborhood as was the house she just sold, &amp; the same neighborhood we grew up in)so my ultimate question to you all is how do you feel we should approach this? be direct with her &amp; confront her with our concerns? ask her to see a doctor? ignore it &amp; wait for her to talk to us about it? slowly limit any unsupervised time, check in more often, hope for the best? it's just so complicated because of circumstances &amp; past, we really both just don't know where to begin. i'm hoping this resonates with anyone here, &amp; can at least give some advice on what worked for you.thank you for reading this!tl;dr how do we confront or not confront our mother about possible dementia?

Recording behavior
my mother is 90 years old. she started showing signs of dementia about two years ago. it started with short term memory loss but has now progressed to long term memory and sometimes volatile behavior. my 92 year old father is her caretaker and is able to manage most days. she is very frail and has had two bad falls in the last year, compression fractures in her back and most recently a fracture in her neck. she refuses to wear the braces for both. her pcp has it noted on her chart that she has dementia, but my mom denies everything and is usually behaving okay at her doctor appointment. until her last. i finally had a chance to talk to one of the doctors in private and was able to provide more details about her behavior at home with my dad. she is very verbally abusive to him and says terrible things to him, accusing him of trying to kill her. she hasn’t bathed in almost two months and denies this if i ask. she has moments of sheer terror and confusion. she is not on any meds for the dementia because she refuses to take her normal meds for blood pressure etc.. i live over 200 miles away but try to be there every 4-6 weeks. there is very little i can do when i am there especially since she is now treating me the same way she treats my dad.  we are trying to figure out a way to get her to sign a power of attorney document but we haven’t done this yet. she still seems to trust my brother so i’ve asked him to help, but i don’t feel confident that he will. she is constantly accusing us of wanting to put her away, but this is so not true. my dad is adamant about keeping her at home, and i agree as long as she is safe and allows him to care for her without risk to himself. she jokes about suicide and she also threatens to call the police and tell them lies to get her out of the house. i don’t think she would actually follow through on any of this, but she is so unpredictable. i’ve been thinking about recording her when she’s at her worst so that we have something to show the doctors. has anyone done this? if yes, do the doctors take it seriously? she needs to see a dementia specialist but her doctor has yet to give her a referral. i know i’ve rambled a bit, but any advise would be greatly appreciated.

Not sure what to do, anyone else had similar experiences?
i'm keeping things a little vague here for anonymity.  i'll try keep it short, but it'll probably be long.tl;dr: my partner has always had a good memory, now he's been randomly mis-remembering or forgetting stuff, now he's decided an important life event was entirely different from the way it really was.  any advice?i've been with my partner over 20 years, he's in his late 40's now.  for a long time, he had a fantastic memory, he could tell people what they said or did in a certain situation from several years prior with total clarity.  he was known among his friends for this.i know as we get older things change, your memory and capacity for retaining things also changes.  but i'm actually starting to worry now about his memory and if it's the start of something bigger.  i don't think i'd be so concerned if i hadn't had the history i have with him and know he was always good with his memory.small things mostly, like we will have a conversation about something that needs to be done around the house, or a place we need to go.  it's all sorted then and there, then a day later he's asking me what is happening with it "just to make sure we're on the same page" and we have to go through the whole thing again. sometimes more than once.  i'll admit it's happened often enough that when it occurs i do get a bit annoyed, but it's not happening every time, just every now and then. apart from that he'll randomly just decide things that aren't true.  for example one time my ds was getting ready for bed, when partner asked him to come do something with him.  he got agitated when ds said he shouldn't, as it was his bed time, and repeatedly tried to tell him it wasn't for another half an hour, specifying a time.  ds had had the same bed time for almost a year.   there have been more than a few instances of very similar things over the last year, but again they're not over hugely important stuff.last night i really had to do a double take though.  we were chatting about various things, and he mentioned he told a work colleague of his how we originally got the money for a deposit for our first house.  it was so far from what we actually did i couldn't believe he was serious.  the incident he talked about happened a year after we bought our home.  i know exactly what happened with it as there were several key events tied to it that i had to keep a very close eye on.  he's actually mentioned the incident to someone else once a few years ago and told them something else he reckons was done with the money which again was in no way what happened, but it wasn't a time to bring it up and i let it go.i did stop him briefly and say, no we did x to save for a home, because y was also involved with it.  z didn't happen until way after we moved there.  he looked at me, literally said "whatever" (not in an angry way, just like i was interrupting his story) and moved on to the second part of his story.he's not an angry person but he's very.......pedantic about being right, and really doesn't like when anyone points out to him that he's remembering incorrectly or that we've been over the conversation before.  he's said that he thinks his crazy work schedule affected his sleep and memory a while ago, but that job finished a few years ago and he's had a normal routine since then, and has no trouble sleeping.has anyone else had a parent or partner start showing signs of changing like this relatively young?  how do you cope,what steps did you take to find out whether they're just a bit forgetful (and maybe it is still related to his work from years before??) or if it's something serious?

Not sure how to deal with the fact that my mom have early onset dementia (possibly)
sorry if my post is a bit incoherent and long, it is 3am here and i'm in bed with my phone as i can't sleep. just going to write whatever is on my mind and edit later.  i'm not sure what replies or advice i'm looking for but there is no one i can talk to irl and i guess i just need a listening ear. so i am an international student and i'm not home often. yesterday, i got a message from my sister telling me that she is going to take my mom to the doctors for an official diagnosis. this news can't come at a worst time as i am not home when all of this is going down during the biggest holiday of the year (chinese new year). growing up, my mom always had bad memory and a hard time processing what is being said to her (she has adhd, depression, dyslexia, bpd and other learning disabilities). we would tell her a story and it would take her several tries to get it or to follow the storyline and there's a high chance she will forget most of it later, at least the details anyway. she has a hard time pronouncing words as english is not her first language and would quickly forget whatever is taught to her, even something as simple as learning to use facebook even if we taught her repeatedly. so for a long time, we always thought that it was just her normal self. but the past year (according to my dad and brother), she actually forgot her way home a few times, made late credit card payments or paid bills more than once, lost her phone twice in a week, swears she brought her wallet out only to find it at home later.despite all the difficulties she has, this is not normal behaviour even for her. my mom is trying to chalk it up to side effects of her anti depressants and bpd meds but i'm extremely worried and so is the rest of us. i know that our family do have a history of alzheimer's which is confirming my worst fears. if it is officially true, i don't know what i am going to do. i love her so very much even though we are apart a lot due to my overseas education from when i was 16. even if i say it very rarely or don't show my love often, i do love her and i wouldn't know what i'm going to do when things get worst. i don't want her to be alive but not mentally present, i don't want her to not remember me, i don't want her lose her memories of us. i don't want her to forget that we love her very very much and that she love us too. i don't want to put her in a home, i don't want to watch my dad watch her slip away, i don't want her to forget that she love to cook, to drive, to paint, to do all the things she love doing now. i don't want her to lose all of that. i just love her so much and i'm not sure if i can handle it. i'm lucky that i have 2 other siblings but as the oldest i would have to take charge. i love her but i love living where i am right now and i know i will have to move back and i don't want to secretly hate her for making me give up my life for her even she did sacrifice everything for me. i don't know what my sister will do if she loses her memories and language skills. they already have a hard time communicating as my sister is english educated and my mom knows a limited amount of broken english.before her diagnosis of bpd, she would go into episodes of crying, screaming and risk taking behaviour. she drove into a road divider once. i was 16 and scared. my dad was in denial and having an affair. i escaped overseas using education as my excused to run as far as i could, abandoning my younger siblings to take care of her. i'm not sure if i will be strong enough this time for them and to take charge. i might possibly hold a grudge that i have to go home. i'm feeling so confused, upset and guilty....  for my possible resentment, for being selfish for not spending more time with her.  i love her very much, i'm just not sure if i'm strong enough to handle it.

Dementia is making everything harder for everybody and we need help.
my fiance lives with his nana. she recently (the past 8 weeks) began developing severe dementia.in september she was having old age aches and pains and showed an interest in possibly having help or moving into a home, so fiance organized a visit with a home care nurse. the home care nurse said she was doing so well that she did not qualify for home care and her dementia assessment came back with basically nothing out of the ordinary.in late october her eldest child and only son (fiance's uncle) was diagnosed with a brain tumor. this is when everything went downhill... he was released from the hospital after about a week and, while he continues chemo, he is doing fantastically.but i think the damage was done to nana? in december, she has quirks:- she thinks there are two of my fiance and gets annoyed when "that other one" does not come home and she puts food in the fridge labeled for both of them- she tells me about how "fiance and digimountain are getting married" and then refers to me as digimountain but does not connect me to the one getting married- she forgets to eat- she can no longer use an oven or stove- she only eats leftovers &amp; meals in the fridge that we make for her if we plate them and label them with her name and a meal- she has a day planner and she obsessively reviews it again and again for the upcoming month, but does not remember any of the information she has read seconds later - i don't know if she knows she is doing this or if every time she looks at it she thinks it is new information- she chooses to sit in her chair and sleep all day instead of doing things she usually enjoys - phoning people, reading, watching television, cooking...- she seems depressed - says she is lonely when fiance is not there, says no one visits her (she has had a lot of visitors lately so this is weird?), says she would rather just sleep than see people, and that kind of thing- she mentions two little girls (fiance has two younger sisters so maybe them?) who she has to make lunches for but does not seeanyways... fiance has been dealing with this mostly on his own, but about four weeks ago uncle visited and was shocked. fiance was in a full time practicum and could not miss as much as was required for doctors appointments and things for nana, so uncle and him worked together to get her to a clinic. she has has blood tests (clean) and got a cat scan a week ago (no results yet). she had a homecare nurse in for a second assessment and now has someone to give her her medications every morning and the possibility for a cleaner twice a month. but this isn't enough.i help fiance as much as i can. i really do. but it is getting to be so much. i feel as though there is a nana-shaped wedge between us. i know he is stressed out about it and so am i. according to target theory i am supposed to be taking his stress and passing it outwards but it is so hard because we're so close and share everything and he carries stress better than i do anyways... i have been trying so hard.but i am on the verge of a serious meltdown. to add to this, my future mother-in-law hates me... and she is nana's poa. so she is more involved now and it has been hell.in the time it took to write this post my meltdown began... i am secondary in fiance's life. nana is and always will be number one. she came first. i want her in a home. for the sake of my relationship.how? i need help.

[Vent] Xmas, with my grandfather, and without my Mother
how is everyone doing? personally i find the holidays a very difficult time.my mother has had severe dementia for 3 years. alzheimer's. it was initially a slow but obvious decline for 5 years and 3 years ago my mom moved her to a nursing home (she has since moved because, although her dementia is severe, she is still very mobile and a bit of a liability). she forgot who her family were and who her husband was, but she remained the gentle, caring soul i had always known. during family get togethers (3+ years ago) she would get anxious and want to go home where she felt secure. she was always so gentle with her dog, and asked after "the gentleman" when my grandfather would pop out to the shops. when i visited her in her nursing home, she made a connection that she knew me, and when we visited her room she brought to me over a photo of my sister and i as young children and in private asked, "how is the little one," and "i'm happy to see you." she squeezed my hand so tight. i am very aware it's easy to dismiss these comments as part of the dementia but i choose to believe we connected during that visit. my mom said as much in the car and i cried. happy tears. it was special. we call her "mother" because, when my mom has kids, she was not ready to be a grandmother. so sorry if there's confusion there (but, like, not really. i have my mom and my mother). her husband (my grandfather) is fortunately still with us and has all his faculties. i feel for him, really i do, and i have been told he loves her and visits her often. however, he has been in a relationship with a widow for over a year now and is spending huge amounts of time and money on his new lady, which my mom hates. we are happy he has found happiness, but there is a lot of resentment about how he has moved on to this new woman. she has a family of her own and very little time for our family, and is disrespectful to our mother - my grandfather's girlfriend wanted to go and meet her, before the family stepped in!i haven't seen my mother is a year and it tears me apart. i had a positive experience last visit, but my family have warned me not to visit her now. mother is functional but too far gone. i'm very torn. how are you all feeling with christmas coming?

i recently found this subreddit and i’m hoping to pull support and well as support others going through similar situations. i just needed a place to vent and clear my thoughts. please let me know if this isn’t right place. my grandma was diagnosed with both dementia and alzheimer’s back in the late 1990s. i understand how lucky my grandma and my family are that she didn’t show tell-tale signs until 2008-ish. my whole life, my grandparents helped raise me and my three siblings. my father’s house was conveniently next door to them. my brothers and i loved it! eventually, my grandma wanted to move 6 hours north of where we lived. their home would be in the middle of no where. we simply thought they wanted to spend their golden years in a area similar to both of their home states. when we would go up for visits, we realized she was having more and more difficulty in the day to day. she would feed her mini-horses 5 or more times because she would simply forget. it  would get worse. she wouldn’t follow a conversation and get frustrated. as a young child, i didn’t know much and i got frustrated with her. a cardiac event in 2016-ish caused her and my grandpa to move back to the city. she was flown from her property to the hospital near her. it could have been much worse. we are forever grateful this was done before the golden hour was up. unfortunately, things got worse. in december 2016, i remember getting a call from my aunt, explaining a terrible incident that had happened. i had to rush over to practically baby-sit my grandma. my grandpa desperately needed a break. skip to the next week, we had no choice but to place her in a group home. she had completely forgotten who her husband was. it was now a unsafe place for him. she believed he was a terrible man, doing terrible things to her. my grandpa was a sweet, caring man. i saw her occasionally but it wasn’t enough. i kept kicking myself to see her but it was so rough. i couldn’t do it. i just couldn’t. my grandpa’s health was worsening too. he was in and out of the hospital all throughout 2017. unfortunately he passed in january 2018, just shortly after his 79th birthday. it was rough and my own resentment to myself was only getting worse. i did not see her from early 2017 to literally today. i forced myself to drive to her. her group home is in my own neighborhood. i’m so glad i saw her. she remembered my face and we talked about whatever she wanted. of course, the conversation didn’t flow but i didn’t care. i was with my grandma. i couldn’t believe i had forgotten what her face looked like with her wrinkles, how her blue eyes shined bright when she was happy. i realize i am lucky to have her remember me and i promised to her i will see her more often.

i recently found this subreddit and i’m hoping to pull support and well as support others going through similar situations. i just needed a place to vent and clear my thoughts. please let me know if this isn’t right place. my grandma was diagnosed with both dementia and alzheimer’s back in the late 1990s. i understand how lucky my grandma and my family are that she didn’t show tell-tale signs until 2008-ish. my whole life, my grandparents helped raise me and my three siblings. my father’s house was conveniently next door to them. my brothers and i loved it! eventually, my grandma wanted to move 6 hours north of where we lived. their home would be in the middle of no where. we simply thought they wanted to spend their golden years in a area similar to both of their home states. when we would go up for visits, we realized she was having more and more difficulty in the day to day. she would feed her mini-horses 5 or more times because she would simply forget. it  would get worse. she wouldn’t follow a conversation and get frustrated. as a young child, i didn’t know much and i got frustrated with her. a cardiac event in 2016-ish caused her and my grandpa to move back to the city. she was flown from her property to the hospital near her. it could have been much worse. we are forever grateful this was done before the golden hour was up. unfortunately, things got worse. in december 2016, i remember getting a call from my aunt, explaining a terrible incident that had happened. i had to rush over to practically baby-sit my grandma. my grandpa desperately needed a break. skip to the next week, we had no choice but to place her in a group home. she had completely forgotten who her husband was. it was now a unsafe place for him. she believed he was a terrible man, doing terrible things to her. my grandpa was a sweet, caring man. i saw her occasionally but it wasn’t enough. i kept kicking myself to see her but it was so rough. i couldn’t do it. i just couldn’t. my grandpa’s health was worsening too. he was in and out of the hospital all throughout 2017. unfortunately he passed in january 2018, just shortly after his 79th birthday. it was rough and my own resentment to myself was only getting worse. i did not see her from early 2017 to literally today. i forced myself to drive to her. her group home is in my own neighborhood. i’m so glad i saw her. she remembered my face and we talked about whatever she wanted. of course, the conversation didn’t flow but i didn’t care. i was with my grandma. i couldn’t believe i had forgotten what her face looked like with her wrinkles, how her blue eyes shined bright when she was happy. i realize i am lucky to have her remember me and i promised to her i will see her more often.

I'm looking for a secret video camera to record what i believe are carers abusing my elderly friends trust and care.
over recent months my friend/uncle has had home carers 5 times a day. i've been coming in everyday, and noticed they fill out the care book sometimes about times when i know their not there. on some occasions stating they are there for times in the future. one day i suspected they filled out the entire previous days logs without ever being there.  my friend just recently came out of hospital for seizures, because a receptionist at the doctors cancelled his seizure medication because he failed to attend a review 2 months before he then has massive seizures. 2 months of no seizure medication which he has be on for a number of years. he has dementia/alzheimers for pity's sake he forgets to attend appointments, and how on earth was a receptionist even allowed, even by accident to delete medication from his repeat prescription.no one noticed this, the doctors, pharmacy, or even the carers who were meant to be giving him oral liquid seizure medication 5 times a day. these carers are a private company paid for by the state. his children who are my age live too far away to be there everyday. i live close by and try to visit everyday. i've noticed many discrepancies in the care package. yesterday another new person turned up who my friend had never seen, i was there. the carer knew nothing about his medication. new carers come in sometimes i've caught them just sitting on the phone watching videos. i've turned up at times to a totally new carer and they havent even recorded me being there, not even asked my name. i could be anyone.sorry if this all sounds strange im just a bit stressed from keeping an eye on my uncle and watching him not only deteriorate but have what i see as elderly abuse for lack of caring. i'd like for some suggestions especially if someone has already done this, for some sort of spy camera, it doesn't have to be ip/wifi enabled or anything. just good quality recordings, with time stamps. it needs to be able to record for 24 hours at least. hopefuly on an sd card that i can swap out everyday and go through the recordings to check the times of carers and whether they give him his medication regularlry. his children are all ok with the recordings, they are as frustrated as i am. btw i live in the uk

so i have posted before about my father and his dementia and his gambling problem.  he totally messed up his pension and social security because he spent all of his money at the casino and of course he doesn’t remember that.  i finally got his accounts fixed and able to set an account for his spending money.  he’s always, dementia people do, always harping that someone’s stealing his money. i’ve been told that if they at least see it sometimes it will put that worry away for sometime. so i gave him his atm card 2-3 weeks ago. he forgot about it.  then this week, he remembered about it. saw his spending money and withdrew all of it. so now it is sitting in his hidey hole. thanksgiving he was itching to leave the house, but we got him to stay put. yesterday he said he want to go to his friend’s house. we let him, but all of us knows where he’s going. he took $100 to the casino. he never tells us where he’s really going (thank goodness for gps). so he’s not allowed to leave the house when no one’s going to be home. so this morning, he gets up bright and early gets dress and plans to head back to casino. he takes another $60 from his hidey hole.  so we try to stop him. he tells us that he’s going to philadelphia to see his best friend. we asked him if he bought his ticket. of course he didn’t. then he has a fit when we volunteer to go with him. this always deters him from going to the casino as he doesn’t want us with him. why the casino is bad? he gets there, spend his whole months allowance in 2 days and then for the rest of the 28 days in the month he has is accusing everyone that someone’s stealing his money. when he is there, he does not eat. he loses weight soo fast that 2 days he can lose 5-10 pounds. he comes home hagard and in a horrible mood.  there is one time i forgot to move his social security and he blew that money in 2 days. then we have to  deal with that personality for a whole month. he’s currently threatening to move out. he can’t be locked up like a prisoner. we can’t give him keys cause he keep losing them. that’s why he not allowed to go anywhere when no one’s home. someone will have to let him in house.  bit once someone is home he can go. however, when we hear the lie (going to play dominoes in queens, going to hang out with a friend) we try to deter him.  but this cycle is damned if you do damned if you don’t. most of his friends know there’s something wrong with him. his closest knows that he has dementia but some of the rest don’t know but can tell something is off but they humor him and take him so seriously. his sister has full blown alzheimers and he thinks 9/11 caused it.  he doesn’t believe he has dementia but just getting old with some forgetfulness. there has been only 2 incidents where he got turned about and couldn’t find his way home. someone had to get him. my father refuses to go to an adult daycare  service. we can’t afford a homecare person on his social security. my dad did nothing to prepare for his old age. i am waiting for his medicaid to come thru but it’s been a year. i am going to have to apply again. this sucks.  taking care of a dememtia person who has a gambling problem is the pits. thank you for listening. i had to vent.

Undiagnosed, but concerned.
hey guys. my aunt (63) has started acting a bit strange within the past year or so. it started as her losing her train of thought in the middle of a conversation, but she laughed it off as getting old. however, last christmas things started to go south. she ended up showing up to christmas dinner 5 hours late because her and my uncle got into a fight about missing presents, even though none were missing. when my aunt finally showed up, she appeared confused, agitated and could barely stand. she is on several medications for migraines, depression, diabetes etc, so we thought it might’ve been a bad mixture of meds. my uncle promised that he was going to take her to the doctor as soon as they got home to get things situated. my aunt went to the doctor shortly after christmas , and her medication dosage was adjusted. things started to appear better, but shortly after, things began to go slowly downhill. she became increasingly paranoid. she thought that every conversation that she wasn’t apart of was about her. she forgot basic things, and got easily agitated if something in her routine went wrong (shower curtain fell down, laundry is wrinkled etc). my uncle has been doing his best to keep her calm and comfortable, and things once again just kept getting better, and then worse over and over again. fast forward to a few days ago, and things have escalated. she now thinks my uncle is hiding money from her (he’s not), and has been tearing apart the house and the car in attempts in finding the missing cash. my mom and my aunt are very close, so she went down to be with my aunt. my mom more than likely did not help the situation as they tend to feed off of each other’s anger, so my uncle decided to stay with his brother for a few days to give my aunt some space. my mom is stays with her. today, i got a call from my mom. my aunt woke my mom up from nap, and started screaming at her about the laundry. my mom got up, and followed my aunt to the laundry room where my aunt proceeded to throw laundry at my mom yelling at her to hang it up. my mom refused to tell me the rest of what had happened. my mom was hysterically crying - almost hyperventilating. i asked if there was something i could do. she said no. i then asked if she was safe. my mom said “i think so”. i asked what can we do to help my aunt, and she replied with “i don’t know”. my mom then said, “i have to go. if your aunt sees me on the phone, she’s going to be furious”, and then hung up. the conversation worried me, but my mom texted me shortly after saying that she was going home tomorrow. i’m worried that my aunt is going to be alone (not sure when my uncle is coming back), and i’m incredibly worried about my aunts health. i know this could be something else, but my brain keeps on coming back to dementia. my grandma had it, and this is all looking too familiar. my aunt has been refusing to go to any doctors for the past month or so as she doesn’t trust them, so we can’t even figure out what is really going on. is this her meds, or something more serious? i don’t know what i can do to get her the help that she needs, dementia or not. sorry for the novel, and sorry if this is not the right place. i just hate seeing my aunt like this, and i feel helpless. any advice on what i can do will be greatly appreciated. sorry for words or formatting. i’m on mobile.

Possible health causes for memory problems?
so i don't really know where to ask, i live rurally and the dr feels other health issues are the priority. so i'll ask you guys.i have a family member in their 50's suffering from various memory failures. including the common ones like forgetting words (and sometimes unable to even describe what we are looking for), forgetting names, people, events. remembering things happening that never happened, but maybe were talked about. most of it is short term problems though they have lost a lot of their ability to recognize things from the past (though we can recall fine on our own at a different time).the most striking issue though i can't find any information on because i can't think of how to phrase it so a search engine gives me relevant results. this family member frequently (multiple times a week) swaps their memory recollection of recent events. for example i might say "it's cold outside" and they might say "no it's not cold at all". but an hour later they will ask me why i told them it's not cold outside. when i tell them i did tell them it was cold outside, they will tell me that they said it was cold out and i told them it wasn't. this has even happened with things like ideology. maybe they say god is a woman, i say god is a dude (this is just an example i'm agnostic lol), the next day they will ask me how i can possibly believe god is female when clearly he is a dude. no matter how much i explain that they said god is woman they recall it reversed. even though if they stop to think about it they should be able to recognize that it's not something they would ever say, they can't. even if it's completely at odds with everything they know or believe. the false switched memory is dominant.it's very weird. does anyone have any ideas about cause? it seems to be a very specific problem that i haven't seen before and i have experience with alzheimer's and dementia. any help would be great so i can take something to the doctor to use as a jumping off point to deal with this. my family member keeps arguing we should record the conversations, which i have considered (they refuse to believe they are remembering it reversed). but i don't particularly think it will help (it might hurt) to shove it in their face they are wrong, so for the most part i have just started conceding and telling them they are right because i don't want to fight about it. and even if i played a recording back they would just remember it as confirming they were right the next day even though it wouldn't lol.

Concerned that grandmother has dementia but unsure?
my family has been taking care of my grandmother (85 years old) for about 3 years now. she displays frequent bouts of confusion and paranoia and i'm not sure if she has dementia. i know that symptoms of dementia vary by patient but i'm just curious if this sounds like dementia to people with experience?&amp;#x200b;my grandmother has been living with us since my grandfather passed away about 3 years ago. technically she has her own apartment but refuses to sleep there alone because she is "afraid". at first, she spent the days at her place and my parents picked her up around 6\~7 pm after work since she hated being alone after the sun went down. &amp;#x200b;she's just gotten worse and worse about being alone since then and now takes the bus to our house at noon every day. it would be one thing if it was just that but her paranoia has been a constant. she often makes us drive her back to her place to "check" on various things: her rice cooker, the stove, the faucet, the windows, the lights, the list goes on and on. she has good days sometimes but other days she expects us to drive her to her place (a 30 minute drive each way) 3-4 times a day. if we refuse she will start crying and say that she will die otherwise or say that if we don't take her then she'll just walk there. she's alienated all of her friends back at her apartment complex because she calls them 6-8 times a day about whether her door is locked/her lights are off/etc. &amp;#x200b;the biggest incident was in late 2016 where she was very anxious about her rice cooker being plugged in. she had already driven back to her house 2-3 times that day to check herself. my father went with her and checked as well. we all knew it was not plugged in. our family was going to a movie and she pulled me aside and asked if my boyfriend and i could drive her back to her place to check. i told her no since we were literally standing inside the theater and had already bought tickets. as soon as the movie ended she started causing a scene in the parking lot and threw herself onto the ground and said we had to take her to her apartment or she would die right then and there. when we got to her place, her rice cooker was clearly unplugged. i even put my hand inside the cooker and found it to be cold - it hadn't been plugged in all day. but she insisted that it had been left plugged in and that it was a good thing we came back because otherwise her apartment would have burned down. &amp;#x200b;there haven't been any public tantrums since then but she has paranoia episodes at least 3-4 times a week. and she constantly lies about appliances being left plugged in. she recently taped her light switches to the off position because she's convinced that they randomly turn on in the middle of the night. (she spends the night at my house. she wouldn't even be home at her place to see the lights turn on.) her apartment management told her that this is a fire hazard and she should take the tape off but she thinks they are lying to her. &amp;#x200b;she's always convinced that people are lying to her. i travel out of state very frequently for business reasons and often take my mother with me. we try to tell our grandmother about these trips way in advance so she can make accommodations about going to stay with our cousin or at the very least be mentally prepared for our absence. but she always forgets all the times we let her know (and it's usually multiple times, more frequently as it gets closer to the date) until like a couple of days before our departure. then she's convinced that we didn't let her know beforehand or she thinks that we had lied about leaving earlier just to get rid of her. &amp;#x200b;i've read that change in personality might be a symptom of dementia but the thing is that my grandmother has always been a very stubborn and rather self-centered person. she grew up fairly affluent and powerful and still thinks that she has the social privilege from an old world class system. she is neither rich nor powerful now. i'm not sure how much of this is her personality and how much of this is an actual illness. my mother is considering taking her into see a doctor to see if this is really dementia. is there anything we should prepare beforehand? i apologize for the long-winded post. she's been putting a huge strain on my immediate family and i'm not sure what to do at this point anymore. my mother broke down and cried in front of me today after my grandmother insisted on going back to her apartment for the umpteenth time. i'm just really tired and would love any input/guidance you may have to give. &amp;#x200b;

[Norway] I don't know what to do for my dad (64 yo).
on the 21st of april this year, my dad was hit by a car. near that time, he also suffered a double brain hemorrhage. afterwards, he has been permanently bedridden, and according to staff refuses to cooperate on physical therapy...we're told that, on top of physical injuries, he's suffering from fairly severe dementia now. however, i feel he has been deteriorating rapidly *after* being admitted, and i feel like something needs to be done to help.but right now, i don't know what i can do.what has stood out to me is that, initially, he seemed receptive to therapy. he had episodes of being, in a word, horrible to those around him, but he seemed to be earnest and stubborn about getting back on his feet.but little by little, he seems to be shrinking. firstly, his weight seems to be dropping like a rock in a bottomless well. it stood out to me most when he was moved to a different department temporarily because of blood test abnormalities, and i spent hours with him.secondly, he used to speak pretty well after he was admitted. his voice was a bit, err, gravel-like, but he spoke up confidently. now, he seems to mumble and whisper.thirdly, while he seemed receptive to training initially, he now seems to want to do nothing but curl up and hide. it's always uncomfortable, it's always painful, and so on.and, once more, i don't know what to do about it. * i'm trying to be there when i can for him, but it doesn't seem to do much. * if i'm in a bad mood i try to avoid being there - i want to infect him with good moods, not bad times, but it's becoming hard. i had him in a wheelchair for the first time recently, and i was trying to not cry the entire time.* i got him a radio, hoping staff would help him listen to music now and then - especially since he seemed to take an interest in having the television on when that was available. help. i don't know what to do. ask away. give suggestions. i'll try to follow here best i can.----before i forget, to summarize his current health:* after a brain hemorrhage in 1999 he had severely reduced function in his left side. these are part of the problems now - he seems to forget that they're there frequently.* after said hemorrhage he also suffered from epilepsy. it would not give him violent seizures, but i think it brings him close to fainting. he becomes horribly lost and confused when it triggers. * his epilepsy is triggered by quickly flashing lights - he can watch tv, but he could never work with cad because of intermittent refresh rates. it is also triggered by noises - noises like refrigerators, "kid shows" (esp. loud voices) on tv, stuff like that.* he's always been a scavenger. if there was food in the house, whatever the hell it was, he could devour it without thinking. as a sprinter right up until the last few years, this wasn't even a dent in his weight. in fact, he struggled to keep his weight up.i think that's all for now. thanks for any responses. i'll try to answer questions best i can.

Questions about the possibility of Demetria/Alzheimers.
hello! i wasn't sure if this reddit was the  appropriate place to find others thoughts on the situation, but i  figured it was a start.a few things to start:i cannot convince her to go to a neurologist or talk to her doctor about this.my mother is 66she also had a recent bout with cancer and is now cancer free.my father is across the country and they do not have a talking relationship(divorced for 20 years)i live with my mother, because i had to assist her with the house and other things while she had her cancer.my grandmother had alzheimers.i do not believe she has had neurological exam in probably 20+ years....so, as i said my mother is 66 this year.over  the past 6 years, i've noticed an extreme change in her personality  from a easy going, loving mother to a demanding, disrespectful and  possibly dishonest person.its not as if it was a sudden thing, its something i noticed more and more as the years go on.i've  sat her down and talked to her about the disrespect shes shown me, and i  asked her to be more respectful and she had apologized and said she  would try better, so long as i respected her. but either she has  forgotten our conversation or simply does not care. her attitude to  others but to mostly myself and my fiance has taken a completely  different turn, even though we have done nothing but care for her, and  have done as she has asked of us the past few years.as  for her forgetting things.. obviously forgetting things is something  that just comes with age, but subtle things like her putting away,  clearly very dirty dishes into the cabinets, frequently leaving the gas  stove burner on and walking away, leaving and forgetting food in the  oven that is on, and on a few occasions forgetting some short  conversations.i remember i asked her to  leave the lights on outside for us, as we had gone out for the evening  and she didn't. but when i asked her about why she turned them off, she  seemed to think we hadn't been home all day, and never talked to  her.(this has happened on 2-3 occasions as i remember)..my mother is not proficient with tech, but i have shown her how to upload an attachment to an email many many times.but  she cannot seem to remember me showing her, or cannot remember a single  step of how i did it even though i've walked her slowly through it many  times(she was somewhat good with tech in her past, not great but could  figure out how to do this sort of thing..)she  constantly argues with me, it doesn't matter if i'm right or wrong, or  if shes right or wrong, everything is an argument, and she constantly  raises her voice and yells even if i am just making a suggestion or  offering a solution. this is completely unlike what she used to be.she  also used to be a very clean person, always wanting to keep a clean  house and kitchen.  but lately, within the last year she has just  started leaving her dishes on the counters and leaves garbage on the  floors. this is so unlike my mother because she used to always throw a  fit if the kitchen or house was messy.i  have taken up most of the cleaning. i have asked her if she could start  putting her dishes in the dish washer after she ate, instead of leaving  them out and she was absolutely livid with me for suggesting it. saying  that the dishes were obviously not hers, and that i left them there. (i  did not) i am a very clean person when it comes to kitchens, and i feel  disgusted when i see it dirty.i  could go on about how forgetful i've been noticing her becoming or how  her entire personality seems to be different in one way or another,  obviously the easy answer for this would be for her to talk to her  doctor about this, maybe even a neurologist but she has refused to talk  to a doctor, or mention it to her doctor.my question is:what should i do? i have no idea how to go about this anymore since everything leads to a fight.do  you think i should be concerned about something like alzheimer or  dementia? or does this just sound like age and stress is getting to her?i  love my mother, i do. but over the last year she has been a source of  never ending stress. it always seems like she wants to pick a fight, or  just hates me. its just so unlike how she used to be that has me  worried.i wasn't a perfect child not  even close, but i've not done anything to warrant her being so  confrontational all the time to me. and when i have asked her why, she  just says she doesn't know what i'm talking about and that she isn't  acting confrontational with me.i know  the fighting could end by me simply moving out, but i quit my job to  take care of her and i'm still going to college. my fiance is going to  college and working but we cannot afford an apartment. and i'm not  entirely sure my mother is capable of taking care of the house anymore.  she is not able to lift heavy objects and has become neglectful on  cleaning, and i have taken up cleaning the house as well as a good  portion of the cooking.

(i  did not) i am a very clean person when it comes to kitchens, and i feel  disgusted when i see it dirty.i  could go on about how forgetful i've been noticing her becoming or how  her entire personality seems to be different in one way or another,  obviously the easy answer for this would be for her to talk to her  doctor about this, maybe even a neurologist but she has refused to talk  to a doctor, or mention it to her doctor.my question is:what should i do? i have no idea how to go about this anymore since everything leads to a fight.do  you think i should be concerned about something like alzheimer or  dementia? or does this just sound like age and stress is getting to her?i  love my mother, i do. but over the last year she has been a source of  never ending stress. it always seems like she wants to pick a fight, or  just hates me. its just so unlike how she used to be that has me  worried.i wasn't a perfect child not  even close, but i've not done anything to warrant her being so  confrontational all the time to me. and when i have asked her why, she  just says she doesn't know what i'm talking about and that she isn't  acting confrontational with me.i know  the fighting could end by me simply moving out, but i quit my job to  take care of her and i'm still going to college. my fiance is going to  college and working but we cannot afford an apartment. and i'm not  entirely sure my mother is capable of taking care of the house anymore.  she is not able to lift heavy objects and has become neglectful on  cleaning, and i have taken up cleaning the house as well as a good  portion of the cooking.

My wife just died. She had Lewy Body Disease
she was diagnosed may 30 and died august 15. she was 66. symptoms started last november. she would fall, be confused, hallucinate, be forgetful. it was gradual. by january she was hospitalized. then to rehab. back in the hospital in february, march, and april. she had multiple utis and c. diff. back home she couldn’t get out of bed. developed bed sores, fell and bruised her coccyx. discharged to outpatient therapy. had two sessions then therapists refused her further treatment. after the diagnosis of lbd medical practitioners started treating her differently. by the middle of june she had developed another uti. back to the hospital for a week. then to nursing home for rehab. discharged for lack of progress. home on the 4th of july. admitted to hospice july 31. she refused to eat, drank very little, slipped into a coma on august 8. at 9:30 pm on august 14 she began making cooing sounds like a baby does when someone is talking to it. she cooed off and on until midnight. she developed a crackle in her chest, her respiration’s dropped to 6 a minute her b/p was 70/40. at 3:43 am on the 15th i could find no pulse. her breathing was light and slow. at 4:17 on wednesday, august 15, 2018 she stopped breathing. i cared for her practically alone with some help from a private agency. hospice provided a lot more support. i didn’t feel so alone. my wife refused hospice at first. once the chaplain spoke with her she accepted the fact that she was dying. the hospice nurse that admitted her was going over a lot of information but it was obvious my wife wasn’t paying attention. the nurse asked my wife if she understood it all and my dear wife said “it doesn’t matter. i won’t be here long.” i asked her where she was going and she said “heaven.”

I wish I could help more
hi. this is a difficult post (but i assume someone out there can relate).i can't really remember when it started because i was studying in a different place, 4 hours away from my town. i just know that, one day, when i came to spend the weekend, my grandpa kept asking who i was. my mom told me he was starting to do this with my older brother as well (he also lives in a different place). then, it was my younger sister, who still lives at home. then my dad, his son in law. now, it's starting to be my mom, his only daughter.my parents try their best to take care of him. my mom helps him with everything he needs and she accepted his state before anyone - she was the one to take the car away from my grandpa despite his protests, for example. and now that his problems are worse - he forgets his pills, he tries to leave the house and gets lost, incontinence, and others - she is tired. and i feel like i can't help.i'm on vacation now and i stay home a lot of the time. i check up on him once in a while and help him with things he needs. i remind him to take his pills. i answer all of his questions. i check to see if he hasn't left the property (just a few weeks ago he started walking randomly around town and fell down. it's a small place so people helped him and got him to my parents, but it was still scary). i also help with my little sister and our small family business. i'm trying to get my masters next year and also a job so that i can support them in another way.but it doesn't feel like it's enough. we're all tired. but i wish i could do more. it feels like he's so down, at his end, but the end never comes. and i'm just stuck with feeling useless.my grandpa is gone (it's a hard way to put it but that's how it feels) and my family is struggling. and it's not his fault. but it gets difficult and i don't know how to make it better.thank you so much for reading. you're all wonderful and very strong.

Not Dementia Afterall?
reddit's always been a great place for me to lurk and find reassurance so when i saw this place, i'm hoping i can find an answer, or at least some reassurance on what to do.my mom is in her late 60s and a few years ago started to show a significant change in memory function. she was having issues with short term stuff. she is and always was extremely independent and blunt (undiagnosed, and yes i understand i am not a psychologist, so take it with a grain of salt please borderline personality disorder)she was fired from her job, went on unemployment, then disability and finally retirement. memory wise she just seemed to decline.currently she constantly talks about old stories from when she was working or growing up. i'm not trying to exxagerate but if she's watching tv or seems something when i'm driving she's got some story about how x happened to a coworker or y happened to her sister.she has practically no short term memory and constantly asks the same question over and over.  for example if she doesn't see my younger brother she asks if he's at work (he has two jobs) and then later on she'll ask again.  the last doctor appointment she went to, my father was supposed to go in the room with her.  the nurse said oh we're just taking vitals.  mom didn't know what to do and came out with no idea of what they did. dad ended up checking the paperwork and finding out she was given 2 vaccines and told to get lab work done.in nov 2017 i got a referall to a neurologist for mom. he told her to keep taking aricept (minimum dose) but didn't give me a diagnosis or any suggestions.they have since switched back to kaiser and i was able to have her refered back to neuro. the visit did not go well and is why i'm lost.doc was extremely blunt, asked me what i "thought" the issue was with her. wouldn't let me speak with him without mom present (that was extremely nice, trying to explain how her mind has deteriorated over the last couple years while she's sitting there listening and starting to cry)he did a few tests, and that standard mini mental test where she had a breakdown and started to cry because of how his was pressuring her. if he had let me speak to him he would have been able to understand she has an undiagnosed learning disability (bad childhood abuse and neglect) and she does have some underlying angry and emotional issues.his diagnosis is that we're completely wrong, she doesn't have dementia or anything but depression and anxiety  and needs intensive counseling. i and my dad are baffled. we live and love her. we know this isn't forgetfulness and resentment because we don't let her drive.  he told us to feel free to stop the aricept and that her pcp will give a referral to pysch. right now my plan is to stop the aricept as told and try the therapy with her. but does this make sense? should i try to get a second opinion?is all this just because dad and i started trying to pick up the pieces after she lost her job?  dad does all the cooking and i do all the driving. i love my mom so much. the changes i've seen are killing me. she used to be the closest thing to a best friend i had. i don't have much of a support system outside of dad, so any advice or suggestions on resources would be helpful. for location reference i am in southern california,  specifically la county. if this kind of topic isn't allowed i do apologize, just kind of in a daze right now.

Am I doing the right thing?
very new to the dementia world but learning fast. i just think i need some perspective from those of you who've been here awhile.my mom hasn't yet had a diagnosis, but is declining so rapidly that it doesn't seem likely that she doesn't. she recently got a diagnosis of parkinson's and has all the symptoms of the associated form of dementia - lewy body dementia. her doctor is working to confirm this.in the meantime, i am trying so hard not to rush her along due to my own needs. i don't know if that makes sense, but what i mean is, i want her to keep her independence as long as possible while still making sure her needs are met in a way that i can easily manage. i am her sole caregiver at the moment as my siblings all live very far away, but do have excellent support from my partner and my employer. the thing is i feel like sometimes i have to lie to her and that is so hard for me to do. she is smart and capable but was a nurse so when we talk about dementia, it is very distressing for her. then she forgets the conversation until it comes up again and i have to break both our hearts all over. she also get obsessive thoughts. like i asked her a month ago if she still had a valid passport. i asked only out of interest because my partner and i are planning a trip and we were talking about it. after that she kept trying to give me her passport. i refused and did not take it. now she can't remember where she put it and is convinced i took it. she won't accept that i didn't take it. now she wants to go through a box of things she gave me to make sure it isn't in there. i am terrified that if i give her the box before i can go through it this weekend, that she will lose or misplace the papers that are in there too. i've asked my partner to hide the box until after the weekend and feign that he doesn't know where it is so that i can go through it before she does.i feel awful about this. i feel like most days she is fine to have access to her papers, but right now she is not and so i fear her losing more. i feel like the worst person in the world to lie to her and to keep her things from her at this stage. i did tell her that i wanted her to wait until after i went through the box, and she has asked me to be in charge of these items, but i worry that she will forget she agreed to this and will ask my partner for the box. god this feels wrong and manipulative.any advice, gentle reprimand or commiseration would be appreciated.

Is there a way to compel someone to be tested?
dad. 74. highly agitated on his good days, mean/nasty/vicious on his worst. it's *always* been like this, we chalked up to stress but 1000% worse now. he's been in a slow decline for roughly a decade, but looking back the foundations of this started around 1996 when he would sporadically confused family members. now we think he's in a tailspin to the really nonfunctioning part of this.now he's confused and pissed off all the time. suspicious. in denial. his irish twin (10 months apart, twin is younger) just tested mild-moderate on some test for dementia. his mother died of alz when i was a baby at age 68. he will not go to the doctor. had an appointment with an internist  gerontologist. refused to go, blew a gasket. later apologized to our mom and said he was sorry and just caught off guard. please make a new appointment, he will go. this was 2 days ago.yesterday pulled the same shit, saw the appointment still written on their calendar and bugged the fuck out. i got cryptic messages from my mom and drove 2 hours out there to witness his nonsense and record some of it. so vicious and angry. he is combative and pissed off and defensive and mean no matter the approach.i guess we're beat, huh? we need to wait until something really bad happens and she just has to call police? he's fiercely independent, grew up very poor (8 people, 1 bedroom) in a sleepy town, was drafted, worked very hard for everything. i think part of this is he feels vulnerable for once and can't handle it. ig won't see my mom without my dad, so that's off the table. they need to see him in person before doing anything. aside from the mood stuff, he confuses everyone, forgets where he is going or where he is at, has screwed up finances (extraordinarily large donations to charities he's always given to), handed my mom a check for *60,000* dollars last year from some account they had forgotten about apparently (didn't get the whole story on this one but yeah), put phone in the freezer, put remote on phone stand, put remote in freezer, forgets where i live and got upset when i told him i was in philadelphia, doesn't know the holiday or cause of celebration at large family events, etc. please help.

New Here - Need Advice
i am new to caring for a parent with dementia.  my father is diagnosed with it. we thought it was full on alzheimers but was diagnosed differently. my father just can’t retain his memory of what he thinks is trivial is the best way i can describe it.  he doesn’t know the seasons, time, day or date. he knows what they are, but if you ask him he doesn’t know what day it is. he is able to go out and come home fine. he knows his way around and can remember how to get places he just learned about. (wish he would forget since he found out how to go to/from resorts casino). he does not remember to eat. i believe that is a typical dementia thing. they think they already ate so they will refuse new food. but if it’s cookies, grapes, beef patties or cashews he will not forget about eating those.my main issue is that, he has no money mgmt. i do not give him his social security to use, but i leave him his pension. i use his social security for his bills and medical bills.  so since he found out about resorts, he went  there everyday. needless to say, he blew over $1500 in 2 weeks. he would take money out of atm up to 5 times a day. now he ran thru all his pension for the entire month and wants more money.  i will not give him his ss $ to blow.  so he’s been running to the ss admin to figure out where his ss $ is. they are not helping him as he would like. but he forgets that we went and goes back and back.  i can’t make him stop. he doesn’t remember that i get his ss $ in a separate account.  i can’t lock him up in the house.  but when he’s fixated on something, he will not back off of it. this is the 2nd time of fixation irritation he has going thru. it is the longest by far. if someone’s here to watch him, he’ll still slip out of the house. do you know what can help? the art of distraction is not working.

Dementia vs. Alzheimer’s
i have read up on both trying to figure out what my father has. they both kind of describe what he's going through.what i have noticed my father is going through right now1. short term memory. having to repeat the same answer to him 4-6 times in about 10-15 min.2. attached to material things. he is not known to have a love for material things. he always had his tools and whatnot, but now he will grab things out of the trash my mom has thrown away and store it in his garage. things like a broken lamp or a chipped plate.3. nervous and/or anxious.  i recently had a yard sale at my parents place. all the items were mine that i needed to get rid of and i had a sale at her place for traffic reasons. my dad would walk around and watch people like a hawk as if they were going to steel his stuff. he seemed nervous and anxious.4. anger. the leftover yard sale items i gave away for free. a guy contacted me and wanted to pick the stuff up. i gave him the address and had him call my mom to let her know when he will be there. my mom told my dad and he got angry about it. he rushed outside to go through the stuff and take what he wanted. then when the guy showed up my dad stood there with his arms crossed, looking at him in a angry way.my mom offered the guy to use my dads dolly and my dad said "no" (this is not my dad, he has always been a giver, not a taker)i had to go over there to make sure everything went smoothly. when i got there my dad said "i would have kept this stuff, why would you give it away" i explained to him that i need to get rid of it and they are selling their place and can't have this stuff sitting around. he looked at me with such anger and stormed off while kicking stuff around. two days later, he either forgot or got over it.5. he's losing weight, looking older every time i see him. the only thing he will eat is deserts. sweets and sugar.6. he's easily distracted. he's asked to do something and then he gets distracted and does something else. what does he have? what stage is he at?how much time do i have left with him?on another note, my dad is a hard worker, he's always working outside in his yard (2 acres) recently it's only been picking up sticks for some reason. his mower broke and he was out mowing his lawn with a weed eater. if you offer to help he gets mad and offended. he doesn't like being treated like a child.help me understand him better!!

Grandfather (66) suffers from Dementia, not sure how to handle and accept all this. (Feeling guilt).
hi people. first of all, excuse me if i make any grammar mistake, but english isn’t my first language. today i went to visit my grandfather as he came to my country for vacation. i knew that he was seriously ill, but didn’t really understand what exactly was going on with him.  when i went yo his house, he asked “who are you?”, “i don’t know you” then i told him that i am his niece etc. he immedietaly started to cry, hugged me and cried very intense like a child. then my grandmother told me that he suffers from “dementia”, which is something i never heard about before. so i googled about it and now i understand what my grandfather is going through.my main problem or concern is that i don’t really know how to communicate with him. it seems like he doesn’t really understand what i say unless i keep it short &amp; slow. he also isn’t really able to walk without any help. he refuses to take any medicine. he refuses to stay at the hospital. he also isn’t drinking any water or so.  i had to beg him so so so much just for him to take a sip or two.can anyone please just help me and let me give any advice on how i can cop with all this and accept all this change? the thing is, my grandmother told me that so many strangers take advantage of him, for example : the waiter makes him pay 2-3 times, the taxi driver aswell, claiming that mu grandpa didn’t pay anything and he keeps forgetting that he actually paid for all these things.also one thing that is making me extremely guilty is the fact that when my parents divorced, i cut off all the contact with my father’s family (including my grandpa). then after 4-5 years of no contact at all, i finally decided that i was ready to meet my grandpa. now that i saw him crying so much and being so sad, i feel extremly depressed. is there any way i can make him feel good even though he suffers from this illnes? is there any way i can convince him that i really do love him from the bottom of my heart? pls anyone, just help me somehow.i’m sorry if i wrote too much text or what i wrote isn’t making so much sens. i’m crying at the moment and just feeling extremely sad. thanks in advance.

so this all started in late march. we only see this aunt a hand full of times a year being we live a few hours apart, so if things were progressing with her on a day to day level it's not something i would notice. she was seemingly normal at our wedding last year, at a picnic over last summer, and even up to this past christmas. she is about 65 years old. in late march we went down to his parents to surprise them with the news that we are expecting. his aunt \(and uncle\) were there and were elated at the news, as was everyone. the day was nice and we eventually parted ways.maybe a month or so later we found out the sex of the baby and told his parents over the phone since there is physical distance between where we live. his dad \(her brother\) calls to chat with aunt a few days after, and asked if my husband has called her yet and told her the news. she goes, "oh, don't tell me they are pregnant!"...*wait*, **what?** she was there when we announced. his dad said, well...yeah...but didn't say anything further, and eventually ended the call. \(which frankly i don't understand, i would have been like...you were there...\) the other thing we learned from this call is that she abruptly retired from her job of 20ish years, after just 6 months ago saying she wasn't going to retire any time soon and wanted to work as long as possible. my husband calls her a few days after that and gets the machine, leaves a message and asks her to call him back. weeks go by, she doesn't. this is odd in itself because she adores him and always jumps at the chance to chat. eventually he calls her again and she answers. when she picks up he says it's him, and "how's it going?" in a very abrupt way she says "everything is fine. why?". he was just greeting her, i found this extremely odd and almost defensive. he eventually tells her the gender of the baby, and that we are naming her after his grandmother, her mother. that made her extremely happy. she insinuated to him that his father had told her we were expecting \(?!!?\). i'm not sure if it's something with the men in this family but again he didn't say anything. she did mention she had been to the doctor and had an mri but that everything came back normal. they talked for a while about other things and everything seemed fine.now my husband's mother called yesterday and told me that she called said aunt and asked her how she felt about the babies name. the aunt said, "what was the name again?".???????????so i guess at this point we can see something is very wrong. these aren't just little things. i'm not sure if she is on medication, or what her stress level is. she has been to the doctor, but i don't know how truthful she would be if something were wrong, she is a sweet lady but it seems like it's a pride thing.personally, my side of the family is very close, and at the first instant of someone forgetting i was having a child i would have been asking them what was going on and making sure they made it to a doctor to get checked out. it blows my mind that everyone in their family is essentially just ignoring it...but also don't feel like it's my place to do or say something. it's just not sitting well with me and i don't know what to do. his uncle lives with her and has to realize something is up. you would think if she mentioned to him that her brother told her we were pregnant he would be like...uhh yeah they told us in march at the last dinner. yet nobody says anything to anybody.

I'm so scared my mom will get dementia
ever since my grandmother (paternal) developed dementia, i've been hyper-aware of my parent's behaviors. i'm only 21 and they're in their early-mid sixties because they had me in their early forties. although my dad is the one who's more at risk on paper, as his father died (supposedly) in the early stages of dementia and my grandmother has it quite badly now, he's doing everything he can to mitigate his risk - taking tons of different supplements, exercise, diet, religiously monitoring his blood sugar, blood pressure, etc. (he has a phd in a scientific field). my mom is just as educated as he is and works in the health field, yet i worry more about her even though she doesn't have a strong family history of dementia that we know of (i believe she had one uncle who had dementia, her father died of a stroke but still had a sharp mind, and though some family members think her mother was beginning to develop dementia before she died, others assert that it was simply her eccentric personality and normal aging). my mom takes the supplements my dad tells her to in a kind of lackluster way (but doesn't take nearly as many as he does). she doesn't religiously monitor her vitals and doesn't seem to be too concerned about blood results that are off, unless something is *really* off. the most concerning thing though is that she refuses to talk about anything dementia related. just the other day when i was talking to my dad about lowering your risk, she said that it's "disturbing" to see us blame people for getting dementia. when i told her there's no blame but you can lower your risk, she got up and left annoyed. my mom doesn't like to talk about these difficult topics. she's a great mom but does have a habit of shutting down in the face of these sorts of things because she takes a "it's out of my hands" attitude. it's frustrating because it's *not" out of her hands. there are things that can be done to lower her risk. she has several protective factors on her side - the fact that she's highly educated, likes brain stimulating activities like reading and puzzles, is bilingual, and has a healthy diet. there are bad risk factors too though - namely the fact that she has type 2 diabetes due to her weight, likely due to an antidepressant she's been taking for many years that is known to cause serious weight problems. after a ton of needling, she's finally going to try something more modern. she also has some autoimmune issues that are borderline, just like me. i know i'm probably overreacting, but over the last six months or so i've been focusing so much on my mom and her behavior, getting worried anytime i see any hint of cognitive decline. she seems to be a little more forgetful lately - leaving her phone at home when she goes to work and coming back ten minutes after leaving to grab it. leaving something at home that she needs when we go out. taking something with her that she was supposed to leave at home (like a form my dad still needs to sign). forgetting the details of a conversation we had the other day (she's always been very distracted, but i feel like it's gotten worse lately... maybe i'm reading into it too much though). i'll be talking to her in a room with just the two of us and she won't pay attention unless i say "mom" loudly, because she doesn't know i'm talking to her (she says "you could be on the phone"). in general she's just *very* distracted - like i said, she's always been this way to a degree, but i have a feeling things might have gotten worse. she also seems to be more temperamental and stubborn as of late. she's always been easily agitated, but i feel like that's also gotten worse.   maybe i am just overreacting. i don't think she's gotten any complaints from her work, and she works in a higher position managing a team of people. i know she's been stressed ever since most of her staff was laid off post-trump. and i know a lot of this could simply be normal aging plus me being more sensitive. i can't get these worries out of my head though because i feel like she doesn't take dementia as seriously as she needs to. there's a dementia crisis upon us with aging baby boomers, and i think everyone over the age of 65 should be doing everything in their power to lower their risk. the fact that she won't even have frank conversations with her children about this sort of thing doesn't inspire a lot of confidence in me. i really get the feeling that she'd be the kind of person to hide any cognitive decline that she noticed until things were too late. does it sound like i need to worry yet? how do i know what's normal and what isn't? do you believe there are serious interventions that can be done to lower your risk? did your family members with dementia have untreated risk factors, and if so what were they? again, i know i may be overreacting, but watching my grandmothers decline has probably been the most disturbing thing i've ever witnessed. it's traumatized my father. just thinking about how i could be in his shoes one day makes me feel extremely depressed and afraid.

(X-Post from r/Alzheimers) Finally accepted Alzheimer’s has taken my grandma and it SUCKS
context: my grandma is 90 and since a surgery last july has been in a rapid alzheimer’s decline. she also has a significant blockage in a main artery in her brain so has had a few tias since then as well. i was dealing with it with humor at first because she still knew who i was and had her spunk. when asked at the hospital if she knew who the president was she responded with, “yeah, that man nobody likes.”  another time she offered me $50 to cut her tubes and break her out of the hospital.  next, she started forgetting who i was. sadness came, but still used a bit of humor to deal with it. i greeted her last thanksgiving i sat down next to her. a few minutes later she turned to me and said, “who are you? i assume i’m your grandma because you called me grandma, but honestly, i don’t know who you are.” i was stunned more than anything because that was the first time she hadn’t remembered me.there’s been a few incidents since then. once she swore i was the actress who plays kate on this is us after seeing her on the cover of people magazine she saw at my aunts. just went with it. this last weekend though broke me more than before. maybe it was just seeing how rapidly she’s declining. she’s gone to needing 24/7 assistance and doesn’t even recognize her own house. she has to be reminded to use the bathroom, she’s not talking as much, and i just don’t know how to continue connecting with her. i just got with her flow. my grandma is the matriarch in this big mexican family. she’s the one who taught me my strength, work ethic, how to cook, and even how to cuss. definitely inherited my stubbornness and ability to murder you with words from her. so it’s hard, i mean hard to see her like this. thankfully , my family is super close, but we are all dealing with it very differently. we were all fighting at first but agreed to a stalemate since this shit is hard enough on it’s own. adding our own bickering and judgement towards each other, warranted or not, doesn’t help. but today i was driving back to my city after a visit and got angry. like rage angry that i’ve maybe felt once in my life. i didn’t even feel that when my dad passed away, but i am closer to my grandma. but i mean i’m just so fucking angry at this awful, horrible disease. i know she’s 90 and i can say “this is a lesson that all time is important” but right now i just want to flip alzheimer’s the middle finger and punch it in the face for stealing the last years i could’ve had with my grandma.  not really sure why i decided to post. partly to vent and partly for support. like i said, my family is all dealing differently and i don’t have anyone who’s gone through this to confide in. it’s making me feel like i’m mourning already. like that feeling of grief you get when you’re mourning and you’re not sure if you’re going crazy because you go from sad to angry to sad to grateful to denial to anger again.  tl:dr fuck alzheimer’s for stealing the last years with my grandma. i’m a hot mess over it.

Too young for this. Any spouses able to give their perspective?
i don't know what i (40 f) want anymore. the last 10 yrs have been pretty miserable in comparison to the earlier ones. he's (51 m) more than a decade older than me and starting to have minor memory and medical issues that he's in denial about. i feel obligated on one hand to stick it out for life and on the other i feel like i've given him my entire adult life and just want to be free. i don't feel the urge to date or do anything crazy. maybe just go back to work, have the ability to read a book without constant background noise, have a conversation with a friend about something generic. just the life that i used to have before we got married all those years ago. he is a very intelligent person and i love him, but he struggles with some things that have gotten worse these last few yrs. he won't ask a dr. to evaluate him and minimizes things so that he automatically "passes" any questionaires. he's always angry nowadawys. it doesnt matter if he's the one that ran the stop sign and someone honked...it's still their fault and he gets mad at everyone. i or others can say something to him 6 times in a row and he won't recall it 30 minutes later at all. his work is frustrated with him. i'm frustrated with him. he's in denial, so... what can you do. he doesn't forget really important stuff yet. i mean he knows the basics and all. more like misplaces things and will accuse us of moving it, conversations and such. two of our kids are grown and two are teenagers. i couldn't take it anymore tonight and decided to hang out on the couch by myself, but i don't know if divorce is the right answer or not even though i've thought about it for awhile now. i love him, but it's hard to like him sometimes. i'm 40 with kids growing up and didn't realize that this is what i was signing up for. for the last several years i've just wished for someone that i could chat with or make life plans with. someone to help with the kids and share life with. before you say how selfish i'm being, understand that i'm telling myself the same thing. that's why i'm still here. i'm 40 though and have been raising kids since i was 18. part of me just wants a spouse/spouse relationship, not always a parent/child one. please try to understand that. i love my husband and always will. i'm not going to abandon him. i just feel like i'm not sure if i can continue doing this and would appreciate if someone who has been through this would mind commenting or pming if that is more comfortable to you.

Mom diagnosed, wow this is a lot
hi there.i've wanted to post on here for a while, but did not want it to be real.  since about 2011, i've noticed a change in my mom.  she slowly became less active, more withdrawn.  she used to be an avid gardener, it's now been 3 years since she pulled a weed.over the past few years, her memory has been declining.  and the personality changes- my loving mother barely called me to check in when my husband was in chemo in 2016.  (he's fine now!)  she doesn't call her grandkids.  she forgets birthdays.  my dad, a busy workaholic, now has to do all the cooking and cleaning, everything.  it's like each month, she stops doing another thing.  he has tried to get her help, she would not accept it or admit that she has memory issues/has changed.  she has been getting worse.  2 weeks ago she tried to pay a bill with a deposit slip, and she is now not bathing.  a new doctor recently gave her the mmse test- she scored an 11/30.  that hit us hard.  she is now on aricept.  (awaiting more tests to determine which specific dementia this is)my mom was a charge nurse in geriatrics.  she was a phenom.  she cared for people with dementia lovingly. my siblings live far away.  they blame my dad for not forcing her to get help.  i try to explain that you can't force someone who was not a danger to themselves to get help.  the only reason that she is accepting help now is that she doesn't understand what she is getting help for.  i love my sibs, but they are making it hard by blaming the person affected by this the most.  my dad recently discovered that nursing home care can cost 100k/year.  wow.  is it possible to do in-home care instead?  i guess not, or people would just do that.  man this sucks.  i feel for my dad, and my mom.  and i'm having my first kid, and a woman who was an amazing grandma to my sibs' kids won't even be able to babysit by herself.  any ideas on how to get her to bathe?  my dad tried to have her take a bath and she gave him pushback, then lied and said that she did take a bath.  we are new at this, not sure what to do.  hoping my dad can find some local experts to help us through this. sending love and support to all who deal with this.

Wondering what kind of dementia? Does anyone recognize these symptoms?
i work with a lady that is about 7-8 months from retirement and she’s got symptoms of some type of dementia. we’re just kind of letting her ride it out so she can get full retirement but she’s extremely frustrating to deal with. about a year ago she started with our company and at the time, she was in a position of leading a few bodies of work. she would blame coworkers and always tell people they weren’t being clear, they didn’t communicate well, something was always someone else’s fault when she didn’t understand things. she would get angry and nit pick people over nothing. we honestly assumed she was just a lying c*nt. she displayed what i thought were classic bpd symptoms at that time, complete with mood swings and inability to get along with people.we reorganized and they offered her a lower position with less responsibility. she took it. after a few months it became readily apparent - she would be shown something, be very hard to teach, eventually get it and then two days later completely forget how to perform the task. she would confuse technical words we use in the industry that she definitely knew well enough when she started with us. she repeats herself often, has conversations and then can’t remember two days later. a coworker says when she gives her steps/tasks she does so one at a time, and by step 3 she’s forgotten the first one. she can barely operate a copy machine, has been shown 20+ times how to scan and send things to her email and can’t do it. she can’t focus well, some of it is her eyes - another problem because if you give her written instructions either she can’t retain what she’s reading or she is having a vision problem, it’s tough to nail it down. some of our management team knows, particularly my boss. it’s a cruel thought to begin documenting on someone so close to retirement and rob them of any percentage of benefits. we are short staffed and it’s hard not to get angry about having someone who is not doing an fte’s worth of work and eats so much of everyone else’s time. i digress...she can be almost childlike and emotional, weeping when people are kind to her. other times, she’s difficult to deal with, stubborn and contrary. she has diabetes, and i know that causes brain fog, so it’s either the underlying cause or exacerbating things. she’s repetitive, obsessive about some things. she does like to travel, does want to be social, but part of the reason why i thought she had bpd is because she nags people to help her and then will blame them when they’re busy or she doesn’t understand when they explain things to her, so she alienates people. she also seems clueless that there is an issue. no problems with gait, if you asked her who the president was she would definitely know that, seems to be able to retain names of people she’s met, find her way around town, etc. mostly, her ability to learn and retain information is affected, logical reasoning is affected, remembering conversations, perhaps reading comprehension, trouble maintaining relationships, emotional, mixes up “technical” terms (not everyday objects or words). i was hoping to get a hit or lead on what is going on, because i’ve seen this before in another person who was diabetic and that relationship ended badly- i’d like to be able to help this person how i can, adjust how i’m giving instructions or find tasks that she can actually do that would fill an fte and are appropriate, even if it takes me awhile and a lot of aids to help her through the next few months. i read that there is over 100 different types of dementia and the 6 or 7 most common have symptoms she doesn’t seem to have or it isn’t severe enough yet, but she has a lot that hit “moderate” in some of those categories, just not certain hallmarks.

Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation
my mother-in-law has been declining with worsening memory loss, confabulation, cognitive function loss, and worsening self care in a dramatic way for 2-3 years. she has three sons. one of them has been aware of the situation and trying to help for a long time. he recently said she was diagnosed with alzheimer's more than ten years ago, before her husband died. at that time, they set up a living trust and poa papers, but the rest of the family were not told about the diagnosis. my fil passed away, and mil has been on her own for seven years. she has steadfastly denied anything was wrong with her and refused any and all help, even minor, common sense measures. she has poisoned family relationships through paranoid/confabulated stories of abuse. she speaks negatively of all family members behind their backs, and this has poisoned family relationships because people have believed her stories rather than talking to each other.she hasn't been able to manage her own medications consistently for several years. last year, i took initiative and with her permission and cooperation, i found her an automated medication dispenser. she paid for it with her own credit card and agreed to use it. i also went with her to a doctor's appointment, with her permission, after i talked to her about concerns about her memory and she agreed she shared the same concerns. at the appointment, we saw a pa who confronted me about why i was there, told my mil she "didn't need anyone to go to appointments with her" and gave a mini-mental status exam that i'm pretty sure she assisted mil to pass. then declared her as having "only normal age-related memory loss." at this time, i didn't know about the longstanding alzheimer's diagnosis and neither did that medical practice. she ended up putting the medication dispenser somewhere and forgetting it existed. a couple months later, my husband pulled it out from under a desk and she was shocked. didn't recognize it. had never seen such a thing.each time a family member has tried to get involved in her care, mil has initially been receptive, and then refused to share information about her appointments and removed any information releases she had previously signed so we could not know anything about her health care. she had breast cancer and was going to all of her appointments alone, refusing help, unable and/or unwilling to tell us what treatments she was receiving, what her prognosis was, or anything. she could not tell us anything about her many health problems. she has insisted some of her doctors came into the exam room and sat silently staring at her before leaving without a word. she has not been compliant with her meds. she is prescribed many medications. she does not take them on schedule and sometimes takes too many. until last fall she was still driving. she only lost her license because i called and reported her to the dmv. she failed the road test abysmally, but thinks she was done wrong and had her license revoked unfairly. now she has had an incident where she locked herself out of the house and spent 24-hours outdoors before anyone missed her. she lives way out in the country on her own and has repeatedly said she would rather die than move or have any professionals come into the home to help her. her doctor ordered a visiting nurse and she refused the service.we are the long distance family. the two local sons are not dealing well with the situation. one knew about the dementia and has been trying to help for years. his reward for all of his effort was for mil to tell everyone that he's been trying to put her in a nursing home and steal her property. the other son has been in total denial and has avoided the situation until recently. now he's jumped in and is taking her to doctor's appointments, which is great, but is also actively getting in the way and raging out regularly. he is still in denial about the dementia and thinks she ought to be living on her own and still driving. he recently threw a fit because his wife told him i was the one who reported her to the dmv. he confronted my husband about it and ended up punching a wall. he also got in an argument with his mother and pulled back a fist to punch her. my husband had to jump in between them, and he put down his hand, but it's really got us shook up. i have no regrets about reporting her to the dmv. the idea of her behind the wheel of a vehicle is terrifying. we finally found the living trust and dpoa paperwork after searching the house for over a year. (her paperwork is a mess--she hasn't paid her taxes yet and we have no idea what's happening with her bills). but these documents require all the brothers to cooperate and that is not happening. the ragey brother goes to her doctor's appointments with her, he is making medical decisions for her via bullying--not the dpoa that she and her husband prepared when she was still competent--and he is making financial decisions for her. he is refusing care on her behalf as doctors and social workers are increasingly attempting to intervene. the burned out apathetic brother is not participating because he is stressed out and thinks his dead father meant for him to be in charge of everything, even though the paperwork has all three names on it.we have consulted our own lawyer and are trying to find our way through this mess. it's beyond frustrating and heartbreaking. we know now that the years of conflict in the family have been created by the mother's paranoia and confabulations--every time something happened that upset her, she would blame somebody and make up a wild story about why they were at fault. until recently, her stories were mostly plausible. it's very difficult to navigate all of the hurt feelings and damaged relationships. most of us understand now that it was never personal, but ragey brother is causing a lot of problems with his behaviors. he also packs a pistol everywhere he goes and has bragged about brandishing it in order to intimidate others. he's never pulled his gun on us yet, but obviously the fact that he's showing up armed to family discussions and raging out is making it difficult to advocate for his mother in the face of his bad decisions, gatekeeping, and poor understanding of her limitations. rage bro is also lecturing her and trying to train her to stop her dementia behaviors.she's not safe in the house. there's nothing keeping her from getting locked out again. she has free access to a stove, many appliances, stairs, bathrooms, etc. where she could get hurt. and she's making a mess of her medications. she is due to finally get a neuropsych eval in may, but her condition is obvious and every doctor she's seen lately has acknowledged she obviously has dementia. rage bro and his wife are still hanging on that evaluation, though, and are holding up addressing her safety needs until they get their "proof."i think we're doing everything we can. it's a nightmare. we spent last weekend with her after she had some teeth pulled, and then we had to just leave her home alone, where she is clearly not safe, because the local brothers think that's ok. rage bro bought her a medical alert device from walmart, but we're expecting about the same success with that as the medication dispenser. she's insulted by the idea of it, and it needs daily charging, as well as her to cooperate with wearing it and remember to wear it.has anyone else been through this? any thoughts?

my mother-in-law has been declining with worsening memory loss, confabulation, cognitive function loss, and worsening self care in a dramatic way for 2-3 years. she has three sons. one of them has been aware of the situation and trying to help for a long time. he recently said she was diagnosed with alzheimer's more than ten years ago, before her husband died. at that time, they set up a living trust and poa papers, but the rest of the family were not told about the diagnosis. my fil passed away, and mil has been on her own for seven years. she has steadfastly denied anything was wrong with her and refused any and all help, even minor, common sense measures. she has poisoned family relationships through paranoid/confabulated stories of abuse. she speaks negatively of all family members behind their backs, and this has poisoned family relationships because people have believed her stories rather than talking to each other.she hasn't been able to manage her own medications consistently for several years. last year, i took initiative and with her permission and cooperation, i found her an automated medication dispenser. she paid for it with her own credit card and agreed to use it. i also went with her to a doctor's appointment, with her permission, after i talked to her about concerns about her memory and she agreed she shared the same concerns. at the appointment, we saw a pa who confronted me about why i was there, told my mil she "didn't need anyone to go to appointments with her" and gave a mini-mental status exam that i'm pretty sure she assisted mil to pass. then declared her as having "only normal age-related memory loss." at this time, i didn't know about the longstanding alzheimer's diagnosis and neither did that medical practice. she ended up putting the medication dispenser somewhere and forgetting it existed. a couple months later, my husband pulled it out from under a desk and she was shocked. didn't recognize it. had never seen such a thing.each time a family member has tried to get involved in her care, mil has initially been receptive, and then refused to share information about her appointments and removed any information releases she had previously signed so we could not know anything about her health care. she had breast cancer and was going to all of her appointments alone, refusing help, unable and/or unwilling to tell us what treatments she was receiving, what her prognosis was, or anything. she could not tell us anything about her many health problems. she has insisted some of her doctors came into the exam room and sat silently staring at her before leaving without a word. she has not been compliant with her meds. she is prescribed many medications. she does not take them on schedule and sometimes takes too many. until last fall she was still driving. she only lost her license because i called and reported her to the dmv. she failed the road test abysmally, but thinks she was done wrong and had her license revoked unfairly. now she has had an incident where she locked herself out of the house and spent 24-hours outdoors before anyone missed her. she lives way out in the country on her own and has repeatedly said she would rather die than move or have any professionals come into the home to help her. her doctor ordered a visiting nurse and she refused the service.we are the long distance family. the two local sons are not dealing well with the situation. one knew about the dementia and has been trying to help for years. his reward for all of his effort was for mil to tell everyone that he's been trying to put her in a nursing home and steal her property. the other son has been in total denial and has avoided the situation until recently. now he's jumped in and is taking her to doctor's appointments, which is great, but is also actively getting in the way and raging out regularly. he is still in denial about the dementia and thinks she ought to be living on her own and still driving. he recently threw a fit because his wife told him i was the one who reported her to the dmv. he confronted my husband about it and ended up punching a wall. he also got in an argument with his mother and pulled back a fist to punch her. my husband had to jump in between them, and he put down his hand, but it's really got us shook up. i have no regrets about reporting her to the dmv. the idea of her behind the wheel of a vehicle is terrifying. we finally found the living trust and dpoa paperwork after searching the house for over a year. (her paperwork is a mess--she hasn't paid her taxes yet and we have no idea what's happening with her bills). but these documents require all the brothers to cooperate and that is not happening. the ragey brother goes to her doctor's appointments with her, he is making medical decisions for her via bullying--not the dpoa that she and her husband prepared when she was still competent--and he is making financial decisions for her. he is refusing care on her behalf as doctors and social workers are increasingly attempting to intervene. the burned out apathetic brother is not participating because he is stressed out and thinks his dead father meant for him to be in charge of everything, even though the paperwork has all three names on it.we have consulted our own lawyer and are trying to find our way through this mess. it's beyond frustrating and heartbreaking. we know now that the years of conflict in the family have been created by the mother's paranoia and confabulations--every time something happened that upset her, she would blame somebody and make up a wild story about why they were at fault. until recently, her stories were mostly plausible. it's very difficult to navigate all of the hurt feelings and damaged relationships. most of us understand now that it was never personal, but ragey brother is causing a lot of problems with his behaviors. he also packs a pistol everywhere he goes and has bragged about brandishing it in order to intimidate others. he's never pulled his gun on us yet, but obviously the fact that he's showing up armed to family discussions and raging out is making it difficult to advocate for his mother in the face of his bad decisions, gatekeeping, and poor understanding of her limitations. rage bro is also lecturing her and trying to train her to stop her dementia behaviors.she's not safe in the house. there's nothing keeping her from getting locked out again. she has free access to a stove, many appliances, stairs, bathrooms, etc. where she could get hurt. and she's making a mess of her medications. she is due to finally get a neuropsych eval in may, but her condition is obvious and every doctor she's seen lately has acknowledged she obviously has dementia. rage bro and his wife are still hanging on that evaluation, though, and are holding up addressing her safety needs until they get their "proof."i think we're doing everything we can. it's a nightmare. we spent last weekend with her after she had some teeth pulled, and then we had to just leave her home alone, where she is clearly not safe, because the local brothers think that's ok. rage bro bought her a medical alert device from walmart, but we're expecting about the same success with that as the medication dispenser. she's insulted by the idea of it, and it needs daily charging, as well as her to cooperate with wearing it and remember to wear it.has anyone else been through this? any thoughts?

Grandma never got a proper diagnosis for the progressive deterioration that destroyed her
my grandmother died last week. it was sort of gruesome death, but i'm grateful that she's no longer in pain and that she and my family are free of the hell that her undiagnosed disorder caused. i wonder if anyone could give me more information on what was happening to her.the reason she never got a proper diagnosis is partially because her symptoms were atypical. she never became demented in the straightforward way that her husband, who has fairly classic parkinson's, is now becoming. she didn't forget much, or lose speech, or become disoriented. but for many years she was plagued by increasing mania and anxiety. she couldn't sleep, and she was terrified all the time about absolutely every thought that entered her head. it seemed to me that her system was suffused with adrenaline and in 100% flight-or-fight mode for about 4 years. she called my mother at all hours of the day or night with crises every day for all those years, over things that in fact were quite manageable, or not urgent. when i would drive her anywhere, she would shriek at me not to run into things. her speech was pressured and shrill. it was a mix of high-pitched anxiety, sadness, fear, and depression that inhabited her body like a demon and never quit.this was not her typical personality before, and she was heartbroken because she knew something horrible was happening to her. and there were some physical symptoms, but again they were vague and hard to pin down. her face adopted a pained expression, as if she was fighting the demons that plagued her constantly. her skin became sallow and pale, and her movement deteriorated and become slower, but not in the trembly way of parkinson's. when we see pictures of her from that time, all of us can tell that she had become a shell of herself. she was simply perplexed by and preoccupied with her own suffering, but none of us could quite define that suffering or find any way to help her.last year, she had a stroke. all of us sort of take this as hopeful proof that there was something truly wrong with her brain and brewing all that time, even though we'll never know quite what happened. in the months before, things became even more insane and weird. she accused one of her caretakers of sexually assaulting her, and then actually said a day later that she'd made it up. it didn't seem like dementia, really, but whatever it was pulled her and my family into a pit of horrible, creepy insanity that we are just beginning to shake off now that she is gone.i know this is a vague description, but that's what was so maddening about this process. my grandmother was never an easy woman in many ways, but whatever this was took her from all of us. i was not able to have a true relationship with her for years. no one was. i miss my grandmother, and all of us would like to know what happened to her--if only because if it is genetic, we would like to be able to recognize the early symptoms and kill ourselves before things get too extreme. it was a horrid death and the whole process was shrouded in mystery. i don't know much about their medical process, but i do know they were in consultation with many neuro doctors and she never received a firm diagnosis.any insight any of you can give me would be helpful. thank you.

This ones going to be hard: always crazy, always forgetful, not my family.
i work for a small family business doing property management. i’ve worked with the family over a year and theirs one person who really has issues.  the owner. she is forgetful, moody like bipolar on an accelerated time scale, aggressive, reckless, and sometimes straight up evil. now her family and other people who work for her say she’s always been this way, but i’ve noticed it getting worse over the last yeah i’ve been there and i don’t know what to do. this is such an extreme case i feel like normal tests aren’t going to cut it, besides the fact that she will not go through a doctor because she “doesn’t want to fix herself.” i’ve gotten into it with her before that she needs to go to a doctor and she knows she’s fucked in the head but she’s not changing anything and everyone will just have to deal with it. yesterday was probably the most extreme example of a mood swing i’ve ever seen. she went from spitting fire to walking on clouds in a few hours like full on manic. usually when she’s happy it’s just like she’s a normal person but when she’s angry there’s nothing you can do to fix anything. even if everything’s ok she’s upset about something and wants 5 things fixed “right now.” recently though even her happy times have been scary. last night she came into the office to say that my idea she called stupid earlier actually worked really well and then went on a manic roll trying to get me to do all these things for her. then she just ran out of the office and went to go meet with some friends at a restaurant. minutes after she left someone else cane to the office asked where she went. turns out they had just gone shopping together and she was there to help her unload the car. this wasn’t a little shopping trip either they spent thousands of dollars(on things we needed ) and she just left without unpacking any of it. her forgetfulness goes beyond anything i’ve ever seen in a person. she will move someone into a unit and by later that day forget and tell us it’s empty. she refuses to do any paperwork and tells us it’s our job to get people checked in but won’t tell us anything because once the people aren’t in front of us they don’t exist. anyways one of my coworkers brought it up yesterday and said she thinks she has dementia. problem is no one in the family thinks thats the issue. she’s always been “terrible” and it’s just something we have to deal with. a few questions. 1. how should i proceed? i’m not in the family but i’m worried she’s going to get so bad and it will be too late. 2. what are some clear signs someone has dementia? this case is so extreme it could be something else or a slew of issues so tangled we may never find out. 3. how should i bring this up to family? i’ve tried before, doesn’t stick. for those of you who think i’m crazy for working here, you’re right. but i care about her other family and making sure the customers are taken care of because it’s not fair to them. they pay me just well enough to do my job to the best of my ability with the circumstances but it’s come to a point where if nothing changes i’m goin to have to quit. she’s too much to deal with on a daily basis and again she’s not my family so why should i be put through this.  any help is appreciated sorry for the long post.

Im 26- my dads 86 - don't know if onset of dentist/alzeimerz or just old?
i'm unemployed which is bad enough. but on top of that my parents are old. i'm up most the night and my dad will come downstairs open the living room door and say 'oh your still up are you mate' - he does this most nights - at first i thought he just wanted to talk to me. now i realise maybe he forgets and comes down to turn the light off?i have also be slowly losing my patience with not having any personal space at all. i had a big talk to my dad about it the other day. how whenever he leaves the house he asks if i want to go with him and mum. - every week he asks me to go shopping.  i used to go now and then but it's the only time i get the house to myself. and i've been slowly losing my patience with my dad asking me all the time. i told him this. and yet he still does it. all the ducking time. at first i thought it was because i had a breakup with a girlfriend and was a little bit down and he was trying to get me out the house. but now i realise it's not that at all. and he can't seem to remember that i don't want to go shopping with him and mum all the time.i mean - maybe i should be a good son and do it. but i need to keep my mind healthy as well. and if i don't keep boundaries it never stops with him asking me to do stuff with or for him. we have conversations and i feel like i'm explaining myself over and over. and i'm realising some points in the day he seems like himself and others it's like a ghost sitting next to me. i thought it was old age before and maybe it is but either way it's fucking hard. he was the stongest man i know just 10-15 years back and it's like i have lost him already. i feel like i never got a chance to be fully young. but now i'm realising maybe i did and this sort of thing will happen to most people at some points in their life. it's just a shame i am young and before i got my feet off the ground it is happening. it's fucking heartbreaking honestly because i had more going for me then anyone else i know but my entire life has slowly crumbled around me. home hasn't really felt that way for 10+ years anymore and i'm so lost. people see me as this shell i have become but nobody really knows what i'm going through. i would have moved out at 18-19 i had a great social group and i was pretty much the leader of it but i have had to let it all go and slow down to be patient with my dad at home. i could fuckoff and do my own thing but what kind of son would that make me?but saying that my sex life and social life have comepletely gone as i never brought my friends or girls home because i feel so trapped at home.10 years back i had the life i wanted. the girlfriend and mates i wanted. it's all gone. my ex went on to be a tattooist. mates have all moved on with their lives and i feel utterly powerless and vulnerable.  i'm kicking myself for not taking oppotunities i had but with vulnerable parents what am i to do? do my priorities lie with what i want out of life or being there for those that sacrificed so much for me? it feels a waste not getting the life i want after all they did for me but it feels just as equally selfish and it would be to leave my mum on her own as my dad gets older _ but the thing is my mum is 15 years younger then my dad so if i don't do what's right for me i might be sacrificing myself another 30 or so years until they are both dead and in which case i will then be 56? i don't really know why i am venting here i just feel like the bottom has well and truly fallen out of my life and it's not gonna get any easier

Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker)
i’m here looking for some advice.my family is currently facing a stressful situation, as my 93-year-old maternal grandmother has been suffering from dementia. the dementia is the result of her having thrown a few pes in the past, rather than her age. this means, her loss of memory/filters has been a relatively gradual process. in many ways this has been a blessing – my grandmother lives alone, in another state. she is a very independent, and a very, very stubborn individual, who is adamant that she will never accept help from a caregiver (outside the family) and will certainly never leave her house.as her memory loss has been a slow process, she has been able to stay in her home by herself. my mother calls to check on her multiple times a day and flies out to check up on her every few months, and remotely handles her medical/financial needs. in addition, she is driven to appointments/stores by a neighbor, who also helps her out physically (taking her trash out, and the like), and she is in relatively close proximity to her sisters and a niece. though she is on medication to slow the progression of the disease, there are many times she forgets to take her pills, which as a result negates any help they may have otherwise supplied. in the past few months, we are seeing more and more signs of decline. names and dates have begun to slip, and her short-term memory too is declining. at the moment, she is still able to more or less take care of her daily basic needs – food, chores, bathing. but, she is not able to rationalize things – for instance, she hordes things, keeps expired food, will sit in the dark on occasion (though this is clearly a tripping hazard). my mother has been working with adult services, who has been keeping track of my grandmother’s decline. the last contact they had with my mother, was a call to inform her that they had done a home check on my grandmother and found there to be no issue (as in she did not yet pose a danger to herself). they ended up closing her case file.so where does that leave my mother/us? it leaves us in a holding pattern – a very stressful one. though my grandmother’s disease is heavily documented, there is not yet any legal recourse for us to transfer her to assisted living. basically, we have to leave her to decline some more, before such action can be taken. in the meantime, my grandmother’s personality has become more and more volatile. her personality from her childhood onward, has one of stubbornness. i’m not sure if this was the result of various familial tragedies she’s had to endure, or if this is simply her natural personality. despite the helpful neighbor and the various family member who will occasionally call her, my mother is really her sole caretaker (her father and only sibling are both long since deceased). as such, the relationship between my mother and grandmother has declined to a point where my mother can no longer remember a time when her mother behaved as such. she has begun to question whether my grandmother ever even loved her.the pinnacle of this came tonight – my parents are currently at my grandmother’s house checking up on her. my mother was in the process of throwing out expired food in a basement pantry, when she stumbled upon decades old food. not only had the food and surrounding shelving begun to blacken and dissolve, but my mother had cause for concern that she was exposed to some very harmful mold.shaken by this, she relayed her worry and finding to my grandmother, and was met with only anger and denial – no sympathy/empathy was given despite my mother’s proffered fears (that she had been exposed to a toxin). my mother has been attending some group therapy sessions in regard to caring for someone with dementia and is aware that the disease takes a way a person’s ability to rationalize and perhaps even empathize. though she is aware of this logic, i see her having trouble internalizing it. the decline in the relationship between mother and daughter is taking a very large toll on my mother emotionally.i know this post is a long ramble, and i'm not sure if any one will even read it in its entirety, but i guess my purpose here is to figure out a way to help my mother. i can’t (nor can my siblings) be there physically to help (at least at the moment). i try to offer assistance emotionally, reassuring her about things, letting her know that we know she is doing all she can, etc. however, there are times when i find myself at a loss for words (on how she may be able to make suggestions or have positive interactions with my grandmother). what can you tell someone who is going through such a difficult thing that will make them feel better or will be useful to them?though we are all here to support her in any way we can, i know there are many times when she feels as if she is carrying the burden alone. any advice would be much appreciated. thank you.

Help with asking a parent to see a doctor about possible dementia
hello, i just recently found this sub and i was wondering if anyone could give me some suggestions about how to speak to my mother about some odd things we've been noticing concerning her behaviour. sorry if this is long.my mom turned 70 in december and we've been noticing that she's becoming forgetful about things. my siblings and i have been passing it off and in denial because she's always been absentminded, but lately it's been getting worse. we noticed it with small things like forgetting someone's name, and what not but the last few months it's been a bit more noticeable.in december i took her to a paint night with my girlfriends and their mom's and she couldn't follow simple directions to paint a snowman. i had to help her the whole time and explain to her what she had to do. she does wear a hearing aid and she said she had difficulty hearing, but she could see what the rest of us were painting. her painting ended up looking completely different than everyone else's.my mother is very attractive for a 70 year old woman and is always dressed to the nine's. she doesn't leave the house without her hair and make up done and she always dresses very nice. i had my baby shower yesterday and when i saw her my heart just sunk. her hair was really unkempt, she had no make up on, and she was wearing a pair of jeans with a t shirt. just not how my mother usually is. my cousins told me that she got confused a few times when they were speaking to her and she kept referring to bread as "flour". when we were cleaning up, she was looking for the cover to a butter container and i found it and let her know. a few minutes later i saw her walking around, looking for something. i asked her what she was doing and she told me that she was looking for the top of the butter. i had to explain to her again that i had found it. my sister spoke to my dad and asked him if he noticed her behaviors changing and my dad said he had. he gave an example of how she was boiling potatoes for supper and he mentioned that it might be nice to have some gravy with them, and she agreed and put the gravy package into the boiling pot of potatoes.i'm just really worried about her and i'd like for her to see someone and be tested, but i know she isn't going to be receptive. she's very stubborn and we can't get her to see a doctor about anything. just looking for some help on how to speak to her about our worries.tldr: my mom is showing some behvaioural changes and my siblings and i are worried she may be showing some early signs of dementia. looking for advice on how to broach the subject with her.

Grandma won't eat
for the last several months, my 82 year old grandma refuses to eat. she has lost so much weight her pants keep falling down her hips. every single day it's such a struggle to get her to eat anything i just feel like crying sometimes.at breakfast, we give her a muffin or some toast with jam. she eats maybe half and hides the rest. we keep finding bits of half eaten muffin and bread all over the place. at lunch she says she's not hungry, that she'd rather tear out her eyes than eat, and plays with her food and swirls it around her plate and then declares she doesn't want anymore when she didn't even take a bite. after much prodding, we get her to eat, except not really. she just chews and chews and chews and then spits it out and never actually eats anything. the rest she tries to sneak to the dog. at dinner we repeat the same routine. when we insist, she gets angry at yells at us to shut up and leave her alone and acts like us wanting her to eat is because we just want to find a reason to get mad at her.i am at my wit's end. we've taken her to the doctor, there's no physical reason for her loss of appetite. i've looked up psychological reasons, but that's not it either. she never eats alone. my grandpa and myself always eat with her. my sister often joins us as well. she always has company. we try all sorts of different foods. the easiest thing to get her to eat is sweets but even that she's starting to leave.what gets me the most is that, if we take her out to eat, she'll devour the food. it doesn't have to be anywhere fancy, just as long as she's out of the house. we take her to a diner, she'll eat and ask for seconds. we took her to my sister's boyfriend's house for christmas lunch, she wouldn't stop eating.the only thing i can think of is that she's bored of being in the house. sometimes she forgets it's her house, maybe that's why, but most of the time she's aware. the problem is we can't afford to be taking her out to eat for every single meal. we've tried picnics where we bring food from home, but it doesn't work. she acts bored and won't eat. maybe it's the cooking she doesn't like, but it's the type of food she always ate and used to enjoy, and we've tried all sorts of different foods. if we bring take out she won't eat it either.i've tried asking her if she doesn't like the food or if she's bored of being in the house. i can't get an answer. she gets mad at me and tells me to shut up and stop pestering her and that she just doesn't want to eat. it's not like she stays locked in the house all day, we do take her out, but as soon as she's back home, she forgets she was out... i just don't know what else to do. i feel like i'm being forced to watch her starve herself to death.

ADVICE NEEDED
(long post, sorry)hey everyone. i stumbled upon this subreddit just now and don't know where else to go to for help. i read through some of the posts and saw the amount of support and figured this was a good place to start. i'm currently visiting my grandparents here in germany with my mother and little sister (we live in an unnoteworthy midwest state in the us) and i need advice. my 82-year-old grandfather has what we think is dementia, and things have recently begun getting worse. it's never been diagnosed, but in the last two years, enough has occurred for us to take notice.  we first noticed symptoms two summers ago when he began experiencing troubles with his memory. he would start forgetting simple routines he followed every day and could no longer perform work on his projects without problems (he was a handyman for fun). he started getting frustrated but was aware of his forgetfulness and his personality didn't really change.after that summer, the forgetfulness started getting worse and he would have alternating days where he was mildly absentminded and then days where he would forget that he had a wife (who he has been married to for over 60 years). other times he would be generally anxious and paranoid--small disturbances would upset him for long periods of time and he would become depressed and stopped leaving the apartment altogether.the following december he had surgery to remove a cancerous bladder and was put under with anesthesia for ~4 hours. he was extremely disoriented following the surgery and regularly hallucinated for a few days afterward. he was 81 at the time and prior to the surgery, the doctors informed my mother that she would have to make arrangements since they were certain that he wouldn't be able to take care of his wife on his own when he returned home. since then there has been a rotation of caregivers that come to stay with him and my grandmother.the symptoms worsened after that. he grew more and more depressed and paranoid and would lose objects around the apartment when he hid them and later forgot their locations. small disturbances would throw him into a fit of mania and he sometimes spent whole days pacing around the apartment and making phone calls to friends and family. one of the more recent incidents involved his growing fear and paranoia that he was running out of money, which wasn't ever really a worry for him i guess. he was a kind of overseer and managed over 200 workers at a mercedes benz factory here in germany from ~1960-1990, and has a comfortable retirement income. my grandma was in the hospital a few months ago for lung problems and that aggravated his paranoia, so one day he took his walker and went alone all the way to his bank, withdrew 1000 euros, and lost them somewhere in the apartment. he hadn't been to the bank in maybe over 3 years and spent the rest of the week searching for the money and neglecting to eat or drink or sleep. he even started accusing the caregivers of stealing the money and would call our house in the us at 3 am in the morning rambling incoherently.in addition to all of this, he has been suffering from trigeminal neuralgia for the past 40 years. the pain has grown exponentially over the last decade and exacerbates his depression and mania. my mother and some of my grandpa's doctors think that this, in addition to the morphine pills that he has been taking since his diagnosis, has completely destroyed his nervous system and is causing all of the other normal forgetful tendencies to grow into the fucking horrible experience he now has to suffer through every single day. today was particularly bad. my grandpa was aggressive pretty much the whole day and was getting angry at everyone, including my grandma. she cannot walk and has been in a wheelchair for the last decade, and spends the most time alone with him when we and the caregivers are not there. he hit her on the head when he walked by her earlier, and it isn't the first time he's done that. when i told my mother she broke down crying and told me that she didn't want to leave him alone with my grandma anymore. she told me about a psychiatric hospital for the elderly that my grandpa's primary doctor mentioned to her when she last visited, and she has been considering it in the last few months. this would be a good environment to monitor his symptoms and if he would be committed he would be cared for by experts with plenty of experience. i know that this would break his heart though, just as it would break all of ours. he would only get more depressed and would lose the little strength he has left to continue.she told my sister and i that she would feel guilty for making a decisive choice though, but she knows that it is selfish to wait for things to escalate in order to justify something like committing him into an institution. it was out of desperation, i think, but she asked us for opinions and advice on the whole situation and i had no idea what to say. the whole thing is so fucked and unfair, and so i came here to look for some kind of information to help me help her.when my mom isn't here in person, she is managing everything--the doctor visits, the caregivers, the mania, everything--over the phone, 4,000 miles away from her parents. she is in constant stress and has been taking antidepressants for several years. it fucking kills me to see her and her parents suffer like this. if anyone has any advice, i would greatly appreciate it. at the very least, i want to be able to tell my mom something to make her feel better about whatever decision she makes. thanks in advance. you're all beautiful individuals for creating and maintaining a place like this.

ADVICE NEEDED
(long post, sorry)hey everyone. i stumbled upon this subreddit just now and don't know where else to go to for help. i read through some of the posts and saw the amount of support and figured this was a good place to start. i'm currently visiting my grandparents here in germany with my mother and little sister (we live in an unnoteworthy midwest state in the us) and i need advice. my 82-year-old grandfather has what we think is dementia, and things have recently begun getting worse. it's never been diagnosed, but in the last two years, enough has occurred for us to take notice.  we first noticed symptoms two summers ago when he began experiencing troubles with his memory. he would start forgetting simple routines he followed every day and could no longer perform work on his projects without problems (he was a handyman for fun). he started getting frustrated but was aware of his forgetfulness and his personality didn't really change.after that summer, the forgetfulness started getting worse and he would have alternating days where he was mildly absentminded and then days where he would forget that he had a wife (who he has been married to for over 60 years). other times he would be generally anxious and paranoid--small disturbances would upset him for long periods of time and he would become depressed and stopped leaving the apartment altogether.the following december he had surgery to remove a cancerous bladder and was put under with anesthesia for ~4 hours. he was extremely disoriented following the surgery and regularly hallucinated for a few days afterward. he was 81 at the time and prior to the surgery, the doctors informed my mother that she would have to make arrangements since they were certain that he wouldn't be able to take care of his wife on his own when he returned home. since then there has been a rotation of caregivers that come to stay with him and my grandmother.the symptoms worsened after that. he grew more and more depressed and paranoid and would lose objects around the apartment when he hid them and later forgot their locations. small disturbances would throw him into a fit of mania and he sometimes spent whole days pacing around the apartment and making phone calls to friends and family. one of the more recent incidents involved his growing fear and paranoia that he was running out of money, which wasn't ever really a worry for him i guess. he was a kind of overseer and managed over 200 workers at a mercedes benz factory here in germany from ~1960-1990, and has a comfortable retirement income. my grandma was in the hospital a few months ago for lung problems and that aggravated his paranoia, so one day he took his walker and went alone all the way to his bank, withdrew 1000 euros, and lost them somewhere in the apartment. he hadn't been to the bank in maybe over 3 years and spent the rest of the week searching for the money and neglecting to eat or drink or sleep. he even started accusing the caregivers of stealing the money and would call our house in the us at 3 am in the morning rambling incoherently.in addition to all of this, he has been suffering from trigeminal neuralgia for the past 40 years. the pain has grown exponentially over the last decade and exacerbates his depression and mania. my mother and some of my grandpa's doctors think that this, in addition to the morphine pills that he

My mom may have dementia and no one in my family thinks she needs medical help
my mom is in her 70s and has been exhibiting signs of memory loss for the last several years. she also is pretty much deaf (she has a hearing aid but it doesn't seem to help that much), so for a long time i couldn't tell whether it was memory loss or just her being unable to hear. (e.g., my dad would tell her that a friend invited them to dinner next week. she would seem excited about that. later in the evening my dad would mention the friend's invitation again, and my mom would react as if this was brand new information.)a few things have happened over the past couple of years that made me realize that she is definitely experiencing memory loss in addition to hearing loss. for example, my dad told me at a family lunch one day that my mom's sister has parkinson's. when my mom seemed shocked, my dad said that my mom was the one who told him. (i've since confirmed that my aunt does have parkinson's, so it's not something my dad misheard or misremembered.)another example: my parents had a party, and they invited one of my mom's oldest friends from high school. my mom sat next to her at dinner and talked to her all night. the next day we were looking at photos from the party, and my mom pointed at her friend in the photo and said, "she looks very familiar."also, according to my dad, she will walk around the kitchen (in the house they've lived in for the past 40 years - last redecorated at least 20 years ago) looking for the cabinet with the glasses.there are many more examples, but you get the idea. several years ago, when i first suspected my mom was having more than normal age-related memory problems, i asked my dad if she had seen a doctor about it. he said she is very embarrassed about her memory, doesn't want to talk about it, feels judged, and also no longer sees a gp  (her old doctor retired several years ago). my mom has always been very health conscious (former nurse), and my dad is the one who is afraid of doctors - but the rest of what he was saying kind of made sense. throughout their marriage, my dad has always judged my mom and subtly implied she is not as smart or high class as he is, so i'm sure she wasn't super happy to be talking to him about how her memory is failing.a few years ago, i tried again and got the same answer, so i enlisted my sister to see if she could help provide some support for the whole "let's take mom to the doctor" idea. my sister's response was, basically, why bother? a doctor can't treat or reverse dementia; if my sister were in mom's place, she would rather not know, etc.i have pointed both my sister and dad to online resources about dementia and menory loss which list various medical causes - a very small number of which actually are treatable/reversible. i have made the argument that the sooner mom has a diagnosis and treatment, the sooner she can start planning for her future in a reasonable way. the only argument my dad even halfway listened to was when i told him that, selfishly, i'd like to know whether this is something that i may have inherited. still, it wasn't that convincing: she still hasn't been to see a doctor. i know that if my mom doesn't want to see a doctor, she shouldn't have to. she is a grown adult. the thing is, i'm not hearing this from her; i'm hearing it from my dad, who i'm not 100% sure is reliable on this subject. i don't know what their conversation was like. an entirely imagined but not impossible scenario: "oh there you go forgetting things again! you really need some help!" "no i don't!" (stomps off in rage) later: "well, i tried to talk to your mom about getting help, but she wasn't having it, so what can we do."my questions:1. is it important for her to see a doctor? or are my dad and sister right when they say there's no point in it?2. if i try again, i think i'm going to make a plea directly to her, rather than going through my dad. i'll have no family support obviously. i only see my mom with my dad (rarely alone) - and he usually takes us to loud restaurants where she can't hear anything. she can't use the phone. she doesn't use email or text or social media. would a letter work? that's literally the only option i can think of.many thanks in advance for any information or advice!

Is it dementia, effects alcoholism/impairment, or both?
i've created this topic in hopes of receiving some guidance to help my help-resistant father who is a 66 year old, white male, with a family history of dementia, chemical dependency, and heart disease (which he's been diagnosed with).  my dad has a clear case of alcoholism. the effects of being impaired by alcohol and the symptoms of dementia can seem very similar to me. however, on top of this, he is on a temporary medication to resolve an abnormal heart beat which caused crippling flu-like symptoms for months. the side effects of this medicine are also extremely crippling including loss of balance (needed a cane to walk) and my family believes ultimately causing depression.  he also may have hearing impairment which makes him appear to be disengaged during many conversations. we are going this week to get tested for that, which i hope helps to improve his quality of life. in terms of his possible dementia: his mother had it as well as his aunt (on his father's side), however his aunt was actually diagnosed with alzheimers while i don't believe his mother was (please excuse me if i'm showing my ignorance to these diseases). i'm going to list some signs but i'm not super knowledgable on these diseases some may not be signs. the list:* short term memory severely hindered. forgets plans, medicines, entire conversations etc.  * when his mother was diagnosed with dementia my mom pointed out that she would only ever talk about her childhood and never acknowledged her grandchildren’s childhood when the conversation was about her grandchildren. pretty much she’d bring many conversations back to herself somehow. well, i’ve noticed my dad does this too now, but in relation to any conversation. it is literally impossible to have a conversation with family friends without him interjecting their story with a personal anecdote about himself as a child but also sometimes as himself during current times.  i feel like this is related to dementia because of the history with my grandmother who didn’t do this until her diagnosis but also because this is a new behavior for him too. * if he does tell a modern story he will tell it at least 5-10xs over* insomnia* he has a blank stare where you can just tell what you’re saying isn’t computing at all but this is usually at night after drinking all daymy question is: how can my family tackle this? so many issues that have similar symptoms or whose symptoms blur from each medical condition.  i feel like he can’t be the only one who drinks like a fish and who also shows signs of dementia, but when i searched this sub i couldn’t find many relatable topics. i also don’t know how to convince him to go to treatment. i’ve asked him to go before and he resists the concept. he knows we won’t judge him at all. i don’t understand why he won’t get help for this.my goal would then be to determine if his symptoms are the acute effects of being drunk pretty much all the time or if they are indeed dementia symptoms.  since most of the time my family interacts with him he is impaired, it makes it nearly impossible to know. i’ve learned about something called “wrap around care.”  it seems like its usually for at risk youth, but from what i understand its a team of medical professionals, from a variety of different specialities, who help get someone back on their feet.  does anyone know if there is anything like that for adults? is it something insurance is inclined to cover? thanks so much for any input and i am sorry if this really lengthy. there are just so many ongoing issues. i'd been away for four years and i sort of came home to this 6 months ago--it wasn't always like this.

Mom is clearly suffering from a delusion but I don’t know how to help
hi guys, i’m not sure if this is the right place for this, but i feel i have nowhere to turn so please point me in the right direction if need be!my mom seems to be suffering from dementia-like symptoms, but does not have a formal diagnosis. she’s definitely become more forgetful in the past couple years, and doesn’t seem as able to regulate her moods (she becomes agitated very quickly and is very untrusting of people). she’s told me that she doesn’t feel safe in her house at night, etc. her ability to follow conversations has deteriorated and she becomes lost and disoriented pretty easily. she also leaves out large portions of her sentences and then becomes visibly irritated when you can’t follow what she’s saying. all of this has been a concern for me for the past couple years, but i kind of just wrote it off as stress or an issue with her medications or something like that. however, what has me scared at the moment is that over the past 6 or 7 months she’s become increasingly convinced that her house is infested with bugs. in the beginning, we believed her. my boyfriend and i kept her dog for almost 6 weeks because she told us the bugs were getting on the dog. however, after several pest inspectors said they didn’t see any bugs, then two months later come back saying they can get rid of the bugs for $900, i started to doubt if the bugs actually exist. she’ll show me pictures of clumps of hair or normal house bugs and say that they’re beetles, or she’ll see dirt on the floor and say that it’s a “milky trail” that the beetles leave behind. if her dog coughs, she’s coughing up beetles. she’ll point to something on the floor and say, “see, there it goes back into the floor!” no one else has seen the beetles. the bugs being in her house was one thing, but last night she calls me in absolute hysterics. for several minutes i can’t even understand what she’s saying. i finally figure out that she thinks that the bugs are inside her body. she said she saw something online that said beetles can infest your body, but when i asked for a copy of the link so i could see what she was seeing she couldn’t provide any information. she’s absolutely convinced; i read something that told me i should play along with the delusion so i told her she needed to see a doctor so the doctor could give her something to “get rid of the bugs.” i had tried to talk to her previously about seeing a doctor for her confusion or hinting at the fact that maybe the beetles weren’t real, but she became very hostile to the idea, so i haven’t tried that again. she sent me pictures of holes she had picked in her skin because she was “picking the beetles out.” she told me she hadn’t eaten in two days, so my boyfriend went over late last night to bring her food and to see if we could figure out how bad she was mentally. she’s lost a lot of weight over the past two or so months. she just looks frazzled, but she was very happy when she thought that we believed her about the beetles. i told her again to see a doctor and to stop picking at the beetles. i’m so at a loss for how to deal with this. i’m 21, an only child, my mom is divorced and doesn’t work, and we aren’t really close with any family members. i called her regular doctor this morning and they said there was nothing i could do for her other than take her to the er and that she would have to make an appointment to come in on her own. what do i do? who do i talk to about this? i have no idea how to get her the help she obviously needs without upsetting her or making it worse. i’m so lost and confused and any help or advice anyone could offer me would be so appreciated! thanks in advance!tl;dr mom believes there are bugs inside her body and is harming herself to get them out. what do i do?

HELP: Grandmother with Dementia
my grandmother has dementia right now, i'm not sure what the extent of it is, but please if there are any doctors lurking on reddit, please help me out here.i can recall her forgetting stuff since 3 years back. it's all basic memory loss, stuff you expect with age. basic repetitive questions like what day it is and where did i put my spectacles were normal for me. nevertheless, she was her usual helpful and friendly self, loved folding clothes, doing laundry and loved interacting with me and my other siblings. now, what really began to make me feel a bit concerned was last month, she asked us if we were going to visit my cousin who was in the hospital. she was never admitted in the hospital, and when we told her that, she said she must be mistaken. however, she began asking,this question several times a week. now, 2-3 weeks ago, i noticed she completely changed. my aunt, who had always been a doting,daughter, came over to my family's house to take care of my grandmother as we were all busy at school or work. she has been doing this for the past decade or so when no,one is at home to look after my grandma. here's when it starts to get really worrying.my grandmother suddenly refuses to eat any of my aunt's food. she would starve herself until my mother comes home with a loaf of bread, which she would consume. i was rather perplexed by this, but not too much as i thought she was suffering from a lack of appetite. the moment i knew she had dementia was a few days ago. she suddenly began crying at random spurts every single day. one day, my brother had completed his night shift and came home in the morning with only me and my grandmother home. he bought breakfast as well. when i opened up the packet of food and invited her to eat, she wrapped the packet, placed it inside the plastic bag once again and threw it inside the rubbish binn. my brother and i were dumbfounded by this, but grandma held our hands and whispered to us that the food was poisoned by our aunt. now, a few days on, she has many sleepless nights where she sits in front of the house door, crying periodically. we now always lock the door because she tried to get out of the house on her own the other day because she thought our uncle was waiting for her outside. she is extremely quiet now as well.it is extremely devastating to watch this unfold to my beloved grandmother. i cannot concentrate on my upcoming exams because of her condition. any tips to make her  better are welcome.

Father With Alzheimer/Dementia
hello. i'm a 16 year old boy who's korean american. my life is nice at its times and i get what i need so money doesn't matter and i'm feel like i'm quite spoiled sometimes. about 4 years ago, my father started showing signs of dementia and i didn't know what it was. my mother didn't really tell me what's happening. he retired at the age of 77 and which i didn't know how old my parents were. i was excited to have him back home thinking i could play with him more since he wasn't home a lot due to him being an anesthesiologist. i was wrong. it turned into the biggest nightmare my life has ever experienced. my father drank a lot since koreans love alcohol and he was very drunk saying/doing things he didn't mean. i never understood as my mom just described it "daddy might forget somethings sometimes." i understood she didn't want me to be exposed to this hurtful thing at this age but it never helped me understand why this was happening. the first year of dementia was ok with some family arguments that were small nothing too serious. but then second year, shit hit the fan. his dimentia got worse and it didn't help he was drinking. it once got so bad that he wrestled me to the ground as i was crying and screaming becnaes my mother and i had an argument about video games and school again. my mother stood off to the sidelines and never did anything until finally when i was hyperventilating, pulled my dad off. i ran away from home for ten minutes (i was afraid of the dark) and tried to come back inside. i just saw him sitting down on teh couch holding a knife and when he saw me he screamed at me and i ran away again. after a while, i don't remember what happened, i was finally able to come inside and my mom told me that my dad had dementia which would hinder his emotions. she said not to get mad at dad because he can't control it. did it help? no it made me very upset. upset my dad does this to me, upset that my mother would stay off the to sidelines and have the nerve to say i can't blame anyone. the grudge grew and arguments got worse at least 1 or 2 every single week. i grew depressed further using video games as a place to escape from all the anger from my family. then finally, when it got very bad, my mother took my dad to the doctors after a year of this hell. they said they couldn't do anything because he was acting perfectly fine and said if he acts violently, to call the police so they can transport him to the hospital to get proper check up and stuff. my mom of course was against this but reluctantly agreed as they gave us medications. the meds helped my dad stay calm and it was ok for me to live but my mom and i still argued with each other. since the meds made my dad drowsy and lazy, my mom descided to not give him as much. big mistake. he started going back and actually got worse being violent towards me more since i always get the blame from him. he says very hurtful things saying "why dont't you just quit school and get the hell out of here", "i have 2 sons and they never acted like this", "why are you fucking cursing at your mom, don't you respect her!?", "why don't you go fucking kill yourself", and much more that i can' type without remembering the pain. fights got worse as now i got phsycial with my dad refusing to be hit and pushed and choked without a fight. my mom and dad held  grudge on me for  a small period because of this but i felt i was justified. finally, i get a call from my mother that she called the police because dad pulled a knife on her. i immediately went home to comfort her and it was very gloomy at home, i missed a lot of school days as i was so depressed and unable to learn i just called in sick. i felt upset that my dad was liek this, but the words lingered in my head from my mother. "you can't get mad at him, he doesn't mean it". i know he has dimentia, but it still fucking hurts me to hear this shit. i never really had a childhood with it being ripped apart from me with all this family drama. i just wished i could be normal. the sadness turned into rage. she only called the police because she was being hurt. i got mad and started to hold a giant grudge against her. i never outright showed her but it was deep down inside. finally, we went to a therapist which helped at first, but i later found it useless and one day decided not to go. that was a big mistake. my mom vented at my therapist and i was unable to defend myself. the therapist recommended very radical things and one was taking away my computer and electronics. i was lost, overtime i would try to talk to my mom, she would cut me off and say you can't raise your voice at me, you're verbally abusing me. this went on for a week and on time it got so bad so we had to get a new therpist who was much better and unbiased. he helped out so much and we were able to stop this radical stuff and i was able to get my stuff back. at this time, i was looking for something to help me cope and i found it was twitch streaming and making youtube videos. i make people laugh and it makes me happy seeing them happy. but later, my dad is able to come home, there is load of legal stuff to go through. police and child abuse people come to interview me. it was hard reliving every moment of hell and but i managed to do it without crying. (too much). life managed to get a little better until this year my mom makes the same mistake she did last year. she started to give dad less medications. the cycle goes all over again but i'm able to cope better with streaming and creating youtube videos. now i'm a 11th grade and i throught i would be tougher and this won't be as bad. it got even worse. argument are more violent and all aimed at me now. my mothers quick temper and quick to judge to accuse me make me upset that she keeps doing this, which leads to my dad getting involved which leads to me not getting any sleep and fights breaking out. i've tried to commit suicide a few times but was unable to do it knowing that i have friends and a loving boyfriend to live for so i won't be dying anytime soon. i just feel trapped and depressed for all my life. but the positive side is that it made me a stronger person and created me to be a very funny person and very optimistic. i'm so sorry for venting but i just got into another fight and i just feel so upset and trapped in this inescapable hell. she refuses to take any blame and always turns it on me using my video games as scapegoat. today i forgot to finish a small part of a page of extra work she makes me do and she exploded on me blaming me playing my video games even though i finished all my work. i know many of you are going to say that i should listen to my mom and not talk back to her, but this is very true and i refuse to be a punching bag for her just because she can't get mad at my dad and gets mad at me instead. thank you for listening...this took a lot of guts to type this so i'm sorry.tldr: depressed for 4 years because dad has dementia, mother not helping and i just wanted to vent my frustration.

Living with and caring for two dementia patients. It's as soul-rending as it sounds.
hi, people. so due to circumstances i'm currently living with my grandparents. i don't have anywhere else to go; my dad is homicidal and serving a life sentence in state prison, my mom has extreme anxiety with schizoid paranoia, barely functional, my stepdad is abusive/rage issues, and their house is falling apart. i have no irl friends left to lean on because i am a shut in. i'm unable to work due to ongoing mental health issues of my own (asperger's/asd, depression, social/generalized anxiety, selective mutism, authority phobia) and all the relevant agencies including ca department of rehab, social security, headhunter organizations are basically ignoring me. no money, no car, nothing.he is 73 and she is 74. i'll start with him. for many years it was apparent that he was slowing down, but 2 years ago he had a cardiac arrest incident and barely survived emergency pacemaker surgery. since then he has decline has accelerated. he has anomia/aphasia where he uses generic words like thing, gizmo for many nouns, or shoehorns in a word that is sort of similar, for example lighter for flashlight. he speaks very slowly and stilted, like his words are bricks lined up on a wall, each one recalled individually. communicating with him is a ponderous chore. he stares blankly at you, uncomprehending, until he chuckles and repeats back what you said, says a non sequitur, or simply walks away, forgetting that he was in a conversation. in addition, he is profoundly deaf, so he mishears things and just goes along with it, even if what he heard makes no sense. he putters around the house aimlessly and rummaging through things, when asked why he says he's looking for something, but he doesn't know what. he looks out the front room window so many times a day that the curtain is frayed where he grabs it. his fine motor skills are not very good; he wields his hands like clubs, seemingly having reduced feeling in his fingers, knocking things over often. he's also cold all the time. every day i have to re-teach him how to operate the dvd player so he can watch the same few episodes of northern exposure again. overall it feels like his personality is evaporating away. at least he's not the angry kind. nothing really seems to bother him. based on the symptoms and his heart problems, i'd guess it's vascular dementia.if my grandpa is slowing down, then my grandma is speeding up, but nonsensically so. she's always been...off, but she's been getting increasingly eccentric, acquiring strange compulsions such as requiring our trash cans to be perfectly aligned on our sidewalk and throwing a tantrum if our neighbor's cans are too close. most of her friends are dead or have moved away, and with her husband being so vacuous, i'm the only one she has to talk to. and boy does she talk. constantly, about literally anything. stores i've heard scores of times, things on the news i couldn't care less about but she carries on anyway, oblivious. if i'm not available she starts whispering to inanimate objects, the tv, herself...it's very creepy. sometimes has arguments with herself and loses. recently she's been having manic-depressive episodes, for example starting a "project" involving "cleaning" the house (in reality moving some of the hoard from one part of the house to another...did i mention they're hoarders? yeah...the ground floor is pretty much a biohazard) and the next day not having the energy to get out of bed. this has made her sleep schedule and mood completely unpredictable. the conversations she has with her husband are very surreal, like two chatbots talking.he still drives. i have a driver's licence but they won't let me drive because...i don't know. it's scary when he drives, he has a serious problem with rubbernecking. sometimes i feel like he's forgotten he's driving and is just...sitting in a chair somewhere, watching the scenery go by...i don't really expect advice for any of this. they're not going to get diagnosed, they completely lack insight that anything is wrong with them. grandma despises doctors and grandpa does anything she says. i just feel like i should say *something.* i'm 25. i feel like the best years of my life are being whittled away.there's a quote that i feel is particularly poignant here. "he who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. and if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you." i feel as if i'm going mad myself.

Bland diet
this is the maybe 3rd level of infection for grandma.  started with her leg about 15 months ago (it seems) with some cellulitis and/or stasis (fluid swelling in legs).  i wish she'd been in stocking earlier because it never seems to go completely away and maybe won't with scar tissue.  we've had multiple rounds of antibiotics for it, including a 5 day hospital stay for iv antibiotics.a couple utis have also led to antibiotic regimes.  throughout we've tried to get her to take a regular probiotic, whether by gummy pill or yogurt.  she hasn't been real consistent about it.  for a little bit we were trying greek yogurt but her choice is the opposite of mine (she opts for sugary types).the last week they found c.diff in her stool sample.  probably because of the uti antibiotics she was on, keflex for one.  so now she's on a 3 a day antibiotic (i forget the name).  it is in a weekly box, but it seems she is getting to the point were i need to be there to make sure she takes them.  i've started to find too many missed times.with the pills, she got put on a bland diet.  i kept her on it for a few days but after that i've been less strict.  she eats mostly bland anyhow but they had some veggie and fruit rules that go against her normal diet.  the skins and seeds are not allowed as much, for example.well today fixing supper with chili for myself i had to remind her that she was still supposed to be relatively bland.  this kind of set her into a tailspin about the meal.  she looked at her list that she had transcribed from the doctor's bland recommendations and then started looking for only things on that list.  she went to open a peanut butter jar.  i've never actually seen her eat peanut butter before, this jar was unopened and something she bought after reading the recommendations.  i said she could have a salad, like she has the last 3 night without problems, but she checked her list to let me know she couldn't have the skins, etc.  i probably messed up because i told her she doesn't need to read the list and that she has been eating without issues for the last few days, and tried to re-iterate my reasons for withholding spicy chili.  i finally just left her to her meal prep.  by that point i'd already prepared and ate my supper, it just becomes too time consuming for me to wait for her.  i'd do everything in cooking, but usually she wants to do things so i let her.  but she can spend an hour reheating and plating leftover, or more.i suppose any advice on how to get her to remember she needs to take a pill every meal and maybe better idea of how to approach meals.  ideally, we'd eat the same thing, but i've been trying to reduce frozen stuff in her freezer and chili was up.  i'd been trying to have her stay relatively bland, while i ate down things from there.  i know probably part of the answer is being more attentive, but admittedly it isn't my strongest attribute.ps i was about to post, but grandma stopped by.  she wanted to call the maintenance guy for her apartment for her kitchen light (which is working, but maybe it is the wrong bulb -- i don't really know because he was by when i wasn't around).  i messed up again, i let her know that it was nearly 7pm on a saturday and that it probably wasn't a good time to call.  i should have, in retrospect, lied and told her i talked to him already and that he can come on monday.  learning to take a breath and think before replying is probably one of the harder things for me.

Dementia or narcissism or???
i'd like some advice about my mother. she is really starting to get to me, and we keep having arguments about what i have or have not talked to her about. she has never been diagnosed with dementia or anything  (but of course she's never went to the doctor about it), but she forgets conversations, and her ability to reason isn't good. she's in her low 60s and has had diabetes for 24 years. her mom had dementia in her later years too. okay, so this happened tonight. i get a text from her asking her why i didn't ask her about camping. background info..we go up north to where my parents have land for a family reunion. my husband and i are planning on camping with my extended family nearby for the first time. previously, we would just go back to my parents. but then that leads to us not spending much time with the family. since we had never done this before, originally i asked my mom if we need reservations or if we need to pay or whatnot. she said she didn't know. so today i posted the question to my family's private group. they answered and said it's free, no reservation...just give a donation. which leads to why my mom texted me. she read what we said on facebook. i responded with "i did mom. you said you didn't know." she said "you did not ask me because  i do know." i said "i did too mom. [my so] was with me and said the same thing i did." and she said "no you didn't because i would have known. i may be forgetful sometimes but not all the time.  i think that you might think you ask me but you don't." and i said "maybe then you don't listen to me.[so]was there too mom." and she said "[my so] is always with you. i listen to you because  you don't talk to me very often. ]this makes me want to cry for several reasons. firstly, she requires that we text or talk almost every day. it really hurts my feelings that she thinks i don't tell her anything. what does she want to know?! i can't even think of anything i haven't told her. second, i accept that she is forgetful. she has been for many years. but it bothers me that she says i have a good memory until i tell her that we already had this convo, etc. then suddenly it's "i don't think you tell me as much as you think you do." why must it be me that's wrong? even when i was a witness (my husband). finally, this thing makes no sense. if she knew all along, why didn't she tell me in the first place??? some of what she does makes it seem like she's gaslighting me because i keep having to question my sanity. but she seeks bow innocent. anyone have advice or anything that might help? i don't know how to deal with her anymore.

[Update]Is in home care possible? (Hospitalization attempt)
sorry if this comes off as rant worthy, i'm just so angry and need to hear if any of this is normal. my dad got to the point where we went to his pcp , and the pcp took me aside and said 'enough is enough, he needs to be force admitted to the hospital, and force admitted to a facility. take him tomorrow morning.' so i did. i took him this morning, and long story short they ran a lot of tests, and the er doc came back and said 'yeah he wants to go home, so we'll let him go home. medically his blood sugar (he's diabetic) is 4x what it should be, but he says he'll take his meds this time.' even though when the doc asked him what day, year, month, what his age was, who the president was, and my dad was unable to answer. i demanded he call the pcp, who apparently said "yeah if he wants to go home we can't force him to stay." i asked for a social worker. the social worker refused to even acknowledge the dementia and instead focused on the hoarding. "well you could clean his house out, but that's on you, and you know once it's clean he can move back in. " "lets focus on the dementia. her inability to feed herself, take her medication, hes urinating on himself, making false police reports, driving without a license, getting into accidents, extreme paranoia, extreme memory loss from second to second and from day to day. " "yeah well maybe an aide can help.." "ok where does he go until then?" "you can rent him a hotel room."how the fuck is this worker licensed? get a dementia patient a hotel room? the social worker told me to call aps, who has ignored my pleas for over six months, and much to her surprise i called them right in front of her face and they told me "yeah we're not going to do anything because he won't let us in the house." the social worker was just like "mm yeah thats not great.." i showed the workers pictures of the house with one path through it, dog shit all over the floor, rats, the fact that he has no good food and its all out and rotting, all the 3 years of unpaid bills that im scrambling to balance and pay off (with his money, not mine), police reports, etc. but they did not give one shit. the only thing the police, the fire marshall, aps, doctors, social workers do is play the "i'm not dealing with this shit" game and hand you some other orgs number to try to fucking pass the baton. guess what? that other org doesn't want to help either. nobody wants to say "this person is incompetent so i will help", they say "sorry you have to deal with this" then wash their hands clean. how do none of these people have a conscience? how did the doctor and social worker today look at the home environment he was going back to and say 'yeah i feel okay with myself about doing this.' i even went so far as to say "okay well i'm not taking him home." and they replied with "well he can walk, so we'll let him walk right out the front door regardless of if you're here or not." not to mention the fact that simply trying to get him admitted probably set me back in terms of trust with him months. fuck this disease and fuck the fact that i'm probably only halfway through this bullshit.

Arguments for and against routine/support
my mother has been diagnosed with dementia and schizophrenia. she is in her late 70s.my dad, 5 years her junior is still very active. he does not want to get any support and takes her along to anything he does, as she cannot be on her own at home anymore. is this good bad, how can i argue with him. some examples: * my parents have 2 homes and regularly go on holiday. but my mother is only fully aware of where she is in her main home, which she grew up in. * other than a very complex, but routine breakfast that has moved from 7 am to as late as 11 am depending on how long it takes my dad to prepare it, my parents have started eating at times that suit my dad, often having lunch at 6 pm only and skipping dinner.* my dad tries to do brain training exercises with her but only does so very irregularly. my mother is currently not capable of putting a 16 piece jigsaw together by herself, but instead of trying this over and over again, he introduces different games almost daily.  * my dad is now challenged by the sailing boat they used to have due to its size and him having to operate it all single-handedly. my mother actually fell off this boat last year and injured herself, yet this year he insists on a smaller boat, easier for him to handle but much harder to balance on and a higher risk for my mother.* i moved abroad - and due to my mother's absolutely shabby behaviour towards my spouse, i cannot really ever move back home unless i get divorced. my parents never really visited us, but last year my dad decided it was okay. my mother was mentally unable to disagree - actually said she was looking forward to it. when she arrived here and saw my wife she completely forgot all that. she never ever looked at my wife, did not recognise me and mistook me for a family friend who has a terrible personal tragedy and kept addressing me (male) with the friends (female) name. we could not change the return journey and it was a terrible week for all of us. yet - my dad still wants to come back here this year even though i will much rather spend the time with them at their home.i'm really looking for arguments to use with my dad. if i look at dementia care here, people tend to only have one home and spend their time there, they try to build a repetitive schedule and avoid major distractions. i'm not sure this is right, but what is the impact of almost permanent flux in the schedule of a dementia patient?tl;dr;* is it correct to force a dementia patient into permanently changing schedules and activities?* if yes or no how do i best address this with a very active spouse who is her carer who neither wants to let go of his activities nor get any help for her care?

My family story...
i go back to 2009 and my father could not put complex thoughts together. he was an engineer, and could not figure out some simple problems with the house. going back to 2000 he was forgetful. covered up, but still forgetful.   in 2015 my mother passed away which was his primary caregiver, and wife of 55 years. by this time he has difficulty putting words together. still functional i.e. shower, bathroom, eats, etc.  he was put in a memory care unit at that time. during the summer of 2015 he did not remember any of us (3 children) or could understand that his wife was dying. we thought we would have difficulty getting him to a home, as he was tied to the routine of his house. we actually had to have him to in the hospital because he got violent with all of the hospice, and my sisters during the final week.   in oct of 2015 my sister picked him up from the hospital (my mother died that week), and took him to memory care unit. he has no memories of his wife of 55 years, or his 3 children.   he still is semi functional, follows the compulsive hoarding, and is generally pleasant...although has no idea what is going on. he is amazed at the world, as it appears he is seeing for the first time everyday. he is 83 now, and i believe is on his 10th year of diagnosis. i have read the progression of ftd. will it progress to being a vegetative state? wheel chair and fed. what has been your experience in the final stages?

Dad's Vascular Dementia Is Breaking my Heart
i just found this sub. i don't know what i'm looking for from you all-- its been helpful just to read the stories of other people's grief i suppose. i thought i'd share my own. 8 years ago my father had a heart attack followed by a tia. in the following 5 years he declined at a slow pace (he is 67 now). but 3 years ago he began to show rapid signs of decline. aphasia, incontinence, balance issues. his older brother has lewy body disease. dad was diagnosed with vascular parkinsons. he has had 3 moderate strokes since then, and many more tiny ones. his latest mri (january 2017) showed significant spots of white matter.i feel like i'm watching him die a little bit every time i see him. he is a ghost of the person he once was. he was an school superintendent, 2 masters degrees. he was incredibly creative and artistic. he ran marathons, rode his bike 10 miles a day. he was vibrant and funny and full of life-- even 5 years ago!!! now he is shrinking away in a recliner. the only thing he is interested in is watching tv and holding his little dog that i got him. sometimes when i call he doesn't recognize my voice. he forgets words, drives erratically, and suffers from incontinence. i miss my daddy.

Update: Mom's Memory Improved Drastically On Prednisone...Now She's Making Big Flubs Again. Typical of Dementia?
part i of this post here:  so i finally talked my mom into seeing a doctor about her memory issues (finding words, leaving the stove on, etc).  she saw an ear/nose/throat doc and they did a ct scan of her brain and some blood tests for urea or something.  they didn't find any infection in the sinuses or other abnormalities on the scan.  she was prescribed prednisone and sent home.  the ent was thorough and didn't sound too concerned about her memory issues but agreed to refer her to a neurologist if the meds didn't clear it up.  what's weird is that, while my mom was on prednisone for 10 days, her mood and memory improved *markedly*.  she wasn't mixing up words or forgetting to do important things.  she was just generally sharper.  not manic or abnormally elated, just normal.  the 3rd day after she went off the prednisone, she was mixing up words again (she said: "i spent an arm and a *load*" twice instead of "an arm and a leg" in conversation and wasn't aware she said it when i told her later).  then today she left the stove on all day again.  ugh  :\i was so relieved when the medication improved her symptoms, now it feels like we're back to square one.  **would dementia respond that dramatically to steroids, or is it likely something else causing her memory issues?**  she goes back to the ent this thursday but i don't think much will come of it.  i don't think she even had a legit sinus infection or blockage according to the ct scan, so i don't know why the prednisone would've helped her function so much better.  she does have constant post-nasal drainage.  could allergies be affecting her memory?  i'm really spinning my wheels trying to figure this out.  she has depression that gets worse in the summer, as well as adhd and sleep apnea.  and she was pre-diabetic 10 years ago and has only gained weight since then.  so there's a lot going on.    any ideas appreciated.  i'm planning to make her follow up with the neurologist if i can (she's stubborn and hates doctors) but i'd rather not let my ocd get the best of me in the meantime.  thanks!

65 y/o Mom Forgetful &amp; Moody Lately; Terrified It's Alzheimer's :[
the line between 'normal aging forgetfulness' and 'dementia' is often up for personal interpretation and difficult to definitively determine.  for the past 2 years, my mom has become more absent-minded in several ways that she's acutely aware of (but not concerned about--that's my job).  i first noticed her having more mood swings that seem to come literally out of nowhere (usually) in the evenings.  she gets all anxious and just has to take her frustration out on someone--usually whoever is nearest.  she has increased her prozac dose from 20 to 40mg per day, as i guess she felt it wasn't working at that dose anymore (she's been on it for 20+ years).secondly, she has frequent memory lapses that involve everything from word recall to forgetting that she didn't make supper that night.  she left the stove on last night "again" (according to my dad it's happened before) and said she couldn't remember the word "grass" in a recent conversation, referring to it as "that green stuff".  she has a harder time remembering peoples' names and other details when telling stories that used to be no problem for her too.  it's like a ditzy-ness or absent-mindedness rather than loss of function...memory lapses that happen several times per day rather than constant/persistent reduced iq.  she has a harder time expressing herself verbally too (according to her).   she doesn't have short-term memory loss or ask the same questions over and over like some alzheimer's patients do.  she can still balance a checkbook, manage her finances, drive to destinations &amp; do other 'big' things...but something has definitely changed in the last 2 years or so.  she frequently says she's "losing it" in a joking tone, but i don't find it funny at all :(she has taken lipitor for her high cholesterol for over 10 years now.  i read that statins can cause memory loss, but there seems to be some dispute about whether they actually do or not.  she also takes xanax about 1 time per week, which i know can affect memory.  we don't have a family history of alzheimer's or dementia at all, though i know it's not entirely a genetic disease.i'm literally bawling my eyes out trying to figure out what's going on.  65 seems young for alzheimer's, but i know it can potentially set in at any age.  i just don't know what i'd do if she had some kind of dementia.  are there any non-dementia causes of these symptoms that i've listed?  thought i'd ask here since you folks probably have actual experience with this topic.  webmd is impersonal and not all that specific.  any info appreciated.  thanks!

Grandpa sliding downhill fast-- like, 3 days fast.
(sorry for the length here, just trying to show how quickly this all happened!)so my poppa is almost 80, and in the past year or two he has had some signs of his memory failing. most often he forgets to eat (my mom or aunt usually will take him out for lunch, but he has gotten very skinny) and he has had a thing with figuring out what all of his 25 or so keys go to, every morning. more recently he's had trouble with falling asleep in his easy chair, waking up and not knowing what time it is. his companion is the anchor point for this; she calls every night at 9pm to tell him to go to bed. then he knows when he wakes up it's the next day.this all changed on saturday. my parents were supposed to pick him up at 1pm at his house to go to a mall about an hour away. he showed up at my parents house at 6am, and scared the shit out of my dad. he said he had been up since 1am shoveling the driveway and plowing  snow for his neighbor. there was less than an inch of snow on the ground in northern ny. on the way to the mall, he was saying how he's been talking to his mother (who died probably 60 years ago), and started talking about how people are following him. he thinks that his neighbor across the street is a member of this secret police, watching him all the time.when they get back from the mall, he drives to my aunt's camp. basically to get from his house to her cottage he has to go up his street, turn left onto the highway, and turn right into her road. it's about a 10 minute drive. when he's leaving, he somehow got turned around and was driving up a walking trail at like 9 at night. (no walkers thankfully, they close at sunset!). he gets to my uncle's house at who knows what time and is saying how the police are after him and all this, my uncle calls the city police station and asks if they are looking for my poppa. they said no.then on sunday, he is all upset saying that his neighbors are going to put something in his gas tank so he can't go anywhere. my aunt agrees to let him park his truck at her house for the night, and she brings him back to his house (about 8 blocks away, around 7 pm.) about an hour later he shows up at her house again, he walked the whole way. she goes "what are you doing here??" and he said he just came to hang out. she says, "we just brought you home, remember? your truck is here for the night." so then he starts seeing people again and cars going by are all people trying to get him and he is all upset saying "they" won't let him leave. he has had similar conversations with my mom in the past few days. my aunt finally take him to camp again, where he says "now they can't get me because i'll see them coming in the day time." this continued into monday. my mom and aunt couldn't get him into his doctor until wednesday, but even then... this doctor is apparently anti medicine (holistic?) and may not do anything to help anyway. he goes there pretty regularly but insists on going alone and does not tell the truth about his symptoms. my mom and aunt are planning on taking him to the emergency room though, if they feel this doctor is not providing the care my poppa clearly needs.my mom and aunt are completely at a loss and pretty devastated to boot. can this happen? can he slip so quickly in a matter of days into this? the only thing we can think of is a "snap" due to his companion/anchor being out of town for a few days.

Non-English-speaking grandmother showing signs of dementia and no one knows how to help
my grandmother just turned 82. physically, she's doing much better than the average 82 year old is doing. she goes to the gym and never learned to drive so takes the bus and walks everywhere. however, my family suspects that mentally, she's not doing so great. my grandfather passed away 20 years ago this year, and she's been living alone in a condo for around 15.  about 12 years ago, she had a depressive episode and stayed with my aunt for a few weeks. she seemed to be out of her mind, and everyone thought she was having a stroke. the doctor said it was high blood pressure mixed with depression. she's been taking medicine ever since.recently, she's been acting a bit more strangely than usual. she calls my aunt to tell her about the problems she has with her downstairs neighbors being too loud. she calls about her door not working. and various other problems. but when we try to remedy them by having her move somewhere else, or checking out her condo or door, there don't actually seem to be any problems. she also has been having angry outbursts that are not characteristic of her at all and behavioral problems when we go to family functions. she's always embellished stories a little bit, but never flat-out told lies like this before. we suspect that there's an onset of dementia as my grandmother has an older sister who has dementia (it's so bad that she doesn't recognize the family anymore and needs constant care from my great uncle). my family is korean, so even if my grandma goes out on a daily basis, she isn't really having much human interaction, as she doesn't know enough english to hold an engaging conversation. she has hardly any stimulation, as she usually just watches tv, cooks, knits, reads books over and over again, reads the korean newspapers we bring her, and then goes out to go to her biweekly swim class. she's been doing this for the past 10 years, and even thinking of myself doing this same routine, i think i would go crazy as well.i think that having someone to talk to would greatly alleviate this (though obviously not fully cure it), but as i said, she only speaks korean. my aunt tries to meet with her when she can, but she's a small business owner and works 7 days a week. my father also tries to meet with her when he can, but he's also extremely busy with work and does all the housework as well, as my mother works even more. my cousins don't really speak enough korean to go visit her often (though we do have family gatherings maybe once a month). and though i speak a little more korean than they do, i was out of state for college and might be leaving for graduate school again in the fall. i also can't speak enough korean to really intellectually stimulate her and can't visit her every day.my family has discussed multiple times moving her into a retirement community. there are even korean ones around the area. however, she doesn't want to move into a community, as she thinks it'll curb her independence, as she is able-bodied to get around by herself. and she also hates socializing with other koreans, so we can't get her to go to korean senior activities clubs or anything like that. edit: oh, and forget about assisted living. she would hate to have someone come to her house. i suggested seeing a counselor, just so she has someone to talk to. however, seeking mental health is still a huge stigma in korea, and she keeps insisting that she's "not crazy" so why would she go see a doctor. we're just at a loss for what to do. my dad and aunt are kind of at their wits' end and are getting annoyed at her frequent phone calls. they know that she just wants a conversation, but most of the conversation just is her complaining about some problem that doesn't exist. i had a little more faith in her and was wondering if she was telling the truth and tried to check some things out, but sometimes she tells stories that just completely contradict each other, so i might just be having a hard time accepting the truth that she is mentally slipping. anyways, my dad and aunt, though they've lived in america for a majority of their lives, are pretty korean and also don't really have a good grasp on mental health. they also just have no clue about the resources available to them. i was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for what to do in this kind of situation. i know a lot of people have problems trying to get their aging parent or grandparent to get the help that they need, but i feel like there's another layer here because my grandmother is korean and can't really communicate with anyone here besides my aunt and my dad. we haven't really come across many korean doctors in the area, nonetheless korean mental health professionals. i also was wondering if anyone has any tips on helping her keep her brain active while we work on a longer-term solution. i know there are tons of apps out there that are aimed at keeping the mind active, but again, she can't read or speak english, and she also is just completely unfamiliar with technology. we got her a smartphone and set it to korean language so that she might find some books on there or text us if she wants to talk to someone, but even after teaching her multiple times, she can't use it.thank you for listening. any suggestion or even words of encouragement would help.

My Mother is Killing Herself
about 2 years ago my grandmother was officially diagnosed with alzheimer’s. my grandmother has been living with my mom and dad for about 9 years’ total at this point (she moved up to pa to be with us after my grandfather died, they were from tx).&amp;nbsp;my mom does not have a great relationship with her mother, never really has. my grandmother always was spiteful and angry that my mom wanted her to move up to pa (my grandmother was not able to keep living alone in tx after my grandfather died...)&amp;nbsp;when i was a kid my grandmother was my favorite person in the world. she always had a personality that was attention seeking, but i loved her and cherished our time together. she was beautiful, and artistic, and always doing exciting things. she was kind to me. i *can* understand when my mom tells me that growing up with her was not easy… but as it always goes, the grandkids always seem to get the best of people.&amp;nbsp; unfortunately, after my grandfather died, my grandmother cultivated a pretty intense mean streak (my mother says she always had this, but it got much worse). she would be passive aggressive and catty non-stop, mumble very mean things under her breath.  i still love her… but i began to not want to be around her (this began when she was still mentally good). i have a great deal of guilt over feeling this way, but it is reality. i do still try to spend time with her, and to sit with her, and before she got bad we would go out to eat sometimes. i have durable power of attorney for her that she signed over some years ago. i got it when she was having trouble keeping her bills straight, and i was always her favorite grandchild so i stepped up to the plate to help.&amp;nbsp;a little backstory on my mother: she is the most loving, kind, and strong person i know, but she also has ptsd from a bad thing that happened to my family about 5 years ago. she copes with taking care of my grandmother poorly (we also always have an abundance of regular family drama, as well… so that doesn’t help things). when she gets too stressed she shuts down mentally and has  terrible stomach cramps. i know my mom loves my grandmother deep down… but when i tell you my grandmother has been cruel to her for almost 7 years at this point (or longer)… it drains the life out of her. she continues to care for my grandmother day and night because she wants to honor her fathers (my grandfathers) memory by doing what she thinks is right. my mom has basically been a prisoner in her home for the past 2 years because she is afraid to leave my grandmother alone. my grandmother has almost started fires before, let the dogs run away, but now she mostly does things like flood the bathroom or get poop everywhere… or eat things off the floor.&amp;nbsp; my grandmother just recently became almost fully incontinent. i can hear the stress and pain in my mother’s voice when we talk on the phone. my mom lies to me though, and tries to play it off like it doesn’t affect her as much as it really does. for example, i know she was up at 1am last night cleaning diarrhea from the entire bathroom and my grandmother because my grandmother had an accident and forgot how to wipe properly.&amp;nbsp; i am thinking this is progressing to the point of putting my grandmother in a nursing facility… but i am so overwhelmed. everything falls on me to figure out and i think i inherited some of that “stress shutdown” because i am having a hard time trying to figure out a plan. when i mention this to my mother, she starts telling me “no nursing home”, and that she will just keep taking care of my grandmother. i think she says this out of guilt, and fear of the unknown, or fear that a nursing facility will hurt my grandmother. from the ptsd she lives in a constant state of trying to avoid fear triggering and confrontation, sometimes to the point of absurdity. i am watching my mother get worse and worse as the stress of being a caretaker is eating her alive… and i don’t know what to say to her. i don’t want to lose my mom, because she is killing herself taking care of my grandmother who at this point, mostly doesn’t exist anymore.&amp;nbsp; i would like some advice if there is any to be had. any ideas for how to approach this with my mom? i have suggested going to a support group or something before… but she refuses. this stuff stresses her out so much she tries to avoid dealing with it any more than she absolutely has to. my grandmother has a little over 120k left in savings. i know my family is going to most likely need more than this to care for her until her death. the situation gets complicated, because my aunt (my grandmother’s other child) is a truly bad person who has leeched money from my grandparents and manipulated them her entire life. i know she is going to be an issue after my grandmother dies no matter what because my grandmother’s will stipulates that my aunt gets half of her assets upon death (money and belongings) … however i don’t think there will be any money left after this disease rages on, we'll probably be in debt. i have the durable power of attorney so i know *i* am the one going to be sued no matter what… but i’ll bite that bullet when i have to (my grandmother’s care and mother’s health come first).&amp;nbsp; is there anything… any programs at all that can help pay for a nursing facility? i know they are ungodly expensive (especially here in pa). do medicare or medicade offer any help? i literally know close to nothing about these things (i am an ignorant millennial trying to do my best, please forgive me). all i know is my grandmother has about 120k saved, gets 1,000 social security a month, and i need to figure out how to stretch this money to try to get her in a place that is not a state-run abusive hellhole. i want this money to all go to my grandmother’s care…. it’s not for my terrible aunt to use to keep being unemployed. my grandmother does have nurse assistants that come over during the week to help my mom out, but she does not have anyone full time. do you think maybe a night nurse would be better? i don’t want to just ship my grandmother away, but at this point, my mother is who i need to save. i know stress and mental trauma can make people more likely to get this terrible disease… i want to help try to avoid this horror if i can for my mother (and myself…).&amp;nbsp;this was long and rambling… but thank any of you who have listened… and to any of you suffering from this disease i would reach out and hug you if i could. stay strong. (also if it matters my grandfather was in the national guard... i don't know of that helps with anything)

Venting about my Mother-In-Law
my mother-in-law clearly is getting/has dementia or alzheimer's.first of all, her mother had it and every symptom that i have read about it, she has. my husband agrees. my 10 yr old even knows that grandma isn't normal.she should not be driving. oh my god, she shouldn't be. when she enters a parking lot, she can't figure out how to exit it. she's gotten into a handful of fender benders and almost causes big accidents multiple times each time she drives. there are a million other reasons why she shouldn't be driving but i won't get into all of them.i don't allow her to drive my son. she babysat him like a year ago and he told me that she would ask him (a 9 yr old) if it was safe to back up in reverse.i have also been in the car with them and my son will say "grandma, you ran a stop sign", "you forgot your turn signal". (this was before i stopped letting her drive him.)she is going to get into a bad accident. i know this. hopefully she won't kill anyone.my husband has casually brought up his concerns of dementia with her and his dad. they just get mad and she barks out "i'm not senile!", even though that word was never brought up.she makes random comments about it too. one time my husband asked her what the name of something was. and she couldn't remember. then later on says "oh i remembered" and said rudely "see- i remembered- so i must not have alzheimer's." (even though that topic wasn't brought up in any way.) it was like she was thinking it in her head and just happened to say it out loud. like she's trying to convince her/us that she doesn't have it.another time, she randomly said that she won't get alzheimer's because she doesn't use deodorant with aluminum in it.she will run around her house all day long. literally running around in circles. on thanksgiving and xmas this past year she spent like 8 (unnecessary) hrs cooking and then when everyone eats, she forgets to eat! someone said "lets do dessert" and then it's like- wait- you didn't eat? she played it off but we all knew.she also does not stop talking. every thought that comes in her head, she has to verbalize it. she also does not stop humming. she also hums and talks at the same time. i didn't think that was possible but believe me, it is. i know that might sound innocuous but when it is that constant, it gets to you. try having a conversation with someone who is humming while you're talking to them. then get interrupted by her saying something (most likely off subject) and then many, many times she will just run out of the room when you're in the middle of a sentence. sorry i'm kind of venting here, i have a rocky relationship with her because i have a hard time dealing/coping with it.thanks for letting me vent. any advice on anything i mentioned would be nice. thanks, guys.

Venting about my Mother-In-Law
my mother-in-law clearly is getting/has dementia or alzheimer's.first of all, her mother had it and every symptom that i have read about it, she has. my husband agrees. my 10 yr old even knows that grandma isn't normal.she should not be driving. oh my god, she shouldn't be. when she enters a parking lot, she can't figure out how to exit it. she's gotten into a handful of fender benders and almost causes big accidents multiple times each time she drives. there are a million other reasons why she shouldn't be driving but i won't get into all of them.i don't allow her to drive my son. she babysat him like a year ago and he told me that she would ask him (a 9 yr old) if it was safe to back up in reverse.i have also been in the car with them and my son will say "grandma, you ran a stop sign", "you forgot your turn signal". (this was before i stopped letting her drive him.)she is going to get into a bad accident. i know this. hopefully she won't kill anyone.my husband has casually brought up his concerns of dementia with her and his dad. they just get mad and she barks out "i'm not senile!", even though that word was never brought up.she makes random comments about it too. one time my husband asked her what the name of something was. and she couldn't remember. then later on says "oh i remembered" and said rudely "see- i remembered- so i must not have alzheimer's." (even though that topic wasn't brought up in any way.) it was like she was thinking it in her head and just happened to say it out loud. like she's trying to convince her/us that she doesn't have it.another time, she randomly said that she won't get alzheimer's because she doesn't use deodorant with aluminum in it.she will run around her house all day long. literally running around in circles. on thanksgiving and xmas this past year she spent like 8 (unnecessary) hrs cooking and then when everyone eats, she forgets to eat! someone said "lets do dessert" and then it's like- wait- you didn't eat? she played it off but we all knew.she also does not stop talking. every thought that comes in her head, she has to verbalize it. she also does not stop humming. she also hums and talks at the same time. i didn't think that was possible but believe me, it is. i know that might sound innocuous but when it is that constant, it gets to you. try having a conversation with someone who is humming while you're talking to them. then get interrupted by her saying something (most likely off subject) and then many, many times she will just run out of the room when you're in the middle of a sentence. sorry i'm kind of venting here, i have a rocky relationship with her because i have a hard time dealing/coping with it.thanks for letting me vent. any advice on anything i mentioned would be nice. thanks, guys.

i hate everything so much right now;
i hate that stupid blank look she gets on her face when she doesn't understand something, i hate that empty open-mouthed stare she has when she's looking around because every day the same damn spot in the kitchen is new to her, i hate that growing up the only time i got to spend with her was the two weeks in the summer when she'd come to town for the family reunion but now that circumstances have changed and we can spend time with her, she's like *this*, and she won't even remember it. i hate that she asks a million questions but she can't pay attention long enough to hear the answer and as soon as you're done, she'll most likely ask the same question again. i hate that she can't just sit still in the car, she has to touch everything around her and dig in her purse from the time we get in the car til it's time to get out because every few minutes, everything in her purse is brand new to her; sometimes she doesn't even remember that it is her purse. i hate that she can't remember putting perfume or lipstick on, so she puts more on every few minutes and winds up looking and smelling like a four-year-old playing dressup. i hate that she's lived out here for longer than i've even been alive, and she couldn't even tell you how to get to the corner from where you are. i hate that she tries to tap the people on tv's shoulders to get their attention so she can wave at them. i hate that she can't understand that she can't eat whatever she wants cause her dentures are messed up. i hate that we can't take her out to eat anywhere because i'm worried she'll gross out other patrons when she spits her food out in her hand. i hate that she puts the spit-out food on the side of her plate and then forgets that and eats it again. i hate that she can't use the bathroom on her own. i hate that she can't even feel herself peeing on herself. i hate that she can't remember her stepson (my uncle) when he looks so much like her husband she was married to for so long. i hate that she keeps forgetting that different family members have passed on and if someone reminds her she's all :o . i hate that she can't watch anything on tv other than mindless things like episodes of family feud over and over and over and over or else she won't understand what's going on and thinks it's real and gets upset. i hate that she can go vote, but she can't even remember who's running. i hate that she can tell people she's got a lot of kids and that my mom is the baby girl, but gets that lost look on her face if someone asks how many kids she's got. nine. "i've got 9 kids, and grandchildren up to the sixth generation" she used to say. that wasn't even a year ago. now she can't even remember that her son came to visit for four days for her birthday two months ago; we all went and picked him up from the airport, and now it's like it never even happened. she can't remember the date she got married. she can't remember the year she was born; if you ask her, she'll say the right month and day, but then for the year she'll say 2000-something. she had some bank business to do yesterday, and when mom took her, they asked her to sign some papers, and it took 10 minutes to get her to sign in the right spot, and then another 10 minutes to actually sign it because after signing her name perfectly in beautiful cursive, not shaky or going up/down-hill, she couldn't remember how to write the same letters in print in order to print her name. mom kept having to show her a piece of mail with her name on it so she could copy it letter by letter.

Support/advice for grandma with dementia
hi everyone,my grandma has been living with dementia for 5 years. it started with her seeing spirits. as time progressed she stopped being able to cook and would forget to eat and drink water. she was in ca and i i had just moved to tx. my uncle was taking care of her. making sure she had groceries and she was well enough to live at home with some assistance from family. a few months ago she went really downhill and started leaving her apartment in the middle of the night and getting lost. she would interact with the people in the tv and stopped taking her blood pressure medication to the point where her legs swelled. my mom and i flew to ca and the doctor said it was time for her to be in a nursing home. it was a hard decision because she was happy in her apartment but it wasn't feasible anymore she had lost 40lb and needed round the clock care. we went back to ca packed grandma up and moved her to a nursing home that is just 3 miles from us. she was very unhappy when she got to the nursing home a month ago. we see her everyday. decorated her room to look like her apartment. made sure she had the same movies she was watching at her apartment so she could interact with the same people in the tv. we put her pictures all over her room and made sure she had all her favorite foods. she was so unhappy that she stopped eating. she was drinking some water but has not eaten more than a few bites of banana and cheese in a month. she is so weak that today when i saw her she couldn't walk and i had to carry her. she can barely talk. i think she has now stopped drinking water. it's so hard to see her like this. has anyone gone through this and how much longer do you think she could possibly have? everyday she seems far worse than the day before. her face is sunken in and she looks completely different. i'm devastated. the doctor gave her anti depressants and a drug to help with her appetite but i don't think she could eat without a tube because she is so weak now. any advice or anything i can do to help her in this time? i really need it. she is like a mother to me. she helped raise me. she was the one who took me to school and cooked my breakfast and dinner. she was the most happy positive person i have ever known. tlrd: grandma went into nursing home. has refused to eat in a month and is quickly declining. need advice on what i can do.

Upcoming doctor's appointment for father [UK]
edit: sorry, realised this is bit epic. thowaway because step-sisters!hi all!my father (82) has been suffering from memory issues for about a year. it started with forgetting words during conversations - he tends to 're-phrase' around the problem or substitute something that sounds somewhat familiar but doesn't make sense. the memory issues have escalated into confusion about day to day events.he is/has:* quite often unable to remember whether he has taken medication. * often confused about time; generally thinking that upcoming events are going to happen much sooner than in reality.* taken to sleeping in his clothes, claiming to be cold.* sometimes gets confused between people - he sometimes talks to me about me as though i'm not there.* usually sleeps excessively during the evening (before going to bed very early).&amp;nbsp;a lot of this is quite variable - some days are a lot better than others. the severity of the problem also usually gets worse during the day and also under stress.&amp;nbsp;he's been referred by his doctor to have a ct scan and from there to a rice clinic (specifically it is a 'memory clinic') to see a consultant. he's had various verbal tests ('how many months in the year?', 'what is 100 minus 7?' etc.) - he apparently did not do very well. the consultant appointment is at the end of the month and both my step-mother and myself will be there. i'm pretty sure he's heading for some kind of dementia diagnosis. can anyone advise what is likely to happen at the appointment (it is 60-90 mins apparently) or make suggestions as to useful things i should ask about?&amp;nbsp;to complicate the fact that this is happening now (and to add stress), there is also a house move coming up. they are downsizing substantially and my step-mother has found a quite appropriate flat in the centre of town. he usually suggests to her that he is ok with living there but whenever he talks to me, or anyone else, he insists that he doesn't want to and will move to the town where he grew up (on his own). he seems to flip-flop between the two possibilities. i don't know if maintaining the two options in his head is a fantasy that is caused by his illness or whether there is some legitimate basis to either of them. personally, i don't feel he will be able to manage although with external care/supervision it might be possible. i'm having a lot of difficulty determining whether he should be allowed to explore the option or whether he lacks the capability to make this decision on his own. i should like to bring this up with the doctor - but since my step-mother is going to be there, just mentioning it (and suggesting i am even entertaining the idea) is going to be highly confrontational. is this kind of flip-floping between outcomes a common symptom? is it common to want to relocate to where you grew up?thanks in advance for any help or suggestions!!

Could my grandma have Alzheimer's?
my grandma lives in a remote village in a country with a very poor healthcare system. she's 71 and physically healthy but for the past 10 years she has some very disturbing symptoms that are getting worse. i have stayed over with her about 2-3 weeks every year and these are some of her symptoms: * she sees black butterflies and dots that appear from the corner of her eye, which appear bout every hour or so. * she hears a constant static noise that doesn't go away. * her short memory span is about two minute long. she forgets everything and all of the time. i was talking to my mom on the phone for about 10 minutes and my grandma asked me 4 times who i was on the phone with.* her long term memory has also deteriorated. she repeats about a half a dozen scenes from her childhood over and over again, but as the months pass by, she changes some portions of the story. * she makes stuff up all the time. she talks about meeting people who have either never lived (like fictional characters) or who are long dead (like lenin). she also makes stuff up about my life that never happened, or forgets important milestones, like she thinks that i am still in high school when in fact i have graduated 15 years ago and i'm a phd student now. * she also talks to herself a lot. her speech is coherent in general, but she does jump from one subject to another constantly. for example, she could be talking about her late father and then suddenly switch to asking about when the weather outside, and then move on to asking where her jewelry is. * she has problems recognizing people on the photos. i took a picture of the two of us yesterday evening and showed it to her about an hour ago and she could see it but couldn't recognize herself or me in it. * she doesn't remember some very basic facts either. we were watching news yesterday and the explosion in istanbul was on and she turned around and asked me what language people in istanbul speak because it sounded familiar to ours. her father was turkish and she studied in istanbul when she was my age. * she doesn't remember how to cook or bake anymore. she can only boil some potatoes and make some tea for herself. but she used be an excellent cook and would be hired as a pastry chef at local weddings for over 45 years.* her mood changes very quickly. she can talk about her father's death and start laughing all of a sudden.* she can't discuss complicated issues anymore. for example, she can't grasp the idea of political parties and the process of presidential elections anymore, but she can talk about simple things like favorite shoes that we got her some few years ago. she once spoke about them for a full hour in our car ride.could these be symptoms of alzheimer's? she doesn't want anyone to get her to doctors and wants to be left alone. also, because the healthcare system is very poor in my home country, i can't find anyone who could diagnose her, but i would still like to know what is going on with her. any feedback is welcomed

is this dementia, or...?
he's always had anger problems anyway, so i don't know if this is him being normal or the anger is designed to stop us questioning things that are genuinely problematic. here are two examples:- dad is given a repeat prescription to drop off at the doctors. leaves in his car, comes back.- days later, the surgery says that no repeat prescription was filed. i ask him about it and he says i never asked him to go, i never gave him the prescription.- we find the prescription in his pocket. he says he must've forgotten to put it in.- i asked what he did that day when he drove off in his car- did he forget in the drive what he went for? did he not wonder why he was in the car?- he got angry and said that what he did with his own time was his business and he wouldn't explain to us what he did.december- dad is asked to give our cat her de-fleaing tablet. he gives her a tablet then asks me what we give her for fleas. i say that we just gave her it and he said no, that was a de-worming tablet.- i ask why he gave her a dewormer when i told him she had fleas. he said that she didn't get one last month. i ask what we are going to do about the fleas because she needs a de-fleaing. he says that we have run out of deflea tablets. i say that we need to get more.- he checks the tablets and says that he did give her a deflea tablet. gets very annoyed when i try to check what exactly he gave her. when i remind him that he just told me that he gave her a dewormer, he gets angry and says he has now told me he gave her a de flea tablet so i should stop worrying. i say i am worried because he seems confused about what he gave her. he is very angry.- he says that if he told me he got on a bus on rails i should know that he means a train. i say that if he confused a bus and a train i would want to double-check what medicine he just gave my kids.these kind of things worry me because it's like he forgets what he's doing in a second, he literally walked downstairs then asked me what we use to deflea the cat. you just gave her the tablet! he drove off to the doctors, which is 30 seconds away...yet forgot in that time what he was driving for. this worries me because if i forgot what i was doing in the car i would ask people until i worked it out. but he just took it as normal that he forgot why he was there, and drove back.in other ways he seems completely normal. he's quite high on the autism spectrum so he's always had problems with compassion, empathy and social situations. he did take a memory test at the doctors but it seems to be things like, what year is it. he can tell you that! he can tell you the year, the date, current politics, etc. but then he can walk into a room that i've decorated for christmas, and get upset that i have moved something 6 inches- without realising that the entire room has been tidied and decorated. all he sees is that his one thing has been slightly moved, and he can't see the context- that the entire room has been decorated, and maybe that explains why his thing was moved.

I think my mom is slipping
my mom is 65 years old and is third generation irish if that has any role in this. we always teased my mom about her memory.  calling one son by another son's name. stuff like that.  i don't have a good family history because her mom died early and her father was an alcoholic.  two of her siblings died early and she isn't in contact with the one remaining brother. lately, i've noticed some behavior changes.  she talks a lot more. she is constantly babbling and switching topics. some are legit segues while others are hard for me to follow.  originally i thought she had some sort of mental illness but some incidents over the past few days have me wondering.  i had a catered business event the other night and stopped to check in on my parents between work and the event. she offered to cook me something at least 6 times. i wrote this off to a mom being a mom. yesterday, my wife and i went on a day trip with my parents and she asked what bubble tea is. my wife told her and said she understood. 15 minutes later, she walks into a shop and asks them.  we ran into a family we grew up with and two times in the course of 10 minutes, she explained how my wife and i announced our elopement.  we also went on a horse and buggy ride which was all of 5 minutes and she told the driver twice about her dogs. my wife is a super smart woman who has a lot of experience working with intellectually disabled people due autism, mental health issues, and traumatic brain injury but mostly kids and young adults. her grandmother also had alzheimers. my mom's behavior threw a bunch of red flags for her.  she said we need to keep an eye on it.  originally, i thought my mom talked so much because of some sort of narcissistic behavior.  my wife thinks maybe she forgets or needs a constant stream of words. are there "first sign" resources?  how do i even broach this subject with my mom and dad?

I don't know what to do about my dad.
tl;dr: i just need to talk about my dad. i don't know what to do. his doctors say nothing is wrong, and my mom just takes them at their word. i'm home with him all day, everyday. *there is something wrong with my dad*, and i just don't know what, if anything, i can even do to help.my dad is just shy of his 73rd birthday, has cognitive issues that haven't been diagnosed, and a major hearing problem. anyone who talks to him for more than thirty seconds can tell there's something off about him, something that isn't all there. my mom has taken him to see neurologists and been with him to his visits with his primary care doctor, but from how she tells it, they all just kind of shrug and say "well he seems fine to us!" he has hearing aids, but refuses to wear them. i'm his 28 year old daughter, and my young son and i currently live with them after my breakup with my son's father. i'm not officially his caregiver, but i'm home all day during the week, partly because i care for my son, and partly to make sure if something happens to my dad, there's someone around to help. obviously, i'm not privy to all of his medical information, i can only go off of what my mom tells me. she goes with him to his appointments now, partly because he can't/wont give her any information from the doctors, and partly because we don't really trust him to drive safely anymore. more than that, when he would take the car to go places, he is out for much *much* longer than you'd think it'd take to go places, driving god-knows-where.even now, he will just straight up leave the house and catch the bus to what he says is the hardware store, but is gone for hours at a time. we try asking him about where he goes and what he spends the money on, and he either can't or won't tell us much beyond 'i went to the hardware store'. sometimes he comes back with stuff, sometimes he doesn't. when he goes out, he almost *always* goes to the bank (not the atm anymore, my mom had to take away his debit card. he would get anywhere from $40-80 out of the machine, and come home with no money and nothing more than two or three packs of cigarettes to show for it, and my parents *cannot afford* for someone to be draining their bank account like that once or more a week). he still manages to get money out of the bank, despite the fact that my mom will *always* give him cash to buy whatever he needs, or take him out once she gets home to get what he needs with *her* debit card. and still he comes home with his money all spent and little if anything to show for it. it's impossible to tell if he's lying to avoid having to say what he's spending the money on, or if he genuinely can't remember. i tend to think he doesn't remember, but my mom usually tries to make it out like my dad's just suddenly *decided* to be the way he is now.when questioned too intensely about things, or when you can't get him to understand why he can't do something, he tends to get incredibly angry. he has hearing aids, but refuses to wear them. talking to him is almost impossible without them in, and even with his hearing aids, you're still not sure of what he's understanding. i've taken to writing important things down, but there's many times when i'm *still* just not sure i've gotten through. he wanders around the house all day, either doing his minor woodworking projects in his workshop in the garage, playing solitaire on his computer, or watching tv. my mom gives him a list of minor chores to do throughout the day, but every day without fail he misses one or two things. even when i remind him, "hey, dad, could you feed the cats?" there's still a good chance he'll get halfway through the task without finishing it. it now takes him two full days to do laundry, where even just a month ago he was able to get his and some of my mom's laundry done in a single day. he *insists* on working in his shop, and will get belligerently (near violently) angry at the mere notion of taking that away from him, despite the fact that he's already cut himself *very* badly twice in the last year. he has these near-constant repetitive vocal mannerisms that he says throughout the *entire* day, and i'm not sure if he's even aware he's speaking. just constantly, "yeah" and "okay now". all day. he talks at anyone who will listen about anything going on in his mind, which is fine, i guess, but it's a clearly one-sided conversation. he either doesn't hear or doesn't understand anything you say to him in response. it's not *impossible* to get your point across, but casual conversation is nearly nonexistent. he forgets to eat unless i either make him breakfast/lunch or pointedly leave things out so he'll 'remember' on his own. my son is four, and not very close with my dad because of how my dad is, and more frequently than i'd ever want to see, my dad will ask my son for a hug, my son will refuse (i don't make my son hug anyone he doesn't want to, that's not the issue), and my dad will call him a bad little boy. and there's nothing i can say or write down to my dad that changes anything. i just try to explain to my son that grandpa's got problems with his brain, and he can't help his behavior etc etc. he's also, within the last few years, been arrested for groping two women in a convenience store. it got swept under the rug, he plead no contest and didn't have to register as a sex offender. to hear him tell it, he doesn't even remember it happening, but there was video evidence from the store. i just don't know what to do. i feel like if my mom were to push for *some* kind of validating diagnosis from *some* kind of doctor, then at least we would know *if* there's even any treatment available to help him. or if there's anything my mom and i as his caregivers can do to make things easier around the house for everyone. just... anything, honestly. i have two older siblings, but none of my please for help from them have come to anything. i don't even really have a question. if anyone has any insight, it would be appreciated. i know this was long, but thanks for reading if you've gotten this far. i feel like a wrung-out dishrag.

Sudden change in mood
mom, who has alzheimer's and a bit of vascular dementia is in a nursing home. for the first 2 months she was there i would receive 20+ calls a day, all of them hostile, nasty and accusing. "how dare you leave me here," that sort of thing. then suddenly...nothing. she didn't call for days. i visited her as normal, every 2-3 days, and when i saw her next she was delighted to see me and grateful and all kinds of wonderful things that were very unlike her.as an aside mom has always been a bit of a narcissist. she also has a large helping of entitlement and can be awfully needy. even when i was a little kid, when she felt bad it was my fault. anyway.for nearly a year mom has been happy and well adjusted at the nursing home. she's way more social and talkative and even got into the activities. it was stunning and a huge relief.suddenly, about a week ago, she became moody and a bit nasty and started talking about her old home. she wanted to go back. she hadn't mentioned it once in months. i deflected her hoping she'd forget. she might have, by now. hard to say. but when i went to visit her last time, she was awful. she said that on the phone i told her i was done with her. why was i visiting if i was done with her? she was upset and kept saying over and over "it was your voice! your voice! that's what i heard!"i don't doubt it's a confabulation. my question is about this sudden mood change. nothing has changed in the nursing home. she gets great care from permanent staff who have come to know her and the residents there are either nice or just keep to themselves. does anyone have any insight? is this just another sign of the illness progressing?thanks in advance.edit: checked with mom's care staff. uti was tested for, result was negative.

Mother shows various signs of dementia, how can I get her to recognise her problems?
my mother is 57 and has been showing signs of memory loss among other things for over a year. it started off as just general laziness and forgetfulness but it's been progressively getting worse. she forgets entire conversations, repeats the same stories and facts to me on a daily basis, eats terribly (never cooks, and if she does she forgets the food and it burns). she is also to put this bluntly extremely lazy and has a hoarding mentality. &amp;nbsp;she wants to move from our house to a bungalow because she has a bad back from an accident a few years ago. with the help of my partner i've been doing all i can to clean the place up and get it presentable for sale. she does extremely little to help and will just push junk around from place to place and hide it from me so i don't throw it away. when i point out that she, for example; doesnt need 10 ceramic jugs and that have been hidden away, with no sentimental value or purpose, she will deflect addressing the question of " do you need all of these? " and try to either insult me, or point out how i've got say, a letter near the same spot that's mine ( of course this is her trying to say, if your crap is here mine can be too! ) i think this stems from a extreme attempt at 'saving money' as she will try to justify keeping anything in a specific order of; &amp;nbsp;&gt; i was going to use that for x, y, z&gt;that's not mine it was nans ( my nan of course, )&gt; oh i like it&gt; that was from when x, y , z happened x amount of years ago. &amp;nbsp;all of which as you can see, have no real solid basis on why keeping a large variety of dusty cermic jugs make sense. &amp;nbsp;as well as the forgetfullness and hoarding i am expected to do everything financial for her. she forgot to get vehicle tax for 9 months this year, because i didn't do it for her. (i wasn't even aware she forgot about this because she usually does it at the post office). i'm expected to set up everything online, do her car insurance, transfer money, set up direct debits, order items etc, it's gotten to the point where i've even had to do certain training courses for her work for her, not to mention she doesn't even know how much money she has in any of her bank accounts. she has a pension lump sum, and a few savings accounts and i'm in full control of them all and am the sole one who knows how much is in each one. if i hadn't taken this firm stance into knowing the financial details no doubt she would continue to waste money on her hoarding habits, at least this way i can try to dictate her how best to spend her money in order to secure a better house in the future with as much captial left for anything post-purchase. &amp;nbsp;she even got a laptop and promised to learn herself but everytime i tried to teach her she would make little effort and look away from the screen. i even wrote down instructions but she just refuses to learn anything for herself,  the same goes for anything new, including basic things such as car insurance comparison, i'm expected to do it, otherwise she'll leave it and she'll pay more money by staying with the same company, a very strange contrast of behaviour considering how incredibly greedy and frugal she can be. &amp;nbsp;one of the worst examples of her 'greedy' nature is whenever our dog has to go to the vets and there is a price tag attached that she isn't expecting, the first reaction is never ever about the dog's wellbeing, it is always about " how much do you cost me ", " i could have gone on holiday with how much you cost " all in a polite sarcastic voice toward the dog, but this on top of her other frugal behaviour makes it obvious deep down she resents taking financial responsibilty for him. &amp;nbsp;i feel sorry for her because she knows deep down she is having problems but at the same time she has been very abusive to me when i was a child, so i'm now finding it extremely hard to put up with all the pressure she puts on me to live her life for her. i wouldn't mind so much but she expects me to do her things for her and is horrible if i do not do them in the time she wants them done in (when she actually remembers). i'm finding it extremely difficult to help her as she just expects me to live her life for her so she can sit in front of the tv and just sail through life. &amp;nbsp;i've tried on numerous occasions to get her to realise she is having problems and seek help but she is in complete denial and ends up being horrible and upsets me to get me off her case. i'm coming to my wits end trying to help someone that cannot even listen to me respectfully. at this point if i had the funds to move out and leave i would not hessitate. i've been considering going to the doctors and asking them to speak to her, but she would no doubt punish me at a later date for this. any advice is greately appreciated as i have 0 experience dealing with this, all i know is that i can't keep living like this.

i need help convincing my mom to seek help
hi everyone, i'm new to this subreddit, so i apologize if this topic has come up already. but i'm in desperate need for help. my mom, who is 71, almost 72, has shown signs of dementia i'd say as early as 60 years old. it was very minor back then, but i'd say in the last 2-4 years, it's gotten significantly worse. my mom is in complete denial about it and/or is just completely scared. she watched her own mom succumb to the disease 27 years ago. it was never diagnosed as alzheimer, although i've had my doubts that she might have be misdiagnosed. either way, she watched her own mother go through it and i can tell she is terrified of it happening to her. but that's the problem. it is happening to her. she is somewhat aware of it and admits that it's a problem, but only "when she's stressed". otherwise, she thinks she's totally fine. one of my sisters, my dad and myself had a gentle "intervention" with her 2 years ago which got her to go to a neurologist. she did have a mri to rule out any kind of strokes or any signs of possible alzheimer's. according to her, everything came back normal. however, we can't fully trust that she told us everything truthfully because part of the appointment she was alone and it wasn't until later that my dad finally joined. my sister (the one at the intervention) brought it up to her again last night and said that my mom was on the defensive almost immediately and got really mad/upset and kicked her out of her room. do any of you have any suggestions to help us convince her to go back to the doctor's? are there any treatments such as medications, therapies, etc she could try that might help? i know there is no cure and most alzheimer medications only help in prolonging the onset of more symptoms, but don't stop them completely. are medications out of the question since it hasn't been diagnosed as alzheimer? *i should describe her symptoms: she has excellent long term memory. like scary good. but her short term memory seems so minimal. she's gotten to the point where she asks us the same questions multiple times in one day. sometimes within minutes of each other. she has to leave notes around the house to remind her of things constantly. she will completely forget conversations and will adamantly deny things, despite me having evidence (example, she left a voicemail on my phone and when i played it for her, she claimed that wasn't her and someone was impersonating her). and don't get me started on the repeated stories. she hasn't lost the ability to do activities of daily living, and she's still able to drive, however, she's too uncomfortable to drive anywhere outside of her own town. her personality has changed too. she's almost reclusive and her once social life as dwindled down to 1 solid friend/neighbor and maybe a handful of other people she occasionally interacts with. she's become very judgmental and kind of angry with everyone but especially to her kids. i understand that everyone can suffer from the repeated story syndrome. i'm super guilty of it too, especially with mommy brain. but this is so much different from that. please help!!

Mother With Early Onset (Really Early. She's 50) Going downhill fast. [Rant]
this is more of a rant to just help me alleviate my own stress over this whole messed up situation. i've had to watch this happen to my mother, up close and personally, over the past 9 months and i'm not sure how much more i can take.i've posted here before. my mother was diagnosed with ftd in september of last year, and in january of 2016 i moved her in with me. she had noticeable problems for about 3 years before the diagnosis, ultimately leading to the dr's prognosis of ftd with signs of alzheimers and early onset dementia.  we have a large family, and my mother has 8 brothers and sisters.  but they all agreed that she should move in with me, her 30 year old son.  if one of my brothers (i don't have any sisters) ever got early onset dementia and it came to the point where they had to be taken care of... and they had a late 20's son or daughter.. i would never expect their children to take care of them!  the fact that my family and i had to argue for almost 4 hours straight and eventually they all decided for me that it was in everyone's best interest that she moves in with me was infuriating, and one of the hardest decisions i've ever had to make.   and it's killing me.  after 9 months i have officially feel like i have no life whatsoever. all of my prospects for girlfriends have gone down the drain as soon as they find out about this situation.  i have had to turn down job opportunities because my mother is in a grey area in her disability at this point, in the sense that she's considered too young to be moved in to full-time care senior living facilities (not to mention i don't want her institutionalized.. yet. she is still a long way away from being a 'shell', as they say) and everyone who just looks at her thinks she's fine.  talk to her - ask her questions, etc - and it's a totally different story.it's absolutely heartbreaking and a bit terrifying because i know there's a possibility this could be me some day. and if it is , and i get the exact same thing, then that means my life is more than halfway over already! and instead of pursuing my own dreams and ambitions, i'm burdened by the daily care of my mother, whom i love and care for deeply but gd when do i get to live my life??so her sisters do help.. they call doctors, make appointments, handle paperwork. i'm truly grateful for their help. it wasn't easy agreeing to have mom move in with me. i pretty much knew this was going to happen (not everything, but most of it). the good news is i have secured a golden opportunity in the form of adult day care. we're starting mom off at 2 days a week in about a month. she'll have 16 hours a week at this wonderful facility where she will have at least 10 activities per day to keep her occupied. and what's even better, the facility workers have agreed to basically lie to her and tell her she is an employee there, so she feels like she has a sense of purpose and that she's actually helping other people. mom always loved to help other people. still does.now, the 'going downhill fast part'...mom's been through several phases, the most recent one being extreme clingy-ness. she wouldn't last alone on a pre-arranged activity for more than 5 minutes before venturing into my home-office and interrupting my work.oh yeah, did i mention that i got extremely lucky and secured a contract to work-from home 3 months before my mom had to move in? it wasn't planned, just sort of miraculously happened that way. there are 2 contracts total and they renew on a monthly basis... so at any given moment in time i could be royally screwed if a contact isn't renewed. i'm working towards a full-time gig but that would only happen if my mother went to adult day-care 5 days a week and i had someone at the house for any 2-3 hour periods where i might be home late from work, etc. i can't even begin to think of getting a full-time job until the medicaid goes through. my brothers live with me, too. but they are younger than me and quite frankly they only help when i force them to. they're good guys but i wish they would be more proactive in their help.  it's more like, "hey i absolutely 100% need to go do this freelance gig today to pay the bills and make some money, so you have to watch mom and the dog today" and they have no choice but to agree.  and when i get home it's instantly all dumped on me again. they're getting better, though. no real complaints. i am the oldest after all.anyway, back to the downhill descent into madness. of course it's heartbreaking and i feel so sad for her that i just can't even begin to explain in words how much i wish this had never happened, or that one day i would wake up and i could just get my mother back, and everything could go back to normal and i could resume my life journey. but i know that's not going to happen. i'm a realist. i know where this is going. my long term plan for mom is that she lives at home with us as long as feasibly possible. i want her to experience the last remaining remnants of her fleeting lucidity with her family. with her loved ones. until the last recognizable thought escapes her mind and she can no longer formulate a sentence. until faces and names become trace memories and all that remains is not my mother, but just... i want her to be happy and comfortable. i want her to believe everything will be alright. and then when that fateful day comes and she asks me, "who are you?" then i will know that it is time.i also watch her 8 year old son once every other weekend for 2 days, as is the current custody and visitation agreement. i won't even go into the details of how messed up that whole situation is, but just know that it doesn't make things easier. and quite frankly, her 8 year old son, and the time she is still allowed to spend with him, might possibly be the only thing holding her back from going off the deep end. teetering on the edge of absolute madness, i strongly believe her love and affection for this 8 year old little half-brother of mine is what's still keeping her fragile psyche in-tact.  but i won't go there... i wouldn't dare think of separating my mother from him, and i shudder to think what would happen if that were the case.the reason i say she's going downhill fast is because these phases of dementia are becoming clear to me the more research i do.  and the current phase she has just entered is the most unsettling and scary phase i have encountered yet. she's started talking to people that aren't there. it started with quiet mumbling and slowly but surely the volume began increasing to where i could hear the pops and whistles of her ps and s's. "who are you talking to?" i would ask. "just myself"....    "oh."driving to the grocery store and the semi-audible self-conversations start again. i turn up the radio volume. she increases her own volume. "mom. can you please stop talking to yourself??"  i get a bit irritated and ask her with a bit of annoyance in my voice. "i'm just talking to myself, do you have a problem with that?"  how am i supposed to respond?? i tell her "no, i guess not but can you please try to keep it down it's annoying me"  she shuts up for now, but now i made her angry and when we get to the grocery store she refuses to put anything in the cart or help me, so we only buy 2 things and just get the hell out of there before she causes some type of scene. people look at me and her as she walks angrily with her arms crossed, spouting nonsense to herself almost inaudibly, but just enough to make people notice.  i'm not embarrassed at all, just angry. angry at myself for making her angry it's not her fault after all.. today. i woke up just early enough to catch mom before she goes outside. we have an extremely loud alarm system but i forgot to set it last night and i'm currently home alone with just her and the dog. thankfully the doors beep so i could hear her opening the door and i intercept.  i agree to let her walk the dog, watch her carefully through the windows, then lock everything back up once she's back inside. she's allowed to go for 15 minute walks in the back yard, but i still have to watch her so i try to limit them when i'm attempting to get work done. it's an extremely stressful situation.  i got tired and took a nap on the couch. the dog got up on the couch and laid on top of me. it was a sublime, peaceful moment as i faded into sleep, almost forgetting about my situation for a moment.when i woke up i could hear mom's voice coming from the kitchen. she was sweeping the floor before i fell asleep, but all sounds of cleaning had since subsided. "she's the devil." i clearly heard her say as i started to wake up. "you know who she is? she's the devil. and she killed the devil. killed it and went *some type of attacking noise* and cut it's head off. she cut off the devil's head but she is the devil. i'm going to kill all of the demons. no more demons because she's the devil, that's right"as i returned to full consciousness and began understanding what she was saying from the kitchen, i decided to secretly record it. i only got about 30 seconds before the dog woke up and made her 'snap out of it'. but what i got was pretty much the same as what i just wrote above. more talk about her ex-husband's new girlfriend being, "the devil" and how she killed the devil and demons, etc etc. very bizarre and unsettling stuff. and she responds to nobody, too. "and i killed the demons. uh huh, that's right. *little laugh* yup. no, it's okay. lots of demons. millions of demons"   wtf?!?!??!she's just standing there in the middle of the kitchen, broom in one hand, dustpan in the other, frozen in place spouting nonsense to an invisible individual.i really hope this is a phase because it is officially the scariest phase yet. i joke with her about it, try to get her to stop, but now.. i just don't know. i set her up on a coloring book before coming to write this, but i bet with 100% certainty that if i snuck upstairs quietly right now i would hear her talking to herself again this very moment. okay, rant over. time for me to return to the madness. wish me luck.

it wasn't planned, just sort of miraculously happened that way. there are 2 contracts total and they renew on a monthly basis... so at any given moment in time i could be royally screwed if a contact isn't renewed. i'm working towards a full-time gig but that would only happen if my mother went to adult day-care 5 days a week and i had someone at the house for any 2-3 hour periods where i might be home late from work, etc. i can't even begin to think of getting a full-time job until the medicaid goes through. my brothers live with me, too. but they are younger than me and quite frankly they only help when i force them to. they're good guys but i wish they would be more proactive in their help.  it's more like, "hey i absolutely 100% need to go do this freelance gig today to pay the bills and make some money, so you have to watch mom and the dog today" and they have no choice but to agree.  and when i get home it's instantly all dumped on me again. they're getting better, though. no real complaints. i am the oldest after all.anyway, back to the downhill descent into madness. of course it's heartbreaking and i feel so sad for her that i just can't even begin to explain in words how much i wish this had never happened, or that one day i would wake up and i could just get my mother back, and everything could go back to normal and i could resume my life journey. but i know that's not going to happen. i'm a realist. i know where this is going. my long term plan for mom is that she lives at home with us as long as feasibly possible. i want her to experience the last remaining remnants of her fleeting lucidity with her family. with her loved ones. until the last recognizable thought escapes her mind and she can no longer formulate a sentence. until faces and names become trace memories and all that remains is not my mother, but just... i want her to be happy and comfortable. i want her to believe everything will be alright. and then when that fateful day comes and she asks me, "who are you?" then i will know that it is time.i also watch her 8 year old son once every other weekend for 2 days, as is the current custody and visitation agreement. i won't even go into the details of how messed up that whole situation is, but just know that it doesn't make things easier. and quite frankly, her 8 year old son, and the time she is still allowed to spend with him, might possibly be the only thing holding her back from going off the deep end. teetering on the edge of absolute madness, i strongly believe her love and affection for this 8 year old little half-brother of mine is what's still keeping her fragile psyche in-tact.  but i won't go there... i wouldn't dare think of separating my mother from him, and i shudder to think what would happen if that were the case.the reason i say she's going downhill fast is because these phases of dementia are becoming clear to me the more research i do.  and the current phase she has just entered is the most unsettling and scary phase i have encountered yet. she's started talking to people that aren't there. it started with quiet mumbling and slowly but surely the volume began increasing to where i could hear the pops and whistles of her ps and s's. "who are you talking to?" i would ask. "just myself"....    "oh."driving to the grocery store and the semi-audible self-conversations start again. i turn up the radio volume. she increases her own volume. "mom. can you please stop talking to yourself??"  i get a bit irritated and ask her with a bit of annoyance in my voice. "i'm just talking to myself, do you have a problem with that?"  how am i supposed to respond?? i tell her "no, i guess not but can you please try to keep it down it's annoying me"  she shuts up for now, but now i made her angry and when we get to the grocery store she refuses to put anything in the cart or help me, so we only buy 2 things and just get the hell out of there before she causes some type of scene. people look at me and her as she walks angrily with her arms crossed, spouting nonsense to herself almost inaudibly, but just enough to make people notice.  i'm not embarrassed at all, just angry. angry at myself for making her angry it's not her fault after all.. today. i woke up just early enough to catch mom before she goes outside. we have an extremely loud alarm system but i forgot to set it last night and i'm currently home alone with just her and the dog. thankfully the doors beep so i could hear her opening the door and i intercept.  i agree to let her walk the dog, watch her carefully through the windows, then lock everything back up once she's back inside. she's allowed to go for 15 minute walks in the back yard, but i still have to watch her so i try to limit them when i'm attempting to get work done. it's an extremely stressful situation.  i got tired and took a nap on the couch. the dog got up on the couch and laid on top of me. it was a sublime, peaceful moment as i faded into sleep, almost forgetting about my situation for a moment.when i woke up i could hear mom's voice coming from the kitchen. she was sweeping the floor before i fell asleep, but all sounds of cleaning had since subsided. "she's the devil." i clearly heard her say as i started to wake up. "you know who she is? she's the devil. and she killed the devil. killed it and went *some type of attacking noise* and cut it's head off. she cut off the devil's head but she is the devil. i'm going to kill all of the demons. no more demons because she's the devil, that's right"as i returned to full consciousness and began understanding what she was saying from the kitchen, i decided to secretly record it. i only got about 30 seconds before the dog woke up and made her 'snap out of it'. but what i got was pretty much the same as what i just wrote above. more talk about her ex-husband's new girlfriend being, "the devil" and how she killed the devil and demons, etc etc. very bizarre and unsettling stuff. and she responds to nobody, too. "and i killed the demons. uh huh, that's right. *little laugh* yup. no, it's okay. lots of demons. millions of demons"   wtf?!?!??!she's just standing there in the middle of the kitchen, broom in one hand, dustpan in the other, frozen in place spouting nonsense to an invisible individual.i really hope this is a phase because it is officially the scariest phase yet. i joke with her about it, try to get her to stop, but now.. i just don't know. i set her up on a coloring book before coming to write this, but i bet with 100% certainty that if i snuck upstairs quietly right now i would hear her talking to herself again this very moment. okay, rant over. time for me to return to the madness. wish me luck.

Trying to get a diagnosis .. need advice
my mom is 71 and started acting very strangely recently.  she's been a bit off for a few years but her behavior and rational thinking have declined measurably in the last couple of weeks.  we went to the doctor,  who sent her for an mri. they said the results showed everything was normal except for some vascular changes but those, "aren't a big deal." they advised her to eat healthy and exercise to reduce her cholesterol  (which is normal) and her blood pressure (which is low! ).my mom has been hoarding for awhile and a few years ago started animal hoarding.  i clean her house for her and it's pretty bad. she keeps trash. she won't shower often and often doesn't change clothes unless she has to go somewhere. here are a few examples of her recent behavior as i began to write them down.  you can tell that her behavior is going downhill. 1. she has been mistaking colors for other colors.2. she forgot who a friend of mine was but covered it to up by saying she gets her confused with another person. 3. she got forgot how and when her father died4. she forgot i had asthma5. she forgot i didn't eat fruit since i was a young child when she used to tell stories about it to everyone 6. she told me that she couldn't watch a youtube video because the computer said she had to log in.  i went to the computer and shesaid,  "see look it says please log into youtube. " she was on google. 7. at my husband's request, i looked through an old photo album with her.  she was doing okay until she pointed to a picture of my mother-in-law and said,  "my hair looked so pretty there. " i gently asked her to point herself out and she pointed to my mother-in-lawagain.  i gently explained that it wasn't her but she argued.  i explained when and where the picture was taken and she changed the subject but seemed confused and argumentative.  they don't look alike at all.8. she expressed concern because my daughter would've listen to her when she told her that, "the television set doesn't work when the computer is on."9. mom reached over and touched my adult daughter's butt inappropriately and really upset her.  when my daughter tried to talk to her about it she said she couldn't help herself. when my daughter got agitated and started arguing my mother started crying uncontrollably.  10. my daughter said she found animal mess in hall - that a dog must have had an accident.  mom said, "it wasn't me."11. she admitted to the doctor that she has forgotten to pay bills,  take meds and says sometimes when she is reading or watching tv she doesn't understand.  she says she knows she should but doesn't. she deflected by turning it into a joke, saying it was probably about politics and no one understands those anymore. she did pretty well on her test at the doctor's office but when she drew her clock she got the time right but didn't draw any numbers.  i insisted on a follow up appt and i'm going to ask for a neurological consult.any advice anyone can give me would be greatly appreciated.

Dealing with my mother with dementia
tl;dr: mother has been recently diagnosed with dementia. i need help and advice.**sorry for the long post. needed to vent. english is not my first language and my thoughts are all messed up, so if you find it difficult to understand what i'm saying please let me know**hello, i am 29 years old and my mother is almost 74. **story**she has been getting worse since 2010 (noticeably) and i suspect that it started in 2003/2002. even though she has been getting worse since 2010 we've only been seeking doctors since dcember 2014. this is due to the fact that she was taking care of her own mother (96 years) who had been bed ridden since 2010. she had a pretty strong stroke and later had successive micro infartions in her brain completely destroying it, spending the last 3 years in bed screaming non stop (really non stop) until her death in august 2014. we all believed that my mother was just suffering from depression, lack of sleep, unbelievable stress (i took care of my grandmother a few times ... i couldn't stand it for 20 minutes, let alone 2/3 years). then she started sinking .. fast ... really fast. i forced her to go to neurologists (she lives in a small town in a third world country, where she was a doctor (geriatrics and nephrologist) until 2010, for 41 years) and it took a really long time to take her to the doctor (500km away). he sent for a few tests and it took us a really long time to get back to him due to my mother's panic attacks making it impossible to travel. so, we looked for doctors in town. one of them never said she had anything, just medicated her with donepecile clorhydrate and memantine clorhydrate (both used in the treatment of alzheimer), which only made her worst and the other doctor said she didn't have alzheimer nor dementia and he'd consult his coleagues and get back to us in 2 weeks. 3 months later we had to track him down and practically beg to get our tests back so we could go to another doctor. after that i tried taking her with me to where i live, a large brazilian city and my mother lives in a small uruguayan city. i tried taking her with me but she went completely crazy after arrival and i had to take her back home immediately (after 1 hour in my city) by car, where she procceeded to freak out the entire 6 hour ride and open her door while a car was passing us. finally we go to a new doctor a month and a half ago who said it clearly .. she has dementia. at that time my world came crumbling down and i barely heard a few thing: "she's probably had several microinfartions in her brain, which is certainly why she is always dizzy. she certainly has mixed dementia and is firmly planted in the 4th stage of dementia and presenting some symptoms from the 5th stage. her dementia has a vascular side to it certainly and presents some symptoms similar to alzheimer and another dementia. we need to perform a pet scan with the fdg and pib markers to get a better idea". this destroyed me, but ok, i'm prepared i can manage. it turns out that i'm not prepared and i can't manage. after the doctor's visit she has been progressively worse very fast. until a week and a half ago she was taken by her brother to the emergency room because she stopped talking and was completely stiff. turns out she was severely dehydrated (probably a combination of medicine) and since then she can barely walk a little bit with help because she falls on her back if you don't grab her (her position is literally like the back slash \), doesn't take her medicine (we basically wait until they dissolve in her mouth), doesn't eat well, doesn't drink a lot of water and rarely ever makes sense or is able to pronounce all the words she wants. i checked [this]( link about the stages of dementia and i can certainly tell you that she is now firmly in stage 5 and hast at least 75% of the symptoms of the 6th stage of dementia. she went from 4/5 to 5/6 in just 3 weeks and i'm scared.ok. sorry for the long vent but i needed it. now i'll post some probably relevant information and ask you some questions and ask for some guidance.**info**-i'm an only son-she lives with her brother (71) and he has hired 3 more women to help him take car of her. 2 of them have been with her for a long time (one of them is a nurse and the other one helped take care of my grandmother) and they are absolutely wonderful with my mother and then a new one, that seems kinda useless (also a nurse my mother knows) because she's really quiet and i don't know if she can deal with my mother, but has planted herself as an ok care giver.- i don't put her somewhere to take care of her because in her city, many of the asylums are known for hitting/hurting their patients or keeping them drugged up. and if i took her to one in my city she would freak out. i also don't take her to one in uruguay's capital because of [this link](. - i live 500km away in brazil. she lives in uruguy. i have a job and if i had another boss i'd be fired already. instead this one lets me get back home whenever i need it and really helps me. this is specially kind considering the economical crisis that is happening in brazil. the past 6 months i've spent at least 3 here. and since she's been taken to the hospital until her pet scan i can't get back to work. i'd be fired anywhere else. i have a really great boss (no, he doesn't reddit).**current symtpoms**- can't walk without help.- can't do anything without help.- can't maintain a conversation.- confuses past and present.- talks to dead people.- confuses me for her brother and her brother for her father that died in 1977- confuses tv and reality- if we don't give her medicine that make her sleepy she doesn't sleep.- she starts crying non stop after all medications wear off and stays like that for about 6 hours. i don't want to give her too much because it could make her worse, but if i don't give her something she'll kill herself. she literally tenses up for 6 hours tried to fight, get up and all that until her next medicine**questions**- how accurate is the link stating the stages of dementia?- i know my mother has mixed dementia. i know one of them is vascular dementia, another one could be alzheimer. any suggestions? until we make all the tests it's impossible to know and they might take some time. even if it's wrong, someone giving me an idea is better than nothing.- how can i give her her medicine?- she's been getting really dizzy after she goes to the bathroom. waht could it be? i already tried talking to her doctor but he isn't here. he'll only be back by friday next week. any suggestions are welcome.- has anyone experienced such a fast decline in health? in january she was able to talk perfectly (was kinda forgetful and dizzy) and she was able to walk. the nurse we hired was hired back then because my mother had a tendency to do whatever she wanted, not take her medicine or take any other medicine in any doses (we didn't know it was dementia, i had my suspitions but i'm an engineer, not a doctor, and no other doctor said it at the time). in march she had a lot of difficulty saying some words and started creating memories (if i said a number and someone said bank she would get it in her head that she needed to go to the bank to deposit the number i said in her account .. she did that for weeks, every day at least 50 times a day and she would read a piece of paper put it down then pick it up again and read it again .. she did that for 30 minutes non stop .. i timed it once). an in the last 2 weeks she can't dfferentiate between television and real life, she has hallucinations, can't maintain a conversation, can't do absolutely anything without help and is getting worse. i can feel her getting worse and everybody else around her as well. **advice**- how can i make her feel better?- does anyone know how to deal with this? i'm kinda young and wasn't expecting to go through this at all, even though my mother had me almost at 45. she's always been a rock for her entire family and many people in the city (remember she was a doctor .. a beloved doctor to some a hated/loved/respected co-worker to others).- i live 500km away and besided going to her house every weekend and on emergencies i don't know what else to do**edit:** added a question and reformated some of the text

Family Physician is refusing to recognize my Grandmother's symptoms
i'm so sorry for the wall of text... there is a lot to get out, i'm going to try to split it into sections with bolded titles for easier reading**background**my grandmother has been exhibiting signs of short term memory loss for a few years now. it began with asking the same question multiple times in short conversations, the inability to remember what she had done throughout the day, calling me by my aunt's name and confusing me for a younger version of her, and occasionally forgetting where she was. we dismissed this originally as just a symptom of growing older and not using her brain quite as much due to retirement. so we got her and ipad and some brain training apps, made sure she always has puzzles and crossword/wordsearch/sudoku books around, made sure that she was getting out and spending time with her friends (she now has a standing coffee appointment with a group of ladies 3x a week), and have been spending as much time with her as possible engaging with her, doing puzzles with her and just over all attempting to keep those cognitive juices flowing. but it seems as if none of this is working, she is still in a noticeable decline which has seemed to increase more rapidly the last 6 months. i moved out of the house i shared with my grandparents and mother growing up in december and have tried to see my grandparents once or twice a week since and i am noticing more and more how bad it is getting not seeing her every day and there have been a few instances lately that have me c concerned. about a month and a half ago i went out and took her for a walk (she likes to go for walks but it is getting to the point that we are no longer comfortable letting her go out on her own as she gets very disoriented and the neighbourhood can be confusing) where she introduced herself to some neighbours across the street who have lived there 10+ years. a week or two after that i went for coffee with my grandparents and as they were dropping me off at my new house (which my grandmother has been to at least once a month since i moved in) and she asked who i was going to visit and when i would be home. the last (well the last biggish seeming one that has me concerned) was when we went to the dance recital of a family friend last week, i sat beside her and she was turning to me and calling me by my aunt's name and talking me me as if i was her and when it came time for the little little kids (3-5 age group) to preform there was one that resembled me as a child at which point she got very excited and said "*aunts name* look at *sosullied* isn't she adorable in her costume! we need to make sure to get lots of pictures!". i had been gently reminding her of who i was every so often but at that point i just couldn't and let her have the happy moment of her being so proud of her "granddaughter". **the issue**so the problem is that our family gp will not acknowledge that there is any issue what so ever. my entire family go to him (my self, grandparents, mother, and 4 aunts and uncles) and at one point or another most of us have spoken to him about our concerns which he has either brushed off or ignored completely. the closest that we have gotten to a response from him was that we should "think carefully before saying anything else as once we 'start this' it can't be undone" and his biggest concern seemed to be that my grandmother might have her license taken away (we don't let her drive any more anyways - she gets frustrated with other drivers because she doesn't know what to do on the road or where she is going which leads to dangerous driving). he has said that her memory seems absolutely fine to him - she still asks him about his children and wife when she comes into the office - and i have a feeling that my grandfather has also been downplaying her symptoms and stepping in and prompting her for correct answers when they have their doctors visits together. **my question**has anyone dealt with a gp that has been reluctant to acknowledge symptoms of dementia before? how did you handle it? are there any resources that can be accessed with out a gp referral? (for reference we are in canada)thank you so much for any responses, my family deeply appreciates it.**side note:** i have looked up all medications/supplements/vitamins she is taking to see if there are any contraindications or interactions that could present as dementia and as far as my research has shown there is nothing.**tl;dr: my grandmother's memory seems to have been declining for some time but the decline has been more rapid the last six months. our gp does not think that there is anything wrong based on short visits with her and will not take further action or refer us to any resources.**

Getting mom's mental decline off my chest. Not sure if it's indicating dementia or just age-related. I don't think it's age-related.
i [30sf] live far away from my parents [late50sm] and [early70sf].  they visit us approximately twice a year, since i was pregnant with my son.  i started to notice my mom's memory wasn't quite the same as it used to be, a few years ago.  not so bad that it was worth mentioning to anyone other than my husband, just to "make a mental note".in the last 2 years, and with the perspective of not seeing my mom regularly for 6 month intervals, i've noticed a pretty steep decline in her short term memory. i mentioned it to my older brother (also lives far away, but sees slightly less of my parents due to a difficult wife), mainly to see if he could see it too.  he wasn't too worried at first, but keeps tabs on what i tell him (privately).this last visit with my parents, i had my dad on his own and i asked him directly about it.  he said that i'm right, her short term memory is pretty bad.  he also mentioned that she is very very good at hiding it from most people (and that she is aware of it herself).  she can reason things out, her overall "intelligence" is seemingly unaffected, but she really struggles with organisational things: where did she leave her purse, what does she need to do before leaving the house, having trouble keeping track of names occasionally, repeating questions or things said in the previous 10 mins to 24 hrs....  to hide it (from my husband, for example) she resorts to telling anecdotes/stories that require long-term memory only.  subtle, but effective.my grandfather was sharp as a tack until the day he died of complications from an unexpected stomach ulcer (age 83).  by contrast, my grandmother had a 2 year downspiral of her cognitive abilities before she died of heart attack (age 86).my son is only little, i want to have another baby and my parents love coming to where we live to help out and spend time with their grandson.  i'm just worried that her memory is declining faster than anyone has control over.  my mom had undiagnosed heart issues (that required an emergency pacemaker installation), and the doc said there was a small chance that those issues could have contributed to some cognitive decline.  if that is the case, the doc said that it should level off where it is.  if not, i think it's more than just age-related mild forgetfulness.my parents do crosswords and sudokus together daily, and read a lot and watch tv/movies and go to concerts.   but because of my mom's organisational issues and also a leg issue related to a childhood case of polio, she won't go out and walk much anymore.  she used to drive and walk and take the bus, but now she avoids it.  i noticed it on this last visit.  i also read that daily exercise in the form of short walks is one of the many things that can help with dementia/memory loss.  she just won't do it though, and it's really frustrating to watch!i trust her with my son, but i'm not sure my dad does - so when they're watching him, my dad takes primary responsibility.i guess i'm not really asking a specific question...just more to get it off my chest.  that being said, i know my mother well, and i know that she never wants to be a "burden" on anyone.  the country my parents live in (they are resident there, retired after 30ish years working in that country) has very liberal euthanasia laws (in the legal comparative sense, not political).  the laws have been around a while...i wish i could just ask her how she really feels about that.

Grandmother Tearing Family Apart
my grandmother has had dementia for as long as i could remember.  i always remember that things were a little bit off when i was a child.  she could go into sudden rages.  little things would set her off.  she was forgetful.  she would ask the same questions over and over again.  i learned recently that her doctors have diagnosed her with dementia, however, she does not take that news well and will start doctor hopping if anyone suggests it.my grandfather's health has begun to fail.  they live in a mountainous region and he had been told to get out of the altitude or die in a year.  at 92, he is very ready to go to a place where he can be taken care of.  however, after finding repeated places that he enjoyed and putting deposits down on an assisted living apartment, my grandmother will inevitably throw a raging fit, accusing people of trying to put her in jail, and he will quietly cancel their plans.about a month ago, he made the decision that he wanted to move to a town about 40 minutes away from me.  he found a facility that he loved.  she seemed alright with the plan.  they are suppose to move in next week.now, the phone calls to my mother have started.  my grandmother told her to go to hell, stating that she would never be put in a prison and she didn't understand why she was forcing her to do this.  she has threatened my uncle with being written out of her will, one of her favorite threats.  everyone is tried, upset, and struggling to understand. my mother wants to have her declared incompetent, but her brother doesn't see the need at the moment.  it has caused a rift between two normally close siblings.it seems as if i'm the only member of the family who she does not get angry with.  i am in my early 30s, have a full time job, and hobbies which take up the rest of my time.  i feel like i need to step in and be peacemaker but at the same time, i decided long ago to stay away from my grandmother simply because she is not the woman that i know and love anymore.  i'm just so confused by the entire situation and i have no idea whether it is my place to step in and say that i'll take care of her if they will only move.  i feel as if she will be fine once she gets moved and settled in a new place, but i also understand that she is scared of something new because of her illness.  how do i keep my family together in all of this?

The long goodbye
i hope i'm not putting myself in a weird situation here, i'm assuming this is mostly safe space.a few years ago my grandmother, 94 at the time, said that her cognitive abilities were slipping. last december, at 96, she said that she no longer remembered any of the things she used to tell me about my childhood. this march she barely knows who i am most of the time. i went to see her in the assisted care facility, and it turns out she's been upgraded from can-mostly-take-care-of-herself-knows-whats-going-on to this-lady-is-losing-it-keep-an-eye-on-her. in 3 months.she was one of those grandmas who was always like "remember when we did such and such" and "i remember when you were 2 years old you blah blah blah" ... we were all tired of hearing about these things because if it had been a day, or a year, she'd be like "lets talk about that thing you did when you were 2." and now when i call her i'm like "hey, remember that thing i did when i was 2?" and she's like "no honey, i dont remember that.." and it makes me sad.sometimes i get a call from my dad or my uncle saying "hey mom's passing" or "hey your grandma is not going to have her mind much longer, time to get in anything you ever wanted to get in"so i call her and tell her things like "remember how you always wanted to spoil me rotten?" that's the one thing she hasn't forgotten...well except for those times that she forgets me all together, but when i can get lucidity from her she remembers only that her goal was to spoil me rotten. i've tried to let her know that i am spoiled rotten. i am part of a generation of children who grew up to be spoiled rotten, although i never tell her that the entire generation is spoiled, i try to tell her that she succeeded and that i am indeed spoiled.she will say something like "aww precious, why shouldn't you be" and then drift away into weird things like "wait til you meet the girls. they are outgoing and very gregarious."each time, just before nodding off she'll mention "i'm going somewhere soon. i don't know where..its not new york. but i have a feeling that i'm going somewhere" which translates to me that i think she knows she's gonna die.because of her age and state of mental decline, every time i call her it is the "last call" every time i call her to tell her i miss her its the last time. i've talked to her a half dozen times in the last year, watching this dementia unfold...and the last 3 have been goodbye calls and visits.i want to keep calling her because i love her and she's part of who i am, she has impressed upon me how to behave in public. she's my closest grandma. when i had a driver's license, the first place i drove was there. when my grandpa died i wore his clothes and ate his favorite foods for a week, it wasn't a planned thing, i just ended up doing it without thinking about it. i'm his namesake. my grandma and i have been close. not like weird creepy close as the last statement would have you believe, but she's part of my small family. growing up she was always my mom's best friend, and my dad's best friend. she was always just there. first school graduation, there. first play i was in, there. you name it, there.now she's dying and i keep saying goodbye but it's never goodbye. when should i stop calling? when should i stop trying? this is killing me to watch this happen. neglecting her because she can't remember me seems like such a dick move. i don't know what to do.the long goodbye sucks. i know a lot of people don't have a chance to say goodbye, and the fact that i'm able to say goodbye over and over and over seems like a blessing. but it's also a curse. to forever say goodbye to your loved one, but for them to always be there only slightly worse off every time. anyone have any experience? anyone have any words?i hope this doesn't break a rule, and if it does, you can edit my post or put a thing by it...but damnit, dementia's a f*cking b*tch. i sincerely apology for disrupting the safe space but i'm very...emotional. this is the first time i've poured my heart out about this to anyone. i can't bottle it anymore. i can't. i added asterisks to the bad words if that helps. i'm angry. i'm confused. i'm sad. i'm everything in that steps of acceptance chart all at once.i know she wouldn't want me to stress out and worry about her, but that's the thing about loving someone...you can't just turn that off. there is a small part of me that wants her to pass peacefully in her sleep before she loses any more. my dad has said: "when i get there just blow my brains out. give me a 45, i'll do it myself" to which i said: "if you have that level of dementia i'm not giving you a 45." we use humor to cope. dark shitty humor...but its a dark shitty situation. i'm sorry. i forgot the stars...is this common? this feeling? anyone else feel this way? like, if she passed in her sleep i wouldn't have to keep saying goodbye? she's not happy. this isn't entirely a me-thing. if she was always chipper and enjoyed life i'd say: "fudge it, let her just be happy" but she doesn't like not knowing anybody. she doesn't like not knowing where she is or who anybody is. i don't like it, the family doesn't like it. we're certainly not mad at her for this. we're not mad at god. we're just mad. and confused. and sad. god this rant has gone on long enough. thank you if you made it this far. i'm sorry. i don't know where else to go.

Worried about my mom
hi everyone! i hope someone on here can help me, because this is eating me up inside and i feel i can't talk to anyone about it. this is about my mom. she's 58, turning 59 this year, and i am very worried she might be showing early signs of some form of dementia.now, my mom has always been a little forgetful. so am i in fact. we tend to laugh it off when she does stuff like forget the keys somewhere or why she enters the kitchen for seemingly no reason. but these last three or so years i feel she forgets more and more and i am increasingly getting worried. a big thing with my mom is repeating herself when it comes to talking about things that have happened to her recently. she might in a day say the same thing four or five times, albeit a little differently every time. when reminded that she's already mentioned this before, she often scoffs at it and doesn't seem to take the comment too seriously. i've confronted her about it, but she claims she is aware she is repeating herself but just wants to make sure we're hearing her out and not just nodding along and not paying attention. i find this explanation a little strange, especially so since her repeating herself is a big reason my dad tends to "just nod along" at her stories.another thing is that she seems to forget nouns and even what they mean much more frequently now than before. she will at times forget a word she needs in a sentence, look around for help or inspiration, and more often than not find a different word that means something similar or just neglect finding a word altogether, adding "you know what i mean". last night she even forgot the last part of a well known idiom, which is especially worrisome considering my mom has always, always been known to recite idioms perfectly. i learned another troubling bit two days ago, when she had told her new boyfriend i didn't like wine at all. now, not only do i like wine very much - my mom and i have shared many a bottle of wine over the years in fact, so i felt quite distressed that this had not only slipped her mind, but manifested itself as me not liking wine. when i told her this, she seemed surprised.i've also discovered she tends to forget what she has in the refrigerator. today she bought eggs despite the fact she has a full carton already, as well as salad and cheese she already had. now, i realize this is pretty common for many people, but she also neglects to throw out bad food very often and forgets she has it.do i have a reason to be worried? my mom is otherwise quite fine. she works as a nurse and has always done so (working with patients suffering from dementia, somewhat ironically), enjoys reading and cooking and is quite fine in managing her own life. the only thing she struggles with is understanding and using new technology, but that's always been a hard thing for her and not something recent. i've talked to this with my dad and my sister and both agree she's been more forgetful recently. she just doesn't want to admit this herself, and i don't know what to do if it happens to be dementia.does anyone have any advice for me? am i blowing this out of proportion? i realize i might worry too much, but i love my mom so much and just want to do the best thing for her.

hello,i am a college student living away from home. my parents both worked close to minimum wage jobs, but the area they live in allows them to live semi-comfortably. i am an only child. my mother recently lost her job due to increasing forgetfulness. with their income essentially halved, my father has to work every hour he can get to keep things afloat. i work a work-study job here at home and send as much as i can home monthly. they have other issues as well. my mother has constant doctors appointments that we have to find friends and relatives to go with her to, because my dad can't always take time off from work. her neurologist found that she has a cluster of ministroke activity in her frontal lobe, and general brain surface atrophy. they don't have an official cause yet, or type of dementia.  it's been a crazy downhill spiral since she lost her job. i can see the red flags in hindsight (getting lost on trips that should have been familiar, misplacing keys/credit cards).my mom and dad have worked with her neurologist to get the paperwork she needs to file for unemployment and then disability, but to be honest my parents are completely unfamiliar with any of this stuff. they applied for unemployment first and even though they haven't even gotten it yet they are getting letters constantly saying that if she doesn't go to the assistance office to show that she's been applying for jobs she won't get unemployment. i feel helpless here. although she still seems completely functional from the outside, if you have a 10 minute convo with her its very clear there's an issue. her cognitive testing has been dismal. she's like a mix of 10 second tom and drew barrymore from 50 first dates. she'll yell at my dad for not cleaning something, and then 10 minutes later forget that they've talked and come back in and yell at him again. does anyone have any resources or advice to offer? i'm particularly scared that she's home alone so often. even though we've sat her down and talked about how money is tight now, she's still doing stuff that costs quite a bit of money constantly, both with and without any actual money. i'm always trying to put out fires but can't do much from out of state. any advice/tips?

Looking for advice on how to deal with my grandmother's increasing forgetfulness
so i live with my 80 year old grandmother who has dementia but it is just starting to progress to the point where she can't completely take care of herself. she can do just about everything for herself, but gets confused with her medication. so i moved in just to help her deal with her pills, and help her take her blood sugar and insulin every day (shes diabetic as well).lately she's been getting more and more forgetful. stuff like what she had for lunch or breakfast that day, whether she had gotten her newspaper or not, if she had called any of her friends to chat that day. most of the time its not a big deal. if i ask her about something we had talked about before or she had told me her friend said, and she doesn't know what i'm talking about or is adamant she had never said something i just let it go and say never mind instead of arguing with her. i figure its better than her getting all worked up or confused because she can't remember something. but i'm not sure how to handle it when its something that i can't just let go, something that has to be confronted.today for example. trying not to go too into detail, she had had some issue with constipation recently. when she was talking to my mom earlier in the day, she told her that she had gone to the bathroom this morning and yesterday morning. so my mom told her not to take any of her constipation medicine. but when i got home in the evening (not knowing about the conversation she had with my mom), she said that her stomach was bothering her and she hadn't gone to the bathroom in days. she has stuff she is supposed to take when she gets blocked up like this so i told her i would get some for her. she told me, "no, your mother said i'm not supposed to take that stuff." not knowing anything about that i called my mom and heard about their previous conversation. i bring that up to my grandma and she's saying she never told my mom that and she hasn't gone in days. but still won't take the medicine "because your mother told me not to"."why would i lie?" is usually what she falls back on at this point. and i don't think i should be blunt and say you aren't lying, you just can't really remember things anymore.so i just don't know what to do in these situations where her forgetfulness has to be confronted. i don't want to argue with her about it because it just gets her more and more upset. but there are times like this when i have to get the bottom of it, because i either need to give her medication or not. similar things have happened with eating and not knowing if she really needs an insulin shot or not.

Worried that my dad is developing dementia. What can we do?
**tldr:** we are afraid that my dad is in the early stages of dementia. but he is very unaware of everything and maybe a bit too proud to admit that anything is wrong. i'm afraid he will react bad if we propose to go to the doctor's to make an assessment. how can we approach him? what can we do? --------------------------------------------------------------------------my beloved dad is 57 years old. he has been a easy-going, distracted kind of guy for very long, but we have noticed some changes lately which we fear is early onset dementia. he is very forgetful about a lot of things. he forgets his stuff, what he tells us, what we tell him, his chores etc.. his personality has also changed. he has always been the sweetest and kindest person but lately he has started to become disturbingly angry about random things (e.g. he really hates politicians and "political correctness") and he can become quite aggressive in arguments with us. and his arguing doesn't make sense at all, he goes on and on and he repeats himself a lot. it's impossible to talk sense to him. the last red flag i experienced was today, when i noticed that he had a few bills that he hans't payed. i tried making him do the bills but he just dodged out of it muliple times. also, he drives a cab and he hasn't declared his work shifts since october meaning that he hasn't been payed since then (meaning that my mom has been the only provider for quite some time...). he just avoids everything unpleasant, including feelings and duties.the reason why i write here is that we really need some help. a lot of things with him are still the same but we don't know how to approach the problem. he is quite proud in some ways and i don't think he would every admit that something is wrong with his mental health. we haven't talked with him about this yet because we fear that he will shut us out - making it more difficult to go and make a proper assessment of dementia.dementia seems so intangible and difficult to approach. i just wish we could deal with the problem as soon as possible.how can we make him go to the doctor? how do we help him? please help. thank you.

Advice needed, dementia much worse after brain surgery
hi there. i need some help. i've posted about my mom before, she is 70 and started showing signs if dementia about 4 years ago (forgetting/repeating things). its gotten a little worse every year, this winter we pushed her doctor to order an mri to try to get a diagnosis. in the mri we discovered a brain tumor (meningioma in the olfactory tract), after consulting with 4 neurosurgeons they recommended we remove it due to its size and proximity to eyes and other vital parts. my mom had issues with her sense of smell (we thought related to dementia/alzheimers) and her memory issues. no one knew for sure whether it would help with the memory issues though, so we decided to move forward and try.  surgery was a month ago. the recovery has been tough. she went from being able to live independently with mild cognitive issues to mid-late stage dementia overnight, needing 24 hr care by nurses. brain surgery is tough, she could barely stand up, needed help feeding herself, walking, bathing, etc. she didn't realize she was in recovery so having her just try to get up or fall off the bed/sofa/chair was a constant worry. since the operation  she has improved a ton physically, she walks pretty much on her own and feeds herself and can go to the bathroom on her own. great. the only serious issue now is her *mind*. it just hasn't come back. she has constant delusions, thinks she's someplace else, asks about deceased folks, etc. as she gets stronger she even has fits of paranoia and kicks her nurses out of her room and refuses to take meds. these episodes last about 1-2 hours only but it takes a pretty big toll on my dad, we never know when they might happen. she doesn't get physically violent, just stubborn in her reality. her neurosurgeon is perplexed, says her mind should be recovering by now and has tried different memory/antipsychotic/antischizo drugs but they haven't helped. he's reshuffling her meds to see if anything works. i honestly think this is beyond his scope at this point. i have no clue if this is a botched operation, extra long recovery or something entirely different. it all happened so suddenly, it was shocking. i still can't believe she will stay this way.  we are going to go see a geriatric doc next week and maybe do a cognitive study, her nurses recommend we see a psychiatrist as well. i've got no clue and taking it bit by bit. if anyone has any tips or recommendations i'm all ears. thanks!

Advice for my grandma with alzheimers/diabetes of 10 years?
my 83 year old grandma has been living with us for over 10 years and has alzheimers and diabetes. early on it was a real hassle trying to learn how to take care of her and deal with her illnesses but we've adapted and have a much easier living situation. fortunately my grandma still has strong verbal skills, can walk and is only forgetful of very short term events. the biggest dilemma with her is that she has become accustomed to jumping on every opportunity she has to sneak food from our kitchen fridge which is a problem as she doesn't combine normal meals and almost always go for carb heavy items which spikes her blood sugar to incredibly high levels. she won't hesitate to do this even after eating a full meal. we do have preventative measures in place which is primarily locking her door whenever no one is downstairs in the adjacent living room to supervise her. we end up feeling guilty for locking her door for so long that we end up leaving it open but she essentially waits for someone to walk upstairs and rushes to the fridge. though i realize her alzheimers can make her forget when she last ate and that her diabetes can cause her to feel hungry even has food in her stomach their have been many instances where we catch her sneaking food, ask her to put the food back and she proceeds to start eating it right in front of us until we forcibly remove it from her. her main target is often ice cream but we started keeping all of the very diabetic non-friendly food in the garage fridge which has a electronic keypad on it, this resulted in a multitude of unsuccessful attempts from her to access that fridge though she has succeeded on occasion when we forget to lock the garage door. it's these kind of events that tells me she willingly attempts to sneak food most of the time. i setup a small whiteboard next to her that i write down the time for every meal of the day and check whether she ate it. this has been helpful for her from what i can tell but it's questionable. on top of that i don't always remember to update as i'm not her sole caretaker and she sometimes misplaces the marker. no matter how many talks i have with her the one thing i seem incapable of changing are her food sneaking habits. i can understand if she forgets she ate recently but her food sneaking is very intentional. only passive security measures such as locks have been able to truly prevent her from sneaking food and even then only if we lock it which we sometimes forget. besides that the only other issue is her excessive knocking on her bedroom door. almost every time it's to inquire for her next meal which she likely already had recently. her balance has been getting slightly worse though this is most notable when she has low blood sugar which has led to some nasty falls. however through constant reassurance and reminders she now uses her walker regularly but even so still tends to fall with or without with blood sugar fluctuations. i make sure to be nearby when she has to travel through the house.

How much time do we have?
i know there is no true answer to this. i know there are hundreds of factors, and everyone progresses through this differently - and yet, there's part of me that really needs to know what to expect.  does it take months?  years?  how much of that time are they still truly ‘them’?  my dad was diagnosed with mild dementia a few months back, and i live 1,000+ miles away.  i'm struggling with the guilt of not being there with the rest of my family, guilt for leaving the burden of this on my siblings, with feeling helpless, and fear because i'm not seeing him every day and watching his progress. my mind immediately goes to a dark place when my siblings tell me stories.  at this point, it's mainly been small things.  at first, he just couldn't quite remember where he had just placed something down, or if you asked him where he had been working a job last week, he couldn't tell you. for the first time this past week while my mother was in the hospital, my sister drove him home and he had no idea where he was, he didn't recognize anything until she finally pulled up and he said, "oh, that's my house."  he's been aware of it though, and tries to make jokes about his bad memory. i've noticed he's become much quieter and anti-social, and i suspect it is in part because he doesn't want to say anything that is 'wrong' or reveal something he has forgotten. i see my parents about 1-2 times a year.  since his diagnosis, i've seen him about 3 times, but it's not something we can financially keep up without bankrupting ourselves.  and yet, there's this thought in the back of my head that says, "how many more visits will there be while he's still my dad? while he still knows who i am?" and then the panic sets in.  how long was it before you ‘lost’ your loved one to dementia? honestly, i just don't know how i should be feeling. most days i'm fine and i'm calm and then others it is like living on an emotional cliff.  last night, i couldn't stop crying just reading through this subreddit and picturing his future.  am i overreacting?  or jumping ahead of myself?  to some extent i feel like i am grieving him before he's gone instead of enjoying time i do have with him. i struggle between telling myself it’s okay to feel however i’m feeling, and trying to get myself back together and tell myself to suck it up, it’s not that bad yet, he may still have normal years ahead of him. when i try to educate myself about all this and try to find support through things like facebook or this subreddit for example, i find it upsets me more than anything - i want comfort but instead i get angry as i see exactly what my dad is in for in the coming years.  i struggle to know whether or not it is better to dive in and feel all this pain now, when we are still only at the very beginning – or try and pace myself and deal with it as it comes.  it’s so easy for me to numb myself to everything happening back at home since i’m so far away, but then when i visit, i get smacked in the face with all that has changed. i don’t expect many to have read through all of this – i think it was helpful for me just to put it into words all the conflicting feelings i’m having on this.  i feel selfish even focusing on myself as if this is all about me instead of about my father.  but even so… i’m dying to know… how much time do we have?

Skill Nursing Facility Help in Relocation &amp; Support
hi guys,i've received some helpful information here in the past with my grand who has dementia. i had some questions hoping someone has any success in relocating their loved ones with dementia. i've been on a waiting list in two facilities for over a year now and i have been calling other facilities with no luck. my grandma is in a nursing facility that is about an hour away from where i live and i was hoping to relocate her somewhere closer to where i live (san francisco). my grandma is currently using a medi-cal and medi-care as her insurance.1)there are facilities that charge 5-8k a month and do not support medicare/cal, how do seniors usually afford these places? it seems like such a high amount of money for one to spend on living without any government assistance. 2) is my grandma lower in the priority list because she currently in a facility? i feel like thats one of the reasons why we're not getting any movement. my grandma has dementia and is constantly screaming and crying (shes bed bound) but when i see her she does not exhibit any of this even when im with her for hours. the instant i'm not around shes been agitated daily and often scratches her head to the point where theres a bald spot on her scalp (no bleeding). she only speaks chinese in a facility that has no chinese speaking nurses. ive tried things like trying to leave the tv on, calling me when she's agitated (doesnt help), nurses try to talk to her and it also doesnt work. she often cries about something from the past like forgetting something, money problems, etc. when i've comforted her about this, she'll forget within minutes of me leaving and cry about other things. she's taken so many types of anti-anxiety meds in the past, i have no idea whats good for anymore (being tired and weak all day or being alert and crying all day). i visit 2-3 times a week but it seems like a small solution to this problem because she'll end up being agitated again within hours of me leaving anyways. i dont know what to do at this point, i feel like me visiting is a short-term solution and i just want her to be at ease. its so difficult to see her suffer like this. i feel like psychologically she'll be better at home but we can not afford the physical support needed to take care of her. i know this is a long post but if you guys have any suggestions, i would greatly appreciate it. thanks!

When Is It Time for Assisted Living? Mom (67) has EOD, FTD
my mom was diagnosed with eod, ftd almost three years ago.  in learning more about this disease in that time, i think that she showed early signs of this illness at least 10 years prior to her diagnosis.  she's been a widow since 1987, and i'm an only child with no close relatives for either of us.she lives with her antisocial cat in a 55+ apartment complex on long island in new york.  my husband (36) and i (32) live in an apartment in connecticut, but we visit her every other weekend.  she volunteers at a church thift store a few times a week and goes to that church every sunday.  she also goes to a medical-model day center 4 days a week and finally has consistent at-home care through guildnet gold (basically medicare/medicaid insurance for the elderly) 6 evenings a week.  these daily outtings have been great because she's chatting with new people and participating in many activities.  she's unfortunately, or fortunately, also seeing the progression of dementia in other people which is sad, but also humbling.she's really with it most of the time, but also has had bipolar disorder and manic depression most of her adult life, so she has benign mood swings occasionally (i realize that this could/will get worse).  she also hardly gets any sleep at nights and has experienced this most of her life, so she can get cranky and tired early in the evening (maybe sundowning?).  she also has epilepsy, which her neuro believes is related to the ftd.  all these are controlled by meds, except for the sleep issues.she spends her free time watching tv, walking or gardening.  she consistently asks if we watch castle, grimm or person of interest, and the answer's always 'no'.  all she can relate to are shows and movies most of the time, but this isn't new as she did this most of my childhood.  she also doesn't socialize much.   people would describe her as odd, or quirk-filled.  she feels that people don't pay attention to her, but she's also a horrible listener, to her child and to people.  also, not new, but growing worse because of the illness, possibly.  fyi, her hearing is excellent, she's just always been a selfish, self-centered person.what prompted me to write all this was that she ran low on two of her medications and forgot which doctors prescribed them.  she got super anxious about running low, forgetting the doctors, and about letting me know about it, so her at-home aid called to talk with me.  i spoke with her doctor's aid about her 'script and they informed me that she missed a neuro appointment in october.  it also turns out that she has a bottle of medication with dispense directions that are out of date, and has run out of pills cause of this.  pharmacy now has the correct 'script and she's seeing her neuro next week.i'm thinking i'm really in denial about the progression of this disease.  a part of me thinks that she's ok with these current services, but then things like this occur and temporarily magnify everything.  they are not frequent, but i know they will become frequent.  yes, i know things will get worse, but for now it seems manageable.  am i fooling myself?  my mother?  is that how it is for everyone with dementia and their families?  when did you know, your parents know, that it was the next logical step?fyi, my husband and i checked out two facilities with alps beds, just to get a feel, last year.

When is it too early for my father to go into a rest home?
my father has been diagnosed with dementia since 2009. he is looked after by carers in the morning and afternoon but attends a dementia day center for most of the day. my whole family works except for me as i am searching for a job. at one point while i was unemployed i looked after him full time. basically things have been changing with my father's behaviour and we don't know if we are doing the right thing or not. 2 years ago when i was staying home with my dad we could relax watch tv, read a book and we were able to do these things for a long time. now when he is sitting in the same place doing an activity 10 mins later he gets upset and we have to constantly find new ways to occupy him. its exhausting. he is increasingly getting angsty, muttering to himself and rolls his eyes and sighs at us. he needs to be in bed by 7pm each night to sleep. he argues with us often that well the suns going down so he should head home. when we tell him the address his is at and that he's home he angrily tells us of course he knows that or says nope i don't believe you. i do understand about sun downing and the inability to understand logic with dementia. maybe once a week or twice every two weeks he will have issues with sleeping. sometimes he is good for two weeks no problems. sometimes he refuses to sleep and lies there muttering and will get up extremely angry and try and leave the house. other times he will have slept and woke up to go to the bathroom and will try and leave. our front door can only be opened with a key so he is unable to leave. and he tries to open the door hitting it, yelling to let him out, he kicked one of the other doors once. he can also do this is the morning when he says hes going bathroom but continues towards the door. we basically try to distract him and tell him to go back to bed or offer him things he likes. when he is like this you can talk to him but he ignores everything you say and is very angry at you. my father has only ever one time while i was growing up yelled at me. when he is in a good mood he is so sweet and caring trying to make sure everyone is looked after. on the weekends he's normally so well behaved smiling, making jokes and loves hanging out with the family. due to his angry nature at night we have thought about putting him in a rest home. we have started to prepare the funds needed as we would have to pay. we don't qualify for a subsidy. he would hate the idea of living at a rest home. it would be one with secured dementia care. we love having him around just not when he is angry and trying to get out. we are three women smaller than him but he is not huge or anything. my father hasn't forgotten our names, is looked after, fed, and showered by the family. we drive him everywhere and normally during the whole day is not by himself for more than 10 mins. i feel like the normal time to put a person with dementia in a rest home is when they forget your names or how to eat or shower. but my father is able to eat, speak, remember our names, help with small tasks, use the bathroom and shower although needs help reminding to wash hands and how to properly shower. we just feel so inadequate when he gets angry especially at night. we feel like its inevitable that he will go into care and are thinking of putting him most likely early next year. are we rushing? i've heard people go downhill in care. when was your final point when you knew you had to put your relative in care? we just don't know if we are doing the right thing to put him in care but unless the anger goes away we cannot keep living with him. sorry for a long post. just wanted to give all the info. many thanks. please share your experience of when you put a love one in care, with me.

my father has been diagnosed with dementia since 2009. he is looked after by carers in the morning and afternoon but attends a dementia day center for most of the day. my whole family works except for me as i am searching for a job. at one point while i was unemployed i looked after him full time. basically things have been changing with my father's behaviour and we don't know if we are doing the right thing or not. 2 years ago when i was staying home with my dad we could relax watch tv, read a book and we were able to do these things for a long time. now when he is sitting in the same place doing an activity 10 mins later he gets upset and we have to constantly find new ways to occupy him. its exhausting. he is increasingly getting angsty, muttering to himself and rolls his eyes and sighs at us. he needs to be in bed by 7pm each night to sleep. he argues with us often that well the suns going down so he should head home. when we tell him the address his is at and that he's home he angrily tells us of course he knows that or says nope i don't believe you. i do understand about sun downing and the inability to understand logic with dementia. maybe once a week or twice every two weeks he will have issues with sleeping. sometimes he is good for two weeks no problems. sometimes he refuses to sleep and lies there muttering and will get up extremely angry and try and leave the house. other times he will have slept and woke up to go to the bathroom and will try and leave. our front door can only be opened with a key so he is unable to leave. and he tries to open the door hitting it, yelling to let him out, he kicked one of the other doors once. he can also do this is the morning when he says hes going bathroom but continues towards the door. we basically try to distract him and tell him to go back to bed or offer him things he likes. when he is like this you can talk to him but he ignores everything you say and is very angry at you. my father has only ever one time while i was growing up yelled at me. when he is in a good mood he is so sweet and caring trying to make sure everyone is looked after. on the weekends he's normally so well behaved smiling, making jokes and loves hanging out with the family. due to his angry nature at night we have thought about putting him in a rest home. we have started to prepare the funds needed as we would have to pay. we don't qualify for a subsidy. he would hate the idea of living at a rest home. it would be one with secured dementia care. we love having him around just not when he is angry and trying to get out. we are three women smaller than him but he is not huge or anything. my father hasn't forgotten our names, is looked after, fed, and showered by the family. we drive him everywhere and normally during the whole day is not by himself for more than 10 mins. i feel like the normal time to put a person with dementia in a rest home is when they forget your names or how to eat or shower. but my father is able to eat, speak, remember our names, help with small tasks, use the bathroom and shower although needs help reminding to wash hands and how to properly shower. we just feel so inadequate when he gets angry especially at night. we feel like its inevitable that he will go into care and are thinking of putting him most likely early next year. are we rushing? i've heard people go downhill in care. when was your final point when you knew you had to put your relative in care? we just don't know if we are doing the right thing to put him in care but unless the anger goes away we cannot keep living with him. sorry for a long post. just wanted to give all the info. many thanks. please share your experience of when you put a love one in care, with me.

New to this sub!
hey all! i've been a long time lurker and recently got myself an account. still looking for relatable subs.    anyway. i moved closer to my mother's side of the family for work and to help my aunt take care of my 83 year old grandmother who lives with her. she has been blind as long as i've been alive.    within the last couple of years i've seen a very quick decline in her health. she used to walk around the mall and go thrift shopping and i would always meet her for lunch at her favorite local buffet. she had a few hospitalizations and when she came home she fell and broke her ankle. hospitalized again; this time she was put in hospice. that was the last time she walked. all the while her dementia worstening.    i think it's a mix of the dementia and her blindness, but sometimes she goes on fantastic adventures. one time two strapping young lads picked her up and took her on a helicopter flight across the lake where she layed on a beach with free cookies and lemonade.  other times she thinks we've stuck her under tables or beds and are hitting her with baseball bats.  she always thinks she's holding babies and cats. or she's grasping at her skin and clothing thinking she's covered in ropes.  she never knows where she is and worries about how she will get home or complains how tired she is of standing when she's already in bed.    one time an old friend came to visit her and she went on this huge rant about how my aunt and uncle made her sleep on the floor with no pillows and were hitting her with a broom under the table. instead of arguing with her i just kept trying to change the subject and ask her about her children or her deceased husband to no avail. her friend was obviously rattled and i had to explain. unfortunately, we probably won't see her around again.    i try to visit her everyday and "grandma-sit" at least 3-4 times a week between full-time work and grad school. every time i see her she is always so delighted to hear my voice and i love every ounce of her. lately she has been asking "why am i still here?" and it's.. so difficult. to say the least. when she is lucid she feels like a burden and not worth our time and love.  but, as anyone with a loved one who has dementia knows, we do everything we can out of love and compassion. some days we may feel more loving and compassionate than others.. but that is all part of the disease.  so here's to us! all of you caretakers and family members are amazing and beautiful people! you go through so much to help someone else have a little bit more comfort and familiarity in their lives. you are selfless and no task is too big for you! but in all of this chaos, don't forget to treat yourself because you deserve it!

Where do I go from here?
i'm 23 and i live with my mother in the uk.my grandmother was recently ( i believe about a year ago?) diagnosed with dementia ( which from a little bit of research i did, may be what is called 'late-onset dementia', she's in her 90's).it's slowly been getting worse and worse over time, and has resulted in her being admitted to a care home after being taken to hospital a couple of weeks ago. the way she's acted is very unnerving for me. her memory has slowly been getting worse and worse as the weeks and months go by. she used to live on her own in a flat, then as it progressed, carers were bought in. she was admitted to hospital twice  and...it's got to the point of ' well, she needs to go in a care home.'  the second time i was also told she had apparently been saying that she wanted to die, which upset me a lot. this wasn't the sweet, kind, funny woman i remembered from when i was young. this was someone different.it's all stressful for me and my mother especially, and my mothers sister is of no help whatsoever. she is often rude and obnoxious to my mother, which upsets her, which then upsets me.it's often like talking to a brick wall. sometimes she'll be nice, and other days she'll be completely rude and unkind. i think that she thinks my grandmother always favored my mother over her.i've sort of experienced this all before with one of my other grandmothers before she sadly passed away, but it was vice-versa ( nursing home, then hospital until her passing, quite a long story behind that) and back then, i didn't understand much of what was going on.and it scared me. this all scares me now as it is, the thought that someone who i remember throughout my whole life, is slowly fading away, and i can't do anything, nor can my mother, and i think it upsets her a lot.  i know there's gonna be a point where my grandmother doesn't remember me at all, and that frightens me. i don't quite know why, but it does.going back to the other grandmother, back when she was in the nursing home, i remember going with my dad to go see her, and to be honest, it wasn't the same person i knew from when i was young, this was a frail, pale, elderly woman,who didn't seem to recall (until my dad said my name to her) who i was. bearing in mind, at that point, she had a water infection as well. i remember being in that room and hearing her start to say "i don't want to be here anymore..." which really got to me, and at that point, i left the room because i couldn't take seeing her like that.the very last time i saw her, she was unconscious in a hospital bed. she passed away the next day.going back to the current and now, i just don't know what to do. obviously i'm gonna be there for mum, because this is hard on her, and when "the inevitable" happens, it's gonna hit her hard, and she needs (and will need) all the love and support she can get.i may sound absolutely horrible when i say this, but on one hand, i don't want to see my grandmother anymore now that she's in this state, because it really gets to me and i know it would upset me quite a lot, but on the other, i wouldn't mind going to see her, because i'm hoping that there's still a little piece of memory in her mind that hasn't forgotten me.i'm just at a loss with what to do right now. i'm just a 23 year old girl who doesn't understand a lot of all this right now. it's a frightening prospect. and i know it'll get worse before it gets better.

Im really scared for my mom, feeling very lost as to what to do (long post)
this is probably going to be long, so i apologize.i thought my mom was just showing signs of aging, repeating stories, forgetting where she put something, very minor memory issues.then she was diagnosed with arthritis, they sent her home with lortab (she lives alone). this was causing major memory issues, forgetting that she had even talked to me the day before for instance. we went to do the doctor, they took her off of lortab, put her on tramadol. the tramadol seemed to be a wonder drug at first, she kept saying that her memory was coming back, and she felt great. then on saturday, she calls me and asks me to come get her. she says she wants to come live with me (very odd for her, she loves her independence). i rush over, and she is telling me that she believes that god is coming to take her soon, and that she is going to die, and no longer wants to be alone. this was obviously heartbreaking, a little investigative work later and a trip to the er reveals that she was hallucinating due to the tramadol. so that was ended.sunday, she seemed much better. still had a little bit of "fuzziness" to her, but was no longer hallucinating. i told her we were going to have her stay with us for a few days to make sure everything was back to normal.this morning she wakes up, and everything seemed fine at first. then i noticed she forgot to take her medicine. i asked her about it, she told me she had taken it. i showed her the full pill box, she said she did that this morning (she watched me fill it last night). then she went outside to smoke, and saw some wet bathing suits drying on the patio. she laid those on the ground. i asked her why, she said the wind blew them over (i watched her lay them down). now she is repeating the same things all day, telling me im smarter than i realize, telling me how loving i am (at least 20 times today). she can have a normal conversation, but then she jumps subjects in the middle of the conversation. she will not stay in bed now, and constantly wants to go outside to smoke (we are in the middle of a severe thunderstorm, and she still wanted to go outside, she never wants to be outside during a thunderstorm). she can recall memories from 40 years ago, knows who i am, knows my wife, knows her address, knows the date, she seems perfectly normal except for the odd behaviors. i am waiting on the doctor to call me back, they had some computer issues today, so i have been stuck googling. many sites describe these symptoms as dementia. so now to my questions:if this is in fact dementia (i know i need a doctors diagnosis, but i am freaking out right now), is it normal to set in this quickly?she is flip flopping back and forth saying she wants to go home, and she wants to live here with us. i obviously would love to take care of her, and she lived with us once, but just today is feeling as if this is going to be taking care of a child. i work, my wife works, im not sure how i can do it. with her being basically alert and knowing whats going on, i don't feel nor want her to go to a nursing home, the ones in this area are disgusting. but i don't really know what else to do if this is the case. my wife is telling me that it is probably just left over tramadol in her system, and that according to the web, "delirium" can persist for a few days. i don't know if this is delirium or if this is dementia. i am basically terrified right now, typing this with tears welling up, i don't know what to do, how i am going to do this, or even what i am in for. i just started my job this year, so taking an extended leave would be very bad (i will if i absolutely have to, in order to care for her, but i would want to eliminate every other option before going that route).if you have made it this far, thank you for listening to me, im very scared and very confused. i just wanted to see if anyone else has gone through these feelings.

3rd International Conference on Alzheimer’s Disease &amp; Dementia
highlights of the conference:track 1: causes and prevention of alzheimer’salzheimer's is caused by brain cell death. it is a neurological disorder in which the death of brain cells causes memory loss and cognitive decline. the total size of the brain shrinks in alzheimer's, nerve cells and connections in the tissue progressively reduced, which cannot be seen or tested in the living brain affected by alzheimer's disease, post-mortem/autopsy will always show tiny inclusions in the nerve tissues, called as plaques and tangles. plaques are found between the dying cells in the brain - from the build-up of a protein called beta-amyloid (amyloid plaques). the tangles exist in the brain neurons, from a disintegration of second protein, called tau.worldwide, with dementia or related disorders nearly 44 million people have suffered in 2015,past results shown 35.66 million population  lived with dementia  worldwide in year 2010, with numbers expected to nearly double each twenty years, to 65.7 million in 2030 and 115.4 million in 2050. in 2010, fifty eight per cent of all population with dementia lived in countries with lower or moderate incomes, with this proportion anticipated to rise to 63% till 2030 and 71% by 2050. this condition is anticipated to double by 2030 and quite triple by 2050 to 115 million.track 2: managing dementiadementia is the term used to describe the symptoms of a number of conditions that affecting the brain. the commonly seen condition is alzheimer’s, and other includes parkinson's disease. symptoms seen at early stages are personality changes, withdrawal, memory loss, confusion and apathy. early diagnosis helps with providing early treatment, support and planning. medications might help with some symptoms of dementia, but no permanent cure.majority of people with dementia are above age 65, the condition is not normal for all older people. the occurrence of dementia gets high with age, but it’s not given that an older person will develop it. while only 1-in-4 people with alzheimer’s disease or dementia has been diagnosed.track 3: alzheimer’s disease diagnosis and symptomsalzheimer’s disease is that the commonest type of dementia, it is a serious brain disorder and it impacts daily living through memory loss and cognitive changes. although not all memory loss indicates alzheimer’s disease, one in ten people over 65 years of age, and over half of those over 85 have alzheimer’s disease. currently, 26 million people worldwide have this dementia, and over 15 million americans will be affected by the year 2050. there is no single test that can show whether a person has alzheimer's. while physicians can almost always determine if a person has dementia, it may be difficult to determine the exact cause. diagnosing alzheimer's requires careful medical evaluation, including medical history, mental status testing, physical and neurological exam, blood tests and brain imaging.symptoms of alzheimer’s disease usually develop slowly and gradually worsen over time, progressing from mild forgetfulness to widespread brain impairment. chemical and structural changes in the brain slowly destroy the ability to create, remember, learn, reason, and relate to others. as critical cells die, drastic personality loss occurs and body systems fail.track 4: alzheimer’s disease imagingscientists look at the brain’s grey matter when investigating about alzheimer’s disease. a fresh study, found that degenerating white matter in the brain could be an early indicator of disease. a study was published in radiology which concludes that white matter plays an important role in how the disease strikes and progresses. abnormal deposits of proteins that form amyloid plaques and tau tangles all over the brain in alzheimer’s disease. it can also be characterized by shrinkage of brain tissues due to neurons loss.track 5: alzheimer’s disease pathophysiology and disease mechanismsalzheimer’s disease is a progressive dementia with loss of neurons and the presence of two main microscopic neuropathological hallmarks: extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. early onset ad, a rare familial form, is caused due to mutation of one out of three genes: (amyloid precursor protein), (presenilin 2) or (presenilin 1).  sporadic form occurs usually after age of 65 and accounts for most cases; it most likely results from a combination of genetic and influence of environment. confirmed risk factors for sporadic ad are age and the presence of the e4 allele of (apo lipoprotein e). amyloid plaques comprise mainly of the neurotoxic peptide amyloid (aβ, abeta), cleaved sequentially from a larger precursor protein (app) by two enzymes: β-secretase (also called bace1) and γ-secretase (comprising four proteins, presenilin is one of them). if app is first cleaved by the enzyme α-secretase rather than β-secretase then aβ is not formed. neurofibrillary tangles comprise mainly of the protein tau which binds with microtubules, which facilitating the neuronal transport system. tau uncoupling from microtubules and aggregation into tangles inhibits transport and results in disassembly of microtubule. phosphorylation of tau might have an important role in this. selective vulnerability of neuronal systems such as the cholinergic, serotonergic, and noradrenergic and glutamatergic systems form the basis of current rational pharmacological treatment.track 6: amyloid protein in alzheimer’s and dementiathe amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles formation are thought to contribute to the degradation of the neurons (nerve cells) in the brain and the subsequent symptoms of alzheimer's disease.amyloid plaques: one of the hallmarks of alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of amyloid plaques between nerve cells (neurons) in brain. amyloid generally indicates protein fragments that the body produces normally. beta amyloid is a protein fragment from an amyloid precursor protein (app). in a healthy brain, these protein fragments are broke down and get eliminated. in alzheimer’s, the fragments gets accumulated to form hard &amp;insoluble plaques.neurofibrillary tangles: neurofibrillary tangles are insoluble twisted fibers found inside the brain's cells, consisting primarily of a protein called tau, which forms structure called a microtubule. transport of nutrients and other important substances from one part of the nerve cell to another done by help of microtubule. in alzheimer's disease, the tau protein is abnormal and results in collapse of the microtubule structures. track 7: geriatrics and cognitive disordergeriatrics or geriatric medication may be a specialty that focuses on health care of older people. it aims to push health by preventing and treating diseases and disabilities in older adults. there's no set age at that patients is also underneath the care of a specialist or geriatric md, a md united nations agency makes a specialty of the care of older people. rather, this call is set by the individual patient’s needs, and therefore the availableness of a specialist. it’s vital to notice the distinction between gerontology, the care of aged people, and geriatrics, that is that the study of the aging method itself.cognitive disorders square measure a class of mental state disorders that primarily have an effect on learning, memory, perception, and drawback determination, and embody blackout, dementia, and delirium. whereas anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and psychotic disorders can even have an effect on psychological feature and memory functions, the dsm-iv-tr doesn't contemplate these psychological feature disorders, because loss of cognitive function is not the primary (causal) symptom. causes vary between the various sorts of disorders however most include damage to the memory parts of the brain. treatments rely on however the disorder is caused. medication and therapies square measure the foremost common treatments but, for a few sorts of disorders like amnesia, treatments will suppress the symptoms however there is presently no cure.track 8: care practice and awarenesspersons with dementia have multiple psychological feature deficits that include each memory impairment, that affects the flexibility to find out new info or recall information previously learned, and one or additional of the subsequent symptoms-aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or executive dysfunction-such that the psychological feature deficits negatively have an effect on social or activity functioning with a big decline in previous talents. additionally, persons with dementia typically suffer from comorbid conditions that additional complicate care and impede best outcomes. therefore, developing caregiving methods people with dementia is urgent, given this increasing prevalence and therefore the associated burden that dementia places not only on the individuals, however on the caregivers, relations, and therefore the resources of the health care system. conventional views bearing on geriatric nursing typically paint an image of the care as being slow paced certain and less demanding than acute care. however, care of the aged, and particularly those with dementia, is usually complicated, unpredictable, and unstable.track 9: therapeutic targets and mechanisms for treatmentalzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is characterized histopathologically by the presence of plaques, mainly composed of abeta amyloid and the tangles, mainly composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. to date, there is no treatment that can reverse the disease, and all the current therapeutics is directed to cope with the symptoms of the disease. here we describe the efforts dedicated to attack the plaques and, in more detail, the process of neurofibrillary degeneration, linked to the presence of the hyperphosphorylated microtubule associated protein tau. we have identified the different putative targets for therapeutics and the current knowledge on them.treatment for alzheimer's disease is entering a new and exciting phase, with several new drugs beginning clinical trials. many of these new therapies are based on our best current understanding of the pathogenesis of alzheimer's disease, and are designed to try to either slow or halt the progression of the disease. there are several different theories underlying the current efforts, and these are briefly reviewed. therapies directed against some aspect of beta-amyloid formation, against neurofibrillary tangle formation and against the inflammatory response are all considered, as are the problems associated with each area. it is as yet unclear which, if any, of these approaches will be successful, but the high level of activity in each of these three fields provides some hope that an effective treatment for alzheimer's disease is on the horizon.track 10: animal models and translational medicineanimal models for alzheimer’s disease it is important to think about the human phenotype and what is being modeled in terms of the animal phenotype. the moderator, bradley hyman, professor of neurology at harvard medical school, said that animal models of alzheimer’s disease, based on the genetics of the disease and the closely related frontotemporal dementia, replicate at least some of the pathology. researchers have been successful at modeling very specific aspects of alzheimer’s disease in the mouse (e.g., plaques, tangles). although these are incomplete models of the human disease, they have been well received in the field as potentially relevant models for use in drug discovery.patients with alzheimer’s disease will display both amyloidopathy and tauopathy; however, scientists often focus, in a reductionist way, on one or the other in an animal model. a participant added that even though the anatomy in the mouse is different than the human, mutant tau mice are relatively good models in that they recapitulate tau-dependent neurodegeneration. this has led a number of companies to focus on antibodies that block tau-dependent neurodegeneration in these mouse models.

3rd International Conference on Alzheimer’s Disease &amp; Dementia
highlights of the conference:track 1: causes and prevention of alzheimer’salzheimer's is caused by brain cell death. it is a neurological disorder in which the death of brain cells causes memory loss and cognitive decline. the total size of the brain shrinks in alzheimer's, nerve cells and connections in the tissue progressively reduced, which cannot be seen or tested in the living brain affected by alzheimer's disease, post-mortem/autopsy will always show tiny inclusions in the nerve tissues, called as plaques and tangles. plaques are found between the dying cells in the brain - from the build-up of a protein called beta-amyloid (amyloid plaques). the tangles exist in the brain neurons, from a disintegration of second protein, called tau.worldwide, with dementia or related disorders nearly 44 million people have suffered in 2015,past results shown 35.66 million population  lived with dementia  worldwide in year 2010, with numbers expected to nearly double each twenty years, to 65.7 million in 2030 and 115.4 million in 2050. in 2010, fifty eight per cent of all population with dementia lived in countries with lower or moderate incomes, with this proportion anticipated to rise to 63% till 2030 and 71% by 2050. this condition is anticipated to double by 2030 and quite triple by 2050 to 115 million.track 2: managing dementiadementia is the term used to describe the symptoms of a number of conditions that affecting the brain. the commonly seen condition is alzheimer’s, and other includes parkinson's disease. symptoms seen at early stages are personality changes, withdrawal, memory loss, confusion and apathy. early diagnosis helps with providing early treatment, support and planning. medications might help with some symptoms of dementia, but no permanent cure.majority of people with dementia are above age 65, the condition is not normal for all older people. the occurrence of dementia gets high with age, but it’s not given that an older person will develop it. while only 1-in-4 people with alzheimer’s disease or dementia has been diagnosed.track 3: alzheimer’s disease diagnosis and symptomsalzheimer’s disease is that the commonest type of dementia, it is a serious brain disorder and it impacts daily living through memory loss and cognitive changes. although not all memory loss indicates alzheimer’s disease, one in ten people over 65 years of age, and over half of those over 85 have alzheimer’s disease. currently, 26 million people worldwide have this dementia, and over 15 million americans will be affected by the year 2050. there is no single test that can show whether a person has alzheimer's. while physicians can almost always determine if a person has dementia, it may be difficult to determine the exact cause. diagnosing alzheimer's requires careful medical evaluation, including medical history, mental status testing, physical and neurological exam, blood tests and brain imaging.symptoms of alzheimer’s disease usually develop slowly and gradually worsen over time, progressing from mild forgetfulness to widespread brain impairment. chemical and structural changes in the brain slowly destroy the ability to create, remember, learn, reason, and relate to others. as critical cells die, drastic personality loss occurs and body systems fail.track 4: alzheimer’s disease imagingscientists look at the brain’s grey matter when investigating about alzheimer’s disease. a fresh study, found that degenerating white matter in the brain could be an early indicator of disease. a study was published in radiology which concludes that white matter plays an important role in how the disease strikes and progresses. abnormal deposits of proteins that form amyloid plaques and tau tangles all over the brain in alzheimer’s disease. it can also be characterized by shrinkage of brain tissues due to neurons loss.track 5: alzheimer’s disease pathophysiology and disease mechanismsalzheimer’s disease is a progressive dementia with loss of neurons and the presence of two main microscopic neuropathological hallmarks: extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. early onset ad, a rare familial form, is caused due to mutation of one out of three genes: (amyloid precursor protein), (presenilin 2) or (presenilin 1).  sporadic form occurs usually after age of 65 and accounts for most cases; it most likely results from a combination of genetic and influence of environment. confirmed risk factors for sporadic ad are age and the presence of the e4 allele of (apo lipoprotein e). amyloid plaques comprise mainly of the neurotoxic peptide amyloid (aβ, abeta), cleaved sequentially from a larger precursor protein (app) by two enzymes: β-secretase (also called bace1) and γ-secretase (comprising four proteins, presenilin is one of them). if app is first cleaved by the enzyme α-secretase rather than β-secretase then aβ is not formed. neurofibrillary tangles comprise mainly of the protein tau which binds with microtubules, which facilitating the neuronal transport system. tau uncoupling from microtubules and aggregation into tangles inhibits transport and results in disassembly of microtubule. phosphorylation of tau might have an important role in this. selective vulnerability of neuronal systems such as the cholinergic, serotonergic, and noradrenergic and glutamatergic systems form the basis of current rational pharmacological treatment.track 6: amyloid protein in alzheimer’s and dementiathe amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles formation are thought to contribute to the degradation of the neurons (nerve cells) in the brain and the subsequent symptoms of alzheimer's disease.amyloid plaques: one of the hallmarks of alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of amyloid plaques between nerve cells (neurons) in brain. amyloid generally indicates protein fragments that the body produces normally. beta amyloid is a protein fragment from an amyloid precursor protein (app). in a healthy brain, these protein fragments are broke down and get eliminated. in alzheimer’s, the fragments gets accumulated to form hard &amp;insoluble plaques.neurofibrillary tangles: neurofibrillary tangles are insoluble twisted fibers found inside the brain's cells, consisting primarily of a protein called tau, which forms structure called a microtubule. transport of nutrients and other important substances from one part of the nerve cell to another done by help of microtubule. in alzheimer's disease, the tau protein is abnormal and results in collapse of the microtubule structures. track 7: geriatrics and cognitive disordergeriatrics or geriatric medication may be a specialty that focuses on health care of older people. it aims to push health by preventing and treating diseases and disabilities in older adults. there's no set age at that patients is also underneath the care of a specialist or geriatric md, a md united nations agency makes a specialty of the care of older people. rather, this call is set by the individual patient’s needs, and therefore the availableness of a specialist. it’s vital to notice the distinction between gerontology, the care of aged people, and geriatrics, that is that the study of the aging method itself.cognitive disorders square measure a class of mental state disorders that primarily have an effect on learning, memory, perception, and drawback determination, and embody blackout, dementia, and delirium. whereas anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and psychotic disorders can even have an effect on psychological feature and memory functions, the dsm-iv-tr doesn't contemplate these psychological feature disorders, because loss of cognitive function is not the primary (causal) symptom. causes vary between the various sorts of disorders however most include damage to the memory parts of the brain. treatments rely on however the disorder is caused. medication and therapies square measure the foremost common treatments but, for a few sorts of disorders like amnesia, treatments will suppress the symptoms however there is presently no cure.track 8: care practice and awarenesspersons with dementia have multiple psychological feature deficits that include each memory impairment, that affects the flexibility to find out new info or recall information previously learned, and one or additional of the subsequent symptoms-aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or executive dysfunction-such that the psychological feature deficits negatively have an effect on social or activity functioning with a big decline in previous talents. additionally, persons with dementia typically suffer from comorbid conditions that additional complicate care and impede best outcomes. therefore, developing caregiving methods people with dementia is urgent, given this increasing prevalence and therefore the associated burden that dementia places not only on the individuals, however on the caregivers, relations, and therefore the resources of the health care system. conventional views bearing on geriatric nursing typically paint an image of the care as being slow paced certain and less demanding than acute care. however, care of the aged, and particularly those with dementia, is usually complicated, unpredictable, and unstable.track 9: therapeutic targets and mechanisms for treatmentalzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is characterized histopathologically by the presence of plaques, mainly composed of abeta amyloid and the tangles, mainly composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. to date, there is no treatment that can reverse the disease, and all the current therapeutics is directed to cope with the symptoms of the disease. here we describe the efforts dedicated to attack the plaques and, in more detail, the process of neurofibrillary degeneration, linked to the presence of the hyperphosphorylated microtubule associated protein tau. we have identified the different putative targets for therapeutics and the current knowledge on them.treatment for alzheimer's disease is entering a new and exciting phase, with several new drugs beginning clinical trials. many of these new therapies are based on our best current understanding of the pathogenesis of alzheimer's disease, and are designed to try to either slow or halt the progression of the disease. there are several different theories underlying the current efforts, and these are briefly reviewed. therapies directed against some aspect of beta-amyloid formation, against neurofibrillary tangle formation and against the inflammatory response are all considered, as are the problems associated with each area. it is as yet unclear which, if any, of these approaches will be successful, but the high level of activity in each of these three fields provides some hope that an effective treatment for alzheimer's disease is on the horizon.track 10: animal models and translational medicineanimal

Is this maybe vascular dementia?
my mother-in-law has always been a constant talker, emotionally manipulative and a bit of a drama queen, so please bear this in mind! she wasn't coping well with living in a small village and taking care of the house and large garden, so three years ago we paid to convert the house into two and we moved into the smaller side, so that she wouldn't have to move from her home. obviously there were teething troubles but, by and large, everything improved. we were able to maintain the house, help her with her anxieties and provide her with much needed social contact.  she is 82 and in reasonable health, although with high blood pressure &amp; cholesterol and failing eyesight and hearing. she has had two or three serious bouts of depression (before we moved in) and reluctantly took ssris for these.recently (the last six months or so?) we've noticed a deterioration in her cognitive skills. she can take two days to plant out a few seedlings for example, leaving tools and pots everywhere, forgetting what she was doing and basically wandering around the garen for hours. her personal hygiene and housework routines are poor and she can't really cook a meal (too many steps in preparation) although she will heat up a ready meal if she's not eating with us. she won't accept any offers of help with cleaning and gets angry if we suggest anything is wrong. she struggles constantly with speaking, often forgetting words, using lots of 'ums' and pauses and her conversation (which is constant) is rambling, circular and inevitably seems to default to events from long ago. she doesn't like anyone disagreeing with her and has several times completely lost her temper (stamping her feet, flapping hands, crying and shouting, threatening to leave or sell the house).also, she is very, very bleak about anything that happens to people she knows, or even stuff she sees on the tv. i'll give an example to try and explain. my husband's nephew has recently got married to an american girl (we're in the uk) and she has got it into her head that he's made a mistake and is miserable (this is because she doesn't like american women, i think) and despite no evidence, she will talk for at least an hour a day about how she knows he's sad, and he is all alone in the us and will fail his masters degree etc, etc. whatever we say to the contrary she ignores and will give completely irrelevant anecdotes to support her argument. for example, how her daughter (nephew's mum) was horrible to her thirty years ago and that means nephew is unhappy (?)we try and keep her calm but she can get very trembly and anxious about her hypotheses and, if we try to explain that she isn't right, she will start talking about any other time in her life when someone upset her. it's hard to explain, because it's hard to follow in real life!i doubt we could get her to the doctors and sometimes she is pretty calm and can seem almost normal. i think she would try very hard to present as normal if we did take her.up to now, we've managed to always have someone at home (we're both freelance) but it's getting harder to work because she just walks in and starts in on her current obsession and/or whims. today she wants her new greenhouse which we built for her moving across the garden and says we put it in the wrong place! it sounds small but we can't just drop work and spend the day moving it, epecially as she will probably change her mind.tl/dr: difficult mil is getting more difficult.

85 year old grandmother may be getting dementia, but I'm unsure. Trying to research more before confronting father.
over the past few months, we have had multiple family visits with my grandmother which have become increasingly awkward. i've been noticing for about a year that my grandmother has seemed "off" but it hasn't been that bad. i'm just wondering if she's sick, or this is just normal for getting older?for some background: my paternal grandmother is 85. about a year ago she had a prolapsed bladder, but that's been her only medical issue for a long time and it is healed now. she lives on her own and takes care of herself fine it seems (the house is clean, she grocery shops, all that jazz). she also smoked in her youth, and quit for about 20 years. then about 8 years ago she married a smoker (who has now passed away) and she began smoking again. she now smokes probably about two to five cigarettes a day. two years ago my aunt (her daughter) died suddenly from lung cancer - she was also a smoker.also, i'm 23 and my father is 62. my older sister is on my side with everything, and my mother is on the fence and wants to support my dad.within the past year, her behavior has become increasingly strange. she often seems confused. we try to include her in conversations as a family and she usually has nothing to say and just stares at us, even when we try to explain things she might not understand. she will tell us stories, usually about a few of her friends in town, but doesn't really respond when we make comments or respond to her. she doesn't seem to understand the simplest things i tell her, like about my new job or our pet dog. often times i literally feel like i'm talking to a mannequin. she stares off into space, doesn't make eye contact, and often doesn't respond or just says "i don't know" basically, talking always feels one sided - either we're talking at her, or she's talking at us. we can no longer have a true back-and-forth conversation. she often seems forgetful - forgetting which car we're driving, or what time we're going somewhere. and for a small anecdote, last week she continually called the chicken pot pie she was cooking "dressing" even after we corrected her and asked her about it multiple times.she has also become mean. she was often a bit passive-aggressive in the past, usually pressuring us to come visit more often. but lately she has gotten a lot more direct in her comments. despite neither of us gaining more weight, she is constantly harping on my sister and i about being "fat" - she complains about having to buy us big sizes for christmas presents, often pokes my stomach and comments on how big it is, and generally calls us big all the time. she gets aggravated at very small things, like a tablecloth having wrinkles in it or things being moved around in the kitchen while we're cleaning it for her. last week she made a really terrible comment to my father. he had been helping her set up a tablecloth and she kept telling him it "wasn't right" and he couldn't figure out what they had to do to fix it. she then said where everyone could hear "[dad's name] you've just ruined it. you've ruined this day, you've ruined everything!" she has never been that direct or said something that mean to a family member, especially where everyone could hear it. my father was very upset about this and we almost left right then. she continued to be passive aggressive for the rest of the day.this has been a pretty sudden change overall, and her aggression and confusion seems a lot more pronounced over the last two or three months. my father is really reluctant to say that anything is wrong, and when we've brought up casually that she might be "going senile" he brushes us off and pretends like everything is fine. so i've been trying to research more and seek help/information to see if i should convince him to get her checked out. does this sound like dementia? does anyone have any advice?thank you so much.

My first patient with dementia (sharing expierence, feedback is welcome!)
hello reddit! first of all, sorry for my english. i guess there are at least a couple of mistakes in my straight-outta-heart wall of text.i'm a nurse, i'm caring for a woman of 95 years old. she is my first patient ever with dementia.when i first met her, she just seemed confused. she told me the most wonderful stories. she got ill just after she got used to her new home, and spends a lot of her time in bed nowadays. i hear her crying sometimes, she doesn't know where she is, and the nurses aren't always right next to her, like she'd deserve, in my heart. but everytime i get to sneak into her room, she smiles and looks at me with those big blue eyes. "is it the little nurse? are you the little nurse?" she asks, when she sees me. her vision is bad, so i will always give her her glasses so she can see me better. "you *are* my little nurse! i have been missing you for such a long time.". her eyes tear up and she holds my hand and kisses it. see, at first, i didn't know how to react. i have walked away silently crying. who does she think i am? why do i mean so much to her? how can i ever break her heart by saying she doesn't know me, that i am not *her little nurse*?after a month of trying to avoid her (by choosing to wash someone else, i'd not ignore her) or talk about something else, anything else, that would make her forget about asking if i remember how much she loved being with me "*back when (insert anything)*", i gave up. i cared for this lady more than i'd have to.i have started pretending i'm *her* little nurse. she can't leave her room anymore, stays in her bed, or sits in a chair in front of her window, with pictures from 19??-1970 on her desk. she looks at them and wonders who the people on the pictures are, but when she sees me, she knows who i am. i am her little nurse. she forgets to eat and drink, but when i tell her i have just stolen a cookie from the kitchen nurses, to give it to her, she giggles and promises me she won't tell. when i tell her i made her a coffee with whipped cream, she drinks it and kisses me on the cheek. miss white, today you told me you met me outside of town - on my way to the forest. i sat by a big oak tree and drank a cup of coffee, i had just bought bread and cake from a bakery in the city. i offered you to join me, while the sun was shining upon our hair, and the birds sang to us, all kinds of different songs, but they were all for us, because we met that day.i promise i won't forget the way we met, because you have chosen me to be your little nurse, and if that makes you happy - it makes me happy too.tl;dr - my patient and i share memories we make up together.

Looking for support
i don't really know what kind of support i'm looking for, but here's my family's story.shortly after my grandfather died a few years ago, we started noticing some disturbing things with my grandmother. memory issues, for the most part, but also some things she was doing that just plain didn't make any sense. my mom took her in for some testing, and we were told that she has vascular dementia. looking back, we realized that my grandfather had known something was wrong for awhile and had been shielding us from it - in his final days, his greatest concern was for her and that we take care of her. we couldn't understand why he was so worried at that time, but now it all makes sense.since her diagnosis, we had to get her to stop driving. then we had to move her into assisted living. the facility she stays in is quite good. they have different levels of care depending on how advanced the disease is. since she moved there, her dementia has progressed to the point where she is now in a "memory care" wing.aside from her memory loss, her ability to comprehend things has also gone way down. she has some pretty severe hearing loss which exacerbates things, but even when she can hear what you are saying, it's like she just doesn't understand. these last few months, she's also taken to having episodes where she becomes inconsolably upset, usually at night. i am now reading this might be part of the "sundowning" phenomenon. i think she has nightmares and can't later differentiate between what was a dream and what is reality. she also becomes fixated on an idea, and it's impossible to steer her away from it. her personality has undergone a pretty severe change, too. she has gone from being a generally positive person to being quite negative. she'll say things sometimes that are very hurtful. i know, deep down, that this is not her, it's the disease. but still it's hard to deal with. she has also fixated on one of my uncles to be a "golden child", and she's always saying positive things about him and worrying that he is safe and happy. the rest of her children (my aunts, uncles, and mom) she treats with paranoia and anger. it's heartbreaking. i feel like she's not my grandma anymore. she really doesn't seem like the same persondespite all of this, up until recently, you could have some semblance of a conversation with her, even if you had to repeat things often (and loudly) and you knew that five minutes later she'd probably have forgotten what you talked about. but recently, she has begun to speak in what i can only describe as a kind of intelligible gibberish. she's saying real words, but mid-sentence she can't remember a word or can't remember what she was trying to say, so she starts over on a new sentence. if you can finally decipher what it is she's trying to say, you realize that it doesn't really make any sense anyway. she's talking to you about something that didn't happen, or you can't really figure out what she's trying to say happened. it's hard to explain this fully, but there really is a marked difference between her previous conversation and this new way of speaking.i don't want to visit her these days. i dread it, and i put it off if i can. i feel horribly, horribly guilty about this. it's just that it's heartbreaking to see her, to try and struggle to make some sort of conversation with her, knowing all the while that she won't even remember you were there. every time i go to see her, she tells me that she hasn't seen anyone in weeks, even though i know another family member has been to visit with her the day before (or even sometimes that same day). she is so sad when you leave and always wants to come with you. i feel like a bad person when i leave and tell her she has to stay there. i almost feel like going to visit her makes her feel worse, like it reminds her that something's not right.like i said, i don't know why i am posting this. i guess...i just needed to say this to someone outside of our family who might understand.

my mom is 65 and has sun downing type of symptoms, and at all times of the day she has extremely poor short term memory. she seems perfectly normal in the mornings, except that she can't remember anything new for very long. at night, she becomes verbally abusive, disoriented, confused, has difficulty walking, with some pretty bad falls from time to time.she drinks every night, and i suspect that her short term memory loss is causing her to drink more than normal, or maybe she's just been a very sneaky alcoholic. what is going on though, is significantly more than just dealing with someone who had a bit too much to drink and got too tipsy.we have had two appointments for the dementia problem with her family doctor over the course of the last six months. i feel like this is taking way too long, and i'm calling her doctor every couple of weeks with little to no communication back. we've done the hospital paperwork allowing them to communicate with me on her behalf, so i don't know what's happening. i feel like maybe they're calling her, and because she has literally no short term memory, they may as well not be calling at all. don't they realize we're seeing them because of memory problems, and calling her is probably the exact wrong thing to do?as far as tests go, an mri confirmed that there is extra fluid around the brain, and shrinkage of the brain as well. there was an eeg done, but the neurologist didn't communicate back to her primary doctor with the results, so we're totally in the dark on that. blood work showed she was in relatively normal health, as far as all her organs working. i should also mention that her mom had alzheimer's, but there has been no diagnosis or any advice from the doctor yet.she still knows who everyone is, but can't remember anything new without constant reminding. she forgets long and very memorable conversations we've had about her drinking, while she was completely sober. she can't remember who she had stay at her house for more than a week during christmas. with some help, she remembers that she saw her doctor recently, but has no clue why. she's lost her license due to many accidents recently, but continues to drive. she wants me to take her to the dmv on a daily basis because she thinks she can get her license back. maybe these problems are coming from alcohol abuse, maybe it's from early alzheimer's and sun downing, maybe it's a combination of both... i have no clue at all.to make matters worse, her partner of 20+ years can't tolerate living with her anymore, because she has been a nightmare to be around every night for more than a year. he needs to move out, or he wants her to move out. any time i talk to her about it, she doesn't even remember that he wants to split up, and it breaks her heart just like she's finding out for the first time. she can't even figure out why he wants to move out because she has no memory of how terrible she has been. i'm pretty sure my mom will end up unintentionally hurting herself severely if she lives alone, or end up burning her house down. she's had some recent brushes with disaster on both accounts.where do i go? who do i talk to to get her some assistance? do i have to give up my entire life, move in with her, and take care of her every night until the day she passes? is that normally how this works? i feel like i've floated this problem for as long as it can stand, and worry that there will be bad consequences if nothing is done. she isn't getting the help that she needs right now, and i have no idea what to do, where to go, or how to deal with this.

Need advice for my dad. xpost r/askreddit
ok reddit, here goes… last summer my mother was officially diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia. it is a form of alzheimer’s that can start affecting someone in their early 40’s. my family noticed changes in my mom’s behavior, reasoning skills, and emotions over 10 years ago… we just didn’t know what it was. she had been progressively getting worse and finally, after years of wondering what was going on, she was diagnosed with ftd. while my family was glad to finally know what was going on we were all upset to realize that there is no medication to slow the, now very rapid, progression of this disease.my parents have been married for 27 years. my dad is her caretaker and both my adult siblings (21, 25) are living with him and helping out when they can. mind you, my family lives in a small 3 bedroom apartment. my mother is on disability but my dad is unemployed. he is 58 years old and suffers from severe rheumatoid arthritis. he lost his job several years back because some days he wakes up and his pain is so intense that moving to get out of bed is excruciating, forget trying to get to work when you are having difficulty trying to stand, let alone move. over the years he has managed to find ways to manage his pain, but still, some days are better than others. he applies for work but never gets hired. he applies for disability himself, but is constantly denied. my siblings pitch in every now and then but neither pay rent or for much else in the way of living expenses. i try to help as much as i can but i live in another city and work 2 jobs. i just graduated from school and am barely scraping by paying my rent, utilities, phone, and student loans.my dad needs help. i wish he could afford to hire a nurse or have someone come in everyday to help with my mom. she needs constant supervision. i went over last weekend to watch her for a day so my dad could have a day off and i had to watch her like a hawk. every sip of water is a trip to the bathroom… but she doesn’t sip, she chugs. she spills water down her throat often choking herself. she shovels food into her mouth also choking herself. there is no self-control. no reasoning to be had with her. she has to go to the bathroom, she will barge in on you with her pants already down. constant help. constant watching. constant reasoning that turns into frustration because she doesn’t comprehend, she just doesn’t understand.a chance. my mom’s dad died several years ago leaving her some money. he, however, saw what was happening to her and how she spent money like water (never with anything to show for it). my granddad put my uncle in control of her money and he sends a couple hundred dollars a month to my mom. we recently found out my granddad left her over $100,000. my dad is trying to convince my uncle to give him the money so he can invest in a small house so that he can free up some of their funds and provide better care for my mother while ensuring there will be a roof over her head, should anything happen to him. my uncle is fighting tooth and nail saying that is not what my granddad wanted. that my mom could take out a loan against the house and all this other bullshit. my mom could not take out a loan against a house, she sees a picture of a sheep and she says it is a hamster. my dad is beginning to suspect that the money isn’t there… that my uncle spent it himself or is hiding it somewhere. my dad has contacted different lawyers but no one will get back to him or help him out. my dad needs help. i don’t know who to ask but maybe someone on reddit will have some helpful advice that i can pass along.tl;dr my dad is trying to gain control over my sick mother’s inheritance, that my uncle is currently in control of, so he can take care of her. my uncle refuses and now my dad wants to pursue legal help but so far no one will help him. what should he do reddit?

A few questions regarding the spotting of alzheimer's or dementia in another person.
so i apologise straight off the bat if this is the incorrect sub but i have some questions and feel i would be best to do some research and get advice from people before actually making this an issue just in case, i'm wrong and it is not an issue. my event is the following.. my wonderful grandmother trusts to speak to me openly and honestly and i see her most weeks at least once. she lives at home with our family dog and is now the nice age of 86 and has had heart trouble. she has stents at present. she wasnt very forgetful as a younger woman but i noticed some repetition in the same conversations over a year ago which i would have put down as an aging forgetfulness . i feel now, certain few conversations and stories are repeated more often than others. more noticeably lately i notice that she is telling me about purchasing a tabletop cleaner which she loves but expressed it to me as though i never knew however she claimed my father took her to the shops and she got it. although i was the one that actually took her to the shops. and was there whilst she bought this. following this she then went on to thank me for bringing her out to another location that same day, prior to her going to that store with my father , which was correct in that aspect, it was actually me. today, i found myself in the position again where i was in conversation with her and she had showed me a couple of religious items which she received from a family member in the post and proceeded to explain a full description and backstory of those people , but i was there the first day she got them in the post, and at this point today, it was the 3rd time since she had received them that i had heard the same description and full conversation as though she never told me. i apologise of my terminology for anything is not accurate here but i want to get this understanding correct before moves of discussion to my relatives regarding these things. these are just some of the regular encounters i find very common now with her. but that's the jist of it. they all go the same way. and i will never remind her, i will always let her say these things without letting her know in case it starts to worry her.1. what are the main red flag tell tale signs of these illnesses?2. how do i know if there is a difference between the line of an older aged person being forgetful and a person who may be starting to develop either of the above mentioned . 3. how best can i help my grandmother tackle a test for these without letting her know there may be an issue.4. should i be concerned in your opinion?5. what can i do as a granddaughter she trusts?thank you all so much and i appreciate you reading and replying.

It’s so hard
honestly. she isn’t with me anymore. my great grandmother passed in 2014. on her birthday. it was also the last time i saw her. this seems like something that should have faded with time but it hasn’t. she honestly probably comes to mind every 2-3 days if not everyday. i didn’t deal with it when i was younger. i was 14 at the time. i have spent a good deal of my life with my grandparents. if not now my grandfather. he loved her too much to put her in a place that could take care of her but was unfamiliar. or get her a proper nurse. he tried to do it himself but he was approaching 80 and wasn’t as strong or quick as he was 5 years previously. i was usually there so he really leaned on me to help take care of her. it’s really a mentally exhausting thing to see someone deteriorate like that. it went from one day she couldn’t remember where the ice cream was. to she started to forget who her sister was. to having to carry her to bed and feed her soft foods because she could no longer chew. i think by that time she had 5 great grandkids. i was the oldest by 6 years. today she has 13 great kids she’ll never know. kids that i myself have babysat, fed, changed, and taught to read. my uncle had a baby around the time she was sick. we introduced him to her. he was only a month old. and there was absolutely no recognition on her face. she was blank and empty. just stared at him not registering who he was. i never had thought about how i’m the only grandkids who remembers how great she was. my brother is the oldest after me. but he was maybe 10 when she passed but was only 5 or 6 when she started to forget who he was. he doesn’t have any memory of who she was. i wanted to help my grandpa so much. now when i look back i imagine how hard it would be and how sad that a 14 year old would have to take care of someone in that condition. i had to take her to the bathroom, feed her, put her to bed, take her on walks, or push her wheelchair when she couldn’t anymore.  and i wanted to spend time with her while i could. i sat and watched her favorite movie with her on repeat everyday. cinderella. i still have her copy. she got so much smaller. she shrank so much. you’d touch her and be afraid she’d break. and wonder why she would have tears coming out of her eyes. my cousin is just a few years younger than me. she never visited but still cried anyway. one thing i never did was cry. not when she died. i remember we all came on her birthday and she laid in bed. staring at the corner of the ceiling. she barely moved then. the doctors told us it was time to pull the plug. so we said our goodbyes in turns. you can’t talk to them and get you want to say everything. you just stare at them and try to memorize their face and the way their hands feel because that’s the last time you’ll see them. yet you don’t want to remember them that way. it was only a few hours after we went home that they called and said she passed. we went back and it’s surreal because now she’s not there. my dad was silent and wouldn’t talk. my mom was sobbing asking why i wasn’t. my brother was crying. everyone was. and we spent the whole day going through photo albums and songs to put up and play at her funeral. i ended up sitting next to my grandpa. i couldn’t look at his face but i could see his hands shaking. i’ll always remember someone who loved shopping. not for her but for everyone else. you could lose her for hours because she was so short. you had to look under the racks to find her mary jane shoes running across the aisles. her long striped socks. t shirts with honey bees and sunflowers on them. or her collection of brooches. who would spend everything on you and tell you not to tell grandpa. spoiled us rotten. cooked everything in the cupboard. i remember she told me how she met my grandpa. he was born in ‘38 and her ‘42. she was 16. roller skating on the street and he stopped her. said she was beautiful and asked her on a date. which she turned down but he kept asking until she gave in. it doesn’t matter that maybe they won’t get to know her. all i can do is tell them what i remember about her.

# Introduction
The ADRD project is a continuation and the most recent iteration of the ADRDtask14. This project focuses on advancing the methodologies, techniques, and results achieved in the previous tasks, aiming to provide more robust and accurate solutions for the challenges associated with ADRD.

# Background
ADRD, or Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementias, represents a group of cognitive conditions that impact memory, thinking, and behavior. The significance of research in this domain cannot be understated, given the increasing prevalence of these conditions globally.

# Project Goals
+ Refine and improve the methodologies established in ADRDtask14.
+ Explore new techniques and approaches to address the challenges of ADRD more effectively.
+ Collaborate with the community to share insights, data, and results to push the boundaries of what's possible in ADRD research.
# Getting Started
To get started with the project, please refer to the documentation and setup guidelines provided in the repository. We encourage collaboration and contributions, so if you have any suggestions or improvements, please feel free to raise an issue or submit a pull request.

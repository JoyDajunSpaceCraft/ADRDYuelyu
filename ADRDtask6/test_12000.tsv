my father had a team of people, he was treated like a king.	0
he had nurses, wheelchair taxi, physio, dietician, tons of medical supplies everything for him.	0
all he had to do was stay inside and not get sick.	0
all the things me and mum did for him.	0
we tried to change him.	0
he didn't want to.	0
and the worst part that this was all preventable.	0
if only he got mental health treatment and took his health seriously we would've ended up here.	0
when he wanted a drink i would drop everything for him.	0
if you want to know about my story just look at my post history.	0
now dad is gone i feel like i lost a part of myself.	0
i built the last 3 years around that man and di it from a place of compassion as a son.	0
i miss u dad, i wish u didn't better and i wish didn't have to feel this.	0
all the things we did for you, out of love for u.	0
my dad suffered from stroke.	0
and i have to take care of him.	0
especially at night.	0
cause he doesnt sleep well, im worried for him and look after him throughout the night.	0
he becomes strange.	0
sometimes, he doesnt look like my dad anymore.	0
yesterday, he touched my breasts while im comforting him to sleep.	0
i thought thats an accident and i put his hand down.	0
but his hand climbed up again.	0
i yelled at him, dad, what are you doing?	0
and push him away.	0
then, he said that he couldnt control his mind and he wanna go to moms bed.	0
i feel so sick.	0
why did he treat me like that???	0
i gave almost all of my time to take care of him.	0
even though i was so tired, i was ready for him when he called me.	0
i loved him.	0
i trusted him.	0
but yesterday, i was like who is he.	0
is he even my dad???	0
thankfully, he cant move well because of stroke and i could easily get out from that place.	0
now, im even scared to stay around him.	0
i feel awkward.	0
i dont want to take care of him anymore.	0
i just wanna run away from this house where i feel no warmth and everything seems fake.	0
how could he have those thoughts?	0
how??	0
does he even appreciate for what i did?	0
its been such a long road, ive ignored my own health for years now and it feels like im falling apart at the seams.	0
part of me just pushed thru the various aches and pains out of stubbornness but i also think i can handle more than i really can frequently.	0
why do i not do things i should for myself but have no problem walking thru fire if its for one of my loved ones?	0
if my mom was living in constant pain i wouldnt hesitate to drive her straight to the er for help but if i drive myself there & they keep me then whos going to take care of her?	0
i know i need a backup plan but im so tired all the time its like making that happen always falls to the bottom of my have to list & just doesnt get done... crazy but im feeling a bit better today (it was too hot to go outside so ive hung out in air conditioning all day:) however, i keep forgetting things and its making think im losing my mind along with my body which scares the hell out of me.	0
and why do i post these things here but dont want to have this discussion with the people i need to have it with?	0
ive never been afraid to have hard talks before but im afraid to say out loud i need help for me, maybe for fear i wont be able to take it back...and i will lose it for real.	0

i am on the brink of losing all my marbles.	0
that is all	0
i am new to caregiving.	0
i've been my mom's caregiver since my dad passed away.	0
she can do a lot of things for herself but she does have some issues walking due to arthritis.	0
how do i talk to her about personal hygiene without pissing her off?	0
i have chatted with her in the past but she always gets defensive.	0
i am always very nice to her about it too so i'm at a bit of loss of what to do.	0
i need some help here guys...need to get her into some kind of routine.	0
any and all help is greatly appreciated...thank you!	0
my girlfriend, the mother of my son, has developed fibromyalgia after receiving the covid vaccine.	0
im coming up on 1 week of being a full time caregiver, and father, and 4th day of not being able to leave the house to go to work, the store, outside at all...      i feel like such an ass, i feel so alone in this, i tell my friends what im going through and i stop getting invited to stuff and no one steps up to even just come keep me company.	0
meanwhile my(31m) gf (23f) sits here in horrible pain, she can barely walk, cant hold her son or even have him sit on her lap, and im resenting her because shes saying she feels alone.	0
like wtf is wrong with me... i just wish this was more natural for me.	0
i love her and my son, hes a toddler and i have to just lock him up in his playroom with the tv rolling all day so i can be ready to walk his mom to the bathroom because she has fallen down 6+ times this week by trying to do shit alone.	0
the worst thing about this situation is i can max afford care services for 1 of them.	0
especially with the fact that im now literally unable to work because of the constant care a young child and an adult whos been crippled into needing cared for like a newborn require.	0
so basically im at a point where no matter what happens i have to put my new business on hold indefinitely, quit my day job, and functionally give up on having any time for myself period... i have no family that can help, my friends are all dudebros who are scared or shitty with children, my girls only friends that are trying to help are a literal unemployed girl and her mom who has pancreatic cancer, both of them arent physically capable of helping in any way besides emotional support for my gf.	0
i just feel robbed, my life has been taken from me and i have no one who i can even talk to	0
so my dad has been waking up 3-4 times every day for the past year or so helping my mom use the bathroom.	0
i'm just wondering if theres any health risks involved.	0
he takes naps in the afternoon sometimes	0

this is my first position in senior care.	0
i have worked with children in the past and grew up staying with my father who was an live-in for a senior care facility.	0
i signed an nda before i started and was aware that my client was in a behavioral program.	0
i have worked here for several months now, i see no ill intent from his poa but they are trying to maintain his behavior to their standard of living.	0
with his current mental state this isnt possible and leads to conflict.	0
nothing physical but still not how an adult should be treated.	0
with the nda i cant share any identifiable or personal facts.	0
im not sure if this has truly all be sanctioned and designed by his doctors but i am sure some of the methods are degrading.	0
i want someone who knows more about the regulations to asses whats going on but dont know how to do that with the restrictions of the nda.	0
any advice would be appreciated.	0
thought we could use a weekly thread that focuses on something many of us could find helpful, music.	0
this thread will be a weekly feature where we can share music with each other.	0
pandora stations, spotify playlists, amazon music, apple music, whatever you listen to, drop it here!	0
sharing is caring!	0
hope you all find some new music to jam along with, chill out to, or just enjoy.	0
caring for my father has become the only thing in my life.	0
i'm chained to him.	0
i can't take a second away or he destroys something, has a meltdown or pees wherever he wants to.	0
i'm so damn tired.	0
i just want to sleep one full night.	0
i used to work with mentally challenged people and alzheimer's patients, why can't i do this for my own father?	0
i feel like a complete failure.	0
i'm just tired.	0
i guess i just needed to vent.	0
thanks for listening.	0
im struggling with conflicting feels regarding my mom.	0
i adore her.	0
shes a great person, funny, supportive, and well i could go on for hours.	0
shes my mom and i love her.	0
but im struggling because shes so timid now.	0
her physical health and depression have done a number on her.	0
shes almost like a beaten animal.	0
her self-confidence is non-existent.	0
she worked from home for many years  and now never wants to go out.	0
she wont ask for things because she doesnt want to ruffle any feather.	0
at times ive watched her literally recede into herself and it hurts my heart.	0
because of her depression and low self esteem she hasnt taken care of herself in years.	0
she just turned 62 but she looks like shes in her 80s.	0
shes really self conscious of her weight and hair loss.	0
but this is the south, many people are overweight.	0
ive tried taking her shopping and giving her some fashion advice for bigger women.	0
but shes not comfortable because she just sees her fat.	0
as for her hair, ive tried buying her wigs.	0
but shes dissatisfied because they dont look like her.	0
this is really hard for me to say, but im embarrassed to show her off.	0
i hate that i feel this way.	0
shes clearly struggling mentally and im over here thinking these terrible things.	0
i want to help her or at the very least be supportive.	0
ive tried doing little things to boost her confidence but it never works.	0
i want to help her but i just dont know how.	0
and its starting to really get to me because i just want her to be confident and happy.	0
hi, i am a caregiver professionally, not for a family member.	0
am i still able to ask a question here?	0
i care and tutor for a sweet and special 12 year old boy with down syndrome.	0
since i started, i have not been treated very nicely by his mother, but i have brushed it off really well.	0
except for this last week.	0
she seems to always assume the worst in me, and only point out what i do wrong, whether it's actually wrong or not.	0
i have compassion for her though, because i believe she's had some bad experience with other caregivers, so she may be hyper vigilant.	0
i understand and i am patient with her.	0
but there have been times when she was straight up unkind towards me and sarcastic in a demeaning way towards me.	0
when i first started the job, i was told i would be paid by her (for tutoring only) and by the man who runs the caregiving company who hired me for her.	0
"she has had a few times where she has asked me ""what am i paying you for?"""	0
when she wanted to know what exactly i was tutoring the boy that day, instead of just asking me what  i was doing with him that day.	0
she speaks to me as if i begged her to pay me before i started the job or something, but she had made the deal to pay me before she even met me.	0
she treats me as if i am below her, and like i do not deserve to be paid or be treated nicely.	0
i am ready to quit, but i love this boy and his sister so much.	0
i told her today i wanted to talk to her about a problem i'm having with the job, because i don't want to quit.	0
she does not know what it is i want to talk about.	0
how do i do this without her feeling that i am attacking her?	0
my (34f) wife (32f) decided to end treatment yesterday.	0
she has been fighting cancer for the last 5 years.	0
every treatment seemed to take a chunk of her with it, literally and figuratively.	0
yesterday she was supposed to have her 4th brain surgery that wouldve likely left her paralyzed on one side of her body and wouldve given her maybe 8 more months to live.	0
with out it she is looking at 2-6. at the last minute she made her decision.	0
she made all 3 of her neurologists cry as she explained to them that the depression that comes after a surgery wouldnt be worth it at this point.	0
one hugged us both and cried with us and told us she loved us.	0
she just wants to relax into where she is at and let nature do what it does.	0
she even comforted her nurse, who was at a loss for words and hadnt yet had this experience.	0
my wife is an amazing loving person.	0
i am a little at a loss myself.	0
i also didnt want her to have to go through the aftermath of this surgery.. i love everything about this woman..	0
(long post is long cause i really dont know what to do and theres a long history) so, ive been living with my mom my entire life, minus 2 years in college, and im 33 now.	0
shes never been married, my father left when i was an infant, and i have a half sibling, but hes in a different state and we share a dad, not mom, so its only ever just been us.	0
when i was around 20 she had been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, and after that i went back home to do community college to take help her out and to help take care of my grandpa who had been starting to get sick.	0
ff to 2012 and she loses her job cause she was so sick, in and out of the hospital.	0
in 2013 i lost the my job, the only job bringing in money, and right after that my grandpa died.	0
during the time i didnt have a job, (and before) we were borrowing $ from family, not paying bills, eating out a lot, and turning into hoarders.	0
i would manage to get part time jobs in between, but they wouldnt last long, and lots of other stuff, but i was essentially her caretaker starting around that time.	0
she got social security disability benefits in 2014. at the end of 2016, she had to have a leg amputated before she stepped on a sewing needle that went into her leg and turned the bottom half gangrene.	0
we lost our house in 2017 while she was recovering, and we moved, and i took over the finances, (which everything gets paid on time now), i kept the new apartment clean (because of a marathon of watching the show hoarders for almost 6 months), and i was her full time caretaker while working 2 jobs.	0
i took care of all her dr appts and pills because she couldnt process the fact she had lost a limb, and then would go on to get an ostomy bag because the colitis was so bad and there was a cancer scare.	0
she let the fear control her life, and then became too dependent on me.	0
i found us a better apartment, bigger for her wheelchair and have watched her go in and out of the hospital a half dozen, dozen times a year, watched her go to rehabs, been told at least a dozen times by drs they dont know how shes alive with how many health problems she has and how she refuses to take care of herself.	0
ive been told 4 times in my life that if i had waited even one night longer she would have died.	0
one rehab said they thought shed never get out of bed again, and 5 months later shes walking on a prosthetic leg.	0
only to watch her throw it all away as soon as she gets home because she wants normal back.	0
she doesnt listen to me or take me seriously because she still sees me as her little girl, and were both stubborn as heck.	0
we have more fights than good moments and im physically and emotionally exhausted.	0
i now work from home, but have a part time job, and have a hobby i recently turned into a side hustle thats starting to make money, cause we live in an expensive place, and ive recently been using my health insurance to try and take care of my own mental conditions.	0
she has family but they refuse to help, after so many times that ive asked for help.	0
they tell me i need my own life, but wont offer even advice on how to make it happen.	0
recently, a friend helped push me to make some realizations that my mom is actually rather manipulative and shes not going to change because she has me waiting on her hand and foot.	0
she honestly cant live by herself, but she refuses to think about even going to an assisted independent living place, and wont even let anyone but me take her to drs appointments, which is affecting my job by needing so much time off.	0
ive decided we need to live apart.	0
im searching for a place for me, and im going to have to work almost 2 jobs and my side hustle to afford it, but feel it should be worth it.	0
we found her some senior apartments and got her on a waitlist, but need to find a back up place for her while the waitlist goes on, because i cant do this anymore.	0
i cry more often than not now, and we fight all the time because i just cant get her to take care of herself, even when im there doing everything for her.	0
i know shes capable of it, and i hope that by moving it forces her to do it.	0
i told her that id still be over at least a couple times a week to help prep meals and fill pills, but i havent lived on my own, and i need the freedom.	0
am i doing the right thing?	0
im just..... so exhausted and im starting to resent her, and i dont want to, shes my mom, i love her.	0
my husband had covid the in intensive care on a respirator for 19 days in a coma for 31 days covid.	0
he was in rehabilitation center for 10 days and left ama ( against medical advice) 8 days ago.i have physical therapist 3 times a week in home occupational therapist 2 times a week registered nurse 2 times a week and home health aide 2 times a week.	0
thursday he laid in bed all day long.	0
so i had a serious talk with him did you come home to die?	0
was i too harsh?	0
ps he is now doing his exercises and sitting in the lounge chair and not his bed all day	0
mental issues are kicking in.	0
i find myself treating my grandmother exactly like my daughter.	0
im in three modes: restriction, prevention, damage control.	0
im constantly waiting on the next fall.	0
and dreading it because i know i cant do the after care again.	0
or if it will be the last fall.	0
i get mad at the physical therapists when they tell her its okay to not use her walker in her safe spaces because thats where she has always fallen.	0
but if i tell her to use her walker, im hindering what little bit of achievement she feels.	0
im forgoing family events, not even bothering to plan things with my kids (3 and soon to be born).	0
i find myself realizing i cant be her socialization, her pharmacist, her driver, her therapist, her beauty tech, her landing pad, her nurse, etc anymore because i am struggling to be all that and do it for my kids too.	0
i feel guilty for admitting that i cant do it anymore, i feel guilty for not doing more than i already do, i feel guilty for researching assisted living.	0
i feel guilty for wanting freedom, and being petrified of what freedom could lead to because adjusting to anything at her age is so hard.	0
ive been a full time caregiver for over a year now, but ive only worked with one client.	0
their health began a rapid decline three weeks ago and they have maybe a couple of days left.	0
i adore my client and its very difficult to watch them go through this, but im also worried about what happens after they pass because the agency i work for doesnt have a great deal of clients- meaning i may be without a paycheck for a good chunk of time (one of my coworkers didnt get another client until 3 months after her client passed).	0
any advice on this would be greatly appreciated, especially since im already financially strained.	0
im in the us.	0
my client also has two grown children who lost their other parent earlier this week and i cant imagine the grief theyre going through right now.	0
i want to do whatever i can to help them get through this.	0
any tips or advice on this would, again, be greatly appreciated.	0
thank you so much and i wish all of you ease of heart as you take care of others (and yourself).	0
[removed]	0
so i have one parent left and age wise after that i expect to have two aunt's with no alone else but me and it's crushing me.	0
how do you guys cope with the current stress and the future stress.	0
please do not say take a walk.	0
i'd love too but if my current charge is house bound so am i.	0
i'm new to this sub, and i'm not sure if this is the correct place to post this, but i thought it might be a good place to start.	0
i take care of 3 disabled adults: my mom has ms and sometimes needs my help, my dad was recently given news that he has 6 months to live and is bed bound, and my younger brother who went blind a little over 2 years ago.	0
for the most part, i'm fine.	0
i like taking care of everyone and i've been doing it since i was about 18-19 aside from when i was away at school.	0
i work for an online company, so i get to work from home which gives me plenty of time to do what i need to do here, but between that and the round-the-clock care my dad needs right now, i'm exhausted.	0
i feel like i don't get enough sleep.	0
i don't have a lot of time to unwind on my own, and i feel like when i do have quiet time someone always needs me.	0
i sit down, i have to get back up, and by the time i'm done i have to go to bed.	0
i sleep for a few hours, then i'm up for work at 3am.	0
by the time i finish with work, it's time for everyone else to be awake and it's just nonstop.	0
i have physical therapy once a week for an hour, because i had major back surgery last year and am still trying to get my body back to normal from it, and i feel guilty for it.	0
today i left the house for an extra 45 minutes, just to get out and be with myself, but i had messages asking when i'd be home, to bring them things, do this, call this person, etc., and i just kind of had a breakdown.	0
i don't know if you'd call this being burnt out, but whatever i feel is just agonizing.	0
it's not that i mind caring for my family.	0
"i'm the oldest, my mom needs help and my brother can't do a lot because he's still trying to learn how to ""be blind"" essentially."	0
i feel like it's my responsibility.	0
my mom is up with my dad when hospice nurses come 3x a week, but only because this is when i usually sleep in the mornings after work.	0
i can't nap.	0
i can't take a long, hot bath or read my books the way i used to.	0
i just feel like i've hit a rut and i don't know what to call it, or how to get out of it.	0
i'm so tired, i want to cry, i can't remember the last time in the last year or so that i've had to just myself.	0
there's always, always, always something for me to do.	0
how do you cope?	0
how do you deal with stress?	0
how can i sneak in the little things without feeling guilty that i'm taking away from the time i'm needed by everyone else in my house?	0
hi everyone.	0
i'm new to this community, but i wanted to post because i just need to vent.	0
for the last 2 1/2 years i've been my mother's caregiver, and i've been on a break for the last 2 months.	0
she has myotonic dystrophy type 1 (i believe it's type 1 thats adult onset sometimes i forget).	0
i had to step away because it was destroying me mentally and physically, plus i got to a point where i ran out of empathy, sympathy, compassion, and my resentment became heightened.	0
don't get me wrong she is being cared for by my dad so she's ok, and i do love and care for her, but our relationship has always been rocky.	0
she doesn't respect any boundaries i set and her personality just doesn't mesh well with mine.	0
i'm sitting with her for my dad today, and i was talking about the state of my mental health she cut me off and made a comment about my teeth.	0
i know that cognitive decline is a symptom of her disease, but she's always been like this.	0
there's been times she's commented on my weight, skin, teeth (called me snaggle tooth and said my tooth breaking off is an embarrassment since she was a hygienist), and its been like that my whole life.	0
she's not a mean spirited person and i know she loves me, but she's been the source for some of the insecurities i developed throughout life.	0
i feel like a real asshole saying all of this, but it's the truth.	0
i'm just fed up with the situation, and tired of the guilt i feel.	0
i'm afraid that the situation has permanently altered the way i respond to other people's emotions and pain.	0
so, i'm a caregiver to my spouse, work full time, and have 3 kids (teenagers).	0
been doing it for a decade at this point.	0
she's got limited mobility, and while she says it's hard for her to get the kids to do anything, we all had a meeting of the minds and a chore chart has helped.	0
sort of dad's voice when he's away from home, and she can refer to it so we can at least attempt to co-parent rather than it feeling like i'm a single parent and cleaning up after everyone.	0
but, it never seems to fail, stuff only gets kicked into high gear when i walk into the house, and then she starts yelling at the kids why they didn't get their chores done, and then they're rushing around to do them while i'm trying to cook dinner.	0
it really makes me feel like crap when i go home.	0
"""oh no, dad is home!"""	0
"i feel like this more of a parenting fail, but when i'm the only parent that can actually ""do"" anything around the house, and the wife plays games all day or sleeps, it's like i have a 4th teenager in the house."	0
i never really got along with my dad.	0
he lives with us and was very independent until he had a fall in 2018. he was diagnosed with parkinsons and it's been downhill since then.	0
we have a caregiver from 8:30 to 3:30 but after that it's me.	0
weekends it's all me.	0
he has night time incontinence and because of parkinsons he is often constipated.	0
we use a condom catheter, but lately he's been pulling it out in the middle of the night.	0
which means it's a mess in the morning and on a saturday morning i am washing sheets and cleaning him up.	0
we keep telling him to call us before he stands up cause a fall can really do a number on him.	0
but he is stubborn or thinks he will bother us so does it without calling us.	0
my patience is wearing thin and we often get into a screaming match.	0
i feel so guilty and depressed because i don't have much of a life, can't go out or do anything fun.	0
i know many of you are in the same boat.	0
any tips on how to deal with this.	0
thank you.	0
hi everyone, caregiving is indescribably hard.	0
dr. bj miller's teaching and his video series have offered me and thousands of others comfort and knowledge, hope you find them helpful too, and look forward to your questions and feedback: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=plp6-phef8j_pjfzgcpcbhckelb6rrajh0 context: dr. bj miller leads a discussion on coping with the stress of serious illness, for patients, caregivers and clinicians.	0
lifes hard, especially when dealing with illness or loss, but there are tried and true ways to make things a little less hard and a little more meaningful; prayer, meditation, exercise, creative outlets of all sorts, to name a few.	0
we revisit familiar coping mechanisms and discover new ones, while hearing from participants on real life examples of coping that have helped them.	0

ive (23f) been taking care of my grandfather who has alzheimers induced dementia for over a year now.	0
taking care of him makes me feel sad.	0
usually, i dont think too much about his condition, but every now and then i get really sad about his condition and how much i cant understand  of what he is saying.	0
i cant even have conversations with him about his life at this point.	0
i hate how we have to give him anti-psychotics for his cantankerousness (we give him haldol, which sucks since ive read up on the side effects.	0
i feel like the alzheimers and the haldol is turning his brain to mush).	0
at least once a day hell state how great he is which makes me feel sad.	0
he has forgotten how to bathe and clothe himself.	0
throughout the day he tells me how great im doing/how i have some great things going  and it just makes me sad/get on the verge of tears.	0
and most days he doesnt ask for much.	0
today while trying to talk to me he said im still there, but im not and he talks about things he wants to finish.	0
this disease sucks.	0
how do you guys deal with this sadness?	0
i am new to reddit and found this sub.	0
i am taking care of my husband who has dementia.	0
he has been fairly stable but recently he has gotten insistent that he doesn't want to have to leave the house or interact with anyone.	0
i took him for regular blood work since his yearly physical is coming up and to his dentist later in the same day and he never spoke a word the entire time.	0
at home today he was very upset and anxious about having to leave the house in the future.	0
he doesn't even want to leave the bedroom.	0
does anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with this?	0
i am at my wits end.	0
my physical is coming up at the end of the month and i will of course discuss this with our doctor.	0
thanks for any help you can give in the meantime.	0
hi, i'm doing some research into pressure ulcers and specialised mattresses.	0
has anyone tried mattresses like alternating air pressure mattresses or has any insights into pressure ulcer management in general?	0
my dad has dementia and requires complete around-the-clock care.	0
i took care of him for 8 months without any help, until it made me so burned out/depressed that i had a mental breakdown.	0
my mom stepped back in at this point and became his caregiver while i took a month off for myself.	0
mom refused to put him in a nursing home up to this point.	0
well--surprise!--mom got hurt while taking care of him, which meant i had no choice but to step back in.	0
my mental health went right back to where it was previously.	0
luckily, this time, mom agreed to put him in a care facility.	0
i got the ball rolling on that.	0
got him on hospice.	0
it looked like he would be cleared for a facility soon.	0
i booked him a respite stay at a nearby nursing home to give myself a little break.	0
mom went to visit him during this time.	0
"she said it was heartbreaking to seem him in that state, and his eyes ""looked dead."""	0
i rebutted that dad has severe dementia and is on hospice, and his care is beyond what we can provide at home... it's sad, but a nursing home is our best option right now.	0
mom still decided that he will stay home, despite all my efforts.	0
well, i've told her that i can't continue being his unpaid caregiver.	0
i want to live my life and focus on my mental health.	0
i'm tired of having this heavy burden on my shoulders--especially after trying to hard to set him up in a nursing home, only for mom to change her mind last minute.	0
it's painful to set a boundary, but i had to do it.	0
i still can't help but fill extremely guilty.	0
my mom is not physically capable of caring for him properly, but she is incredibly stubborn.	0
she will literally take care of him until she can no longer walk, and then i will have to figure out how to put two parents in a nursing home.	0
it's incredibly frustrating.	0
am i being terrible for refusing to help with dad's care?	0

i just joined last night, was so glad to find this community.	0
"i wrote a long rant this morning, which was really helpful, but when i tried to post it, i got ""something went wrong"" i shortened my title text and tried again, that time it looked like it went through and posted, but i don't see my post in the list."	0
does it take time for posts to show up, like they need to be reviewed by a mod first?	0
or is my novella post just lost in the ether?	0
sorry not to see it here, but even if i did write it for nothing it still felt good.	0
will keep trying to use this resource, i'm new to reddit and still trying to figure it out so any help is appreciated.	0
thanks	0
the universe needs to calm down.	0
i'm 33f and i take care of my parents who are in their 70's.	0
mom has stage iv lung cancer and dad has a bunch of stuff going on.	0
i also had a feral cat have kittens in my yard, shelters are full so i'll have to neuter them and their parents.	0
dogs can't go in the back yard because of kittens, so i'm taking them out on leashes in the front yard.	0
one of the dogs has gi issues and is on a bland diet rn.	0
he had a normal stool, but passed blood with it today.	0
also the kitchen drain line collapsed, and i'm coordinating the repair for my parents because my dad is hard of hearing.	0
plumbers in and out of the house until 5pm.	0
mom asks me to order ubereats, and keeps asking me to as i order food on my phone.	0
dog with gi issues has diarrhea in the house.	0
food arrives as i'm cleaning carpet and mom is anxious about why i'm not eating.	0
dad comes in and demands to get him ice for his drink as i am cleaning up liquid doggie doo.	0
i tell him to get his own and don't put any water down the sink... he put water down the sink after i had the plumber extract all the water for the leak detection specialist who is coming tomorrow.	0
during all of this my older brother who is almost 50, is texting me that i can cook, wash my dirty dishes, and wash my dirty laundry at his house 30 minutes away.	0
i have a portable dishwasher that only uses 4 gallons of water that's easy to dump on my own and a laundromat 5 minutes from my house.	0
i instead ask him to bring paper plates, plastic forks, white rice, and unflavored pedialyte (last two are for the dog), but he wouldn't be able to get it until 8pm (not a big deal).	0
then he says he can't do it because it's too much of an inconvenience for him because he got off work late and needs to go to bed.	0
so i just ordered instacart.	0
i understand the need for rest, but i only get 4 hours a day tops so to me it is more of an excuse so he can feel like he tried instead of actually helping.	0
he has a history of being unavailable, bailing out halfway, and just being difficult.	0
i was in the middle of typing this when my doggo had his accident and i had multiple trips with both dogs on the leash while ordering on instacart.	0
i ate my dinner an hour and a half after it got here.	0
i'm so tired.	0
i still need to clean the mess the plumbers left in the kitchen.	0
fml i need a break.	0
throwaway account.	0
found this subreddit recently and started lurking until today where i felt motivated to post.	0
i (23m) live with my mom (60) and grandma (82) who has been diagnosed with dementia (possibly lewy body).	0
my grandma has always been abusive to my mom but we are stuck with taking care of her because my aunt refuses putting my grandma in a home.	0
my grandma although clearly cognitively unwell, still remembers that she hates my mom and treats her terribly; whether its damning her to live alone or telling her to eat shit, saying were poisoning her, or talking badly of her to anyone who stays to watch her for a couple hours while we run errands.	0
she will also get up in the middle of the night and take off her pajamas and diapers to dirty the sheets (i dont believe this is intentional, but its hard to believe its a result of the dementia when she knows to say exactly the same things she would say to my mom when she was a child to belittle her).	0
she can walk but she refuses to at times, she can get up off the bed and her chair but at times she refuses to do that too, yet at night shes up and i swear shes doing gymnastics from the ruckus i hear in her room.	0
my mom is so tired from having to work and then take care of her abusive mother, and i cant help as much as i can being that i am in college and dealing with classes, maintaining my job (i run a small buisness online from home) and having to be available for my father who is declining with alzheimers and his care/doctors appointments.	0
what do i even do?	0
am i doing something wrong?	0
has anyone else gone through something like this?	0
i feel terrible knowing my mom is suffering and i cannot help as much as i should be.	0
neither of us even mind helping her get up and go to the bathroom, making her food (that she refuses to eat), putting her to bed; but when she calls out every 5 minutes to get you to do something and then starts the verbal abuse, its unbearable.	0
luckily i dont get the abuse but watching my mother get it is almost worse; i rather be at the recieving end of it.	0
my mom is so depressed as her life is passing by her and i dont know what to do.	0
my bed-ridden, multi-stroke-surviving, deeply-aphasic, hemiplegic mother turned herself onto her side tonight, with nothing other than a request from me!	0
she has been able to do the individual elements, crossing her leg, bending her knee, grabbing the rail, etc.	0
sometimes she can do a couple together, but usually needs help to hold her position, or doesn't turn far enough.	0
"nope, this was a beautiful, perfect turn and all it took was me saying, ""let's turn on your side."""	0
it was such a great, unexpected moment that i immediately sank to the floor crying.	0
even having to then clean a large bm and redress an ugly sacral wound didn't do enough to mar that moment.	0
i know tomorrow she may forget how, and it could be weeks or months before we see that again.	0
tomorrow she may forget name and may smack at me when i help her with her water.	0
but for 30 seconds tonight, things were great.	0
we so often share the shittiest parts of our lives and the lives of those we care for (and i am by no means complaining about that).	0
but tonight, let's share the good moments that we have, the successes, the shining moments in the dark.	0
let's have a triumph tuesday, if you will.	0
hi everyone.	0
long time lurker, first time poster.	0
i know the position that im in isnt nearly the level of a lot of yall, but im feeling lonely and i dont know where else to turn.	0
im in a wlw relationship and my (28) girlfriend (29) is chronically ill. she has several illnesses such as eds/pots/dysautonomia/gastroperesis and last year was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting ms that left her in the hospital for a month until she could regain feeling in her legs.	0
at that time i was her primary caretaker and i still hold that role but its much easier now that she can walk.	0
her everyday life is difficult and there are many things that we cant do that healthy couples can do.	0
i try not to dwell on that fact and try to celebrate the things we can do, but it gets hard sometimes when she feels so ill all the time that everyday tasks are a battle for her.	0
we just moved in together last month and im seeing for the first time close up how hard everyday life is for her and i get so sad that i cant take all of this away from her.	0
does anyone have any advice for how to make things easier for her but doesnt cause me burnout?	0
i feel like i focus so much on her that im losing myself.	0
i just want her to be happy.	0
my husband is recovering from covid and very weak.	0
i guess i should stop yelling at him.	0
(i'm not)..very sad	0
i again went down the rabbit hole looking for an explanation to suffering from insomnia for 3 years now.	0
the didn't really find anything as always.	0
3 years ago two things happened, my spouse broke her leg and thus needed much more support.	0
i had a procedure to fix chronic pain, that just gave me new chronic pain that started out sever enough to keep me up at night but since has become more irritating than anything else.	0
so i'm not sure what triggered this insomnia, do others who are technically on call 24/7 have sleep issues?	0
my spouse almost never asks anything of me during sleep time so there's no logical reason for me to be on alert but i wake up every 1.5 hours and bound out of bed like i'm late for work only to do basically nothing.	0
&#x200b; i used to fall asleep in 10 seconds and sleep through the urban soundscape and only wake for distinct clear voices.	0
so insomnia is the polar opposite of where i was 3 years ago.	0
im here with my mom, day after day.	0
dads busy working to pay the bills and put food on the table.	0
my friends have all moved away and are living their lives, the way i wish i could, but cant.	0
they have spouses, their own homes, and can do whatever they want.	0
i, meanwhile, have to haul my mom to the toilet every few hours, and help clean her up after.	0
i have no one to talk to, or spend time with, except for my tired dad and infirm mom.	0
i hate this so much sometimes.	0
thanks for reading this.	0
because it's all i think about anymore.	0
my story - had a flashy job, to be honest.	0
top of the world, out five nights a week socializing, all glitz and ritz and then, boom, my poor dad had a devastating stroke seven years ago.	0
i continued my life as i defined it (friends, relationships, job, etc) but his care started to need more of my involvement.	0
so i moved back home and helped my mom until he passed in 2018.	0
(an unexpected gift - my dad and i had a terrible relationship but i was able to heal it.	0
he wasn't a scary tyrant anymore, he was just a man trying the best he could in life.	0
that's all he ever was.	0
i could see that, finally.	0
it put me in a good place considering.	0
i felt useful and healed.)	0
but his dying (still hard to write those words) left my mom on her own.	0
my dad had done all the dad-like stuff of his era and so i, unofficially, took over.	0
loved it at first.	0
she was healthy, involved in her own life, ran a book club.	0
even beyond that, i love my mom, she's an amazing woman, strong, a true survivor.	0
once again, it felt great to help, really great.	0
when people would ask if it was hard to sacrifice, i corrected them.	0
it didn't feel like a sacrifice.	0
it felt right.	0
my mom took care of me, now i was helping her.	0
i embraced it all.	0
until the pandemic.	0
she is 84 and started to lose everyone important in her life.	0
i mean, just think about that for a second.	0
everyone you love, grew up with, the shared history, you laughed with, all gone.	0
aging is horrible partly because our western society makes it horrible.	0
we treat the elderly like a problem, a headache.	0
they are just us!	0
just older versions of us.	0
why is that so hard for so may to understand.	0
anyway, i digress.	0
here i am.	0
i am now officially a caregiver to a dear woman who has mostly good days but, of course, really bad, sad days too.	0
she and i live in a big house together so there's always a lot to do.	0
but on those bad days (hint, today) she often seems to be fading and just doesn't care anymore.	0
when she starts to fade, i feel myself literally disappearing.	0
i am tempted to put my hand up in front of my face to make sure i'm still here.	0
as for help from my siblings, honestly they are awful.	0
all of them live out of state, all living their best lives, married, wealthy, traveling.	0
so i'm bitter af.	0
i fight to stay grateful.	0
i am still working (sorta), freelance, it keeps me afloat and my brain hasn't atrophied.	0
but that's all i got left.	0
i'm home behind a computer instead of in the thick of it all.	0
friends are mainly gone.	0
so, finally, i land back on my question to you (sorry for the wall of text).	0
when you define yourself as one thing only, a 'caregiver', what happens when you aren't that one thing anymore.	0
my mom, this house, the car, this is my life.	0
so without her, i can't see a future for myself anymore.	0
things used to be colorful and exciting, now it's just all muted grey.	0
you know?	0
anyway, thanks so much for reading.	0
sorry to bring anyone else down, i really am.	0
my grandpa recently passed a week ago and i've been really pressed to try and get a job asap bc i am still head of household.	0
i thought i might try my old work place but they're taking a little while to respond which is making me a little anxiety.	0
well i just got off the phone with the company that paid me for caregiving my grandfather and she's willing to take me on as i learned quite a few skills.	0
i'm just really nervous that i'm not going to be good enough despite caring for a year and a half.	0
what is caregiving for other people like?	0
yeah basically what the title says.	0
hes been injured for a year, still waiting on another surgery, and now for the past couple months been dealing with a migraine that happened whenever he stands up so basically he cant do much and definitely hasnt been able to leave the house.	0
things like this have been happening occasionally (okay, often), where he completely overreacts and gets angry like youd imagine a little kid reacting when they are throwing a tantrum.	0
today this is what he did.	0
he was feeling okay this morning so decided to take on cleaning his fish tank (with my help).	0
while we were doing this, i was placing the tank back on the stand when our new puppy stole something and runs away with it.	0
he has a history of eating foreign objects and getting sick from it so i ask him to try to get it from him.	0
he ignores me thinking its no big deal so after i set the tank down i try to go get the object out of his mouth.	0
he runs away and i yell to my husband for some help.	0
again he doesnt come.	0
dog swallows mysterious hard object.	0
i yell to my husband he just swallowed it!	0
he finally comes in and grasp the dog (scaring him) and tries to make him throw up by putting his fingers in the back of his throat.	0
i tell him not to because it could hurt him coming back up.	0
so my husband got pissed and starts yelling dont ask me for fucking help then!	0
and he yalls at me to get out of his way and slams our gate multiple times before just completely knocking it over on purpose.	0
at this point he scared both the dogs, cussed at me multiple times, and stormed into another room.	0
yeah that was a few hours ago and he still has net talked to me or apologized.	0
im gonna go crazy because how am i supposed to react to this?	0
i know his head and back hurts but god damn.	0
for all i do for him, this is what i get.	0
sorry if this post doesnt belong here, i just needed to rant a little with possibly some people who know what its like.	0

my mum is in the end stages of ovarian cancer.	0
maybe months.	0
shes still with it, able to do things on her own but shes in a palliative care for now.	0
its an amazing place, i feel good knowing shes being taken care of.	0
i quit my job to spend more time with her.	0
i live an hour away and have a child so its hard to see her much.	0
but i just asked my old work place ( another place, hated my latest one) for casual work and they accepted right away.	0
i technically could be a sahm with my husbands support but i also want to make my own money to be able to provide for my child.	0
they know about my mum and that it wont be for long and that im not available all the time.	0
i just want to know if anyone else still works ?	0
how do you start the conversation of discussing expectations and when/whether or not youll have to eventually put your loved one in a home?	0
my grandmother is nearly 85. she lives with my husband and i. she has parkinsons.	0
we are solely responsible for her care.	0
we have a 3.5 year old girl and a baby boy on the way.	0
she forgets her walker, she makes questionable decisions (she will attempt to walk across the floor with her pants around her ankles if shes had an accident, without her walker, despite being a fall risk), she refuses to ask for help with the biggest things and often refuses to do the smallest things by herself.	0
the other night, she had another fall.	0
and i knew without any doubt that if she had suffered another break, for any limb or any type that required assistance or surgery, shed have to go to a home.	0
because im 9 months pregnant.	0
my kids have to come first.	0
before you ask... there is no other family.	0
her son, my uncle, is in california.	0
my dad is dead.	0
my cousin lives in florida and cares for her own mother (my grandmothers sister) and the mothers husband.	0
i know this conversation needs to happen.	0
but i also dont want it to seem like we are just throwing her to the curb, especially since from the beginning, she has split home repairs with us and paid rent monthly.	0
we had a roommate until you need more agreement... but we never expected the decline that shes had in just less than a year.	0
my mother came home from rehab on friday.	0
since then nothing happens unless i tell her.	0
ex.	0
let's go potty now.	0
can you move to the table?	0
it's time to go pot your plants.	0
let's go potty again.	0
i put your food on the table.	0
go ahead and eat it before it gets cold.	0
here's you meds.	0
take them.	0
drink the shake i put in front of you 5 mins ago.	0
remember you should be thinking about where you want to read or call your sister.	0
she is fully competent.	0
has no mental deficits.	0
i feel so much pressure&stress in having to keep the flow of caregiving and control her every move & thought.	0
i literally control everything that happens in our household.	0
mom, the dog & me.	0
does anyone have the same problem or suggestions?	0
thanks for peoples kind words and encouragement.	0

my great grandma passed this morning.	0
she had a lot of health problems and we were already expecting it to happen within the next week or so.	0
she was struggling extremely the past two weeks, not eating or drinking and having a really hard time breathing.	0
my mom has been her primary caretaker for the past 5 years now.	0
she was named after her and promised never to put her in a home and she succeeded.	0
i took care of her sometimes, and today hit me really hard.	0
i know shes at peace now and not suffering, so that helps.	0
feeling her cold hand and watching her body get wheeled out was devastating.	0
im not a very emotional person and neither is my father, but we both cried pretty hard.	0
theres a lot of family here who have been taking it even harder than us.	0
however, my mom has not cried.	0
shes teared up but no crying at all.	0
i know its because shes taking care of the memorial and such, but im very worried about her.	0
my (great)grandma has been a huge part of her life since she was a kid and especially since she started taking care of her.	0
i guess my question is how can i comfort my mom when the death finally hits her.	0
she hasnt fully processed it yet but i know shes going to break down when she does, so if anyone has any tips as to how i can ease her pain that would be greatly appreciated.	0
(tldr my great grandma passed.	0
mom has been her caretaker for past 5 years.	0
the death has not fully hit her yet.	0
how can i comfort her when it does?)	0
i just wanted to post here and ask if anyone had tips or tricks that might help.	0
my grandmother (in her mid-80s) was just recently diagnosed with dementia.	0
as a result of this, this week we moved her (largely at her request) from her home to my mother's, several states away.	0
my mother is planning on getting her into an apartment at a new independent living facility, but since it isn't ready, she's spending the next few months living at my parents' house.	0
we were careful to sort out things she wanted or needed for her own room here (the rest is in storage) to make her happy and make sure she has her own space.	0
i've spoken with a few other family members who have been around her in the past few years - they say they've noticed her being increasing confused, forgetful, etc.	0
that makes sense, given the diagnosis.	0
however, i don't think we (myself, my mother, my husband, and my sister) were fully prepared for how bad it had gotten.	0
we're basically explaining things (patiently, of course) over and over again and repeating ourselves as needed.	0
i guess what i'm really wondering: (1) is the repetition and explanation the right way to go?	0
(2) does anyone have any tips that would help her in general and to help get settled in a new a home?	0
(3) any general advice for her caregivers about keeping calm and caring for themselves too (at the moment, my husband, my sister, my mom, and myself, but soon to be just my mom)?	0
one day, this isnt going to be my life.	0
one day, i wont have to wake up at the crack of dawn every single day to fry an egg or make some oatmeal.	0
i wont have to drag you out of bed and sit you at the table just to hear you complain about the food i can barely afford.	0
i wont have to force some medicines into your system anymore and remind you to stop scratching and picking at your legs.	0
one day, i wont have to worry about the next trip to the drugstore that burns a hole in my barely existent savings account.	0
i wont have to look around for coins just to be able to feed myself because your needs come first they always do.	0
i wont have to lie to people and say im doing intermittent fasting to mask the fact that im starving.	0
one day, ill wake up not have to worry if youre breathing, if youve fallen, if your needs are met.	0
ill wake up and not have to repeat the same old conversations weve had for the past five years ive gotten tired of responding.	0
ill wake up and actually feel alive again.	0
one day, when i wake up, you might be gone.	0
when i wake up, you might be gone and ill have nowhere to go and nothing to live for.	0
when i wake up, you might be gone and ill have nowhere to go and nothing to live for and ill always ask if this was worth it because right now it feels like my future and my purpose was stolen from me by a decaying body still clinging on to life.	0
one day, i tell myself, i can hope again.	0
one day, i convince myself, i can start all over again.	0
one day, i promise myself, i can live for myself again.	0
one day, this will all be over.	0
one day, this will all come to an end.	0
one day, i have to hope for that one day.	0
hi, new here.	0
thanks for the community.	0
my mil has progressive blindness and was living alone.	0
she asked to move in with my husband and i. to do this, she needed to sell her house and we sold ours so we could get something bigger.	0
although we hadnt planned on moving, we agreed that it was best for her and the family.	0
now, shes getting angry and resentful.	0
she changed the narrative and is saying that we asked her to buy us a house which was the biggest mistake of [her] life.	0
our home is sold, hers is sold, we cant reverse the sales.	0
we are also seeing that her day to day language and behavior is abusive/gas lighting towards us.	0
for example, ive been cooking every night but last night i said i didnt feel like cooking and wanted to order out.	0
she started accusing me of not feeding her and basically was calling me lazy and wasteful.	0
i just dont know what to do at this point.	0
my gran came back from hospital, shes 93 and is now on oxygen 24/7.	0
she needs help walking to the bathroom and back, and we have nurses who wash her and change her adult pads.	0
the rest of the care comes down to me and my older sister, my mum has depression and doing anything for my gran sets her off in a depressive spiral and my dads doing his best but hes also not well.	0
my gran is mobile, but shes bed bound herself.	0
if shes not going to the bathroom, she wont get out of bed.	0
she asks to be hand fed, unless you do it wrong then she takes it from you and feeds herself.	0
but even that i dont mind, however she calls out my name every 15 minutes, and usually its for nothing, she doesnt need anything anything and will just want me to sit there, or hand her a glass of water right next to her.	0
as a care giver, are we meant to cater to every whim, be on call for whatever task they need doing all the time even if its nothing.	0
or do we still have to set boundaries?	0
and if boundaries need to be set how do you offset the guilt you feel as you hear an elderly lady shouting your name and not going to them?	0
thank you for any advice you may have.	0
i'll start with the basic details i (33m) have been married to my wife (38f) for 10 years.	0
8 years ago she developed rheumatoid arthritis and i have had to help her move around as well as the housework.	0
i also work evenings four days a week to pay the bills, though she did just get ssi but that only helps a little.	0
because of all the work i have to do i feel exhausted all the time.	0
it feels like i can't do anything for myself since she constantly needs me to do things for her.	0
i feel like that if i left, i could finally have my life back, but i feel guilty because she needs help with so many things.	0
so what should i do?	0
should i leave her and help her get a regular caregiver?	0
or should i stay and hope things get better?	0
hi.	0
longtime redditor, off and on for years.	0
for the past 3 years, my sister and i have been the primary care givers for our father with alzheimer's.	0
he is progressing quickly.	0
i'm at the edge of complete burn out, my sister is burnt but won't admit it.	0
i am looking for ways to find a moment of peace for both of us.	0
looking for your advice and techniques.	0
i love my father very much, i'm just exhausted.	0
my (28m) wife (26f) cant work even a part time job without skipping at least two shifts per week.	0
(+ other things) my(28m) wife (26f) cannot bring herself to work even a part time job without taking every other shift off and leaving early on almost all of the others (+other things).	0
i have no clue where to start about this.	0
i could honestly put this in r/caregiversupport as well but i'm just not sure.	0
let me preface my post really quick with some information: my wife and i were married 3 years ago on may 5th 2018.  she has bipolar disorder as well as ptsd from watching her mother decline in health and finally pass away from metastasized breast cancer early 2017.  i knew all of this proceeding with marrying her.	0
now, i have an anxiety disorder myself and for quite some time have been dealing with a great deal of existential depression.	0
as dumb as that might sound to some, it's really done a number on me emotionally.	0
now, when we were married, my wife was just about to graduate college while i was slightly behind her due to having spent two years abroad as a missionary for the mormon church (we have since left the mormon church).	0
long story short, my wife graduated, worked full time for 2 months in the summer at an entry level job in her field, said she didn't like it, promptly quit and proceeded to take a part time job at a call center that pays less hourly than i am without a degree.	0
this was mid 2019 by the way.	0
all this time my goal was simply to be supportive of her.	0
i know she struggles and i simply wanted to make sure she knew she had my support.	0
i figured she would soon enough be back to a different full time job in her field.	0
our plan had been for my wife to graduate school, begin working full time so i could switch to part time work while finishing up school and move back to full time once i graduated.	0
once my wife started working part time, however,  college kind of got put on the back burner for me and i ended up taking a break and taking one or two classes at a time because honestly working full time while going to school full time is something i simply cannot do.	0
i've tried it and it did not turn out well.	0
anyway, back to the story.	0
time went on and things got more weird.	0
i could be wrong about this, but i am convinced that my wife became or already was a hypochondriac.	0
this first started to become clear to me when for her birthday in 2019 we went to an olive garden to use a gift card.	0
while we sat waiting for our food, i shit you not, one of the small floodlights above us popped and the lining of the light fell on her head.	0
of course we received the meal for free, but my wife began to complain of concussion symptoms.	0
then followed a string of expensive doctor appointments as well as a couple of mris for her.	0
keep in mind this was just a month or so after she quit her full time job for her part time job.	0
we ended up with a personal injury attorney and they started working on my wife's case to simply get the medical bills paid for.	0
i come to find out that the lining she was hit in the head with was no more than a couple of ounces in weight, something that had occurred to me at the time of the event but that i had ignored because i wanted to simply support my wife.	0
the case didn't end up ever going anywhere.	0
my wife eventually just stopped following up on the things she had to do for it despite me urging her to do so.	0
luckily the attorney takes their charges if and only if the case is resolved and there is a settlement, but we still had to pay the medical bills.	0
at this point, my wife had begun taking off practically every other shift and leaving early on most every other day (it's not too busy of a call center so they usually offer for people to go home early) citing nausea, aches, and pains as the reason why she couldn't go to work.	0
as time went on she started having more medical issues (examples being: appendicitis pain, blood clot pains, lung pains, what she thought was a broken rib from sneezing, etc, etc).	0
because of this a string of ultrasounds, x rays, urgent care visits, and even er visits happened.	0
none, i repeat, none of these ended up having any real underlying issue and we were always sent home with a large medical bill without any actual health issue to cite for it.	0
with each occurrence i have become more and more frustrated about this whole situation, though i suggest we take her to the doctor whenever she feels like she needs to go.	0
i'm not just going to let her die if she really has something wrong.	0
i was then hit with my own health issues aside from my mental health.	0
i began having rapid heart movement episodes and had to go get an echocardiogram and some other checkups.	0
as it turns out i have two congenital heart conditions: wolffe parkinson white syndrome and bicuspid aortic valve.	0
when we got married i was on my parent's insurance and she was on her dad's and step mother's.	0
by the time i found out about these heart conditions in summer of 2020 we were both on my insurance from my job and have no hope in the world of affording any kind of operation for either heart defect as our deductible being met is a laughable thought.	0
i could really use an operation for the wpws and it is relatively non invasive and has a very very high success rate, but that is just not going to happen anytime in the foreseeable future.	0
to this day nothing has changed.	0
"it's been a very long time since my wife's ""concussion"" incident, and a very long time since my wife started working part time."	0
i've discussed these things and how i feel like i'm the only one really supporting us financially with her gently many times and she always gets super depressed and extremely self critical afterwards.	0
"she'll then find shift swaps to get extra hours to ""make up"" for it."	0
"the problem is then as soon as she has some extra hours planned for later in the week she will take another day off and say ""it's okay because i have extra hours on the 15th"" or whatever."	0
"i've tried reminding her that this does not give her ""more hours"" and that it just ends up shifting her schedule around."	0
she always says she knows this and promises that she'll get even more hours.	0
spoiler: she doesn't.	0
she'll do some extra cleaning around our apartment, again acting like it solves the issue.	0
i don't know how to be appreciative of this but at the same time let her know that what i really need right now is her help with the income, not dishes, so that we can stop living paycheck to paycheck, draining my account to pay rent every month, and using half of my other paycheck to pay the rest of our bills.	0
i mean, what's the point of being essentially a stay at home mom when you don't have kids and never plan on having kids?	0
i don't need a stay at home wife that solely i provide for, i need a wife that will help us mutually get to a better place financially.	0
i can clean things up after work in less than half an hour.	0
not to mention, i feel like if she can be up and cleaning and making all this food like she does to make up for not working, she would much more easily be able to go sit at a desk and take customer service calls for 4 hours.	0
i have the same job for eight hours a day in a second language.	0
i don't know how much longer i can do this alone for.	0
i am a patient, introverted, and very quiet fellow.	0
i just want to be supportive and i want there to be peace.	0
that's all i have ever wanted, but this situation i find myself in is changing me into someone completely different and fast.	0
i can't live like this.	0
i feel like a caregiver instead of a husband.	0
as time goes by i am also less and less attracted to my wife sexually because i feel like i'm just supporting us by myself and i'm beginning to see her as immature and selfish and i can't help but feel a bit resentful.	0
"i know we promised ""through sickness and health"" but jeez, this feels like torture for me emotionally and mentally."	0
my wife has a tendency of s ideation and has attempted it in the past and honestly if i even mentioned divorce ever i am worried she might do something drastic.	0
i've noticed is that she's very dependent on me emotionally as well.	0
she doesn't like it when she has to be alone in a room of our small apartment without me, for example.	0
seeing this mental state of hers over these past three years really makes me worried in that sense, but i'm not sure if i can keep doing this.	0
even if i did bring up the topic of splitting up, the problem is that i do not have hardly any family or friends at this point aside from her.	0
the main reason for which being that i recently left the mormon church and all of my friends and family are mormon.	0
my parents have cut me off and want nothing do do with me, unfortunately, and my extended family are all on the same page with them.	0
i've no clue who i would ask for advice from or what i would do.	0
i'll probably post this to am i the asshole as well because i genuinely feel so guilty for feeling the way i do.	0
i feel like maybe i should simply continue to support her by getting a second job and working 60 hrs a week instead of 40.  all in all, i just feel stuck and would love some advice.	0
if you have any advice, how would you suggest i proceed?	0
i am currently aware of the divorce rates when bipolar is a factor.	0
should i continue to attempt fixing the situation?	0
thank you in advance!	0
i'm a disabled young adult (21) and it's been getting worse and i'm much less independent than i used to be.	0
this means my mom has had to be my caregiver and it takes up a lot of time and i can't be alone for too long and all that.	0
and i want her to be able to do things but also like i need someone around basically constantly?	0
is there like a program for helping out caregivers that don't have help i know she's getting frustrated (i am too i don't like being like this) but i can't alleviate my needs so how do i help her?	0
i am the primary caregiver of an 83 year old female who appears to have abandoned all semblance of respect for family members and household helpmates.	0
she regularly mocks the household nanny, treats children in the household in a vindictive and rude manner, and wants to do nothing the whole day.	0
all she enjoys doing is cooking, and simply doesnt have a daily routine.	0
she wakes up, washes and dresses and essentially lays idle for the whole day.	0
moreover, she does not want to engage in stimulating activities.	0
i recently purchased her a box of trinkets: puzzles, knitting equipment, books, board games and painting items.	0
she has used nothing i bought her and instead prefers to watch television and, dare i repeat it, be on the dole for the whole day.	0
her table manners have slowly receded into nothingness, she blurts out things all the times, shouts randomly.	0
please advise on ways to help her.	0
happened to stumble across this subreddit today.	0
im 30 years old and i have been living with and taking care of my 82 year old grandmother who has copd and is pretty far along into her dementia for 28 months and counting.	0
half the time she knows who i am, but she always thinks there are other people in the house.	0
this lady is the most impatient and flat out mean person i have ever met.	0
shes constantly mad about her situation and takes it out on me.	0
she accuses me of stealing, moving things from their usual spot so they get misplaced, hiding other people upstairs.	0
her tone and instant condemnation has worn me down so much that i had to get back on my anti-depressants.	0
unfortunately, my uncle who controls her finances only pays me $50/week for being her and being her mental abuse punching bag.	0
i dont have another job so im here all the time and i find it extremely difficult to not find some temporary relief in drinking with the little amount of money im given.	0
the other day she was arguing with me and got upset that i stood my ground and tried to get her to understand my perspective and she took the knife she was using to cut up a cabbage and pointed it at me while shaking it and coming at me.	0
im fed up with how little im being paid to deal with the most stressful situation i have ever had to endure in my life.	0
my father and i promised my grandfather that we wouldnt out her in a home, but i dont think he ever imagined her getting this bad.	0
sorry for the wall of text, but just needed to vent.	0
im trying to figure out if i can get paid by her medicaid for taking care of her or something.	0
if not, im probably gonna just end up moving out and away from this situation and never look back.	0
how do you all deal with getting the pervasive urine smell out of sheets, clothes, and reusable pads.	0
it seems like nothing works.	0
tried vinegar, dreft, woolite.	0
i don't know if something heavily scented would be good for sensitive skin/noses.	0
thanks in advance	0
i'm currently  under shelter in place order with my 82 year old grandmother who has mild dementia/cognitive issues and very poor hearing.	0
everyday i answer the same questions  over and over again.	0
as if days didn't blend together enough.	0
i'm going crazy!	0
i can't take this anymore.	0
on top of everything my mother herself is making me cry several times each day.	0
she says the most hurtful shit and i just can't take this anymore.	0
i don't understand why i'm always hated everywhere.	0
even by my own mother.	0
the one i love more than anything and anyone and am working so hard to help recover quickly day and night.	0
it's over.	0
everything.	0
i can't live anymore.	0
i'll go soon.	0
tl;dr: my family is at a loss of how best to help my dad as a caretaker of our mom who has ms. she doesn't want my dad to be a full-time caretaker, and it's hard to get her to communicate what she *does* want.	0
we want her to have agency in her life plans but i don't think any of us know what the best options are or even where to start looking.	0
help?	0
okay, the details, sorry in advance for the disjointedness of it all: my mom was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in the mid-90s and my parents have stayed together through it all.	0
they're now in their 60s, and over the last 5-10 years my sisters and i (all grown and in different states) have noticed their marriage falling apart as my mom's cognitive/physical abilities have deteriorated.	0
this last year in covid land definitely hasn't done them any favors.	0
my mom is a very determined and rugged individualist type woman, and would prefer to do everything herself.	0
and she did, until about 5 years ago when she decided she couldn't safely do it all anymore.	0
she's full-time wheelchair now, but still manages to bathe herself a few times a week.	0
my dad handles all the cooking, cleaning, errands, and general support for my mom, on top of still working full-time (and he plans to keep working for another 5 years).	0
it's a lot for him, but he manages and prides himself on not complaining about that.	0
he has said he'd be her full-time caretaker but she has said from the beginning that she doesn't want that from him.	0
as my mom's neurologic abilities have gone down, it's been hard on my dad.	0
she's easily angered and upset, cries every day, and is miserable.	0
"she's gotten more negative and says ""no"" to a lot of advice from her doctors and neurologists, basically ""i know better than they do"" -- she was like this even before her ms diagnosis, now it's just a bigger part of her personality."	0
i know a lot of it is just pain management.	0
pot's her go-to, the only thing that makes her less miserable without terrible side effects, and she'd been growing for herself, but it's illegal in their state and taking care of the plants is getting to be too much for her.	0
my dad doesn't know how to handle all her emotions and so he mostly ignores them at this point, which i'm sure only makes things worse.	0
"in the last few months, it's been especially bad, culminating in my mom saying she wants to separate/divorce and move several states away to get ""better care"" but not being able to tell us what she means by that (besides getting legal weed) or what that looks like."	0
they've kept most of their turmoil hidden from me and my sisters, but it's all been coming out and it's a mess.	0
i've recommended therapy for them (both together and individually) for going on 15 years -- my mom has done some, but my dad had a bad therapist match and hasn't gone back.	0
after the whole divorce situation, i convinced my dad to join my mom for a therapy appointment she had set up for them, but she didn't let him join the meeting, saying she wanted to vet the therapist by herself first.	0
she canceled all further meetings and now doesn't seem interested in couples counseling with my dad.	0
my dad is anxious about being honest to a therapist about his experience, not wanting to upset my mom.	0
he's started telling me things recently, and i'm glad he's telling someone, but i have no idea how to help him, and he asks me to not tell my sisters about it.	0
i hate that he feels so isolated and afraid to seek help for himself.	0
my dad wants to support my mom and make her happy, but it's becoming more and more clear that she maybe doesn't know what she wants and maybe doesn't know what options are available to her.	0
we don't want to make decisions without her -- we very much want to figure out what will work best for her and make her happy and comfortable.	0
we don't want to just throw her in a care facility, you know?	0
sigh.	0
we just don't know who to talk to about options or planning, because it feels like if we don't start planning soon, we won't get to have much meaningful input from my mom.	0
any advice fully welcome, but mainly: 1) are there specialists to talk to about making these plans as a family?	0
how should i search for them/what are they called?	0
2) what kind of help/support can i seek out for my dad?	0
can i go to a session with him or?	0
?	0
what is the best way to help the patient use the portable urinal?	0
he was lying on his back i held his penis in the urinal but the urine squirted all over then overflowed out of the container any advice on technique?	0
anyone else deal with mother-in-laws who believe their sons can do no wrong?	0
i already have a massive language and cultural barriers with my mother in law.	0
i was trying to explain that my husband is a doctor was explaining that chronic pain is a family disease.	0
the doctor saying this was an incredible affirmation.	0
when i was telling my mother in law, to just explain where im at emotionally she started to get upset saying her son is a hero for going to work every day.	0
i get it, were blessed that hes able to do that at this time.	0
hopefully hell heal completely.	0
but it just feels so minimizing for all we go through to hear well he goes to work everyday or in sickness and in health.	0
what about the mornings, what about the explosions after a two hour family outing?	0
what about the depression, the anger, the rage.	0
what about the obsession or ocd with issues where he fixated on it for months.	0
what about all the bill shit.	0
all the lack of time and support during my daughter being in the hospital, when i had a miscarriage, when im sick.	0
wtf about when im sick?	0
what about my sickness and health.	0
im learning who i can go to for support and who i cant.	0
hi,  i finally joined reddit for this group.	0
i feel super alone and just reading some of the stories felt like an and acknowledgment of everything ive been going through for the last year.	0
since last july i have been quaranting with my 81 yo father whos had two tias and some cognitive impairment.	0
one of the tias was during the pandemic.	0
he has mostly recovered but has way more lingering cognitive issues this time that pop up at random times.	0
i was thrown in to caregiving without even having a name to express what i was doing until my skip level boss named it as he was expressing sympathy for my situation.	0
i work a very demanding high profile job and i am super ambitious but all that feels like it is on hold even though i keep grinding forward.	0
it feels like i should be pulling back but i cant.	0
and i dont want to.	0
i worked hard to get where i am and my dad gave me incredible privilege through his own sacrifice.	0
i have been seeing a therapist weekly for over a year and that helps.	0
my dad was not perfect but he was a rock for my family.	0
he would do almost any act of service for me up until his first mini stroke in 2018.  he regained almost all function but then the pandemic.	0
he is a big part of the reason i have my high paying cool job that i love.	0
weve taken many road trips together and we could sit and have breakfast and remark on what we were each reading in the paper.	0
i have a lot of wonderful memories of us having brunch he cooked for us.	0
he has always been a mild mannered guy.	0
so it really breaks my heart when he is cruel to me bc of his cognitive impairment.	0
its so hard to remember he doesnt really mean those horrible things.	0
but hes like 70% there cognitively so it comes out of left field.	0
he has always loved to debate especially politics but now he becomes fixated on it.	0
we share 99% of the same views.	0
you would never know listening to us.	0
i had to train myself to stop engaging substantively so much and just agree with him.	0
that kills me because my dad is one of the smartest people i have ever met.	0
after zero help from immediate family despite arguments and pleas i finally sought out services.	0
looking to hire a home health aide for 6-8 hours a week.	0
get dad in to some rehab.	0
feels hopeful.	0
my dad is going to stay with family for a few months on the other side of the country.	0
i am excited and worried sick.	0
they wont care for him the same.	0
they lose patience with him more easily.	0
there are positives for him but i still worry.	0
i also still lose patience with him and feel horrible.	0
i guess there is no real point to this but i figured if somebody on here reads it at least it may resonate.	0
i am burnt out but trying to turn things around.	0
taking steps for both me and my dad so that when he comes back in the fall we have more support.	0
thanks for reading and sort this is sorry so long.	0
my grandmother has parkinsons and lives with me.	0
shes nearly 85. im nine months pregnant.	0
so today, i had a final growth scan... any day down for our new little baby.	0
couldnt wait to get home and tell granny.	0
we have gotten so much rain; our porch flooded.	0
apparently a frog got in.	0
the frog jumped at my grandmother when she got up to pee.	0
scared her, then she fell.	0
im supposed to be on bed rest... so hubby helps her get up.	0
shes now in an er getting checked out, hubby is with her, three year old is awake, and im trying to keep my legs crossed so baby does just slide out to check out the drama.	0
i keep asking myself if this last year and a half is what caused me to burn out or if living as a single caregiver for my mom made it just something that was going to happen & lock down had nothing to do with it?	0
do you all feel like the pandemic made it easier to be a caregiver or harder?	0
part of me liked the fact many docs moved to phone appointments & my mom who smoked for 65 years (thru colon cancer, copd, emphysema, lung nodules & a thoracic aneurism) was finally forced to quit smoking... which is good because shes now on oxygen & i know she would have blown us both up.	0
i just wonder if the lockdown made it worse because i was basically stuck here constantly & was not able to take normal vacations (time away with mom) or do lunch out with friends and my mom couldnt go out to her normal visits, civic groups or church- which meant we were stuck with each other.	0
i didnt do a couple of surgeries (hands& feet) because it was a perfect time to put off going to hospital (which did have lots of covid issues here in ca) i put off physical therapy- it too is located in  a wing of the local hospital.	0
also failed to go to dermatologist appointments, but had skin cancer procedures this past month.	0
part of me thinks maybe i kicked the can a little to long with my own health, just trying to keep my vulnerable & elderly mother safe.	0
i have gained a ton of weight i now have to try to lose but no longer have the energy to get out of my own way.	0
i also wonder if this lockdown made me crazy or if i was crazy all along?	0
can being burned out make you bat shit crazy- gosh i hope its a temporary symptom of a passing problem because i dont want to be this short fused, mush brained blithering idiot who just keeps wandering around the house forgetting why the heck i came into this room forever... i fear pretty soon i will be the one forgetting im cooking on the stove or leave the bath tub running for hours for no reason.	0
its bad enough to come home from the grocery store to have the backdoor wide open with the central ac running at full blast, cooling the great outdoors because mom was checking to see i might be hiding out back but forgot to shut the door, put clothes back on after having a bathroom accident & choosing to sleep naked/in a towel, on the couch until i return to help her with the awful mess she made while i was gone what	0
my dad was diagnosed with colon cancer in nov or 2020. we moved him in with us for the duration of treatment.	0
he had surgery to remove the tumor and then chemo to kill anything still swimming around his body.	0
we are on #8 of 12 infusions and it hits him harder everytime...and he is just a trouper.	0
but dang it if it isn't hard to see him go through it.	0
he is now experiencing fever and chills for the last two treatments.	0
it lasts about 24 hours.	0
so cold washcloths seem to help but this crap is just horrible to watch.	0
"the following started in response to what i felt was a shaming rely to a hurting person disguised as a ""harsh truth""."	0
this turned out to be my story, which i don't often tell because of the harsh truth shamers out there.	0
i have been afraid for too long.	0
when this came out like this, i decided that leaving it buried in the comments was not good enough so i am bringing it here... when is it ok to say enough?	0
"it is not always best to stay with our sweethearts ""in sickness""."	0
"we need to temper our words with compassion and the understanding that it is never easy to leave, let alone ""leave in sickness""."	0
and certainly not because the caregiver has some moral failing or loyalty defect.	0
who are we to make such sweeping, blanket judgements of someone else's life and situation??	0
sometimes, a person is sick to the point of toxicity which includes manipulation, guilting, isolating, sabotage etc.	0
all of which are abusive.	0
caregivers, spouses, significant others hear me now... abuse is never ok. how do i know all this?	0
glad you asked.	0
i have been married 27 years, more than half of that as a caregiver.	0
we have two kids who have just reached adulthood.	0
neither remembers their dad as healthy or happy or caring.	0
not really.	0
my hubs had a stroke and head injuries.	0
these assaults happened on top of trauma brain due to serious childhood abuse.	0
i do not blame my hubs for what happened to him or the medical assaults that destroyed him.	0
suffice to say, the stroke and brain damage left no physical scars.	0
only mental.	0
he is now extremely narcissistic, angry, self absorbed and completely clueless about how his behavior affects his family.	0
not the man i married.	0
but i stayed.	0
i stayed through rages and manipulation and isolation.	0
because i made a commitment.	0
i love(d) him, of course, but i was desperately miserable.	0
i found out he hurt our 12 yo son and still did not leave because i thought i could mitigate by never leaving the kids alone with him.	0
i thought maybe he would get better.	0
i wanted to give him that chance.	0
i wanted my family back.	0
he eventually turned some of that rage on me in a physical way and i realized i had to leave with my kids.	0
i had this magical thinking that he would never hurt me and as long as i was around to shield the kids, we could stay together.	0
that was shattered.	0
i finally realized i could not keep all of us safe by staying.	0
we left.	0
i moved him into a separate place nearby and the kids and i moved home.	0
i worked three jobs to make it work.	0
he actually got a bit better.	0
there were fewer rages.	0
i moved him into an independent living situation because he was given meals there and basic housekeeping.	0
he got even better once we got all the sodium out of his diet and his blood pressure came down.	0
i spent nights with him.	0
at times it felt normal.	0
except when he raged.	0
and even when he didn't, i slept with one eye open.	0
i could never relax.	0
it has been three years since i moved the kids out.	0
four since i started therapy for me.	0
and just over six months since i told him i no longer want to be his wife.	0
it was not easy.	0
it has been fraught with indecision and difficulty in defining myself, my needs.	0
i have worked my ass off in therapy.	0
i have made mistakes.	0
one thing is certain though, i do not regret making the decision to move on.	0
"i still help him, i still provide for him but i do not need to live abused because i said ""until death us do part""."	0
i am seeing someone very special.	0
we are truly partners and i feel so loved and respected.	0
that relationship gives me the positive energy i need to continue to assist and nurture my hubs while not getting sucked into the manipulation and abuse cycle again.	0
i say again, abuse is never ok. and judgement is only welcome ... wait, no it isn't.	0
this is not a courtroom.	0
this is my life!	0
"judgement and belittlement of my situation and my lived experience based on ""your"" beliefs is not welcome."	0
however,  i would love to hear your story and we can talk about how we got where we are and we can cry together and celebrate the victories and shake our fist at the universe for the unfairness of it all.	0
"mostly though, we can love one another through our pain without judgment and harsh words and shaming disguised as ""truth telling""."	0
my husband has flair ups, takes medication daily, uses electronic stimulation on his back daily.	0
he needs massages often.	0
while he walks, goes to work for 8 hours and in his mind is functioning just fine.	0
for myself personally, lack of travel, lack of ability to enjoy out time for an afternoon out.	0
he has about a 2-4 hour max before he explodes, needs to medicate, and has to rest for down time of about an hour.	0
i know im not in the worst situation.	0
he could be completely immobile.	0
he could be bed ridden day in and day out (who knows, that might be our future).	0
to say the lease things have impacted me very deeply on the emotional end.	0
my background is complicated.	0
but honestly growing up i had a lot of trauma.	0
grew up as a runway in my youth, became homeless as a young adult, was in an abusive relationship and then escaped.	0
i had a daughter, got my life straight and was trying to learn how to be the best mother i could be.	0
i never wanted to have children nor be married.	0
my personality is neurotic and selfish in nature so the idea of nurturing others was never a largely interesting concept to me.	0
so, i had my daughter by getting pregnant in a terrible way.	0
then a year later became religious, was dating a good man and decided marriage would be the next step.	0
a year later my husband was in a devastating car accident.	0
its been a long road of surgery, law suit, doctors appointment, medications and breaking points.	0
i had no idea how depressed i was in all this.	0
now i have two children and feel completely trapped in a life that everyday feels like misery.	0
im a journalist and would think to myself what if my life was different.	0
these thoughts led me to falling for someone who had a similar career as myself.	0
i sought council and then told my husband.	0
after telling my husband, we have never been so close to divorce.	0
he feels like i cheater on him for having room in my heart for someone else.	0
mind you i never expressed my feelings.	0
they were just thoughts in my head about what if i wasnt with someone in chronic pain, how would my life be different.	0
i know what i did was wrong to allow my heart to be in a place of weakness and allowing my family to be vulnerable to a potentially dangerous situation.	0
what if i acted on my thoughts, it would have been devastating for my family.	0
i want to be the best mother i can.	0
i want to be the best wife that i can.	0
when my husband has flare ups i spiral into depression.	0
if i talk to him about how his pain effects me he says its abusive because im bringing up something he cant control.	0
my marriage is falling apart and i cant remember the last time i was happy for more than a week.	0
i have no idea what to do.	0
ive cut off all relationships with men seeing that my heart is in a very weak place and i dont want to have thoughts about what if my life was different.	0
does anyone else understand what im going through?	0
am i just a shitty human that needs to suck it up and just ignore my emotions?	0
help needed.	0
my husband has flair ups, takes medication daily, uses electronic stimulation on his back daily.	0
he needs massages often.	0
while he walks, goes to work for 8 hours and in his mind is functioning just fine.	0
for myself personally, lack of travel, lack of ability to enjoy out time for an afternoon out.	0
he has about a 2-4 hour max before he explodes, needs to medicate, and has to rest for down time of about an hour.	0
i know im not in the worst situation.	0
he could be completely immobile.	0
he could be bed ridden day in and day out (who knows, that might be our future).	0
to say the lease things have impacted me very deeply on the emotional end.	0
my background is complicated.	0
but honestly growing up i had a lot of trauma.	0
grew up as a runway in my youth, became homeless as a young adult, was in an abusive relationship and then escaped.	0
i had a daughter, got my life straight and was trying to learn how to be the best mother i could be.	0
i never wanted to have children nor be married.	0
my personality is neurotic and selfish in nature so the idea of nurturing others was never a largely interesting concept to me.	0
so, i had my daughter by getting pregnant in a terrible way.	0
then a year later became religious, was dating a good man and decided marriage would be the next step.	0
a year later my husband was in a devastating car accident.	0
its been a long road of surgery, law suit, doctors appointment, medications and breaking points.	0
i had no idea how depressed i was in all this.	0
now i have two children and feel completely trapped in a life that everyday feels like misery.	0
im a journalist and would think to myself what if my life was different.	0
these thoughts led me to falling for someone who had a similar career as myself.	0
i sought council and then told my husband.	0
after telling my husband, we have never been so close to divorce.	0
he feels like i cheater on him for having room in my heart for someone else.	0
mind you i never expressed my feelings.	0
they were just thoughts in my head about what if i wasnt with someone in chronic pain, how would my life be different.	0
i know what i did was wrong to allow my heart to be in a place of weakness and allowing my family to be vulnerable to a potentially dangerous situation.	0
what if i acted on my thoughts, it would have been devastating for my family.	0
i want to be the best mother i can.	0
i want to be the best wife that i can.	0
when my husband has flare ups i spiral into depression.	0
if i talk to him about how his pain effects me he says its abusive because im bringing up something he cant control.	0
my marriage is falling apart and i cant remember the last time i was happy for more than a week.	0
i have no idea what to do.	0
ive cut off all relationships with men seeing that my heart is in a very weak place and i dont want to have thoughts about what if my life was different.	0
does anyone else understand what im going through?	0
am i just a shitty human that needs to suck it up and just ignore my emotions?	0
help needed.	0
anyone have advice/resources for those who have to do frequent unassisted transferring?	0
it's the second time my spouse broke her leg this time around the transfers are harder then before.	0
i know my form is good (doctors seamed shocked, that after 10 years we have the whole act down to a science).	0
but after doing 5 transfers in 30 minutes in the am my neck shoulders feel bad.	0
a massage or the chiropractor will fix it but it buys me a day tops.	0
i am surprise surprise not in the best condition.	0
i once watched a dwayne johnson look-a-like lift her like a stuffed animal and immediately asked if he would be down for a 3s company type situation.	0
i'm sure i just need to beef those areas up.	0
looking for solutions that fit into the lifestyle of an exhausted overworked depressed person, i can google exercises but was hoping someone here had more tailored advice not just what to do but also how to stay on top of it.	0
is this possible?	0
my grandmother needs daily help.	0
i am currently a full time student who has been taking my classes online, so it has worked out.	0
however, i am getting a full-time job soon.	0
"my mom works a very stressful job, and would like to ""retire""."	0
she lives in the home with my grandmother, but is at work all the time.	0
my grandmother would like to pay her to just stay home with her, drive her places, etc.	0
gma does not qualify for medicaid, and can afford to pay mom a living wage.	0
mom already pays for healthcare through the aca.	0
could we use a platform like care.com, or should we set it up with a lawyer?	0
thank you in advance for any insights!	0
grandpa passed yesterday.	0
still trying to wrap my head around the fact.	0
i just wanted to thank this sub for getting me through a lot and suggesting different things for me to do.	0
the advice here was very helpful, especially for a young caregiver like me.	0
if you're new to here, know you're in good hands.	0
this sub is filled with kindness and good spirited people.	0
i'm wishing all of you luck.	0
thank you all.	0
weve been married for 8 years (34m, 34f) and have been through a lot.	0
infertility, abusive parents (his that we are no contact with now), we have a 2.5 year old and 10 month old (20 months apart).	0
i have started my own business and am trying to make that work.	0
he is working in a physically demanding job 50-60 hours a week.	0
he just got dx with a chronic condition that has him needing to change jobs.	0
so we are trying to transition him.	0
i havent had consistent income in 2-3 years with starting my own business, pandemic, kids, etc.	0
so financially we have been behind and cannot seem to catch up.	0
i am exhausted.	0
i am trying to give him space and support to figure this all out mentally now that we finally have the medical stuff on an active action plan.	0
hes depressed.	0
im overwhelmed and anxious.	0
so many demands.	0
not enough time.	0
im burned out.	0
i cannot focus.	0
we are both in counseling separately which is great.	0
im hitting a limit.	0
its like a balloon and every day a little more air gets blown in and it keeps stretching and sometimes some air gets lets out but not enough and its gonna pop soon.	0
i know this is fragmented and might be difficult to follow.	0
thats how it all is in my head right now.	0
a million things to do and no energy/time to do it.	0
i cannot get physically healthy myself (daycare crud).	0
i went to the er in february because i hyperventilated with a stomach bug.	0
i couldnt handle there being demands on me while i was physically unable to do anything and i panicked.	0
i still didnt get to rest because then everyone else got sick too.	0
i just dont know what to do.	0
i dont know how to survive.	0
the house is disgusting.	0
theres pet fur and clothes and dishes that always need picked up and washed etc.	0
no family around to help.	0
no money to hire help.	0
full disclosure the family in question is nice, means well and pales in comparison to the horror families i've read about here.	0
but they finally came after after 4 months of my work load increasing 10 fold because of an accident.	0
instead of helping as they used to do with dishes (i'd legit kill for dishwasher), trash maybe even a vacuum.	0
i was sent out for some belated mothers day flowers in the am, after being up for hours doing some light cleaning because the threat of in-laws is the only time i'll do most of these things.	0
it paints a better picture than there really is but whatever.	0
they show up, they need water, they need tea.	0
they used to pet sit for us, they know where that crap is the fact that they ask anything of me, pushes me to the edge every time.	0
i know its being a good host but shit i wait on their daughter 24/7 go get your own tea.	0
we order lunch i pass out everything, i fetch the silverware.	0
they basically sat on their ass making weird or antiquated comments for 3 hours and leave.	0
on the way out they apologize for not helping out at all.	0
which feels extremely empty.	0
they rolled in made more mess ate up more of my time and left.	0
the whole situation which isn't that bad in the scheme of things left me very resentful of her entire family which despite dealing with this disability for her entire life now seams blissfully ignorant of reality and totally happy to have me drive her to every damn excuse for a gathering.	0
where i sit patently waiting to leave to get back to the mountain of shit to do in the house.	0
they again seam ignorant that when they ask anything of her that is physical in nature its really me and i don't owe them anything, they should be thanking me for taking their daughter off their hands.	0
we are planning to move, the biggest overriding decision is proximity to her family but from my perspective i don't see it as an advantage.	0
i moved to the other end of the country for distance from my family, for mothers day i got an apology from my mother for ruining my life, which was awkward to have that convo in your late 30s, but i'll say that in adulthood they've at least been neutral neither a burden or help.	0
which is the relationship i'd rather have with her family to be honest.	0
be helpful or be nothing.	0
&#x200b; inter-family relationships was not something my family did, how do people deal with these situations?	0
"i never say anything in the moment because it be blunt and harsh like ""get your own damn tea"" and after i just drop it because confronting someone over tea seams petty, but its not about tea its bigger than that but people will always latch on to the easiest defense leaving me to justify my confrontation in its simplest form which is making 2 cups of tea, like if they'd have asked for coffee it have been fine because i like coffee and not tea."	0
this is more of a meds question.	0
i'm supposed to give my father .5 ml of liquid ativan every 4 hours, and .25-.50 ml of liquid morphine every hour as needed.	0
how do i know if he needs it?	0
what if he doesn't and i'm just drugging him up needlessly?	0
if i give the 2 drugs together won't they cause respiratory distress (read this online)?	0
i don't want to make him feel like hes drowning or cant breathe.	0
i just want to make him comfortable before he dies, not accidently kill him.	0
this is so frustrating and i feel lost.	0
bg: 66 years old male, metastatic colon cancer, renal failure, tumor lysis	0
vent -  my girlfriend had major surgery a few weeks ago, and she really isnt capable of more than shuffling from the bed to the couch in our (very small, single floor!)	0
house.	0
she needs help with wound care, and meals, and we have two dogs (one is just a puppy!)	0
that i am now solely responsible for.	0
i am so overwhelmed and honestly i dont know how - its only been 3 weeks.	0
it feels like its been years.	0
we dont have any family in the area, and im a full time phd student.	0
im exhausted and angry and also ashamed.	0
how am i so selfish?	0
i know people care for loved ones for years!	0
yet im fussing over what will end up being a couple months.	0
but im tired of being at her beck and call.	0
im tired of being the only person who knows the last time she took her pain meds.	0
im tired of the only things she can actually do being watch tv and play video games - things i definitely dont have any time for.	0
im also tired and angry of hearing her whimper and complain about pain - i know its cruel of me.	0
but i dont know what im supposed to do about it (well, i already contacted her surgical team, moved her follow-up, and had them write a new rx to control the pain better) - but there is going to be pain after major surgery.	0
if its under a 4 i really dont want to hear about it more than once an hour.	0
i know that i also happen to have a skewed pain tolerance - i fully tore my acl, didnt cry or complain the whole day, and waited until my ortho doc could see me two days later before i took any meds for it.	0
i just think its rude to constantly tell people that youre in pain - and i also think it makes the pain worse.	0
i feel awful for being angry about this.	0
but it is relentless.	0
its getting to the point where im fantasizing about getting sent to the hospital - just for a few days - just enough to let someone else take care of me for a change.	0
im not a danger to myself.	0
i just want people to remember that im struggling too - that while my gf is the patient, both of our lives have been (temporarily) upended.	0
i feel awful for feeling this way - because i know she would much rather be healthy and because how easy i have it comparatively.	0
im just .... overwhelmed.	0
hello peoples.	0
wow.	0
so much encouragement, tenderness, and tragedy.	0
i am married for three years and i have a  daughter with cp that i take care of.	0
i do have respite regularly which is a godsend however i do a lot of the caregiving myself.	0
just recently i was venting to my husband about how stressed i was feeling with the day-to-day struggle of trying to balance everyone's needs.	0
my daughter needs 24/7 supervision.	0
i love my husband and i know he wants to be supportive.	0
"he asked me after my vent, ""is it really that bad?"""	0
and i sort of lost it.	0
i just started crying in the restaurant.	0
"he said it sounded like i was ""giving in to defeat""."	0
how can i help him understand?	0
i have done this for 27 years and it is really hard.	0
i get exhausted physically and mentally to keep everything together and i had to do it all by myself up until three years ago.	0
does anyone who does not have the responsibility ever truly understand?	0
even those who live right there with you?	0
should i accept the fact that i will always be alone in my understanding of this struggle?	0
i don't think i complain that much about it.	0
maybe i do and i don't realize it  i admit i get defensive sometimes.	0
"some people hear the word, ""stress"", and confuse it with ""bad""."	0
i love what i do.	0
it takes its toll on me and i don't love every minute of it, but i love my daughter and i know i could do something else but i don't want to.	0
i choose this.	0
i just wish sometimes people could listen to me venting and understand what i'm going through.	0
"to show some sympathy and encouragement instead of blank eyes and the ""is it really so bad?"""	0
question.	0
i feel alone and misunderstood.	0
thanks for any advice.	0
im(31 f)  the sole care giver to my husband(34)who is a traumatic brain injury survivor.	0
he has very limited mobility, bowel and bladder incontinence and uses a walker around the house and wheelchair in public.	0
i have to watch him 24/7 because he lacks the judgement and will break safety rules if given the chance.	0
i also take care of my brother(29)who was severely neglected, emotionally and physically abused by our narcissistic father and is now suffering the consequences of long term abuse.	0
he has fibromyalgia, hypothyroid, food allergies, chronic sinusitis, gerd, migraines, ptsd, anxiety and depression and has a very strict diet due to his stomach issues.	0
i have no support system, no friends or relatives around who could ease the burden and i'm the only who can drive.	0
i do all the cleaning, cooking, shopping, errands, physical  therapy, cognitive activities and finances.	0
sometimes i fantasize about just getting away even for just a couple hours but thats not possible.	0
im an introvert and before this i spent a lot of time alone.	0
i feel both lonely and over crowded and  lazy and over worked.	0
the house is a mess and i still need to go grocery shopping.	0
i dont know where to begin to pull myself out of this mess i created.	0
my sleep is all messed up and i literally feel blocked when i have to do the dishes, cook or clean.	0
i'm wasting more time on apps and have lost a nice routine i had month ago.	0
if i could just clean the house and keep it clean id feel better.	0
i know need to go to a therapist  but i'm hesitant  because ill need to take my husband with and i dont want him to be burden by my issues.	0
after his injury he's more self critical and puts pressure on himself to do more and hearing these things will probably make him feel worse than he already does.	0
this downward spiral happens after my trial, to determine if i get compensation as a caregiver, was postponed.	0
new trial isnt set until december 6th and i've been waiting since may 2018.	0
(we do have an attorney)  i feel like such a let down and i feel deeply ashamed at how messy my house is.	0
i have no extra money to hire some help and that caregiver compansation  and back pay was going to be such a relief.	0
sorry for venting.	0
maybe writing this down will help.	0
i love so much but im not a natural nurturer.	0
im not patient.	0
i dont like complaining.	0
i dont like trying to anticipate my sos needs all of the time.	0
i dont want to do this!	0
i guess that means im a bad person now.	0
they wouldnt ask me to do this if i were a man.	0
this is a teary vent/ raw emotions.	0
im open to advice, am aware that im probably over-reacting, but am just feeling so defeated.	0
honestly i just feel like never going back.	0
my spouse is with his parents, who after a year of my solely taking care of him, have come to stay for 2 weeks while i get away (for an indeterminate amount of time, other family members are coming to stay in shifts, because where i am i have to quarantine for two weeks on either end).	0
they decide to take a couple-day trip in the middle of it (without him).	0
maybe thats fine, maybe its a good idea, but i cant help but feeling upset.	0
i did a year+ of no breaks, because my spouse was absolutely brutal about it, and covid.	0
they were not there for us, and any support financially came with strings (ie wanting to go through our credit card statements monthly).	0
im just so done.	0
i feel like ive been taken advantage of by his family, and i do feel like im owed an apology by them and him.	0
he refused to ask for help from anyone.	0
it only began to happen when i set a date that i was leaving and with the help of a therapist.	0
same situation with him starting to help with household tasks - he only started to do these things once i said i was leaving.	0
and this is still only basic shit like refilling toilet paper supplies from the main storage closet, not cooking meals or cleaning.	0
i dont know what to do.	0
if i should make this a trial separation, if it should be a real separation, if i need to cut off communication so that i dont barge in on their way of doing things (i really dont want to control the situation, im just annoyed that i did what felt like a year of prison and they couldnt do two weeks!).	0
honestly it just underscores my feelings of being alone in this and wanting to move to be around my family, because i dont feel like i trust them or even like his anymore!	0
my dad had a tbi in december of 2018 that left him unable to drive, work, and do most things for himself.	0
it affected his frontal lobe and so he has constant short term memory loss and an extreme lack of motivation and common sense.	0
but from the outside he seems fine to other people.	0
initially he was attending therapies to help but he wasnt doing the work on his own time without my moms help so she stopped taking him (that seems unfair to me).	0
she seems so stressed and too busy to even be concerned about him when she goes to work yet only works part time.	0
im planning on moving out soon as i am 22 so she really needs to step it up as a caregiver.	0
he used to be a handyman and thats all that interests him now.	0
he tinkers in the garage and builds random things using power tools!!	0
he constantly cuts himself and has already started a fire!	0
with his lack of problem solving i really think he shouldnt be using power tools at all he is going to seriously hurt himself.	0
but she doesnt care as long as he is out of her hair.	0
as far as food he wont cook for himself and my mom doesnt meal prep anything for him.	0
so either i make him food or he is stuck eating junk and frozen entrees or starving all day living off coffee.	0
typing this out makes me realize how bad things really are here behind closed doors.	0
the thing about my mom is that she has always been self centered and never supportive so its tough trying to tell her shes doing something wrong.	0
is it just me or is she being a very neglectful caregiver?	0
not to mention she constantly yells at him about his memory like its his fault.	0
overall, i believe shes emotionally abusive to him.	0
theres a lot more that goes on like her making him clean and cook dinners for her.	0
she would rather try and leave the house to see her grandkids all the time than face spending time with him.	0
she already told me she doesnt love him anymore.	0
i am completely torn.	0
tl;dr i'm just so tired of the disrespect.	0
she doesn't recognize me or my mother (her daughter) as family but also can't fathom that i could want a life outside of her.	0
i'm currently helping my mom care for her mother/my 90 year old grandmother.	0
i have been on the extended unemployment since covid, but of course that won't last forever.	0
she's lucid and cognitively capable except her judgement is awful (was never great, she got scammed since mid adulthood ), she refuses to ask for help and thinks she can do everything herself (also her personality).	0
in fact she probably makes trouble because she needs help (she is blind) and so she's just bored  when i explained we've been renovating her house to be more disability-friendly (the plumbing and other stuff  had been neglected and it had to get gutted anyway) so she doesn't need as much help, and we plan to have a caregiver come in via medicaid.	0
she had an idea cooked up that her house was perfectly fine (the cement floor had rotted pipes) and we were renovating it to steal her money by spending it on stuff she doesn't need.	0
it never occurs to her that anyone could ever have goals or reasons that aren't about either propping her up or scamming her.	0
she was shocked that i wasn't planning on doing this for 3 more years.	0
i said no, i need to get a real job.	0
i have a college degree you know, and the student debt too.	0
she suggested that if income is a problem why do i simply not get married (??????).	0
lol, stuff is so expensive nowadays that two income couples are the norm, you can't just have a husband with a normal average job, and a stay at home wife and own your house like before unless the husbands job is very high income.	0
"then later that day she told my mom both ""you're not my daughter"" and ""you're shirking your duties""."	0
her disabled son (who has aphasia and limited speech; but does not have dementia) was also totally shocked that wouldn't want to waste my youth (25), and my mom waste the last few years her body will be strong and healthy (60s), on cleaning up their messes and saving them from the problems they manufacture.	0
we still need her to sign some paperwork in front of a notary so that the medicaid process can go forward.	0
(to put her money in a trust for her disabled son).	0
so i can't tell her off just yet.	0
my mother who has suffered from multiple strokes over the 20 years is finally at a point where she is unable to swallow without choking on food/water.	0
i dont want to do anything with gtube since she is suffering in my opinion and has not been mentally there for over 6 months (blank stares & fetal position).	0
of course all of this is very frustrating for me because i no longer know how to help care for her.	0
few days ago she developed a very wet cough which prompted a call to the dr. he prescribed antibiotics just to be safe and also suggested getting an x-ray of her lungs  done (going in on monday).	0
my question is this, what if this is the new normal what can i expect.....& what can i do as a caregiver to help her.	0
the dr. recommended speaking with a hospice nurse which makes me believe that given her condition she has very limited time left with us.	0
will the care for her moving forward be a balance of determining if i feed her in which case she will develop lung infection which can be of course fatal or let her starve to death & be ok with this?	0
what do i do, has anyone gone through this type of experience, what or how do i plan to help her from this point forward?	0
thanks strangers for your input.	0
hi all, hope youre doing ok. i caregive to my partner who is schizophrenic.	0
we recently found out we are expecting (im 4 months along).	0
i deal with severe depression and withdraw a lot, so that (over the span of a few years) made me lose my job in april.	0
i dont blame the company, they had to do what they had to do.	0
my partners illness has been worse over the course of the past 4-5 months and its really bad right now.	0
i know i need to start working again soon but i feel like hes struggling so bad right now, that it would really affect him.	0
im also waiting on my own medication to start working so i dont feel so fucking depressed and lousy.	0
i guess, everything just really sucks and while i am struggling so bad myself, i also have to worry for him as he cant care for himself.	0
i really need to call monday and get him back in with the doc.	0
i know im lousy sometimes and could always do so much better but damn, anyone have any advice to help me out or make me feel a bit better today?	0
i could really use it thanks all	0
just found this sub and need to vent...bear with me please my 81 year old grandma has rheumatoid arthritis.	0
as expected it has claimed a good part of her health, specially in the last five years: heart, lungs through pulmonary embolism (which leads to pneumonia every now and then) in which i have assisted my mom into taking care of her (i'm 25f and mom is 53 rn), but not as much as nowadays.	0
mid march she began getting sick but we were scared to take her to a hospital because of covid, tried  medical appointments, exams and whatnot but ultmately we got her on a public hospital, where we learned that her ra has claimed her bone marrow now.	0
it's either blood transfusion every time she gets anemic or transplant.	0
it's getting harder and harder to make her eat, no apetite at all.	0
i don't know what to do anymore.	0
she's at home now but much more debilitated than previous hospitalisations so i'm helping my mom more (specially since i'm studying with remote classes only) and it's being though.	0
barely any sleep, tending to her 24/7, diapers and wipes everywhere.	0
i worry about my grandma but also about my mom, her health is not great either (she has ra as well) and she was a caregiver for my dad and her uncle already and it seems she can never catch a break, my heart aches for her so much.	0
then add our elder dog with a broken leg and i'm afraid we are reaching burnout	0
im venting as much as i am seeking words of wisdom and experience, so please by all means chime in.	0
my 80 yr old mil has been living with us since september.	0
she has some minor health conditions such as diabetes but is generally in very good health.	0
she spends every day in bed thinking up illnesses to get attention.	0
she sends text messages to her entire contact list telling them of these awful (nonexistent) problems she is suffering.	0
most just ignore the constant complaints, because its never just one text, its about 17-20 one after the other.	0
in the beginning i was doing absolutely everything for her, now for context i should mention that i also have a 1 1/2 yr old grandchild that also lives with us full time.	0
i had and still have nothing but good intentions in taking care of this woman, but she has made it increasingly difficult.	0
she has told my husband and contacts that i am a thief and steal money from her and my husband, that i open and hide her mail, control her life, force her to remain in her room, and prepare meals i know she cannot have.	0
everything i just listed is the normal day to day crap since september.	0
she treats me horribly and attempts to make other family members think this is all true.	0
she refers to me as that person, someone else, or stupid girl.	0
i get the silent treatment for no known reason and for weeks at a time.	0
i dont like or appreciate this kind of behavior and as a result i quit catering to her.	0
about the only things i do anymore is prepare dinner, clean her bathroom/room, and take her dog to grooming appointments.	0
i made it quite clear to my husband that i will not be a scapegoat and wait on her hand and foot while he says nothing and her behavior is tolerated.	0
this brings us to yesterday when i am doing my normal daily chores.	0
i had just put the baby down for a nap and was hanging laundry in my laundry room when she appears in the door way screaming at me demanding that i unlock my guest room.	0
we had an agreement that she could use the closet for additional storage not use of the entire room.	0
she is in and out of that room every day to the point that my carpet is filthy.	0
at one point she even began to say i cant have guests in her room.	0
to solve the argument my husband and i concluded that we should just lock the door.	0
hence the reason she lost her shit.	0
as long as she continued to scream at me, i had no intention of unlocking the door.	0
she yells im calling the cops on you.	0
still folding laundry and very calm i told her, go ahead.	0
i then text my husband and informed him of the situation.	0
he called me immediately, and in our brief 10 minute conversation, mil called 911 six times ( not exaggerating).	0
she called so many times that the police called my husband for more information.	0
she would dial 911 scream help me, help me and hang up.	0
she did this every two minutes for about 45 minutes.	0
when that wasnt working for her she switched to  shes trying to kill me.	0
i stayed in my kitchen in the cameras view for a record of my involvement!	0
she then proceeds to go outside our home and stands in the middle of the street trying to wave people down, which is where my husband found her moments later.	0
the cops show up and very quickly realized that we provide a very nice home for this woman and she is coo coo for cocoa puffs.	0
she lost her shit again when she demanded that i be arrested for gaslighting, emotional distress, and a federal mail theft charge!	0
when that didnt happen she then demanded that she be removed on the allegation of abuse.	0
shockingly, she did not meet the criteria for a medical hold and we were left to deal with this ourselves.	0
about 30 minutes later she came into the kitchen and tried to force me to leave  the room, she turns to her son and says i only want to be with you.	0
for 25 years you said i could live with you.	0
then proceeded to tell him that he is abusive.	0
un-fucking-believable!!!	0
there is more but this post is already longer than i wanted it to be.	0
the bottom line is that her other children want no part of taking care of her for these very reasons, and yet my husband and i feel very guilty about even considering a nursing home.	0
i feel very angry and resentful towards her and am not sure how much longer i can keep from telling her exactly how i feel!	0
i am not a mean person so im struggling with my own emotions and my husband is not very supportive in the sense that he wont put his foot down and demand some boundaries with his mother.	0
please give me any advice and suggestions.	0
my father had a stroke more than 15 years ago and his condition has worsened a lot over time.	0
used to be my mum taking care of him but shes in bad shape now and ive taken over while we look for alternative solution.	0
daily routine: diaper changes, meals, shower, potty, getting him meds ready  we gave up our daughters room for him.	0
we try very hard to engage him.	0
eg, we bring him out for walks where we move him around in a chair, try to start conversations, etc.	0
but hes never interested and doesnt express any gratitude.	0
even getting him to have meals is a tiring process as he will always complain that hes not hungry or has not appetite.	0
however he will happily help himself to snacks during meal times.	0
i dont mind doing all the dirty work but the lack of appreciation and cooperation is really getting to me.	0
i know its not possible, but sometimes i just want to throw him out on the streets and let him suffer for a few weeks so he will know how good hes having.	0
its hitting me really hard this morning just how tired i am.	0
my aunt is in the ending stages of being treated for throat cancer and this morning she called me crying and asking me to take her to the er she was in so much pain.	0
i had only just woken up so i brushed my teeth and threw on pants before running over to her place to take her to the hospital.	0
i have no coffee, no breakfast, i havent taken my meds yet and im supposed to take those with said coffee and breakfast.	0
its just been a whirlwind and now i cant stop yawning.	0
words of encouragement are welcome.	0
hey there everyone, i'm new here, i wanted to inquire if anyone is still available for this job as i need your services urgently for my mom who has dementia and multiple sclerosis.	0
please if you are still looking for a job, dont look any further.	0
hit me up with your name,age and location please.	0
man its tiring.	0
i know its burnout but i just gotta rant about it... i just miss my old life.	0
im 20 years old and i gotta wake up every morning at 6 to get to my grandparents and help them down the stairs and make there breakfast.	0
gotta make sure they eat lunch, then come over at night and make sure they ate dinner and if not make something for them then help them back up the stairs... i just want to be able to wake up and relax and just enjoy a morning and lay in bed at night and read and relax.	0
its so tiring and it just makes me so impatient for this to be over	0
for the last year my grandpa has been living in my mom, brother and i. he is 80 years old and suffers from parkinson, at this point he fully has dementia and is lossing the small amount of balance he had left.	0
i am physically strong for my size (lifting weights and such), but i find that when i have to help him get up after a trip or fall i just can't seem to get the leverages right, my legs are too short.	0
and when i hold  him he is so light that i feel that i should pick him up easily, but i just can't without potentially injuring my back.	0
luckily i have my brother to help me most of the time, but on the odd ocasion it's very frustrating.	0
so my question is: is there a tip or trick that could help this situation?	0
my husband had covid and pneumonia and was in the icu for 2t days and on a ventilator for 19 days.	0
he was discharged to rehab monday to build up his strength.	0
he had a complete meltdown yesterday and was prescribed xanax.	0
he wants to come home.	0
i got a frantic call from him yesterday at 3pm with his psychologist on the line begging to come home.i visited him at 5pm and he seemed more relaxed the xanax i guess.	0
i got a call at 7am today begging me to bring him home.	0
he can barely walk needs a bedpan and 2 strong men to lift him from the bed to the chair.	0
i will meet with the discharge manager later today.	0
what are my options?	0
stage 4 abdominal/colon cancer, now renal failure.	0
66 years old.	0
we've been estranged for the last few years, but i'm lucky we got to talk a bit a couple weeks ago before he lost his ability to speak.	0
i've never done anything like this before, but i can't not be here.	0
he cleaned up after me as a baby, least i can do is return the favor.	0
im at his house with his wife, landlocked with out a license or car (i'm from the city).	0
im not totally alone with her but we never gotten along with her really, but we're united in our love for him.	0
still i could use my friends.	0
waiting for the ambulance to return him was rough.	0
it wasn't even an ambulance it almost looked like a van amazon uses to deliver cheap goods.	0
the giant, immovable man i'd run to as a kid for protection went in to the hospital and it spat out this frail, small, shadow of a shell from the back of a lime green van.	0
whats even more disturbing is how humdrum and cold the whole process seems; like the emts could have been delivering a fucking pizza.	0
when i said i was here he smiled and gripped my held my hand so at least he knows im here i think.	0
aside from sleeping all day the only colors i see out of him is deformed rage.	0
i've never seen a human snarl and growl with teeth, let alone my dad.	0
his anger was one of the reasons we fell out, but this is something more primal and unsettling.	0
especially when he needs to be changed and/or the catheter inserted.	0
he's been fiercely independent and provided for others and never asked for help his whole life hes so fucking stubborn.	0
i would imagine this is one of his worst nightmares and is so humiliating and degrating for him.	0
at 4am he tried to get up and walk to the bathroom.	0
i had to run and stop him and hold him down before his catheter rips.	0
hes a sliver of his former weight but still has so much strength.	0
i've never even changed a baby's diaper before so i feel so out of my league.	0
who could say they've seen their father naked, let alone ravaged and emaciated from cancer and chemo?	0
i almost had a panic attack after.	0
i'm starting to understand why some people skip chemo altogether.	0
i'm starting day 2 as i write this.	0
i don't know what's in store and am running on adrenaline.	0
i understand the main thing is to make him comfortable as possible, but how when he can't communicate except frustration and fury and pain?	0
i'm not religious and have even cursed god before, but i still pray for a miracle.	0
or at least one more day of lucidity where we can talk.	0
this is mostly a rant so thanks for reading.	0
but if anyone with more experience has any tips for me i'd greatly appreciate it.	0
i'm new to companion aiding and general caregiving and i'm super nervous about my first client.	0
they're in a facility so i won't be completely alone in case of an emergency, but outside of family and friends i've never cared for someone like this before and given the amount of care this person needs it has me feeling very anxious, more anxious than other jobs.	0
is there any way i can alleviate some of my first client jitters?	0
my first time posting anything here and i doubt anyone will respond but i dont personally know anyone who is or has been in my shoes to vent to.	0
im going to try to keep this short, but once again, i am venting here.	0
my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer right before i turned 22. im the youngest of 8 kids, however all my older siblings are married with kids so the responsibility to care for my mom and dad (hes otherwise physically healthy but has a hard time dealing with my mom being sick so i still do most of the caregiving) falls solely on my shoulders.	0
my relationship with my parents, particularly my mom, hasn't always been...the healthiest?	0
"both of my parents are extremely attached to me and though i understand that this is very normal with the youngest child, i feel like our case isnt ""normal""."	0
"before my mom got sick, any attempt to be independent was always thwarted with ""but i want you to live with us for forever"" or ""you arent capable of being independent and you'll fail""."	0
i had big goals and dreams for myself so i didn't let the negative rhetoric get to me.	0
got a job at 16 and had to ask my friends parents to teach me to drive at 18 because my parents didn't think i needed a job or to know how to drive and refused to teach me.	0
"my mom of course didn't appreciate this and used months of the silent treatment or comparing me to more ""desirable"" family members who were less independent and more dependent on their parents, as way to make me feel guilty about me wanting to be a competent adult."	0
me being the people pleaser i am, really let this get to me.	0
i slowly let go of my dreams because i didn't want to be selfish.	0
gave up college and my dream career path, living on my own, and even spending time with friends and just being a normal young adult.	0
wouldn't even think about dating because any mention of the subject would cause the silent treatment again.	0
my parents are older (had me at 44 and 43 and are now mid 60s) and i did decide to stick around since it seemed their health was beginning to deteriorate (though in reality at the time, they were perfectly healthy and just relied on me to do everying/run the house, not because they were incapable but...because apparently thats why they had me in the first place) all my older siblings had their own families so it only made sense.	0
"fast forward to this year, im now 25, still caring for both of my parents and my life has basically been put on hold since 21. my moms condition has gotten horrible, then has gotten better and is currently in a weird state of ""we dont really know""."	0
the depression and anxiety i've experienced the past few years has only intensified during the pandemic.	0
but also with each year that passes, the older i get, and the amount of life i have never lived makes me feel so hopelessly depressed.	0
i love being here for my parents, despite everything i know this is my duty and i want to see it through.	0
but the situation at home doesn't always make the depression easier.	0
watching my mom be so incredibly sick and wishing with every bone in my bodh that i could just trade places with her, then doing everything in my human energy and abilities to make it better only to constantly get compared to other people, to be told im not good enough or not doing enough makes me feel so...useless and like a cheap excuse of a human.	0
the loneliness is almost debilitating.	0
most of my friends are getting married and having kids, done or finishing with schooling, living on their own and loving life but this has been my existence for my whole adult life.	0
i now have a horrifying anxiety about aging because i feel like i haven't even started life yet and the clock is just ticking and im running so behind.	0
i was such an ambitious  young person and yet, i've accomplished nothing but worsening mental health.	0
my only escape is my imagination.	0
"i spend a good amount of my walking day just daydreaming about being married with my own kids or living somewhere with my friends or working in my dream career or even just feeling ok mentally and like im ""enough"" only to ""wake up"" and realize that im nowhere close to any of that."	0
the relationship and interactions i have with my parents on almost a daily basis leave me feeling so useless, like i wouldn't be good enough to accomplish any of those things anyway.	0
i feel so guilty for even feeling any of this.	0
is it true?	0
am i as selfish as i feel?	0
ive lost all of my independence and i dont even know who i am anymore.	0
im a recovering addict and the desire to use has never been stronger.	0
suicidal thoughts are looming when i had just spent over a year in therapy diligently working on my trauma.	0
i was in a good place - healthy, worked out regularly, had a decent social life.	0
i am a shell of what i used to be.	0
im too tired to do anything outside of what is constantly required of me, which makes me feel like im just making excuses and in turn makes me feel even worse.	0
all i have is this phone in my hand thats my portal to the outside world.	0
seeing people living their lives, going on vacations, getting promotions, getting married.	0
i dont see how this could possibly get any easier.	0
if it does, please tell me how.	0
does anyone have experience with federal long term care insurance in the us?	0
it sounds pretty good but i dont have a lot of experience with insurance so i really have no idea.	0
can/will they deny coverage for people with pre-existing conditions (parkinsons, dementia)?	0
any info you have on it or your own personal experience with it is much appreciated :)	0
i (22f) am a caregiver for my mom (61f) who suffers from heart and kidney problems and cannot walk by herself.	0
i live with my dad and two older sisters (28, 30) who also care for her.	0
my sister (30f) is abusive as hell towards me.	0
she throws random violent tantrums and expects me to tolerate them.	0
she believes she takes the brunt of the caregiving when i think she suffers from exaggerated victim mentality.	0
and im tired of acting as her therapist as she refuses to get help.	0
ive been taking care of my mom since i was 13 while my sisters were away at college and i dont get where she gets this idea from when we literally have a daily schedule to split up our time with her.	0
i already suffer from cptsd, depression anxiety and suicidal ideation, so her shit is not helping.	0
the abuse has gotten so bad that i have decided to move 30mins away.	0
my plan is to be close by for emergencies and spend two days a week with my mom the whole day to watch her while i do remote work on my laptop.	0
im moving to create as much space between me and my sister but i hate how this limits my time with my ailing mom.	0
im doing this to improve my mental health that my sister constantly attacks but how do i shake the guilt with what feels like leaving my mom behind?	0
i have a job interview tomorrow and am wondering if and to what extend i should/can mention that i am taking care of my partner.	0
it definitely plays a role why i havent worked full time for the last year (but not the only reason - i changed the direction of my career and studied online, etc).	0
i would also appreciate if they would understand my situation to why i need to work from home sometimes and need a more flexible working schedule.	0
in my work field it is quite common to have those advantages and working models anyways.	0
but i am afraid it could put me to a disadvantage in comparison to other candidates (oh she needs to take care of someone and is not fully focused on work its too risky because she might need to take a break from work in case of a emergency, we cant rely on her) i would really appreciate your experiences and thoughts on that topic.	0
i'm not sure if its because we have to be so on top of it that when i have to do even more work to compensate for someone else just not even trying to pretend to do their job is honestly more frustrating to me then the actual act of caregiving.	0
i'm a freelancer if i failed once half as bad as say someone who's job it is to move and object from point a to point b i would not be hired again.	0
"i've grown so frustrated by this that i sometimes say ""i care for my disabled wife 24/7 what's your excuse"" it feels like the whole world is slacking off and all the bucks stop here."	0
there are lots of benefits of being a home caregiver.	0
in this article, we have listed some surprising benefits of being a home caregiver.	0
i am a caregiver for a smallish adult supported living company.	0
a client performed an action tonight with a shady individual in front of said home, and now we have police patrolling the street as law inforcement thinks that it is very likely that we will be robbed/broken in.	0
i didn't sign up for this, and i am scared.	0
no one else works grave for my house, and of course i can't leave with no one here with the clients.	0
i am on edge, i don't know what to do.	0
this is going to be a very long shift.	0
i was told by oxygen company that anyone using home oxygen could not cook on an electric stove, use a toaster oven or air fryer... i can understand a gas stove or even our pellet stove but seems a bit much to not even use a toaster oven or air fryer.	0
if anyone has used oxygen at home please let me know if you were told these restrictions (& follow them:) thanks	0
we've been living with and caring for my mother in law for three years.	0
she's been in our care for five.	0
we moved in when she kept falling, and could no longer remember to take her meds.	0
she has early onset dementia, congestive heart failure, and is just a horrible person all around.	0
but.	0
my calling has always been caregiver, so i do what i must, and for the most part, it's not awful.	0
i know, thanks to lurking a while, that it could be much worse.	0
"hubs's sister has seen ""grandma"" once since she's been in our care."	0
she's impatient and despite being in town frequently, she just can't be bothered.	0
this means no birthday cards, no christmas cards, no contact other than a monthly three minute phone call.	0
however, on mother's day, she sent the old woman a five pound tiramisu from a swanky bakery in nj.	0
grandma didn't even know who it was from until we saw the card.	0
"""happy mother's day from daughter and son in law. """	0
"immediately, i thought of it as the ""guilt cake."""	0
some history: six weeks ago, she called 911 for mild angina.	0
since, she's called them twice for gas.	0
i suggested we set it out, still covered to protect it from the flies, until it thawed.	0
it was frozen solid.	0
she agreed, and we both went about our business.	0
until the cops showed up.	0
apparently, she also called 911 because i took away her tiramisu.	0
the officer who did the welfare check was very sympathetic, and assured me that this happens with dementia patients.	0
however, i'm angry.	0
i have to watch everything she eats, because she'll eat herself literally sick.	0
she's discovered that if she rubs her chest, it sets my husband off.	0
whereas i want her to have a degree of autonomy, and for her to be able to freely reach out to the few people she has left, i also don't want her calling 911 for her amusement.	0
yes, she's bored.	0
she's spoiled.	0
she's an asshole.	0
i'm consistently angry, and we're all tense, and i'm kinda at wit's end, and i'm just venting.	0
if you got this far, thank you.	0
this is a great community, and you've helped me more than you know.	0
hello all.	0
has anyone moved a loved one into memory care?	0
wondering if having someone make a visit to the home for some backup is a possibility.	0
i emailed a few places but currently waiting for a response.	0
this is extra difficult as my mother never learned english, adding a whole new layer to the challenge.	0
mother is incredibly difficult, (always has been, but more so now of course.)	0
and convincing her that this is best is impossible for me.	0
"she sees me as the enemy, trying to ""get rid of her""."	0
i've put in a good fight spanning over 10 years, but i am completely done.	0
no job due to caring for her 24/7.	0
mentally, and emotionally sick.	0
physically, i am 47, but might as well be her age.	0
any input would be greatly appreciated.	0
take care, everyone.	0
i am exhausted.	0
tired of what is required of me daily.	0
"but the endless doctors appointments (for seemingly no reason other than to ""follow up"" are getting to be simply too much.)"	0
for both my dad and i. he can barely walk at all, and he is very heavy to push in a wheelchair.	0
and it is such a slow process getting him in and out of the house/car.	0
i have no help.	0
even the home aide people we have, claim that taking clients to appointments is not part of the services they offer, even though it says on their website that they do.	0
i no longer wish to bring him to appointments.	0
he is on a waiting list to go into a nursing home but it feels like it's taking forever.	0
even then, i bet they'll urge me to schedule 38463829 more unnecessary doctors appointments once he's there.	0
"i had to take him to the doctor because one of the home aides were ""concerned"" about his toenails being thick?"	0
he's an old man.	0
that happens.	0
"the doctor said the same thing, ""it happens with age""."	0
"so i wasted an entire day addressing their ""concerns"" because i'm afraid that if i don't address every single issue they whine at me about that i will be seen as neglectful and they will call the state or something."	0
i just... don't want to do it anymore.	0
but there is literally no one else.	0
"the va keeps telling me ""well the va offers a shuttle to take veterans to appointments!"""	0
which is true, but they don't assist in getting him out of the house.	0
nor do they offer any type of assistance once he is there.	0
they literally would dump him off at the main entrance and he would have no idea how to navigate through the hospital, and he would probably forget why he is even there in the first place.	0
so it forces me to do it and i am just so tired.	0
i have been doing it for so long and i just want them to let him age in peace.	0
without the constant appointments which have literally never got anything accomplished.	0
i'm having trouble getting past the mother/ daughter dynamic.	0
i'm struggling to tell her what needs to be done.	0
i outlined a bit of her condition in a r/grief post.	0
it's really hard seeing the woman who always held strong for me as basically an infant now.	0
her memory is shot.	0
she's immobile, using diapers (that she hates), confined to her bedroom for the most part, having to use straws and be spoon fed soup only.	0
hi everyone.	0
first of all, excuse my english, i'm from belgium so english is not my native language.	0
my grandmother is in the early stages of dementia and i don't really know what to do anymore.	0
for a while now everyone in my family has noticed my grandmother forgetting small things.	0
the address my girlfriend works at (she still knows the company though), the name of our cat,... small things like that.	0
when things became worse we decided it was time to have her tested.	0
at the hospital where she did some tests it became clear she couldn't interpret time anymore.	0
when asked what year it was she said 2013 while it was 2016 at the time.	0
the doctor suspected alzheimer's although further testing needed to be done so we booked her an appointment for the tests a few weeks later.	0
when the appointment approached the hospital for some stupid reason decided to call my grandmother, asking if she still wanted to go through with her appointment.	0
so of course she says no, because she forgot what it was about and she believes the doctors are trying to pull a scam on her by having her do as many appointments as possible so they get paid alot.	0
this of course put us quite a few steps back, as she absolutely does not want to visit the hospital to get diagnosed now.	0
in the meantime my grandfather, who also happened to be diagnosed with kahler's disease at the meantime (cancer of the bloodcells), has to cope with my grandmother who is becoming increasingly aggressive and forgetful.	0
every week they do groceries together and every week they bring home the same things they already have 9 of because she believes they ran out.	0
when my grandfather points this out she becomes angry and doesn't believe him and even throws a fit right in the middle of the store.	0
anyway, i'm drifting.	0
i would like to know if there are any possibilities of getting my grandmother to the hospital to get a diagnose, i already know what dementia eventually does to people but i would like for my grandfather to have it easier.	0
perhaps if she can take some meds that calm her down it would be a huge help.	0
also if she has to be admitted to a nursing home it would be easier if she has a diagnose.	0
it's just so hard because everytime the word doctor is pronounced she just immediately refuses any cooperation and we can't really tie her down and drag her to the hospital for tests.	0
does anyone have some tricks?	0
thanks for letting me vent and providing advice everyone.	0
stay strong.	0
pbs newshour is looking to speak with caregivers (either adult caregivers or parents of young children) who had to either step away from their careers or reduce their hours due to the pandemic.	0
if you want to share your story, do us a favor andfill out this google form.	0
if you don't mind being contacted by a producer for a follow-up, let us know.	0
the information you provide will not be linked back to your reddit username.	0
hi, i've just been feeling really stressed and confused lately and i felt i needed to share with someone.	0
i've never posted here before.	0
i'm a 20 year old college student with a 71 year old mom who's being treated for memory loss.	0
i don't know if i quite fit the role of caregiver yet but i'm the person my mom sees the most and the only person who really knows a decent amount about her dementia other than the doctor.	0
my family knows vaguely, but she doesn't tell them much, and i don't want to speak out of turn to them about something so personal to her.	0
there have been a lot of incidents building up lately that have me concerned.	0
i come home from university to find that the dog's been limping with a harness on wrong and she hasn't noticed (there's now a bald spot), she left a pot on the stove on once and the entire kitchen was filled with smoke.	0
another time she didn't notice the smell of gas throughout the house - she had accidentally left the gas on the stove on.	0
she experiences a lot of the other symptoms too, and she tells me that i hate her and don't care about her and only stops saying that if i start crying.	0
then she immediately forgets that she said it at all or why she did.	0
i try to be there for her as much as i can, but it's hard while i'm at school, so i never know if i'm doing enough for her.	0
we're the only ones left for each other, not including our dog; my aunt, uncle, and cousins (i was adopted so my cousins all are older and have children) live in adjacent states and we only see them sometimes.	0
i love her so much and i cannot even imagine what she's going through, and i feel so overwhelmed and confused right now.	0
she said last year that we might have to start looking at assisted living or retirement home options if things keep progressing like this.	0
i have a friend who's going to think i'm a monster if we decide that's what's best, and despite what she said before, these days she tells me everything is fine, but i'm starting to really worry.	0
i feel like i'm not smart enough or equipped to do what i'm supposed to right now.	0
i don't even know what i should do.	0
i love my mom so much and i want to be there for her, but i feel so lost.	0
i also struggle with severe major depressive disorder and i feel like an awful person saying i don't know how to be enough for both of us.	0
please send love or advice.	0
thank you	0
today i get mom in shower to shower bench & chair- put shower handle in her hand & leave her to shower when water is right temp.	0
i take out trash after cleanup from lunch but come back in to screaming.	0
i run (which is more of a hobble due to my knee being fubar from slipping in urine while she was last at hospital) to see if maybe she fell-god  forbid.	0
nope, she screaming because she forgot how to turn in the shower... i remind her, to which i get oh i knew that so i ask if shes good?	0
i get a yes then i politely remind her to stand up carefully to wash her nether regions and get f**k, i know that!	0
really!	0
cause you just freaking forgot how to run the shower youve been using since 1975.... but as an unpaid daughter/caregiver-  i just walk away saying my new mantra relaxed, heavy & warm	0
i dunno if anyone else is struggling with this, but i keep all my mom's receipts and my brother and i share them.	0
and i kept losing them / mixing them up with my own.	0
another caregiver recently recommended this simplywise app to me and it has been a gamechanger.	0
it's not the sleekest design, but it's just really simple, and it has saved me so much time and energy.	0
i've been using it to digitize all of my mom's receipts and ones that i need to save for myself.	0
my brother and i share the folder with my mom's receipts, so he can add receipts there too, and we can see the total we've spent in a month, etc.	0
and then just today, i realized that the app even reminds you about return date deadlines!	0
it's pretty cool.	0

im a full time carer for my son whos 30. hes had a sci since he was 5.  hes recently had eczema flair up that covered his stomach, thighs, pubic area and penis.	0
i was having to rub a cream into his skin.	0
he has erections a lot anyway during showers etc and they dont bother me, only difference is him getting them due to me having to actually rub something into his penis.	0
when i was finished he asked if i could just rub it in a little more.	0
even tho he didnt directly ask it, we both knew what he was asking.	0
now considering the embarrassment and what he must be feeling to even ask that i cant even imagine.	0
i obviously hesitated and was taken back by what he said, but ultimately did end up helping him.	0
once he finished and i helped him into his wheelchair ive been going over it in my head.	0
did i do the right thing?	0
probably not, but sexual health is important and its definitely linked to mental health.	0
my country doesnt have any sort of help for that, so ultimately disabled people are kind of looked at as not having needs.	0
did i do the right thing?	0
becoming a caregiver for your loved one is extremely rewarding experience.	0
read this article completely to know about how to become home caregiver through cdpap program.	0
i've taken care of my mother for 6 years.	0
she suffers from a t.b.i.	0
and early onset dementia symptoms.	0
she's always been a lot.	0
it's part of her personality.	0
since i've started caring for her, we've grown irritable with each other.	0
to much time together.	0
we get short with each other and every other thing turns into a fight.	0
i love her to death but between the arguments and my low interest social activities outside of the house, we're drifting apart.	0
i'm looking to take some time off.	0
maybe leave state for a few days.	0
my biggest concern, and what really burns me out, is that i'm the only one who she talks to.	0
over the years she's lost friends, family, and no one else in my family takes the time to listen to her.	0
she's a lot, and doesn't have a filter, but she's human.	0
i'm just her only outlet that she really had left.	0
i don't even have my own outlet.	0
it's obviously difficult to care for someone else.	0
i just never really thought it would be so dividing.	0
i guess i'm just sort of venting here.	0
15 years ago my wife was diagnosed with ms when we were both 30 years old, her ms has been progressive in nature, the last 7 years being non-ambulatory and i help with all transfers, getting dressed, showers and personal hygene, etc.	0
i'm sure many of you understand just how many little things there are when caring for someone with severe physical disability.	0
my wife and i are both only children.	0
her parents are both over 80 now, a still live independently on a small farm thats a 6 hour drive.	0
they dont need help yet, but i know its coming soon, i just dont know if its 6 months, a year or if lucky more.	0
my father is passed but my mom has a hereditary liver disease, is in her late 60s and is at the point where serious consideration needs to be made on how to ensure she is properly cared for.	0
she lives almost 1000 miles away.	0
i feel totally stuck in my ability to quickly pivot to care for either parent due to the distance they are, and the fact they my wife is reliant on me for basic daily living.	0
i work full time, fortunately from home, which has made it easier to be my wifes full-time caregiver, but i just dont know how to get prepared for whats coming and how i'm going to be able to do it all while still working (i have to work to keep healthcare and pay the bills like most).	0
as a man in his mid-40s this is not the mid-life crisis i envisioned as a kid, its so much worse and seems impossible.	0
any advice or words of encouragement are appreciated.	0
my mother (58 years old) is moving to the us to be closer to my sister and i (we both live in the us) and her grandchildren.	0
due to our circumstances she will not be able to live with either of us.	0
once she moves, she wants to start working immediately.	0
one of the options she is considering is becoming a live-in caregiver (she will need room and board).	0
a little bit of her background: she's a doctor with decades of experience (generalist with certificates in cardiology) - i think this must be a big plus.	0
well, obviously, she will not be able to transfer her skills and work as a doctor here in the us.	0
she had taken care of her parents until they passed away.	0
she's very caring and extremely responsible and i'm 100% certain anyone will like her.	0
the thing that troubles me is that her english is very basic at this moment.	0
and i don't think she will be able to hold a conversation, at least in the beginning.	0
she's learning though and making some very good progress but i think it will take her some time to get comfortable with the language.	0
she is russian.	0
she has never driven a car - a big minus here in the us.	0
this thing concerns me a little as i don't know if it's easy to learn to drive at her age.	0
i'd definitely be uncomfortable with her driving on the highways.	0
assuming that someone will hire her what level of compensation can she expect?	0
we currently live in northern virginia (washington dc metro).	0
how easy would it be for her to find a job?	0
or is it not an option at all?	0
if it doesn't work out, she will just move back but we'd like her to stay and live in the us.	0
how do you guys do this without pulling your eyes out.	0
ive recently acquired this horrendous job and just when i thought corporate america was bad this is a million times worse.	0
my wife has recently been diagnosed with rsd known as the suicide disease and a rare brain disease called iih.	0
shes become wheelchairs bound and her leg is so sensitive with nerve pain that anything as light as a feather makes her scream in pain that its hard to even stand next to her while shes screaming.	0
both my wife and i are 23 years old and where the normal people my age are out getting drunk and starting the next chapter of there lives after college, im home collecting my wifes pee in a starbucks venti cup, carrying her up and down the stairs, and everything in between.	0
i basically have no family after my mother kicked my wife and i out of the house because i wouldnt clean the gutters.	0
(mind you im a 53 female.)	0
but the worse thing is she called my wife the n word, bitch slave while kicking us out.	0
so again i know this may not even be the worse situation in world but how the hell do you guys stay?	0
how do you guys not cry?	0
how do you guys keep the little monsters out your head?	0
ive been my partners caregiver for seven years now.	0
and in this time my health has taken a downturn, and im still working to take care of them and manage the farm and animals that they want.	0
i feel like im reaching the end of my rope and im resenting them and im about to walk out.	0
and want to thank all that have read & replied.	0
without an enormous about of info, i tried to do the right thing and it blew up in my face.	0
thus creating more work to be done on my part.	0
my family has been mia this whole time, with everything, leaving it all to me.	0
i wanted everyone together to make an informed decision... no decision was reached and more things must be done, by me, to do what they want to help them with making the decision.	0
i'm exhausted with all the shit i'm taking care of and i added more!	0
my mental health has been a mess my whole life.	0
multiple diagnosis, tons of meds, tons of doctors and therapists.	0
i'm trying very hard to push thru all this to do what i need to do.	0
but i'm getting suicidal.	0
i haven't had these thoughts in a long time.	0
that part, at least, had gotten better.	0
now my thoughts run from everything i need to do to dying, back round to everything i need to do, on a constant loop.	0
and above all of this is the fact that my mother is dying.	0
my heart hurts so much.	0
i have been my mothers caregiver now for 2 1/2 years.	0
i am the oldest of four children, and while one of them lives here with us, the others live a couple of hours away and so essentially nothing but create more work (think getting the house ready for when they come to visit, helping my mother deal with things they should be taking care of for themselves.	0
even my brother who lives here does not get it.	0
he gets to go out when he wants, have a girlfriend and sleep when he goes to bed.	0
meanwhile, i am up with her every time that she gets up during the night which means that i am tired all of the time.	0
i spend some of the time that she is sleeping doing the chores and then it is up and down with her.	0
but any time that she does not get to do what she wants, or i dont jump when she says jump, i am atilla the hun because after all, i should be willing to wake up, get her out of bed, get her settled wherever, then go back and try to sleep with one eye open if i am the only one home/responsible (i sleep so deeply normally that i literally sleep on an air mattress right at her bedside so that i will wake up when she needs to go to the bathroom) and trust that she wont try to get up out of the chair the minute that my back is turned (an utter fiction) and that i will wake up when she calls me (also a fiction - i have slept through the fire alarm in my law school apartment building that is painfully loud and every alarm clock i have ever purchased).	0
simply put, if she is up someone needs to be up too.	0
and i am not going to be up and down like a yo-yo because someone else in the house wants her to come out to the kitchen and visit because the times that was tried it amounted to me getting up, clearing and flipping my bed up, getting her out of bed, only to be woke up to do it all again about an hour later meaning i got about 40 minutes sleep (if that).	0
gee - no thanks, i will just get up and wait it out and hope that when i get back to sleep it will be long enough to matter.	0
but my brother does not listen to me because after all i am just a lazy bones who wants to stay in bed all day.	0
i feel like all that anybody sees when they look at me is the not-perfect.	0
the fact that i dont want to get up right this minute, not the fact that i have been up and down over and over and over because she needed to and this time is not a need to get up situation.	0
and of course my mother does not defend me or even speak the truth.	0
because that might just once prove that i am not being a controlling witch (spell that one with whichever starting letter works for you) but a tired achy person who has seen enough to be able to predict what happens next.	0
i also at times want to scream at them about how much i wish i had moved half way across the country to follow my dream job when i had the chance.	0
the realistic part of me knows that the move was a bad idea, that my health issues probably would have doomed it and that the cost of living was going to go up without a pay raise to make it work.	0
but i have sacrificed a ton and my mom and siblings have a better life for it.	0
i stayed and so they have their lifes and my mother is not in a nursing home, but i feel alone and forgotten.	0
i am barely putting one foot in front of the other and cant remember the last time i could gather the energy to even try to get a shower or change my clothes.	0
i'm 33f and i currently live with my parents who are in their 70's.	0
my mom has stage iv nsclc and is currently undergoing combo therapy (keytruda and alimta) every three weeks.	0
my dad has various health concerns that make his health in just as a precarious situation as my mom.	0
my dad and i are vaccinated for covid.	0
my mom is not because her med team disagrees whether or not she should take a vaccine or not due to the combo therapy wiping out her immune system.	0
my older brother is nearing 50 and does not live at home.	0
"he just got his second dose, but his wife has not because she is ""waiting."""	0
my brother had a huge freakout over my request ( as directed by my mom's healthcare team) to continue to wear a mask around my mom.	0
with mother's day around the corner he had a huge meltdown aimed at me like it is my fault.	0
has anyone else dealt with difficult family during these times have any advice?	0
this has been a battle on and off for months and it is really draining me.	0
i used to be able to depend on my brother and he is more like a father figure to me due to the age gap.	0
im caring for my husband while hes going through some health issues.	0
hes very irritable and has a short fuse.	0
for example, he got angry because our new puppy stole a french fry from his plate and he over reacted and put him in his crate and the puppy was scared of him for a few minutes after.	0
i told him simply he cant do that and make the puppy scared of him because he doesnt know any better yet and he still needs trained.	0
now hes mad at me for saying something to him about his reaction and wont talk to me.	0
thats just an example, but he gets angry like this very often and easy.	0
he has had a bad migraine the past week that wont go away along with some debilitating back issues.	0
i know thats contributing to his irrational behavior, but how should i deal with it?	0
should i ignore it since i know hes in pain?	0
should i try to be extra nice to him?	0
or should i call him out on the bad behavior and still try to hold him responsible for acting out?	0
i did go to him after i walked the dogs and put them to bed and ask if he was okay and ready to talk to him and he told me to leave him alone.	0
so i just went to bed without him.	0
really dont know how to deal with this behavior knowing that hes also been in pain nonstop pretty much for months.	0
i go back and forth being nice and forgiving to being annoyed and upset with him.	0
my best gf had spinal surgery and is now out of rehab.	0
shes been told there are no available ot or pt folks to be had.	0
she lives near brandon, fl any advice yall can give?	0
i live on other end of us so my search ability is limited to internet.	0
thanks in advance.	0
i've posted on here before and ya'll have been really understanding!	0
i'm more of a financial caregiver than anything -  i do most of the chores and errands and the occasional help with a compression top or bra clasp or grabbing her meds from the other room (but that is pretty much it) as my family member is physically capable of the more intimate jobs some of you champs do daily.	0
but it's getting to the point where i need to set an allowance for her so she stops pulling funds out of her retirement to pay for groceries/toothpaste/odd expenditure when she feels up to running those errands on her own.	0
i have no idea where to start with how much i should give her or how to bring this up without it being super dehumanizing.	0
i'll try to avoid putting in the same thing, how i am at my end, i can't do this anymore, the resentment has started, all of that.	0
"my dad has been told he had early-onset dementia for \~15 years now, but the symptoms didn't exactly match, so we just figured he had ""some-kind"" of dementia."	0
after researching and finding another (again) doctor, it is believed he has ftp which is frontotemporal dementia, where the front lobe is effected first / harder rather than the sides.	0
his actions much more greatly match that one, rather then dementia.	0
we have been trying to get him on medicaid for a very long time now.	0
every doctor and social worker said that we should easily qualify, based on income and all other things.	0
"finally, on our fourth medicaid attempt, we received a call and they gave us what they classified as a ""medicaid pending"" number, which i guess is supposed to prove that he will (eventually?)"	0
get it, which should allow us to find a home for him that accepts pending medicaid applications.	0
well, i can't find any.	0
he follows me around like a lost puppy, i can't talk freely on the phone because he is always right there.	0
if i try to leave the room and lock a door or something, his anxiety skyrockets.	0
i was also told that if they do take him in, they would be taking half his money, which is already either right at or right under the poverty line.	0
i have not been able to work because he literally can't go 10 minutes on his own.	0
"despite my best efforts to make the place ""safe"", he will always find something dangerous to get into."	0
if i take the burners off the stove, he wil put stuff in the microwave.	0
if i unplug the toaster oven, he will flush bad things (not waste) down the toilet.	0
he can't operate a utensil on his own, or even put his pills to his mouth.	0
go figure, the few times he had an aid come by (i think medicare allowed 5 30minute visists, which were burned through a long time ago), he sat still and watched tv instead of constantly sitting up and down and pacing literally every dang 15 seconds.	0
he was timely and mannered instead of constantly pulling down and up his pants.	0
i know this isn't the case, but it almost seemed like he knew who was there and that he was purposely putting in an effort to look like his is well.	0
the two times an uncle has come by, he sat quietly and watched tv, instead of his usual hijinks of dragging chairs around, stuffing things down his pants, and sniffling literally every 3 seconds.	0
it's maddening, and i have come so close to just dropping him off at the big hospital in the area, but can't eat the bills (you have to pay like, 60% of the first 20 days and then 30% of the next 60 days, maybe not that exact ratio, but something like that.	0
the money is being used to pay for utilities that have started to fall behind (but not completely sank), cats that we have had for the last 10 years, all of that stuff.	0
a fair size amount goes to his depends, medications, and his cookies and dr. pepper that he just absolutely has to have, as he will barely eat or drink if those aren't there.	0
i haven't had a moment to myself, seen a friend, or done something for myself in going on...18 months now.	0
what does everyone do?	0
on top of all of that, i have finally got in to see a doctor for myself, and was alerted by my podiatrist that i need to come right back in because he thinks that i may have cancer on my foot and needs to biopsy and check blood for spread.	0
i had to move two years ago because i couldn't take care of the house we had on my own, so i moved away from any friends i have, am an only child, and don't have much family.	0
no grand parents.	0
my uncle, his (my fathers) brother lives in florida and doesn't even call to check on him.	0
none of the places i have found (at least, the very few i have been able to contact and actually get a hold of) either don't have memory care, don't accept medicaid, or won't due to it's pending status.	0
all the usual stuff...my only father, but he just goes around making disaster after disaster before i can even finish cleaning the first, resentment, i might need this myself some day so do it for another while you can, all that...but, there's got to be more...right?	0
something to help me help myself?	0
i have two parents that are well over age 70 and are beginning to need more help with their daily tasks like caring for the dog.	0
at first, i was getting annoyed and trying to avoid it but now i've accepted that my future is a caregiver.	0
it won't be forever but it could be for 10 years or more.	0
i'm going to get help from social workers when the time comes, but i think that accepting your role makes it so much easier than trying to fight it.	0
has anyone done this or can give me more info on how it works?	0
my mom has a disabling condition and honestly probably should go to a nursing home but doesnt want to and it would be nice to keep her at home and support her.	0
i already do a lot of unpaid labor and have no problem with this but she really needs someone full time/live in.	0
thinking maybe my sister will do it as she already has a really low wage job.	0
i'm at my wits end.	0
i'm new to this sub,  so forgive me if i transgress.	0
i didn't want this, it has been placed upon me by the same person who placed the care of her children upon me when i was also a child.	0
now, i care for her mother.	0
she used me then she uses me now.	0
i love the person i care for, but i need myself now more than ever  yet i am at her beckoned call.	0
i am growing resentful.	0
i still have love and hope in my heart.	0
i just want someone to ask me how i am.	0
just once.	0
and for someone to make me dinner.	0
i'm an only child taking care of my 88yr old parents.	0
mom has dementia and dad is failing physically and i work a full time job.	0
my schedule is full to say the least.	0
"i'm so tired of people telling me to ""take care of myself"", what the hell does that even mean??"	0
take a vacation?	0
right, that's impossible.	0
have a fucking spa day?	0
are you kidding me?	0
"feels like ""thoughts and prayers""."	0
what do people tell you that drives you crazy?	0
if you have liability insurance for your work as a home health aide.	0
please tell me where to get it and price please.	0
hi all,  i've been live-in caregiving my 91 year old father since 2013. with the pandemic i've been employed off and on the last year, currently not working.	0
my family still expects me to pay my father $400 a month despite being unemployed.	0
i was presented a line item bill by my sisters for expenses that my father covered for me during a five month period, including back rent.	0
i gave my father $3500 that i calculated ( roughly) would cover that.	0
that's when i was presented with the credit card statement and checking statement for expenses i purportedly still owe ( to the tune of another $3000).	0
he hasn't paid a dime to me for groceries, toiletries and household maintenance items since i moved in.	0
he's not solvent financially.	0
i cook, clean, grocery shop, indoor maintenance, yard maintenance, snow removal etc etc.	0
i know it's insane that i'm paying my father to work for him.	0
by my calculations his half of just the groceries for the last 8 years is approximately $12,000.	0
we're having a sibling meeting soon ( it's always four against one).	0
i need some help with a script to bring with me to advocate for myself.	0
hey all!	0
before i start i just want to say thank you to each and everyone of you for stepping up to the seemingly impossible task of caregiving.	0
i know its super hard, and i pass my love your way for sure!	0
i'm a caregiver to my elderly mother who has a rare neuro/autoimmune disease: stiff person syndrome.	0
there is no cure, and it will only progress to get worse over time.	0
i am 27 y/o and do this 24/7.	0
i've been helping her out for the last 10ish years, and just two years ago, i quit my job to officially be her paid caregiver.	0
i have a 7 y/o son, and due to covid, he has been doing virtual learning for the last half of his kindergarten year, and now his entire first grade year.	0
my husband is a full time ironworker and the past few months has been working overtime whenever possible.	0
90-95% of dishes, laundry, house cleaning, cooking/most meal preparations, grocery shopping and schooling fall into my plate.	0
some things i help my mother with are setting up every appointment and taking her to them, getting her medications prepped for her to take, each meal and snack throughout the day, helping her use the bathroom(commode) and clean up afterwards, showers, getting dressed, clipping nails.	0
appointments for myself, and my son as well.	0
(i am not complaining, i just feel this is important to note).	0
my mother has had pt/ot come into the house, and show us how exercises for her level are done, and they basically gave us tools/info to now complete it ourselves.	0
pt/ot have come to our house a few times over the years.	0
the exercises they've given her are arm and leg exercises that she can do while sitting.	0
my mother is fully aware that she needs to exercise.	0
between admitting it herself, all doctors she has (primary care, neurologist, oncologist, nutritionist) telling her its in her best interest, and myself asking her to take some time to do it a few days a week.	0
i myself suffer from depression and anxiety, and my plate often feels as if it is overflowing with no end in sight.	0
some days its hard for me to continuously show up, even for my own wellbeing honestly, but as a caregiver and parent, thats what i must do.	0
my mother doesn't do much other than watch tv and play computer games unless we're doing a movie night or board game night which we try to do every couple of weeks.	0
i have been honest with her with how much it will not only help herself, but it will help me out greatly because i can't always find time to be in her room while shes doing the exercises.	0
she doesn't require assistance with the exercises because again, they're to be done while she is sitting.	0
she does have some that do require help, for example, walking back and forth through the house with her walker, and those ones i am not talking about when i ask her to do them herself.	0
when i do ask her to do the ones she can complete herself, she will only do them for a day or two but then she'll stop.	0
this happens a lot.	0
if i don't find the time (somedays i do find the time, but somedays i don't) i start to feel guilty as if its my fault shes becoming weaker.	0
it seems like nothing anyone says that will get her to take it seriously.	0
when i talked to pt they said they do a couple of sessions per week, for 6 weeks, and then they leave when they're confident we have the knowledge to do it ourselves.	0
is there a specific profession or some company that i could have come in to exercise with her, but not pt?	0
i am willing to pay out of pocket if theres not something offered through insurance.	0
would it be a personal trainer i'd hire?	0
is there someone in between a personal trainer and physical therapy that i don't know exists?	0
she knows the exercises, but seems to need someone with her like the buddy system.	0
does anyone have any experience in this sort of thing?	0
she doesn't fight me on doing them - its never an argument, she just severely lacks motivation to go at it alone.	0
any advice/help is greatly appreciated!!	0
-j	0
hey guys i just joined this group.	0
im a caregiver for my injured husband for the past year.	0
he cant do much right now.	0
cant ride in a car or even stand/walk for more then a couple minutes.	0
we have no children but two dogs also who are pretty high maintenance/high energy (ones still a puppy also) who i take care of as well.	0
between requests from my husband, picking up the slack for everything he cant do, walking the dogs separately multiple times a day, cooking, cleaning, etc, i feel like i still have free time (i dont work right now), but i am constantly interrupted every 5-10 minutes for various things whether it be taking the puppy out to pee, or getting something for my husband, or just little tasks.	0
i want to get on a schedule so i can maximize my time and be more organized and get more things done for myself that ive been neglecting but i dont know how to schedule my day when im also at the mercy of other beings and everything i plan typically gets interrupted and the in-between time gets wasted.	0
i was just on here yesterday looking for some advice (thank you to those that replied!).	0
and now i have yet another question (not related to that one).	0
if a person still has the mental capacity to make their own health decisions, why would a nursing home contact & look to family members to determine that person's code status?	0
my mom is full code and declining very quickly.	0
the nurse wants to know what should be done.	0
my mother has stated she doesn't want to go back to the hospital.	0
she is not eating and rapidly losing weight.	0
started to refuse meds.	0
refuses to get out of bed (and has a pressure wound forming).	0
almost never answers her phone to talk to me anymore.	0
it does appear she's given up.	0
i will obviously speak to my father & brother about this.	0
but i'm still just wondering why we are being asked when at this time, it was/is my mother's decision to be at full code.	0
i know her quality of life is already horrible.	0
and any further emergency treatment could make it much, much worse.	0
i guess i'm just confused.	0
and the nurse seems pretty adamant about changing the current status.	0
thanks for reading & any info you guys can give.	0
much love	0
my grandmother passed away this week.	0
i helped take care of her on a daily basis for over a year, and it has been such a hard year.	0
over the last few days ive had this enormous sense of relief that this chapter could finally be closed, that she would no longer be in pain and the rest of us could move on with our lives.	0
this is what ive been yearning for over the last year, for her to be set free so we could be set free again.	0
even after she passed away, and they carted her off to the white minivan for transport, i held myself together with thoughts of hope and relief given what this meant for my life.	0
i kept myself busy, offering food and beverages to family who came out to see her body at peace.	0
i had been feeling so much resentment towards the situation and now i could let that go.	0
my grandpa seemed to be doing ok but i figured once the house got quiet he would probably have a hard time.	0
well, the house being quiet affected me, too.	0
the empty bed in the dining room, the stack of supplies we no longer need, the lack of music we no longer need to play to offer her comfort.	0
living through the last year felt like torture and i was kicking and screaming the whole way, but i look back on it now and feel glad i could be here to care for her and to advocate for her.	0
i was able to speak for her when she was experiencing too much pain, especially at the end.	0
she loved us so much.	0
her children and grandchildren were her pride and joy, we were her whole world.	0
even though she had been suffering from dementia for at least 15 years, she would periodically ask if the kids were ok...in her mind we were still 5 years old while in reality were in our 20s and 30s.	0
going through old pictures and videos from the past year, tears started to come.	0
im devastated.	0
i was so focused on what i could gain by closing this chapter it feels like i forgot to appreciate what i was losing.	0
i know i did stop to appreciate what i had, but now that shes actually gone it certainly hurts a lot.	0
thank you to this community for all your support and for sharing your stories and experiences.	0
this was the hardest year of my life and this sub made it better.	0
hi all, this is my first post.	0
i'm an exhausted 24/7 solo caregiver to a wheelchair bound 89 yr old mom in mn while maintaining my life (wfh) back on the east coast.	0
my dad lives separately and unfortunately my parents never divorced.	0
i have 5 siblings that aren't participating for one reason or another and are in no position to help financially or in any other way due to their own troubles such as disability.	0
my dad, a retired lawyer, has been threatening my mom and i repeatedly that he'll sell her home or do other financial things that fill her with terror.	0
at 92 and almost 90 it's too late for them to divorce unfortunately (although i've tried to make it happen) so their finances remain mixed although he is fully in control of them.	0
today he made me an offer to give up my job and rent stabilized ap't on the east coast and he'll pay me $750 a month and he'll have my mom pay me $750 a month for her care.	0
he said he would hire someone from time to time to give me a break although i don't totally believe that to be true.	0
my mom and i would live in her home (where he lived for 30 years) but if she were to die it would be sold and i'd be....on the street apparently?	0
"i'm sure you are all thinking ""hello, elder care lawyer!"""	0
but i am so overwhelmed and my dad is a retired attorney himself so i don't even think the elder care lawyer could help me and honestly my dad is so rageful that if i even mentioned an elder care lawyer i can't imagine how he'd react but it would be terrifying.	0
i don't know what to do but i cannot believe she's put up with this abuse as long as she has without a disparaging word about him.	0
for those of you you have created care contracts, how did you do it?	0
ugh, i'd kill for a hug and for reassurance that everything will be ok. we had so, so many happy years and i cannot believe this is what it's come to, and in their 90s no less.	0
it's so damn sad.	0
thank you for letting me vent!	0
hi everyone!	0
i have started my short course for caregiving.	0
everything is going well but i tend to get nervous when doing demos.	0
i have some anxiety on acting/performing.	0
may i ask for some advice on how you got over this?	0
thank you!	0
personally, my husband and i want to purchase a large amount of property, give some of that property to each of our children to have their own property (for living, farming, weekend play, selling for wood, etc) with the only stipulation being they don't let their respective pieces get trashy/unkempt looking.	0
if they choose to live on the property and care for us, then great, but we will have funds set aside for professional caregivers so that this isn't a requirement, but something they do because they want to help.	0
because that's what i do.	0
why do we find it difficult to take a break or ask for one.	0
why do i wait until the  precipice  of a total meltdown to do the things i know i should do all the time.	0
also... do you guys try to block out a few hours for yourself each day or week?	0
a little background, im (24f) a care taker for my husband (23m) for the past year.	0
hes got bad back issues that prevent him from driving (or riding in the car), walking much, sitting in a chair, doing a lot of things for himself, etc.	0
also, hes has had severe migraines as well the past few months that last for upwards of a week at the time where he cant really even get out of bed.	0
im not working, just at home, doing school full time, and tbh ive also been doing his schoolwork most of the time.	0
hes taking a break from school after this semester since he hasnt been able to do it himself.	0
but just between that, doing all the cooking, cleaning, errands, grocery shopping, driving to and from appointments and waiting, walking and training our dogs separately, im finally almost to my breaking point after a year.	0
i think its mainly just the lack of emotional support that i get from him or anyone else.	0
i feel like im giving him everything i have and im getting nothing coming in.	0
but either way, im prepared to start focusing on myself a little more.	0
so, whats some good self care tips that have helped you guys?	0
finally my dad's heart doctor is beginning the process of getting my dad a consult for being on the heart transplant list.	0
he's 70 and has several comorbidities which may make him ineligible but this is a start.	0
my dad's in heart failure and his heart is getting weaker (<20% ejection fraction) so this is giving me a little peace of mind.	0
maybe they can get him an lvad or some experimental drugs to add some years to his life.	0
in the meantime i'm just kind of afraid that he may kick the bucket at any moment.	0
we're praying for the best.	0
anyone have any experience with transplants and the like?	0
another weekly rant.	0
im 15, and i really, really have a bad family history with dementia/alzheimer's.	0
is it possible that this terrible condition will be cured in my lifetime?	0
i'd really hate to have this as it just looks absolutely horrid.	0
ive attempted to write a post many times, only discard because my brain is a pile of useless mush.	0
im too tired to form sentences and need a vacation from constant caregiving so badly- this is worse than milking cows, at least then i got two weekends a month off!	0
ive had one night away from my mom since my dad died in 2014 (but worried because my addict brother was staying with her) i do not know how you all do this....	0
this might be a long post, but, its a good place to vent.	0
at least, thats what im using this subreddit for.	0
im a 25f, recently married.	0
ive been with my husband for almost 9 years, but at the beginning of 2020 we moved into my maternal grandparents house to help my mom care for them... which allowed us to live together before we got married and for us to save for our own house.	0
my grandparents (both 87), need 24/7 care.	0
my grandmother has alzheimers and doesnt know what goes on anymore.	0
her moods are hit or miss, can be combative but also sweet, and just seems to basically be existing at this point.	0
my grandfather is more mentally there but has a touch of dementia, and needs more help physically.	0
his downside is that hes the complete opposite personality as he once was; how i remember him as a kid.	0
once was very soft spoken, considerate, and kind...but now... very sassy, grumpy, rude and bossy.	0
makes caring for him difficult most days.	0
as im sure many can relate, caregiving is hard.	0
its not for sissies.	0
many times i cry from frustration.	0
sadness.	0
i find it hard sometimes to keep my patience.	0
praying for relief from my mom or sister, but finding it hard to accept help.	0
guilt is more consuming than i wish it to be in that area.	0
some days, i feel like a prisoner in the house.	0
everything revolves around my grandparents.	0
we cant do anything as a family anymore.	0
timing of events have to be thought out.	0
who can watch them while i go to the store?	0
we have a date night saturday can you come over and sit?	0
we (my family) have cameras to keep tabs on them when were out in case something happens, but i find it obsessive to watch.	0
i cant stop.	0
when i do have a break, its hard to give my mind a break as well.	0
its all consuming.	0
i dont feel like a normal 25 year old newlywed.	0
though, i volunteered for this life - to help my mom (who was pretty much burnt out) - its taken a lot out of me.	0
stress is beyond what it should.	0
my marriage/relationship sometimes suffers (but i have a very supportive husband).	0
the guilt i feel when passing off duties is unmeasurable.	0
the difficulties when caring for someone with alzheimers gets worse by the day.	0
its all just.... a lot.	0
i dont know the point of this post other than just venting how i feel to complete strangers.	0
strangers who also just happen to know what its like.	0
i have a great family; support system.	0
but does anyone else just feel immense guilt when asking for a break or time for yourself?	0
taking care of my grandparents is rewarding but oh so hard.	0
especially when its such an unappreciative role.	0
i am yelled at, hit, argued with.... not all the time, but most.	0
how do you keep from growing resentful?	0
i tell myself they are not the same as i once knew.	0
that they are probably depressed.	0
embarrassed.	0
but sometimes my mind forgets.	0
my soul gets hurt.	0
i often wonder why they are still even here on this earth... their lives are no more.	0
its a sad situation.	0
a tough situation.	0
and i pray for strength almost everyday.	0
this might not be the best place to post this, but my mom finally got checked into a care facility today an hour away.	0
i now live alone in our condo, with no close friends (im 20), but with lots of family nearby.	0
although a lot of weight is lifted on my shoulders and im happy that she can now get the appropriate help she needs to get better, im extremely anxious and lonely.	0
i guess my question is, has anyone else experienced this, and how did you get through it?	0
i feel super weird.	0
since i started taking care of my mom i lost all of my close friends so i dont really have anyone.	0
my family does the best they can to help me but they have jobs and families and problems of their own.	0
my semester ends next week and ill have a lot of free time after that.	0
im a part time nanny so theres that to keep me a little busy, but no way to meet people through my job unfortunately.	0
i also cant own pets in my building ): .	0
this post is super messy im sorry	0
she shit on my floor yesterday and dumped her milkshake all over the porch today.	0
i have two job interviews coming up which, if i get one, ill no longer have the ability to work remotely to keep an eye on her.	0
im desperate to step out of this role and get away from the house and get away from her but im dreading whats going to happen to my home when i cant supervise anymore.	0
i dont remember signing up for this.	0
hello all, something happened today that i found to be a bit weird and i'm looking for some opinions.	0
first let me give some details.	0
my grandma is the only close family member i have left.	0
she is 92 and in pretty good shape (for her age).	0
she has mild dementia, (not alz.)	0
and needs daily help but not 0-24 supervision.	0
i used to live at hers for a while but now i live at a rental.	0
i call almost every day and visit her 3-4 days a week.	0
i buy her food and stuff from the store.	0
she has caregivers that are free for her because of a kind of support she has.	0
mon-fri someone is here 10am-12, then then usually the lady in my story comes from 4pm-8pm and on weekends it's only the lady, like 2pm-8pm.	0
she wears a button on her wrist that is connected to a box and on that she can could call for help any time.	0
this level of supervision has always been enough so far luckily.	0
let me say i don't know about the laws of caregiving for old people around the world, i'm from middle-europe and i'm not even sure how they work here.	0
but i never fully trusted these people doing the caregiving and especially this lady seems to be egoistic and a bit shady sometimes.	0
you know, the kind of people you talk to and seem kind but give a feeling that they aren't completely trustworthy.	0
her bosses are in the same category.	0
they are from a company hired by a foundation that deals with the type of support my grandma gets.	0
they seem ok dealing with the daily works but i always had a feeling about this woman that she seemed a bit shady along with the entire company she works for... and i heard stories about caregivers trying to get what old people have... i don't know how and what, the flat is under my ownership (couldn't sell it in her life even if i wanted to, just own it) so it's her money that could people want somehow but the whole thing might just be my paranoia.... or just wanting to get her under guardianship since they have already tried this before but didn't succeed.	0
she also made a fuss recently about not liking me getting into the arranging of grandma's medical stuff whenever i feel like it and either she deals with it 100% or gives it up and i have to deal with it 100%.	0
i'm a bit short tempered and she got upset and we fought about this for like 2 hours (she didn't seem to understand that i didn't want to offend her and i had no intention of taking over grandma's medical stuff, just decided to call the doctor for the prescriptipons on an impulse) and after this i decided to avoid her from now on and only talk to her on the phone since i don't really like her personality.	0
so grandma had to go to a new doctor today since her old neurologist resigned and the memory-psychiatrist she belongs to haven't seen her before due to the pandemic.	0
but now she got both shots and the doctor refused to prescribe her meds any more without seeing her at least once.	0
caregiver also said she should definetly go and today they went.	0
the time wasn't good to me so i didn't go despite that i would have loved to be there in person.	0
i called her after and they said everything was ok, her condition is ok still, took one of her pills away and she might not need to go again in the lack of a new problem.	0
the caregiver then told me she came earlier today and so will leave earlier too, so i decided to also visit grandma today and got on a bus.	0
when i got here i wanted to sit on a bench and smoke a cigarette still before i came up and that's when i noticed the caregiver lady across the street a few meters from the house holding a piece of paper and talking to the phone to someone (her boss, i assume).	0
i think she didn't notice me so i tried to hear some of what she was talking about since i was pretty sure she was holding grandma's results from today and telling her boss about it.	0
but of course when i crossed the street a bit further up and stood in the cover of a pillar, before i could have heared anything, she started to head home (i still think she didn't see me).	0
i didn't want to follow her so i came up and was sure her result wasn't going to be here.	0
she took one already before and said that was so she could call them for the meds (and got the appiontment then).	0
but now all her meds are prescribed and still she took the paper.	0
i called her to be sure and she acted like she left it in her bag and took it by accident and will return it next day.	0
but i'm 99% sure she was acting and took it on purpose and i'm also pretty sure that's what she was holding and talking about to someome when i saw her by accident.	0
"regardless i said ""ok, i'll read it another day then""."	0
is this normal or am i rightfully afraid that there is something shady going on?	0
is there anyone she's allowed to tell the results to?	0
don't know what's their agenda could be but something about this unsettles me.	0
maybe it's nothing but these people weren't the most trustworthy people anyways and i know there is a lots of shady stuff in the caregiver-business so i'm not sure what to think.	0
sorry for long text and thank you for your replies!	0
i need help with understanding whether i need to amend my 2020 taxes.	0
situation: a check from the area agency on aging is mailed to my house, in my name, every month.	0
the amount is $160.00.	0
the stated purpose is to cover my mom's expenses such as medical equipment, med copays, convenience supplies, etc.	0
daily needs.	0
since she can't shop for herself, the check is sent to her caregiver.	0
i have never received a 1099 for this income, and a call to both the area agency and the entity through which the benefit was generated did not result in definitive information on whether this is taxable.	0
"the only thing they said was, ""we've never sent one (1099) out to anyone, ever""."	0
ok.   a chat with h & r block yielded no results so far.	0
they recommended calling the irs.	0
so, i tried.	0
and i got lost in their call screening hell and finally hung up.	0
googling did not help either.	0
these entities do not want to give tax advice, naturally.	0
does anyone know whether i need to amend last year's tax return to add this income in?	0
am i worrying about this needlessly?	0
(a search of this sub and reddit did not yield any results either, but then again, maybe i'm missing something)	0
started to work for a company of caregivers for the elderly recently, & it sounded like a decent job that i could do.	0
well little did i know, id be thrown into the job with no experience, no training, not even a video.	0
i went from fast food to this caregiving, & theyve thrown me straight into helping bathe fall risk people & they havent trained me on anything.	0
how to properly help transfer a patient, how to help clean a patient, how to change briefs, nothing.	0
they just said well heres this task list to do but the tasks are mostly cleaning + cooking, stuff that i know how to do.	0
i dont know how to appropriately help a fall risk into the shower, i dont know how to bathe him, i dont know how to really do any of it & my first day was so overwhelming & anxiety inducing for me that i dont want to go back.	0
problem is that i just spent a lot of time trying to get into this job & out of fast food, it took 2 months of effort & now im worried that i may be facing having to go back to the fast food job i left.	0
am i doing something wrong?	0
am i just not cut out of this?	0
ive never had to bathe another person, ive never even changed a babys diaper let alone a fragile adults depends.	0
im anxious, im embarrassed, & i feel way undertrained.	0
help?	0

hi, somewhat new here, been reading a bit and just watching this sub for a bit.	0
i am soooo excited today as i am finally reaching out for help again.	0
i have been struggling entirely on my own for over a year now when the lockdown began.	0
i just moved to a brand new city and still dont know many people, of course no one comes out to meetings currently and an old friend i have here is avoiding outings due to his children being young, i totally get it.	0
so i have been putting off connecting for a year, hoping the restrictions will lift soon.	0
and it is slowly happening.	0
my patient got his first vaccination recently and soon enough, i will get mine.	0
once we are protected, things should slowly return back to normal where i live, whew.	0
today, i finally looked up local support groups and whats on offer.	0
duh!!	0
they meet virtually of course!	0
i am a shg veteran, have been attending meetings for a good 10 years now, so i know the drill and the benefits.	0
i have met quite some inspiring people in such groups, some of which have become my best friends.	0
so i am quite hopeful.	0
i really just need to get my social network going again and talk to different people and get new and fresh energies into my life.	0
thought id share the good news with yall.	0
first meeting is wednesday, yay!	0
i sure hope this is the end of one of the most depressing and trying times i have ever experienced.	0
i hope you all experience some silver linings as well.	0
let things get better, please!	0
someone called aps and said that i and my grandfather are severely neglecting my grandmother.	0
it could not be further from the truth!	0
they said that we withhold her medicine, that she's lost over 100 lbs since december, that we starve her, that she's covered in bedsores.	0
all lies!	0
out and out lies!	0
she went to the hospital on friday because she thought she was having a stroke.	0
they didn't find any stroke evidence and believed she may have possibly had a tia, which she has a history of, but that there was no damage and no last effects.	0
i came home and the aps agent showed up then wanting to speak to her.	0
i told her that she was at the hospital.	0
the hospital pretty well backed me up, and my grandmother told them the truth.	0
i talked to her then as well.	0
unfortunately, i'm trying to get into nursing school and these false accusations may well prevent me from getting in.	0
even when they are found to be untrue, it will still follow me and make it extremely difficult to get in and get my liscense.	0
i've worked so hard and juggled so much to get here just to have it snatched away by malicious bullcrap.	0
i'm so angry, frustrated, and disheartened.	0
i don't know what to do, and i just needed to rant.	0
the role of caregiver is a hard one, and crap like this makes it 1000 times harder.	0
at least i have the knowledge that my grandparents are in fact well taken care of.	0
i make damn sure of that.	0

hello.	0
long story short- my father is in a snf rehab unit and this facility's social worker is refusing to discharge him unless a vow of 24/7 visitation/care happens.	0
medicaid waiver emergency assessment happened and they are not willing to increase his paid hours to anything close to that.	0
dunno what to do as medicare will soon end their payment for my dad's stay.	0
which of these should i do??	0
-accept snf demands and have ppl over as often as possible, but it would be impossible to make it 24/7 like they demand.	0
-discharge ama and bear potential consequences.	0
which would screw us least?	0
or is there another way?	0
wow this is a bad spot to be in..	0
so my mother is terminally ill, and basically fully paralized.	0
i'm her sole caregiver, i'm not counting my 90yo grandma (her mom) because she's helping as much as she can, but obviously in that age she only can do so much.	0
my mother is obviously not happy with the situation, and i understand that completely.	0
to say that facing your own death racing at you every day is hard, is to say nothing.	0
i'm obviously trying to do my best and give her as much comfort as possible, including emotional and physical help.	0
that said, she believes (not hopes, she's 100% sure, at least on the outside) that she'll get better.	0
let me be clear - i hope for that too, but i know how the reality looks like and it's not bright.	0
because of this, she doesn't want to agree to anything that could actually help her, including some minor remodeling to our small flat that would help me helping her.	0
"it gets ridiculous now, because i start to feel it in my back (i'm a big guy so leaning 100 times a day takes its toll) and still my every suggestion is shit down with ""i'll be healthy"" or ""i have worse than you, take that into consideration"", which is true, but it's comparing apples to a train."	0
i'm getting burned out of empathy towards her.	0
she's mostly quite appreciative, but it's verbal.	0
it helps, but it won't save my back nor mental health.	0
i have quite a lot going on in my life and i try to somewhat keep it from her, but i'm near my limit.	0
it's half rant, half question.	0
i wanted to ask you, have you been in similar situation?	0
how did you resolved it?	0
"have you finally ""snapped"" and just did the changes with crying and screaming in the background (this is what will probably happen in my case when i start changing anything)?"	0
i'll appreciate any support here, i know this post sounds quite cold but i'm really just not myself anymore.	0
:(	0
i feel awful writing that, but it's where i am right now.	0
part of it is that we're crammed in a small apartment with little soundproofing and i can't escape (i work nights, so even in my free time there's nowhere for me to go except the car, which is not a relaxing environment for me).	0
part of it is i feel like whimpering is a cry for help, and there's nothing i can do.	0
part of it is i am personally dealing with poor mental health and being reminded that there's someone who needs comfort that i can't offer feels like an extra task on top of everything else i do.	0
i call myself my mom's caregiver, and in some ways i am - she doesn't cook or clean and rarely feels up to driving, so i usually get her meds, etc.	0
but there's nothing i do to help her directly.	0
she's pretty self-sufficient, just in a lot of pain that i can't help with.	0
i just get to be a constant witness to her suffering while dealing with my own issues.	0
(while knowing that even if there was more for me to do, she wouldn't ask because she knows that i have issues, which makes me feel guilty, too.)	0
i wish i could move out and just find her an aide or something, but neither one of us can afford to live on our own.	0
i would ask for help from the rest of the family, but everyone else is either struggling to get by themselves or lives across the country.	0
i'm afraid one day i'm going to lash out at her and make her feel terrible, which is the last thing i want to do.	0
my dad has some kind of super advanced dementia.	0
he gone from kinda weird to totally nonfunctional and immobile and unable to communicate within a few years.	0
he can barely stand at this point.	0
im determined not to put him in a home.	0
but my whole life has been dedicated to taking care of him.	0
i love my dad.	0
he made me who i am.	0
he has hell faults and shit but fuck man.	0
he is a saint.	0
dementia has destroyed him.	0
he cant do anything anymore.	0
i worry every time hes left alone for more than 2 minutes.	0
he could stand up and fall down.	0
he could wander into the street.	0
who the fuck knows.	0
what fucks me up worse is knowing that these things have happened under my watch before.	0
i once went to a corner store and left him in the car for 5 minutes, he then took the wheel and tried to drive home.	0
we had to get th police involved and it ended up that he was at the house safe and sound, the car was destroyed tho.	0
once i walked away from him in the shower, i had to check on a new puppy.	0
when i came back a few minutes later my dad was o. the ground and there was blood pooling around his head.	0
i do not leave him alone for any amount of time any more.	0
i feel like im a terrible person.	0
like i am not attentive enough.	0
i try.	0
i fuckin try so hard.	0
but things happen .	0
terrible shit.	0
shit i cant forgive myself for.	0
i have to do better.	0
that being said.	0
theres been 3 years of uneventful bullshit, me cleaning and changing and entertaining my dad.	0
me fuckin explaining to my relatives how his dementia works and how to handle it to make him not feel sad and shitty.	0
but, still.	0
ive fucked up.	0
and ive hurt my dad.	0
because of my negligence.	0
he deserves better.	0
we cant afford better.	0
so we have me.	0
i just do what i can.	0
sorry guys, this is not my favorite topic but i need some ideas.	0
lately every bowel moment is like a bomb going off.	0
it's a combination of flexibility, muscle control, sense of hygiene, and just gosh darn old age.	0
they are making it to the toliet but the clean up wich they do standing up, by the sink leaves, well a mess.	0
all my bathroom rugs are in the wash at the moment and i have used so much bleach this week.	0
i have disposable pads all over every surface they could ever sit on.	0
but i wish i had a pad i could sadly put on the floor ( no slippery plastic side) and just pull up and trash.	0
any ideas gang?	0
and thanks!	0
hi everyone, so my dad had a very severe hemorrhage stroke about 2 years ago, and even to this date, his memory is super bad, have left neglect, cannot move his left hand and arm at all, and cant walk, and cant really control his left leg.	0
ive been helping him do standing exercises to try to strengthen his left leg, but im getting very frustrated and very tired and do not see any hope whatsoever.	0
im constantly very sad whenever i see him zooming out when i talk to him, and never seem to try to stand up straighter or try to learn to do something to improve.. i hate to see him having to live in long term care for the rest of his life.	0
i regret so much for saving him back then, and i cry myself to sleep every other day after coming home from his place.	0
ive been seeing him and caring for his every single day since his stroke 2 years ago, but soon i will be going back to school, and its not possible for me to visit and help him exercise or brush his teeth anymore.	0
im just so tired of this whole situation, does anyone have similar stories that they can share?	0
:(	0
my mother and i work together to take care of my grandma full time.	0
my mom has little to no free time for herself.	0
her self care is nonexistent.	0
with mothers day coming up, i really want to get her something special that will alleviate stress and make her feel relaxed and appreciated.	0
i, of course, considered a massage or a spa day but its hard to get her to leave the house because she is always exhausted from being sleep deprived or has no desire/will to get dressed up to go out.	0
she has a really hard time having any focus or attention on her, which is why i think she deserves this even more.	0
im wondering if theres any products that you, my fellow caregivers, have had purchased for you that made you smile or made your life easier in any way.	0
i realize it may be hard to provide some input on this, but this sub was the first place i thought to turn to.	0
thank you in advance!	0
can anyone help me find a caregiver sub that is not just family caregivers?	0
id really like something specifically pertaining to caregiving as a career.	0
thanks.	0
i took care of my dad for 8 months until it caused me to have a nervous breakdown.	0
my mom stepped in for two months, until she got hurt taking care of him.	0
now i'm back in the same position as before.	0
i'm so fucking depressed.	0
in pain.	0
suicidal thoughts every day.	0
i can't function or even take care of myself.	0
i just can't do it.	0
it's too much work for one person.	0
mom can't help me.	0
siblings won't.	0
turning, moving, and repositioning him multiples times a day leaves my back, knees, and feet screaming in pain by the end of the day.	0
he's covered in some bodily fluid every day.	0
i use the most absorbent diapers i can find and double up on bed pads, but he's still soaked every morning.	0
it's all over him, his sheets, even the floor sometimes.	0
he's yells all day and night due to dementia.	0
he's developing bed sores, despite my best efforts.	0
he's not getting quality care here, because it's too much for a one person.	0
we've started the process of putting him in a nursing home through his hospice social worker, but who knows how long that will take.	0
i need it done asap.	0
i was supposed to move out and start my life and be happy soon.	0
but my plans got put on hold, as usual.	0
i can't just leave, because no one will take care of him.	0
my mom will just get hurt worse trying to care for him.	0
i wish someone could just come and take him so i don't have to live this way another day.	0
but i dont know how to ask for it.	0
im my wifes (late-onset tay-sachs (pretty much under the muscular dystrophy umbrella of debilitating diseases)) caregiver and i feel like im spiraling.	0
i am burnt out, dead tired, mentally exhausted, and emotionally numb.	0
im currently in year 8 since diagnosis and the prognosis is that she will only get worse.	0
slowly and inevitably.	0
i dont know what to do and i feel guilty about even thinking about but its a burden to be blunt.	0
and i would feel bad about passing that along to anyone even if its just temporary.	0
how do you all cope?	0
im lost.	0
im moving out at the end of the month to live with my boyfriend.	0
tbh, it is because taking care of my grandmother is too much.	0
she is primarily self reliant, however my main concern is her eating well and that she can get help if she falls.	0
what should i do in general to get her acclimated?	0
i think im going to call my local office on aging and ask for advice and i think im going to look into meals on wheels, but is there anything else i can do ?	0
"a little backstory: ive posted about my ""mother in law"" about a week ago looking for feedback, more so to vent, it hasn't gotten better as far as her situation... she's starting to smell really bad and she keeps asking for mf coffee but i'm standing my ground."	0
"anywaaayyyyssss, this post reflects more on our convo a few days ago... when i wouldnt bring her a second cup and she told me ""as a caregiver i'm supposed to do what the caregivee wants"" which i know is not true."	0
i've worked as a caregiver in several different companies where ive had to put my foot down on what they wanted me to do.... one lady wanted me to clean her 7 cat litter boxes which i did up until the last few weeks that i said i wouldnt do it anymore, one gentleman wanted me to help him get porn off his phone... and my favorite lady who was bed bound wanted me to get her out of the bed from time to time.	0
i told my mother in law my job is to not do what she wants me to do, it's to encourage her to do the things she can do for herself and that i felt like i was enabling her to not do those things.	0
"she started ""crying"" saying she felt like she was being attacked."	0
she needs some mf psychological help but bc she was a former therapist or whatever she already knows what theyre going to tell her so she wont go get the help she needs.	0
i also suggested physical therapy and she said she is scared.	0
hard eye roll its all bullshit but these are the tactics she uses to get out of doing the things she has to for herself.	0
i feel like as a caregiver i should be sympathetic towards her and for the most part i am but because i am in her house and i see the bullshit she pulls i am less inclined to show it.	0
damn it you guys i feel like a whiny bitch but this shit will be so much better when we are not living in her house.	0
it hasn't even been a month and my dad is back in the hospital.	0
his bp dropped again and he fainted.	0
after his last hospital visit he was supposed to have a follow up with his cardiologist but they scheduled him out to may 25th.	0
his heart is weak and we need to figure something out a little more long term.	0
i was hoping to speak to the cardiologist about possibly getting him on the transplant list.	0
this is so stressful.	0
4th visit of the year and we're only just not beginning the month of may.	0
on the plus side he's fully vaccinated so at least we don't have to worry too much about the virus.	0
weekly rant.	0
i'm tired.	0
it's been a long.	0
hello, all!	0
i've recently moved my mom into assisted living, which takes a significant load off of my shoulders.	0
however, she recently experienced her first fire drill there, and long story short, the ear shattering noise added extra stress which put her into a fib.	0
we asked if they could give us a heads up before fire drills so she could get out of the building, but it looks like that isn't going to happen.	0
what can we use to block out the noise other than ear plugs?	0
she really doesn't mind if she can hear it, but it's so loud that she'd like to avoid feeling like she is at a club.	0
i'd love your tips.	0
thanks!	0
im an around the clock caregiver for my dad.	0
my (22 no degree, quit my retail job due to covid) dad (52) has been in the hospital in and out all year, and now hes at the point i have to be home all day for him.	0
essentially the problem is i need to make money.	0
have yall found any luck or ideas of jobs or freelancing skills that work well in a situation like mine when our schedule is a bit unpredictable but i usually can accumulate several hours of downtime in my 24 hours  any ideas?	0
or success stories or failure stories?	0
i think this headline says it all, but i've been told of late i need to speak more openly about things but when i do people look at me like cockeyed and it yields nothing.	0
if i had kids to be oh blah blah blah.	0
can you tell who's been in lots of zoom meetings with coworkers recently?	0
so i'm 8 months pregnant and experiencing vertigo.	0
apparently, this isn't uncommon.	0
what's also not uncommon is my grandmother just randomly deciding she's not going to use her walker anymore.	0
i've stayed on top of her about it forever, but once that led to us just being bickery all the time, i gave it up.	0
i can't control every single movement she makes.	0
so fast forward to today and the vertigo is awful.	0
i have fluid on my ears from allergies and i'm exhausted from a week of travel (medically necessary) for my daughter.	0
in walks grandma, no walker.	0
"""granny, don't forget your walker!"	0
"with my vertigo, we'd both be on the floor until the handsome squad (our pet name for the firefighters) shows up."""	0
"""well if i fall you can just put me in a home!"	0
you think i should be anyway since that's what you want.	0
"i bet you'd be happy then!"""	0
so i asked her why she said such a thing, because the only conversations we've had about a home are if she gets to the point of being completely wheelchair ridden, or if the dementia-like symptoms that accompany parkinson's makes her aggressive to the point that she's risky around my kids.	0
forgive me if this type of post isnt welcomed here, but im at a loss, and i would be so grateful for suggestions for meaningful gifts i could get her...im not nor have ever been a caregiver myself; i dont want to make assumptions for a situation i have never experienced.	0
my step-dad has been living with stage 4 renal cancer for over 10 years.	0
the last two years havent been kind to us (covid aside), and this current scare (hes currently in the icu with sepsis shock, but stable) and my poor mom has literally been running on 2-3 hours a sleep/night if shes lucky.	0
when or if youve ever found yourselves in the middle of these horrifying scenarios as a primary caregiver, what type of comfort did you yearn for?	0
do you remember craving anything?	0
do you remember a gift or a favor someone did for you that really meant a lot to you or that you actually found useful?	0
i know these are kind of odd questions, but like i said before, i just want them to be meaningful and useful by providing even the littlest bit of comfort.	0
she cannot use bath bombs or other scented bubble bath/luxury soaks.	0
not a big fan of candles, but coming around.	0
she also has a westie - her little sidekick.	0
thank you so much if youve taken the time to read until the very end, and for allowing me to seek advice from your community.	0
i have so much respect and compassion for the work you do.	0
title, it sucks but i'm being forced into the position (no i dont have any options it's not my place of living, i'm stuck here as i'm disabled and can't work) any products, reccomendations, tips and tricks are welcome.	0
she fell and broke her hip, now is pretty much in bed/chairs only, yay.	0
so i'll be cleaning, bathing and feeding her.	0
will get a portable doorbell so she can wake me up at night, i need to get senior lights as her cognitive abilities are diminishing, she has gastritis so half of food makes her get diarrhea everywhere so i don't know if she needs plastic sheets, she'll be using a portable toilet as she wont be able to make it to the bathroom and a walker to walk.	0
miserable times ahead of me.	0
hi all, i'm lost and hope some of you may know how to begin approaching this... four years ago i moved abroad, where i met and married my husband.	0
i still live abroad as we get paperwork in order for my husband's visa.	0
it takes about a year and he can't travel to the u.s. during processing.	0
at the time i left, my older sister was disabled and being cared for by our mother, who was taking over as caregiver from me after i'd done it for ten years.	0
sister has autoimmune disorder, takes a lot of pain meds as a result, and has some mental health issues that cause her to be angry and, well, just mean.	0
really spiteful.	0
she can no longer wash herself, she often refuses to go to health appointments, etc.	0
she needs things done a certain way or they aren't good enough, refuses to schedule or be responsible for her own healthcare, yadda yadda.	0
a few weeks ago my 65 y.o.	0
mother contracted covid at work (she's a nurse).	0
she tried to convalesce at home, got worse, and has been hospitalized for 2 weeks now.	0
i was trying to avoid coming back because of covid restrictions on travel, and honestly because i have a lot of jarring emotional pain from dealing with my sister.	0
my mom, when she was cognizant, had also told me to please not come because it's dangerous, i can't come visit her in the covid unit anyway, etc.	0
the thought of returning really did a number on me, but eventually i couldn't avoid it.	0
mom is still in hospital, and sister refused to use meal/grocery delivery services even if i offer to do it from abroad, laid a heavy guilt trip about the cats suffering because she can't care for them, decried the state of the house, etc.	0
a neighbor brought food for her but it wasn't what she normally eats so she refused to eat it.	0
sis also swears she has covid too.	0
"when i said i'd stay at a hotel instead of at the house  she told me i'm ""overthinking this covid stuff"" and that she's somehow simultaneously dying from it yet not contagious to me so i should get over myself."	0
i arrived last night, tried to quickly get her a meal and clean up the worst of things while internally i was freaking out about getting covid with no health insurance here and being refused entry to go back home if i test positive for the mandatory preflight covid test.	0
i wore a mask and gloves, but my sister refused to even after i brought a mask for her...told me her cough was that she swallowed a cookie wrong.	0
my mother may not recover.	0
she's been unable to eat for weeks, has made no signs of recovery, just maintains at the edge of needing a ventilator.	0
my aunt is telling me to prepare for the worst.	0
i'm dealing with the emotions of that realization on top of the sister baggage.	0
last time mom was able to rasp out a phone call, she was confused and very very emotional, and asked me to help set up social security for her because she didn't think she could bounce back from this even if she recovered enough to go home.	0
she cried and told me she can't handle taking care of my sister any more.	0
she hates that someone has to help her go to the bathroom, she's on ativan to keep her calm...just all a big mess.	0
i'm worried covid is bringing out some beginning signs of dementia, something my sister often attacks my mom with, that she's senile.	0
i'm lost.	0
cried out and feeling hollow.	0
recently my husband and i had talked about starting a family before it was too late (i'm 36), and now i'm dealing with the realization that i may be responsible for the care of two disabled family members...or one and the death of my mother.	0
feels like my chance at a normal life has been flushed down the toilet, and i'm so guilty for bringing this family trouble into my marriage with a normal guy whose parents and siblings are all spry and mentally sound.	0
i have no current income to cover mom and sister, used my last savings just to make this trip.	0
i had quit teaching english when covid started and had been planning to start working again when we moved to the u.s. the most pressing concern is that i have to return abroad in 2 weeks (my spouse visa has to be renewed), and i don't know how to get any kind of care set up for my mom and sister during the time i have here.	0
sister has medicaid (if she hasn't been dropped for being noncompliant) and mom has basic insurance from work, but she took out all of her retirement money four years ago to help my sister with debt and...honestly i don't know where it all went, but her retirement is gone.	0
the house is in a state.	0
looks like a hoarder lives there, and my sister just has piles of garbage around her that she says she hasn't had the energy to throw away.	0
i have to get it cleaned up so that a home health worker would even be able to walk around.	0
hopefully without getting sick myself while i try to do it.	0
i also need to give my sister a home covid test.	0
sister refuses to go out and have one.	0
as evidenced by this crazy long, nonsensical, and ridiculously personal post, i'm a little emotionally compromised at the moment and i don't know where to start.	0
"my mother's family are all feeding me lines that basically equate to ""glad you're back, you're so strong and brave, let us know if you need something, but you know, not really."""	0
i have no father to give me any direction or advice.	0
i feel like a little lost kid and i don't know what step 1 is.	0
any ideas about resources, how to start, anything would be so helpful.	0
hi ive been reading these posts and i see im not the only one.	0
i take care of my dad, hes 94 and lives next door.	0
me and my brother are the only ones left.	0
im 51 hes 54. hes poa and takes care of the financial end and does the shopping.	0
hes got a full time job, so do i but i own a construction company so i have more flexibility.	0
i do the day to day stuff.	0
its sucking the life out of me and i cant say anything to anybody.	0
the minute i complain about a 3am phone call, my wife gets on the hating him and my brother bandwagon.	0
you shouldnt have to deal, your brother needs to do more, he has life alert, you should take his phone away etc.	0
etc.	0
it exhausting but at the same time i want to take care of him and be there for him.	0
i really dont mind but sometimes it gets overwhelming and just putting this out there relieves a little pressure.	0
so my mother in law is (aprx.)	0
47 and can't care for herself.	0
my fiance, the good man that he is, wants so badly to take care of her and help her but we just mentally and financially are not able to.	0
his mom has been diagnosed with ptsd,depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, some kind of heart problem,and fibro...along with other various problems such as chronic stomach ulcers and vision issues.	0
she continues to work despite her doctors telling her not to because shes convinced she cant quit because theyre low staff and she needs to make money.	0
she lives with her abusive mother,this woman literally sold her as a child and continues to verbally attack her every second of the day.	0
she cooks,cleans,takes her to the doctors, and lets the woman control her life despite it only making her worse.	0
she makes her use all her food stamps to buy only the food she wants.	0
like literally she has to get the exact same thing everytime or she freaks out.	0
all of her other siblings have straight told her its on her to take care of her mom because they hate her... her own brother, the fucking scum bag, scammed her out of $500 and refuses to pay her back to get her hair done but then told her he was gonna help her with her bills.which she had already paid,leaving her with 161 dollars for savings and to live off of for two weeks...also hes told my fiance hes recently sold a house and got them monster jam tickets.	0
to top this all off, shes been hallucinating for months and took herself off her anti-depressants cold turkey a few weeks ago.	0
shes drinking again,or somthing of that lines,despite swearing shes been sober for months.	0
"she literally admitted to us to taking ""some kind of liquid"" that fucked her up so bad she forgot she was on the phone with us.shes going down a slipperly slope that were pretty sure will lead to her killing herself over the phone with us or her getting raped for easily the 5th time in her life."	0
i literally have a panic attack everytime she calls now.	0
when she does anything, other than sit in my room, i worry because shes so so so self distructive and socially incappable of keeping herself safe.	0
she also suspects her abusive ex boyfriend(who she picked up after being cheated on by her mentally abusive husband) is now stalking her and picking the locks to her car.	0
& for once, i dont think shes just paranoid.	0
i've been smart about this, as smart as i can be with having no clue as to what i'm doing.	0
i've recorded phone calls of her telling us all these things and plan to take it to aps.	0
however, i dont want to start a fuss if they have nothing to go on.	0
i'm going to call them tomorrow, and see how much of a case i have built or what i'd need to build one.	0
i have no clue what they do really, and that scares the shit out of me, however i dont know who else to call.	0
she is an impulsive liar so this could just be for attention, however i've seen enough as a by standard to believe just about all of it.	0
has anyone else had to do something similar?	0
peferably specifically in indiana however just in the usa will be helpful!	0
thanks so much in advance, hopefullly youll see more of me & better things ahead!	0
hi, im not sure where to post, really.	0
my (41f) grandmother is 95 and we have always been very close.	0
my uncle has a mother in law suite and had her move in with him about 10 years ago, which was awesome because they both had plenty of space & did their own thing.	0
i live out of state & visit 1-2x a year & call weekly.	0
always been super independent, but after 90 she started to decline, understandably.	0
fast forward to march of this year and she fell a couple of times/is now bedridden with increasing dementia & needs 24hr care.	0
her staff is amazing, and one lady encouraged me to visit sooner than later in the summer.	0
so i flew over that weekend and was taken aback by how shes doing.	0
i asked her workers to let me help them bc im family and god knows my grandma has always helped people in her life.	0
but i cant get the changing adult diapers, especially out of my head.	0
she is so tired and wants to sleep, but obviously staying clean and dry are essential when shes forced to lie on her back 24/7.	0
it hurt her and she kept crying out for jesus to help her.	0
i was right there, and these women were all being as gentle as possible, but shes getting spots on her bottom that are incredibly painful and she has no choice but to lay there and comply all day every day.	0
it hurts my soul, and i have literally been praying for her to pass so shes not stuck in this miserable life anymore.	0
i was with my mom (her daughter) when she was removed from life support, and the visit is bringing some of that back.	0
the thing is mom was so clear that she never wanted to be unable to care for herself and once that was confirmed by doctors i had no choice but to honor her wishes.	0
my grandma doesnt have that option and it kills me.	0
i have started calling daily, but find myself at a loss for words.	0
what do i say??	0
our old conversations fall flat.	0
what are you doing/is the weather nice/whats been going on? .	0
she told me years ago that after our papaw died she made up her mind to stay around for us grandkids.	0
tonight i asked her how shes feeling and she sounded dejected, half lucid.	0
you know, i lay here and look at this celing and fan.	0
i dont know how to pretend like everything is ok anymore.	0
everybody tries to be cheerful but i want to tell her its ok to let go.	0
please let go.	0
sorry this is so long.	0
im just heartbroken and hate being so awkward now.	0
also, to you caregiversi used to do personal care services for adults and kids with dd.	0
this experience was so eye opening as far as the physical and mental work you all do.	0
sending you all a lot of love.	0
hello, im not sure where to post this but i feel really stuck right now.	0
i (m20) have a boyfriend (m21, ill call him b) whose mother had a stroke 3 years ago and recovered and last february had a major stroke that left her half paralyzed, aphasia, diabetes 2, and constricted blood vessels i believe due to her life time smoking and poor general health.	0
my boyfriends family is lower income and are on medicaid.	0
she was kept in the hospital for about a month and right before covid was put into a hospital rehab center.	0
medicaid stopped covering that in about june and she was transported to their house and has pretty much been stuck in her hospital bed and wheelchair since then.	0
my boyfriend (and sometimes his older brother and girlfriend) feeds his mom, changes her diaper and takes care of her medications and general health.	0
my boyfriends dad is half deaf, heart disease, a bad hip that never got fixed and i believe is on the spectrum.	0
he is emotionally manipulative/abusive towards my boyfriend and treats him like he is no longer his son, but a caretaker for his mother.	0
his dad also has hoarding tendencies and as a result his family has 9 cats that were strays and destroy the house and his dad fills the house with tons of random things and kicks and screams when b tries to clean up.	0
they had a nurse come in june that was supposed to visit every few days to check on his mom but she left and told her supervisor the house was too messy and smelled like cat pee for her to help.	0
ive also only gone to his house once after wed been dating for a year and a half and couldnt stand the smell.	0
b tries to keep up with it but its a lot on top of his mom, 9 cats and his job.	0
i come from a big family and my father commit suicide in july; b stayed with me for 3 days and his dad kept texting him things like you dont love your mommy you dont care about her you need to come home, he also speaks to him like this on the regular when im on the phone or over text, usually with obscenities mixed in.	0
bs job closed down in january and when he found a new one, 20 mins away- his dad got pissed because thats too far.	0
b also visits my house once a week and his dad gets mad at him for leaving the house.	0
things have started to get worse.	0
the houses in bs town are rented out by the church for some reason; his neighbor of 20 years got a 1 month eviction notice in feb and b found out through a friend of the mayor that the mayor wants to evict the whole block and build new apartments.	0
b is unsure of when hell be getting evicted.	0
my family has always had an open door policy for him to move in and i would love him to.	0
on top of that, his new job is a lot more demanding and his mother isnt getting any better at all.	0
shes still paralyzed on one side, aphasia with mostly babbling but some talk.	0
a nurse visits once a month but thats the only care shes receiving.	0
bs mental health is declining and its killing me watching this happen.	0
his job has a place near me that i think they could relocate him to and ill be going to community college this fall because my university is still mostly going to be closed.	0
we just dont know what to do with his parents.	0
we were thinking of a nursing home through medicaid but i heard that can take months to even get through.	0
we dont know who to contact about maybe a consultation for his mom because things arent looking like shell ever live a normal life again and his father definitely needs some sort of care.	0
im sorry for the long post but i genuinely feel lost and i cant watch him suffer any more than he has.	0
i'm 24f and was my dad's full-time caregiver for 1 years.	0
he requires complete around-the-clock care.	0
my mom was his caregiver previously, until she got hurt.	0
that year was rough on my mental health, to say the least.	0
i was incredibly depressed and burned out by the 6-months mark.	0
aside from a drive to a doctor's appointment here and there, i had no help from my older two siblings during this time.	0
home health cam a few times each week, but only for wound care.	0
well, it ended up taking such a toll on me mentally that i had a nervous breakdown and couldn't do it anymore.	0
mom was recovered enough that she could take care of him again, so she stepped back in.	0
i was finally free for a time and could focus on my life.	0
i made plans to move in with my partner.	0
i made plans to go back to school.	0
it felt like my life was in my hands again.	0
well, mom got hurt again after two months of caring for him.	0
now, i'm stuck in the same position.	0
luckily, he is on hospice now.	0
mom finally agreed to put him in a nursing home (only after she got hurt twice...), which is good.	0
except, who knows how long the process will take, especially with covid happening.	0
we've done the paperwork with his social worker, but they haven't been able to give us a time fram of how long it will take.	0
i had plans to move this month and start my life.	0
i'm devastated.	0
i don't know how i can prepare for my move and take care of him on top of it.	0
i'm so terrified that this will interfere with my plans, and i don't know what to do.	0
dear reddit, i (f) am having trouble getting my grandmother (97) to do or tolerate much of anything, even for her wellbeing.	0
she is remarkably healthy for her age and strangers regularly comment on how young she looks.	0
her only physical hindrances are a pinched sciatic nerve (it's genetic) that she takes aspirin for and hearing loss.	0
i believe she may be in the beginning stages of alzheimer's, but she has been playing at frail-old-ditzy-lady 50+ years and its hard to tell.	0
"lots of ""gotcha!"""	0
moments that make me question if she really is hard of hearing.	0
she plays it up when she gets upset and i have to use text to speach in those cases.	0
the last time she went to the doctor he said she was fine and shoved an oxy prescription in her hand.	0
we were not impressed.	0
she's also stubborn and can be quite mean, always has been always will be.	0
it takes days of nagging and begging to get her in the tub to wash for which she refuses help and rips out any railing i install.	0
she won't cleanse herself at all without some repeated prompting.	0
i can only wish she would change clothing or wear her depends as i end up cleaning her chair often.	0
plagued by eczema, she scratches herself bloody raw and scrapes the very expensive cream off that i apply almost immediately.	0
she won't let me clean the house, and i spend most late nights dusting and thowing away stacks and stacks of old broken junk that she values above all else.	0
she flails and screams if anyone tries to make her do anything especially if it involves leaving the house.	0
all she really wants is to sit in her chair, read, and play her crosswords.	0
just got her second shot yesterday and lets just say she fought us so hard that now i know she is not full of just hot air... once she was clean and dressed she transformed into mild mannered grammy and went quietly to the car, talked and laughed with those in line, and even had fun with my aunt and i on our little country drive.	0
like it never happened.	0
she has always been an odd duck, but she's done this for the last two years.	0
i'm exhaused!	0
i'd love to have a nurse or somthing come in to help, but i have a feeling that will go over like a lead balloon.	0
we don't have the money to send her to a good care facility thanks to her embezzeling pastor, and there is no way i'm just handing her off to any old place.	0
is this anxiety?	0
desperately need advice!	0
tl;dr: my grandma won't work with me and if this goes on i might get charged with neglect	0
hey guys, i wanted to know how can i report a care taker?	0
the care taker i want to report is my sisters ex boyfriend.	0
my sister has spina bifida and she asked him to be her care taker to which he happily agreed due to the fact he has a criminal background and was to lazy to look for a job.	0
for years i have had to see her getting mistreated by him.	0
he doesnt clean their place, he doesnt help her shower or motivate her to shower, all he does is play videos games all day (he is 31 years old), my sister made around 15k in a lawsuit against a company and she used it on him and bought him a car, he calls her names and shames her body, all he does is order take out or makes my sister order him food with her money, he leaves her alone for a good amount of time to hang out with his ex girlfriend, he doesnt pay attention to her and ignores or on purpose and she has been having negative thoughts yet she wont leave him   he makes my sister pay for their groceries also which by the way is all junk food he likes and since my sister has stayed with him she has been diagnosed as obese but he doesnt try to help her.	0
backstory: my grandpa is 83. he had a stroke over 30 years ago that left him disabled.	0
since the late 80s hes chosen to be home bound.	0
he hates shopping, crowds, getting in the car etc.	0
he will only go to doctor or dentist but nowhere else.	0
he is very out of touch with...everything lol.	0
so this morning hes frustrated with his cable.	0
he wants to watch a specific show but he wants the option to pause it for bathroom breaks and fast forward through commercials.	0
i explain his cable package doesnt provide that.	0
he doesnt have or want to pay for the dvr function.	0
i spent an entire hour going over his tv functions.	0
showing him every possible way he could watch a specific movie or show.	0
he either has to pay to rent, pay for the dvr function, or wait days in order to get it for free.	0
so that brought us to the topic of streaming services.	0
he wants what my husband and i watch (netflix/hulu/sling) but it wants it on his cable  ??	0
he was so confused.	0
he doesnt understand the internet period.	0
has never even had an email address or cell phone.	0
its like explaining these things to a 2 year old.	0
he just has no grasp on how the world works anymore.	0
so now hes frustrated.	0
he thinks im pulling the wool over his eyes.	0
he wants me to preform a miracle but its just not possible unless he forks up the money to his cable company.	0
he does this with a lot of things actually.	0
he still thinks the world runs as it did before he had a stroke, when things were a little more simple/cheap.	0
sigh.	0
its just hard.	0
the generational gap in our home is so large.	0
he thinks we lie but things are much more complex then he can understand anymore :/	0
hello.	0
a very urgent and very bad situation is unfolding at a snf rehab.	0
my father has been in this unit for almost 3 weeks now.	0
he will be going home with more needs than before.	0
he has a medicaid waiver that gives his family member 26 paid hours a week as it stands.	0
the rehab's social worker says that he needs more hours than that in order to be granted a discharge.	0
fair enough.	0
problem is, she is very adamant that 24 hours a day is the only solution.	0
that'd be 168 paid hours a week.	0
she's nuts if she thinks the waiver people will grant us anything close to that.	0
the lady will not come down on that demand though.	0
i know she won't be happy with whatever new hours we secure soon.	0
and my father has been endlessly sitting in there growing very upset.	0
what should i do?	0
does anyone happen to know the reprocussions of a discharge ama (against medical advice)?	0
by the way i don't think my father needs 24 hour care.	0
half that, sure, but not that amount.	0
he knows who he is, is mostly competent, etc.	0
how do i stand up to this lady's death grip on our discharge without risking our waiver, our legal status if he does get hurt unsupervised, etc.?	0
thanks.	0
i'm not sure if i belong here with all the stories i am reading but i'm not sure what group i directly fall into.	0
i am a 22 f caregiver to a 20 m with severe autism, tourettes, & ocd.	0
i have been a caregiver for a few months and i mostly enjoy it however lately i am having the hardest time with his screaming.	0
he screams a lot.	0
in my face, to repeat song lyrics, or just phrases.	0
at first i could deal with this but being young my ears are particularly good and the fact that i have ptsd and sensitivity to loud sounds isn't helping.	0
i'm developing ear pain, migraines, loss of balance, and jumpyness at home long after i leave the job.	0
"i know he can not control these things so i try not to tell him to "" be quiet"" as it's not very productive."	0
my boyfriend really wants me to wear headphones but i'm greatly scared of offending his parents who are there all the time.	0
do you think they would  get offended or question my reliability if i started showing up with clunky big earphones to work?	0
does anyone have any advice or input?	0

ive been my moms caregiver for almost 7 years, since we lost my dad.	0
tonight i had to leave her at the same hospital, on the same freaking floor that my dad died on.	0
due to covid changes, family is not allowed to stay in hospital after 8pm- the look i got leaving @ 2am broke my heart!	0
she isnt used to being away from me, the last time she was in the same hospital 5 years ago, i spent day & night there- for two weeks i only came back home to shower & feed my dog... i feel terrible for not being able to stay, and i have no control of it :-(  my mind says i can do nothing, rules are rules but my heart says f that, shes old & scared and these new rules suck!	0
damn it all to hell!	0
ex husband's ,(my deceased ex) best friend mom.	0
80f now needs round the clock care 300# plus can't use arms well on her own.	0
4th to last male child's wife is reluctant unpaid caregiver.	0
home health newly involved.	0
i as an sn instructed friend than he needs to ask for more hha though they are only temporary and only if she can show improvement and historicaly as a nurse and knowing her prior hx i do not see medicare continued need.	0
her daughter in law is trying so hard but cg fatigue is creeping up.	0
any suggestions to get the 4 other kids scattered around wash state plus me a 5th involved, why do caucasians wait till last second to ask for help?????	0
he is working on medicaid for her incont supplies.	0
snf did not send her home with hosp bed or hoyer lift.	0
i told him to ask for msw.	0
i told him to ask for hha at least 2x weekly for a few weeks.	0
i told him home health is not forever and that she needs to show improvement to continue as it is to teach caregivers how to safely assist.	0
suggested some nice assisted living in eastern wash. i am sad the other 4 kids i know very well have not stepped up.	0
people are just......	0
mom got hurt and i'm moving very soon, so i'm not sure what will happen in regards to dad's care.	0
he is on hospice and they will be here later this week to discuss nursing home arrangements.	0
how long does this process typically take (especially since he is not yet covid vaccinated)?	0
wondering if anyone out there might have any suggestions for us?	0
my mother is a very physically healthy and active 71 year old but is also very much in the grips of moderate dementia.	0
she needs 24/7 supervision.	0
she used to be easy to take care of but because of the closures of her day program, she has been acting out and making life very difficult for us for the past year.	0
as the future of this pandemic is still up-in-the-air with no definite timeline, and no indication of when her day program or any other supports will open again  we are now considering if it is time to put her in a home.	0
but our options seem so limited.	0
i feel like we only have 2 basic options and neither suit us well:  1) continue to keep her home.	0
use the 20 hours-a-month caregiver respite + scrounge around for any private home care we can find and just try and hang on until the pandemic is over.	0
pro: maybe it's just a matter of waiting until summer??	0
con: we are so very tired of this and really are facing caregiver burnout.	0
2) go in to crisis and get her into a home.	0
pro: we can finally live some sort of life again.	0
con: correct me if i'm wrong, but going into crisis would mean that she goes into any nursing home they can find.	0
we are on the waiting list for several good homes but my understanding is that she will not get into them for many years due to waitlists.	0
so in order to get into a home at all, we will need to go into crisis.	0
another problem is that she needs stimulation.	0
this is the root of the problem.	0
she needs specific dementia care.	0
which requires a lot of attention and some sort of social activity.	0
i don't think these are things you get at a nursing home.	0
in fact, my experience is that they basically just lock them in a room and give them the basic necessities of food, shower, etc.	0
-- she is not ready for that.	0
in fact, i'm certain it would make things worse.	0
how can we get her into a home that gives her dementia care?	0
i remember the alzheimer's society mentioned a temporary respite place called nora's house.	0
this sounded amazing to us but it, too, has been closed since last year with no sign of re-opening.	0
open to ideas or any information anyone has.	0
thank you.	0
weve never waited for more than two hours.	0
yesterday we waited five hours to be seen.	0
two accidents and an emergency birth plus it was a monday .	0
all went well though and got medication for gout and the cellulitis.	0
other than that hes been doing well.	0
my elderly relative and i are now fully vaccinated and my hope was to get them back in the world and seeing their friends for dinner or lunch.	0
but the day just burns up like a match flame.	0
every bowl of cereal takes an hour to eat, every time they sit on the toilet its an ordeal taking of pants shoes underwear.	0
the nighttime routine brushing teeth, flossing teeth eye drops, changing sock is an hour and a half.	0
meals are sliding later and later in the day sometimes are right on top of each other.	0
a shower can only happen at most twice per week because it takes two hours and completely wipes them out.	0
i set up everything, medication, meals, clothing, anything they need to keep them on a schedule but it's just in slow motion.	0
how do your days go?	0
have you found things to become more efficient?	0
things that make the day go smoothly?	0
try the cdpap program by family always first home care to encourage the seniors to look after their health.	0
our program allows people to manage the caregivers on their own.	0
im married to my wife of 46 years.	0
several years ago she was diagnosed as bipolar, with severe depression.	0
next was a diagnosis of ra followed by a diagnosis of lupus.	0
she has been, for all practical purposes, disabled for 8 years or so.	0
i have been her caregiver during this time only retiring in the summer of 2020. since then i am with her 24/7.	0
dont get me wrong, i married her for better or worse, and refuse to contemplate abandonment.	0
other than seeing to her medications, she doesnt require assistance of a medical nature, except for bathing which i take care of.	0
however the daily home functions are my responsibility.	0
cooking, cleaning, washing, etc.	0
she informed me several years ago that she was through with sex (its been 8+ years) which i had already assumed as fact.	0
and, while i do miss that aspect of our relationship, its the other things i miss most, the hugs, kisses, walks, etc.	0
its the intimacy thats no longer there.	0
we live in a very rural, isolated area, which we both dearly love, but the opportunity to interact with others is a real downer.	0
before retiring i did find some sympathetic ears with two of my coworkers, but now i no longer have that and it kind of all bottles up.	0
i found some release in the bottle for a few years, only giving up the hard stuff a few months ago.	0
itd be easy to pick it up again but she begged me to quit.	0
cant quite seem to quit the smokes though.	0
guess thats a work in progress.	0
i spend the majority of my day outside, going in from time to time to check and see if she needs anything.	0
ive visited adult websites and viewed more than my share of porn, but it seems so stale and i guess ive become desensitized to its excitement factor.	0
hell im not sure what im looking for.	0
maybe someone to discuss life in general with.	0
you know, choices made, regrets, accomplishments, etc.	0
im not wanting sympathy and im sorry if it sounds like ive been crying.	0
im just venting i guess.	0
it does feel better to put this out there though.	0
if youre going through something similar id love to hear from you.	0
perhaps we can find some sort of mutual support.	0
anyway, thanks for listening.	0
i was dad's full-time caregiver for 8 months, until it caused such severe burnout that i had a mental breakdown.	0
then, mom stepped back in to become his caregiver (two months ago).	0
well, mom got hurt taking care of him, so i'm caregiver again.	0
he is on hospice this time around, but they only come out like 2x each week (mostly just for a quick change and a bath).	0
he requires constant around-the-clock care, and i already feel the burnout setting back in.	0
what's worse, is this coming month is extremely important for me, as i'm supposed to be moving out... but i can't even prepare for that while taking care of him.	0
we've started the process with hospice to find him a care home.	0
however, they won't be here until later this week.	0
i'm supposed to get my second covid shot next week, which i can't miss.	0
nor can i take care of him afterwards, because i don't know how it will affect me (extreme drowsiness is extremely common after the 2nd dose).	0
but if i can't take care of him, who will?	0
i'm just so worried and have no idea what else to do.	0
what do y'all think?	0
i am currently caregiving for my overweight mother-in-law.	0
she is a former psychologist former workout instructor and a retired teacher.	0
she attempts to manipulate me psychologically but now that i know how she is and we're so who she is i don't let her.	0
i'm just starting to not let her manipulate me.	0
today was actually my first day.	0
because typically i'll just do whatever she wants she is not that bound and she's unable to move without a walker she can do all the things that she needs to do for herself like cook hand wash laundry and bathe herself but yet she refuses to.	0
i am just starting to push for her to bathe herself on a regular basis i gave her a sponge bath yesterday and today she was supposed to shower herself and she is refusing me straight up just saying nope not going to do it.	0
there is nothing i can say after that i feel like i have given her the okay well it's because i'm your caregiver because i care about you because this is healthy for you.	0
yes she is still refusing me i can't make someone do anything so she refuses me i think that's the bottom line that's it i can't make her do what she knows she's doing well i know she has to do.	0
my sister-in-law however thinks it is my job they said i am the one who should make her shower but if she refuses me there is nothing i can do as a certified caregiver i can't make anyone do anything.	0
i am also staying in this house so i am using her water washing my clothes using her laundry detergent using her electricity so the lines become crossed at some point like i am using her so she can use me but now i am putting my foot down i am doing the caregiver role not the servant roll not the housekeeper roll i get it she can't sweep and mop the floors easily i will do that that is my job i get it she can't get food out of the fridge easily i will do that that is my job but she can put her food on a plate she's been doing it way before i got here.	0
and she can make herself a cup of coffee.	0
i don't even know why she's making the coffee thing such a big deal i get it she's a coffee drinker and so am i but i'm the one who clean the coffee maker i'm the one who started making coffee every day i'm the one who even got the coffee maker clean to begin with because before i got here it was collecting dust and dirt and grime.	0
anyways, this is more of a vent post but any comments are appreciated i'm having a really hard time we are moving out very soon we just got it an apartment and waiting for the landlord to clean it up for us to move into it to make sure the previous tenants did not break anything and get it move in ready.	0
idk she just tries to manipulate me and for the longest time it worked.	0
she was her cry if i gave her logical reasons why i wasn't going to do something and then i would just do it so she would stop crying.	0
she thinks she's good at manipulation and i was a sucker at the beginning but now that i see how she is and know how she is i'm not going to fall for it anymore she's even said i can do all of this stuff it just hurts.	0
and i get that it's difficult to get in and out of the shower.	0
but i have to start doing my part to take care of her better i have to be more convincing as to where i go with this.	0
hi everyone.. im a bit new to this subreddit.	0
i just want to thank everyone who has sacrifice a great portion of your lives to take care of your loves ones.	0
its not an easy thing.. ive been a caregiver for almost 9 years and sometimes i feel like i will break, but truly has given me the strength to continue to do his work.	0
i pray that he will bless you all and continue to strengthen you who struggle.	0
thank you so much	0
my 80 year old father has dementia and while it's not super terrible, it's getting pretty bad.	0
i'm having to pay all his bills for him and have him just sign the checks, and that's been okay for a while but now he's forgetting how to sign his name.	0
i'm not on any of his accounts so it's getting a bit scary as once he slips beyond a certain point we'll both be kinda screwed.	0
he's always been very proud and private.	0
no one ever knew how he was doing financially as he never talked about money, not even his income.	0
i'm the first person to ever have access to his checking account via online banking.	0
he doesn't like people messing with his stuff.	0
he won't pay bills online as he doesn't trust it, etc.	0
he also doesn't seem to think there's anything wrong with him.	0
not when he forgets my name, or how to make his signature, or how to turn off the stove.	0
not when he can't remember how to turn on the tv, or where the shampoo is in the shower, or how to put on underwear.	0
i really need to get a poa from him before it's too late because i heard getting guardianship is a much longer/harder process.	0
i'm just worried he'll shoot it down the second the request leaves my mouth due to his pride, independence, privacy, and denial.	0
anyone have any success in getting a poa from a loved one in this situation?	0
any tips for me on how to approach it with him?	0
hi!	0
my niece took our car, and it had moms lift belt in it.	0
i cannot get it back.	0
i used the belt to help my mom in and out of cars (from a car seat to her walker or chair).	0
can anyone recommend a replacement that i can order from amazon?	0
also, mom is having a harder time getting out of her shower chair.	0
even with wall handles.	0
i have the chair at its maximum height setting, so im wondering how to get better traction for her feet.	0
she hates the bath traction strips i put down and insists on having a towel under her feet which is too dangerous.	0
she can only hoist herself up, just barely, from the right side.	0
any slippers or other devices you can recommend would be helpful.	0
we have a walk-in shower but im starting to wonder how many more weeks it will be practical for her.	0
she can get into the shower fine.	0
getting out is dicey.	0
im not sure if this is the right place to post this, but im 21f starting a new job as an in-home caregiver to the elderly.	0
i dont want this to be a job that i half-ass for better benefits than my fast food job.	0
i would genuinely like to be a good caregiver to my patients & make their home life more enjoyable & easy.	0
my problem is that im brand new to this type of work - my new employer is aware & is putting me through training of course.	0
but if anyone who is a caregiver has any tips for the difficult parts, id be really happy to hear them.	0
for the most part i am a companion, not a nurse.	0
but im nervous & dont want to mess up, like i said i would really like this to be a job i can do well & help make others comfortable in.	0
here is my issue: i have been taking care of my mother since about 2010, and a bit from 08-09. i also took care of her when i was a little kid.	0
i've been living with her since 2015 in a small apartment that is very, very, small.	0
in 2009 she had cancer and wanted to make sure everything was taken care of and she signed a power of attorney making me her poa.	0
luckily i can't remember a time when i needed to invoke it except once at housing court when she was in the hospital and couldn't make it to court.	0
over the last 2-4 years she has been making large purchases without speaking with me.	0
i do a budget at the beginning of the month and i ask that she loosely stick to it and if either of us wanted to make a large purchase we would discuss it as one of us spending a lot of money effects the other person's finances.	0
i have been trying to keep her on a budget for years but she buys shit she doesn't need, she buys from scam sites, she makes mistakes in ordering, i could go on and on.	0
she has her own checking account.	0
we are both on disability, she get's more than i do yet every month on cue she is broke by week 2-3 and i get to pay for everything for her.	0
her food, her medicine, her medical bills, her transportation, i could keep going on.	0
she ignores any financial advice i give and promises to stick to our budget then never does.	0
i believe a promise is a promise.	0
she makes these promises and doesn't stick to them or follow through with them.	0
she got upset tonight because i told her that her word meant nothing to me because she can't agree to things she promised she would do as agreed upon by both of us.	0
my question is: is it time to invoke the poa and take over all her finances?	0
i feel like it's kind of a scorched earth policy if i do that but it may be time.	0
i had her evaluated by a neuropsychologist and she said my mother's iq is 71, just one point from making her mentally challenged.	0
i don't want to have to take away what little financial freedom she has but every month it effects my bank account as i have to pay for/cover everything after she runs out of money.	0
i spend hours a week taking care of her and have never even considered being financially compensated, it was just a labor of love and i know no one can take care of her better than i can.	0
i just want us both to be happy and right now one of us is always unhappy and most of the time it is me.	0
she's only 52 so she will probably fight me tooth and nail if i tried to take over her finances but she doesn't give a shit about money, if she thinks she might need it she will buy it.	0
i don't want to get hardcore here, i already told her i would have some tough decisions to make when our lease is up since i'm just not happy with my/our current situation.	0
has anyone ever used the caregiver child exemption for when your lo needs to be moved to a care facility?	0
like theyve exceeded your physical limitations and just cant take care of them... its so hard.	0
but i really need some insight.	0
mostly on when youve lived in the home with them for years.	0
everything is hard right now.	0
thank you.	0
hi guys, my mom has a masters degree in nursing and has been in practice for over 20 years.	0
i want to share some information with you guys as she has her own home-care services.	0
she is located in the greater toronto area.	0
you can contact her at esmie4@hotmail.com &#x200b; as the pandemic evolves, the focus is on the seriousness of the disease and how it has impacted the lives of individual clients and families worldwide.	0
in the wake of covid-19, many lives have been physiologically, physically, and emotionally affected as many loved ones have been hospitalized, have died, or are too weak to care for themselves and their family members.	0
services we provide include but are not limited to the following  diabetic education and management  blood pressure monitoring, medications assistance  wound care managements  assistance with laundry, housekeeping, personal care, and hygiene  meal preparation value we understand and we realize that there are clients out there that need our help during these trying times.	0
we understand that sometimes, they just need a helping hand with some light assistance in their homes.	0
we also recognize that some clients who are ill prefer to be at home over a hospital facility, which is why we offer many levels of care.	0
privacy policy and confidentiality homecare services have adopted privacy and confidentiality policy to ensure that the privacy and protection of their personal information are protected  respect the privacy of our clients personal information and adheres to strict confidentiality standards.	0

every single time i start talking to women it inevitably comes to the topic of my housing and i embarrassingly have to admit to still living with a parent for caregiving.	0
i haven't met anyone that's ok with this, is it over before it began?	0
my father was recently put into a skilled nursing facility following a brief hospitalization in hopes that a couple weeks of regular physical/occupational therapy would improve his condition.	0
at first i was actually kind of excited - he loves doing physical therapy and is thankfully very receptive to it + having a couple of weeks off from 24/7 caregiving duty seemed like the greatest gift i could ask for.	0
i figured i could use this time to get catch up on my school work (this semester's course load has been... rough) and do some spring cleaning around the house.	0
apparently this is asking too much, though.	0
the actual reality has been me having to micromanage his care remotely, which is even more challenging than having to do it myself!	0
it doesn't help that my dad is also making this difficult, consciously or not.	0
i dropped off his bipap machine on sunday.	0
since i'm not allowed to enter the floor he's staying on without an appointment, i asked the nurse to call me if they need any help setting it up.	0
she says she's got it.	0
i visited him him on tuesday, and the machine was still in its carrying case and not set up.	0
i asked them again to please set it up and call me if there are any problems.	0
i also asked my dad multiple times to call me if there are any problems.	0
like please, work with me here!	0
1. my dad has severe sleep apnea (ahi of 60) 2. if he doesn't use it at least 4 hours a night his insurance will stop paying for it.	0
i guess they figured it out and everything was seemingly going smoothly.	0
when i called him today (saturday) i asked about the bipap.	0
apparently he didn't use it last night or the night before.	0
i ask why - there's some issue with the humidifier.	0
why didn't anybody call me then??????	0
he's a dialysis patient, and since i don't have a car, his transportation to and fro needs to be arranged.	0
he originally told me that the facility took care of that but that wasn't the case, so i made the necessary arrangements.	0
my dad then tells me he can't use that service because he can't walk and needs an ambulance.	0
i call the center's social worker, completely frazzled, to see what i can do since i can't afford 6 ambulance rides a week and he tells me a completely different story!	0
my dad has been walking up to 150ft during his pt sessions and is completely capable of using the paratransit service i set up.	0
the social worker then had a conversation with my dad who agreed to use it.	0
"this whole ""not doing something i ask him to do only to agree to do it when somebody else does"" thing is nothing new but it drives me insane like nothing else."	0
i want my two weeks off, damn it!	0
my mom has dementia.	0
she was very smart, radcliffe grad.	0
every evening at sundown she finds a way to engage me in arguments and succeeds in making me feel like a pos.	0
i dont know how to deal with it.	0
my dad has cancer and is on opioids and they have always been super codependent.	0
im at my wits end.	0
ive left my job to come take care of them on a small island accessible only by ferry or boat.	0
they team up on me and i feel like its all my fault.	0
i know it is not.	0
what can i do.	0
im almost suicidal at this point.	0
my only sibling died 8 yrs ago so its just me caretaking.	0
the pandemic makes it just so much more harder.	0
my husband's grandmother died after a long battle with alzheimer's before i met him.	0
his mother is currently 62 and showing signs of forgetfulness.	0
i want to learn everything i can about alzheimer's from the clinical to the anecdotal/advice kind of information.	0
what are some good books to start with?	0
i'm 25(m) and my fiance (20f) are caregiving for my 91 year old grandmother.	0
my grandmother was physically, mentally and verbally abusive to her children when she was younger.	0
she's completely lucid.	0
obviously, the physical abuse isn't really a problem anymore.	0
and for the first couple weeks, we got along fine.	0
but she has recently started to get more demanding.	0
every time i come down to offer her food, she complains about how something is wrong with the meal, how something she enjoyed a week ago is now terrible and she hates it, etc.	0
only to change her mind and ask for it again days later.	0
and every time, i've bent over backwards to correct it running myself ragged and even driving across town late and night to the grocery store to pick her out things she would rather eat.	0
there has to be a better solution.	0
my fiance has cared for disabled family her whole life and is a phenomenal cook, but shes met her match with my grandmother.	0
to give an example, one time, she summons me into her room and says shes hungry.	0
i have a list prepared of all her favorite foods, and i proceed to read them to her.	0
one by one, they are all rejected.	0
"word for word, she starts by saying ""i dont know what i want to eat."""	0
"""the snake in the stomach"" doesnt want any of it."	0
once i reach the end of my rope, i proceed to start bringing in food i bought for myself and my fiance, all of which she also rejects.	0
shes literally refused every meal in the house.	0
"eventually, she says, ""i just want a milkshake."	0
"that's all i'm willing to eat."""	0
"i made her one, but i'm really bothered by the idea that ""the stomach"" will continue to make me bend over backwards and play long guessing games, even when i don't have money to keep buying new groceries every day."	0
the latest thing she's started to do is throw the food and even toss the plates off the table, insulting the effort we put into preparing for us and saying bad things about us in spanish.	0
our family friend brought over a dish they prepared as a gift for her, and she wasted all of it by throwing the meat on the floor because i didn't cut the meat correctly.	0
i'm worried that if she continues to refuse to eat her food i've prepared, it will negatively impact her health.	0
does anyone have tips for dealing with uncooperative behavior?	0
i can handle a little pushback but i'm starting to believe she just wants to see how much she can get away with making me accommodate her.	0
thank you.	0
it   was my second shift with a patient w/ dementia as a caregiver and it   was really really frustrating :/.	0
i worked with another caregiver to   change their briefs, etc.	0
and the whole time the patient was screaming   but we had to change it because it was dirty/soiled.	0
"after this, they   forgot who i was and told me that two workers hit them ""last night"" and   it made me upset that the experience was seemingly really traumatic for   them (also the risk of getting into trouble for a little thing)."	0
and   then an hour later i think they forgot but still felt sad/stressed and   it just upset me out so much.	0
i vented to a caregiver and they said the   patient is basically always like that because they hate being changed   but it makes me so sad that this is normal.	0
just wanted to vent :/	0
it  was my second shift with a patient w/ dementia as a caregiver and it  was really really frustrating :/.	0

i am not sure if anyone else ever gets these same feelings but thats why i ask, maybe im just crazy or psycho or maybe im just like many others.	0
i 20m take care of my 81 and 85 year old grandparents every day and that consists of going over morning and night and the occasional grocery run or walk to gt them out of the house.	0
i love my grandparents.	0
but man oh man can it be hard, and not that i wish they would die or anything like that but man sometimes i do dream about my life kind of going back to normal afterwards... i know it sounds terrible but i had to get it out.	0
i am sure looking back after they actually do pass ill feel bad for saying or thinking or feeling like this but i just had to get it out and see if im insane or not.	0
it can just be tiring	0
this sucks.	0
hes 83 and cant hear (hearing aid is being repaired right now).	0
he had a stroke many years ago and is a bit unstable on his feet.	0
he needs an advocate with him and they wont let me inside.	0
i understand why but its so hard sitting out here in my car while hes alone.	0
he was having hallucinations about numbers on the ceiling and was very disoriented.	0
he also spiked a 102f fever.	0
he couldnt get himself out of his easy lift chair and couldnt focus on eating dinner.	0
i called an ambulance.	0
he had his first dose of the covid vaccine yesterday.	0
im really hoping its only mild complications from that.	0
i havent heard anything at all.	0
i really hope hes able to talk to the doctor and fully get across how bad his condition was.	0
ugh i hate this!	0
hello there fellow caregivers, thank you for creating this community.	0
today i just need to vent a little bit.	0
okay, so quick story.	0
my mom (59) had breast cancer back in 2006, it wasn't looking good.	0
but after surgery, 5 rounds of chemo and 25 rounds of radiation she was able to carry on!	0
she lived very happy and cancer free for the next 14 years.	0
until september 2020 (was 2020 the shittiest year ever or what?)	0
she started to develop a pain on her lower back, i didn't pay a lot of attention to it, but then it became so intense she couldn't even walk.	0
cut to late october, she was diagnosed with a metastasis on her spine.	0
i wasn't so scared at the beginning since her oncologist told me she could get radiotherapy and a reconstructive surgery and she would be fine.	0
but then they started asking for more tests and every time something new popped, she not only had cancer on her spine, but on her ribcage, sacrum, femur, skull... we are now in april and she can't walk by herself anymore or basically she can't do anything by herself anymore.	0
i bathe her, feed her, help her in the bathroom, take her to the hospital almost everyday for her consultations.	0
by this point  things have gotten complicated because there is a strong suspicion she might already have a metastasis on her brain (she is throwing up a lot and she has blurry vision on her left eye, more tests are coming next week for this).	0
i'm an only daughter and my father left when i was a toddler, so i really don't have a lot of support with anything.	0
i do have 2 aunts who are a little bit stupid and detached from this.	0
my mom decided she didn't want to tell her friends and she broke up with her bf because she didn't want him close, so that only leaves me to take care of her.	0
i love my mother, she is my whole world and the best person in my life.	0
i would gladly give her all of my blood and my organs in order to heal her, but i can't.	0
i feel tired all of the time, sad and scared.	0
because it doesn't matter how tired i am, none of what i am doing will heal her and the worst thing is that the day i stop being tired it will be likely because she is not going to be here with me anymore.	0
and i hate life, god i hate life so much and i think i might even hate god too.	0
i feel like nobody truly understands me and i also kind of feel nobody cares about me (i do have friends, but i try not to talk a lot about this since it's too much).	0
i do see a therapist because i am trying to wrap my feelings around what is happening.	0
and i just don't even know what i need anymore and i was just wondering if anybody could send me some virtual hugs or encouragement words.	0
thank you, stay safe.	0

hello all i am a 27 year old caregiver to two elederly grandparents and two aunts with parkinsons.	0
me and my wife take turns feeding and helping around the house, ive noticed that alexa has a lot of skills that could be useful for elderly folks.	0
asking for weather, time, calling family etc etc.	0
im a self confessed techie and wanted to use that skill to help.	0
ive created a few alexa skills to help us around the house as well i was wondering if there is any technology that anyone uses here to aid in caregiving?	0
hi everyone, i hope youre all well!	0
so a bit of background.	0
im 21, and a biology student.	0
im hoping to become a physician associate (physician assistant if youre in america) so educationally im on track, but i really need to gain work experience.	0
i worked in care home before, when i had just turned 18. i absolutely enjoyed working with the elderly residents, but couldnt deal with the toxicity of some of the staff.	0
im pretty aware of what the role consists of, but i just need advice.	0
i live at home still, and am very lucky to have my dad cook for me and the family, and my mum popping my washing in the washing machine.	0
im guessing these are very much skills i have to pick up before i visit people!	0
im also aware that i may have to cook for residents, which is a daunting task as i always avoid cooking meat as im terrified of giving someone food poisoning!	0
its probably best to practise, right?	0
what kind of things do you guys cook for individuals?	0
how often do you wash bedding/use the washing machine?	0
just general advice for care at home carers?	0
this may sound so silly but i just need advice for this.	0
please no negative comments, im really just here for advice.	0
im very much aware of the challenges that are involved when working in care.	0
thank you guys!	0
"grandma is in the hospital for a ""tune up""."	0
it is a very good thing and we are already seeing improvements but i've only gotten 3 hours of sleep.	0
i can't have caffeine due to heath reasons...how can i stay on my game???	0
?	0
little back ground.	0
i am 40 years old and caring for my disabled mother.	0
she suffered a subdural hematoma in 2012 that caused some significant damage to her brain.	0
despite knowing my mother's wishes my dad insisted that the doctors do everything to save her.	0
she survived but my mother was then living her nightmare of needing care 24/7.	0
i was already living back at home because earlier in the year i had to have emergency open heart surgery.	0
my dad and i worked together caring for mom.	0
her impairments are not horrible but significant enough she can not be left alone.	0
fast forward to 2014 my mom has a stroke.	0
we caught it early enough no damage was done.	0
she however required rehab and was in rehab hospital than nursing home till strong enough to come home.	0
when she came home we could tell there was still something wrong but doctors kept telling us there was nothing wrong and we didn't know what we were talking about.	0
for months with multiple trips to er and doctors with no resolution to her condition.	0
finally during another trip to the er was a doctor who i knew personally since i was a child and knew my mom well.	0
i told him.	0
there is something wrong with her.	0
he promised that she would not be released til he figured out what was wrong.	0
he ran every test under the sun.	0
finally deciding final step was to run a spinal tap.	0
boom she had meningitis.	0
she contracted an infection in the hospital/rehab/nursing home that went untreated and went to her brain.	0
again my dad had to option to follow my mom's wishes and to let her go and again did not give her want she wanted.	0
she again came out of it with more damage but her impairments were only slightly worse.	0
again my dad and i care for her together.	0
my dad is diagnosed with lung cancer in 2019. so now i am caring for both of them.	0
i love my mother with all my heart but my relationship with my dad has never been good.	0
i am a disappointment because i did not fit his ideal of what a boy/man should be because i was gay.	0
so i have massive resent towards my dad because i now must care for him as well.	0
my dad's health declined steadily till he passes away last may.	0
i am now left to care for my mother alone.	0
grief over my dad's passing hit me harder then i thought.	0
neither of my siblings come home for my dad's funeral.	0
i am incredibly lonely.	0
family members who promised to help after my dad passed have all but disappeared and i am left dealing with a home health aid who does her job well but has some pretty ugly opinions about groups of people who i care about pretty deeply including gay people.	0
she has has the need to constantly give her opinion on how she thinks there are things i am not doing right in terms of caring for my mother.	0
not sure what i am looking for just thought get it out there and see what you all think.	0
i could go on for hours about my situation and all of the nuances, but will keep this post as short and straight to the point as possible.	0
in october 2020, when i was 16 weeks pregnant with my first child, my dad called to inform me that (1) my mom had been diagnosed with als and (2) shed attempted suicide that previous afternoon.	0
that phone call turned my life completely upside down.	0
it was a time where most people feel elated/excited about bringing the familys first grandchild into the world - but instead my life became consumed with grief and guilt.	0
will i be able to give me daughter all of the attention and support that she needs to thrive and to love me?	0
can i physically and emotionally give my mom support in a way that reflects the immense love that i feel for her?	0
will the relationship with my babys father crumble under the stress?	0
...not to mention the stress, mental health crises, financial burden, etc.	0
that i was already dealing with due to the pandemic.	0
fast forward to now: i had a healthy baby girl in february and she has been an angel.	0
i count my lucky stars every day for her and dont know what i ever did to deserve such a perfect baby.	0
but now, while still on maternity leave, im staying with my parents to help take care of my mom (and the newborn).	0
my mom cannot be alone for more than 10 seconds because she has a very aggressive form of als that makes her choke frequently - someone always needs to be there to quickly bring her breathing machine over so that she doesnt die from respiratory failure.	0
we have 24/7 nurses at the house, but eventually they have to use the bathroom, empty my moms catheter, change her feeding tube bag, refill her water, etc.	0
so im there to pick up the slack.	0
my dad has serious caregiver fatigue and leaves the house for 5-8 hours every day because he cant deal.	0
my mom thinks that shes a burden because my dad doesnt want to stick around the house all day every day.	0
meanwhile, im burning the candle at both ends.	0
like changing adult diapers and newborn diapers literally at the same time.	0
ive known for awhile that it isnt sustainable, but it fucking kills me to see the look on my moms face when one of us isnt there when shes struggling.	0
i try so hard to find and focus on any shred of joy in life anymore, but it isnt there.	0
i want my daughter and mother to know that theyre both the center of my world.	0
i want to give them everything.	0
but i have nothing to give anymore.	0
alright so im an in home caregiver for a little boy with special needs and he got sent home early because of mushy stool this was fine i know they dont know that his medication does this but when he got home and i changed his diaper because i felt some pee i saw dry st on his bottom.	0
i am beyond pied im pretty sure now that his stool was more mushier than usual because they didnt check him and he sat down.	0
i used to be a behavioral aide and i know it doesnt pay a lot but ffs at least clean him properly!!!	0
!	0
i'm bipolar.	0
i'm an only child.	0
i've been taking care of my mother.	0
i do my best.	0
she requires 24/7 care.	0
today is sad.	0
the hospital is making arrangements for her to come home.	0
they want to send her to rehab but she wants to ho home.	0
this means iv antibiotics for me to give.	0
but against my better judgment i agreed.	0
she needs rehab.	0
i asked my aunt to help find a good rehab maybe near my aunt so my aunt could visit my mother.	0
my aunt said that she could probably take my mother but i could never live with my aunt since i had a problem... was a problem my aunt went on to say that i couldn't stay with my other aunt because i have a problem and i would upset my aunt and put her in the hospital.	0
when i said something to my mother she agreed with my aunt.	0
that she sucks it up and if she doesn't do anything or say anything them she will be ok.  i don't yell.	0
i don't hit her.	0
i cannot count thre number of dr. pol or sasquatch marathons i have seen.	0
i take her riding.	0
fix what she wants to eat which usually means 2 meals at mealtime.	0
bathing,  laundry, holding her hand and staying up when she's scared.	0
you know the drill.	0
all at the expense of my own self care.	0
i didn't realize i am so terrible.	0
i am med compliant and stable.	0
i can take my aunt's comments but my mother agreed.	0
she agreed.	0
i've been working on ways to keep her out of ltc.	0
maybe i should let my aunt take care of it.	0
it makes me cry and nothing does.	0
content warnings: death threats, verbal/physical abuse i understand the concept of maintaining personal boundaries to prevent burnout and such, but i get stuck sometimes on what words to use.	0
my current patient is physically and verbally abusive, and although im able to keep both of us safe (she is a fall risk patient, and not physically strong enough to do a lot of damage with her violence), and i have therapy and am strict about keeping my personal days free to recharge etc., but i have twelve hour shifts and this woman seemingly has a bottomless well of energy and it just wears on me.	0
its constantly (and i mean constantly.	0
30 seconds of silence seems to be the max.)	0
things like:  no coughing/sneezing/yawning!	0
or stop that!!	0
for coughs, sneeze, yawn, stretch, etc.	0
dont break any of my things!	0
mind you dont get your dirty hands on anything!	0
take it easy!	0
youre going to break everything.	0
did you steal any of my nice things?	0
while im putting away dishes, folding laundry, etc.	0
you poisoned me!	0
when i give her food or water or medicine.	0
youre too fat, dont break my furniture!	0
(lol) hussy/damned fool/idiot girl/etc etc etc (i do appreciate feeling like im in a noir film but still.	0
it starts to sting a bit.)	0
you cant do anything right, i have to order you around.	0
youre good for nothing.	0
nobody loves you.	0
nobody wants you here.	0
i wish someone would kill you.	0
i will burn your house down with you in it.	0
etc etc etc etc  you get the gist.	0
anyway.	0
thats the verbal stuff and my main responses are to distract, agree when possible, and be silent when those wont work.	0
like, seriously, how do you even respond to a disoriented dementia patient saying i wish someone would kill you.	0
????	0
so i say things like, ill be careful, im just putting away laundry!	0
and ........you have six kids, right?	0
that must have been quite a houseful!	0
what was it like?	0
and for the physical, i mainly follow her around while shes on a rampage to make sure she doesnt fall while she looks for pictures to throw off the walls and such, but i do need to keep her from her husband because she will be violent towards him if they are in the same room while shes upset, and i also feel like i ought to sometimes say something when shes violent towards me if just for the sake of my own sanity.	0
i say things like i really need you to stay sitting on the couch with me right now because im worried youre going to fall!	0
and [name] you may not hit me/throw things at me/spit at me/etc.	0
but both do very little.	0
she is on as much xanax and mood stabilizers and antipsychotics and stuff as the doctors will give her because shes a fall risk patient and the family doesnt want to medicate further due to what the doctor recommends or put her in a nursing home due to covid, which is understandable.	0
im on the verge of quitting, honestly.	0
i just am out of things to say that remind me (and ideally her too) that im a person, not a well trained dog, and her emotions and such do not come above mine as long as she is physically safe and has the minimum of emotional support that i can manage without burning out.	0
i feel like i need to put affirmations up or something.	0
idk.	0
any suggestions????	0
screaming to the void here   (also for the record the family is extremely supportive and pays well, and do what they can, but these situations are always difficult, of course.)	0
whats yalls living situation?what kind of precautions are yall taking at this point in the pandemic?	0
i moved to a new state to be a caregiver 5 months before the pandemic, therefore i dont know many people im 22 living with my dad (52, pretty bad ms who i care for), and his parents (73 and 75, they see relatively healthy).	0
now my grandparents are both fully vaccinated and i will be in a couple weeks.	0
my dad has had to postpone his due to doctors orders but should get his first one started next month hopefully.	0
in march 2020 when everything shut down i stopped doing everything.	0
i kept working my part time job up until september 2020 when i realized covid wasnt going away, and i felt guilty putting my household at risk.	0
since then i have had literally no social interaction with anyone my age and the only ones i do have with people outside of my family are medical related for caregiving.	0
without going into it too much, september up to now has been sooooo rough, i just typed out a whole page to try to explain what im going through and cant even get through the half of it lol.	0
thats what kind of pandemic its been, im sure yall can relate.	0
my main question is what is the middle ground at this point?	0
its bothering way more than i can explain that i havent had any social interaction in over a year and i wanna get back out and just do a couple things at some point.	0
frankly im tired of going to the park alone to do push ups alone.	0
i want to get a relative safe job and go back to the gym.	0
those are the two things that used to keep my sane.	0
when will yall / when did yall step out and take the risk?	0
do yall think i should start to wear a mask in my home?	0
my grandparents still run errands and do some things on occasion, im the only one who stays in the house all the time.	0
i just want to hear yalls situations and realize im not alone.	0
maybe some things yall have found to relieve stress?	0
i'm new here and honestly new to looking for any resources/support/advice i've been caring for my wife for 10 years after two unfortunate events in as many years things accelerated.	0
i'm in my late 30s but all the resources groups etc i see skew hard in the direction of elderly parents and largely cognitive conditions or terminal illness.	0
i think the situation of being young(ish) caring for partner who depends on you for most but not all things physical is a unique challenge.	0
if there are resources or others also feel this is missing i'm interested.	0
i have been trying to find essays, books, podcasts, etc.	0
about the experience of being a caregiver, in their late 20s, taking care of a significant other.	0
my significant other and i have been together for several years and he has been being treated for cancer for over a year.	0
i periodically will look for things to read that would help me think through the feelings/challenges i have had during this process.	0
there are some resource pages but i have not managed to find anything substantial from working-age caregivers talking about their experience taking care of a significant other.	0
thank you in advance!	0
specific materials of interest though would be curious to read works from a range of mediums:  essays columns books blogs  bonus points if the writer is...  gay no children working  ... or discusses...  self-care (while upholding the quality of care for the sick family member) trying to succeed at work despite sometimes-crippling anxiety (and depression?)	0
challenges from covid-19	0
my mother had multiple sclerosis and refuses to care for herself.	0
i have durable power of attorney and manage her expenses and pay for caregiver because im the only child and i have my own kids to care for.	0
she called me yelling at me like i was a child because i restrict the amount of alcohol she is allowed to have in the condo.	0
if i didnt restrict this then she would almost surely go into more seizures.	0
she would happily go through 2 liters of margarita in a day.	0
she said if i restrict her alcohol then shes taking me out of the will ... oh lord	0
does anyone have experience with the home purewick system?	0
thanks	0
hi all, i feel like my brain is about to explode so i just need to get his out.	0
sorry about typos, i'm on mobile.	0
i'm new to this community, so i'll give y'all some brief background.	0
my (31f) partner (tom,34m) has a fracture in his lower spine that occasionally gives him issue, but on march 25th of this year, it completely debilitated him.	0
he could barely walk, and even the barest movement, bend or twist was excruciating.	0
that same day, i started a new job, and my dad told the family that he has lung cancer.	0
cue the start of my midlife crisis.	0
as the weeks passed, toms back was getting increasingly worse and i suddenly found myself his full time caregiver when i wasn't at work.	0
our house, the animals (2cats and a dog), cooking, cleaning, gardening, helping him shower or go to the bathroom, picking up prescriptions, helping with his therapy, doing so much laundry, sobbing by myself outside then handwashing 3 days worth of dishes because our dishwasher broke, it's like i woke up in someone else's life.	0
and i didn't like the pieces of me that i was left with.	0
i didn't even have a chance to deal with my father's cancer, and tom rarely asked.	0
i've struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life, but any form of mental health care has disappeared.	0
i'm pretty sure i'm going to get fired at this new job because of poor work performance.	0
i tried to explain my situation, and it only made things worse.	0
10 days ago, we took tom to the er.	0
thank god we are both vaccinated, i can't imagine the anxiety otherwise.	0
he had a high fever for about 5 days and we were worried about an infection, although he had already seen several doctors and they did not share our concern, which was incredibly frustrating.	0
we waited for nearly 22 hours to be admitted, with him in excruciating pain the entire time.	0
we went through so many shift changes, and so much was lost or forgotten because of this.	0
we were told we were waiting for an mri, and 6 hours of badgering later, discovered that the previous shift doctor who said he had ordered it hadn't put it in the system.	0
eventually, around hour16, they moved him to a back hallway by the trauma er entrance.	0
i wasn't able to go with him, and was able to go home and finally rest for a bit.	0
he was in this hallway for 6 hours, i'm pretty sure they forgot him.	0
anyway, once he's admitted, over the course of the next few days, we find out he has a strep infection in his spine (i didn't know this was a thing?!?)	0
that took up residence in the spine defect.	0
so even though it sucked sitting through all the er stuff, i am glad i pushed and advocated for him because this could have easily been so so much worse.	0
and i know y'all know how tough hospital stays can be.	0
i felt like i was pulled 1000 directions, making sure he was fed, had clean clothes, taking care of whatever house stuff i could to try and get it ready for him to remove home.	0
he is home now, with a picc line for the next 6 weeks.	0
he is still in a lot of pain, using a walker to get around, can't bend over or do much of anything independently.	0
still a lot of work and not fun for either of us, but a much needed relief from the hospital balancing act.	0
anyway, i am struggling with with feeling like i am constantly disappointmenting tom as a caregiver, even though i know how hard i am working and that i am quite literally doing my best.	0
i am proud of myself for how hard i have worked to make tom happy and healthy, especially given that my depression has a history of making even basic self care impossible.	0
but somehow in the past month it's like i've gained superhuman strength to help tom fight this, i'm able to care for tom and take care of myself better than i usually do.	0
yes, there is cat hair on the floor, our garden is dying, the dog needs a long walk, i need to plant this tree, clean out the fridge, take the trash to the street, shave your back, water the plants, schedule a maid, mow the grass, and a million other things, but we are clean and fed, and i am working my ass off to complete the growing list of shit i have to do.	0
so i feel proud even if it's not perfect.	0
but tom has consistently made me feel as though im falling short.	0
complaints about the food, the cleanliness of the house, what i should be doing... i know he is frustrated and in a lot of pain, but i just want to scream at him to open his eyes and have some fucking empathy for me as well throughout all this.	0
it's like he sees me as this endless waterfall of kindness, energy and empathy that never needs to be replinished.	0
this is also hard for me.	0
i also need support and care.	0
for example.	0
when he was still in the hospital, i had gone home during the day to rest, clean, and restock toms supplies.	0
my brother dropped me off for the night so i wouldnt have to pay for parking or walk through the city alone late at night (#6 highest murder rate in the us ftw).	0
i have to pee when i get there and find the nearest public only to find that i've started my period early, thanks stress, and bled through my pants badly.	0
don't know how i didn't notice, i guess i just thought it was normal vagina things since it was a full 2 weeks early.	0
so i wrap myself up, start my hunt for tampons, and am shit out of luck.	0
i walk 3 blocks across sky bridges looking for a tampon vending machine that information pointed me towards, no luck.	0
can't get an uber, no pharmacy in walking distance or open at this hour.	0
eventually i find a nurse who gives me one tampon and a pad, so i am able to go up to his room and finally change clothes.	0
the pajamas i had grabbed we're some weird ratty old ones, all the rest were in the wash. and of course, the next morning, i have completely bled through the pad, the sheet, probably the floors below us.	0
it was a mess.	0
but whatever, i call an uber to come grab me awhen tom starts begging me to get him something from starbucks.	0
i do not have a change of clothes, because they are also covered in blood, and the only shoes i have are from my outfit last night, and are these chunky clogs with a slight heel.	0
so,i am wearing blood soaked, lime green and blue striped leggings that are covered in holes and these absurd heeled clogs.	0
i smell, i'm embarrassed, i look completely deranged, and i just want to go home and find a super plus 6x tampon and sit in the bathtub.	0
but he wants starbucks, which is 2 skybridges away inside the hospital.	0
i tell him no, explain why, show him my ruined pants, and yet he's persistent and keeps whining that he doesn't know why  i can't just do it, he hates the hospital coffee.	0
i just felt so unheard, unseen, unappreciated, unloved, uncared for.	0
i cried my entire way out of the hospital and in the uber, i don't know why this particular instance just stung me so so bad.	0
i felt so broken and alone.	0
i couldn't stop crying for hours.	0
not because i still felt those emotions but my eyes just turned in to faucets and wouldn't turn off.	0
so that's a brief summary.	0
sorry i can't seem to stop writing, i don't feel like i can talk about this with anyone, and it's felt good to just get it out.	0
on to the main event, or why i feel bad that i don't feel bad.	0
yesterday was our anniversary.	0
we've only been together 2 years, we're not married, so it's not like this is some big hoorah or anything.	0
but it's been a tough year, it would be nice to reconnect with each other.	0
so i get him a cool hanging plant, nothing fancy, but he loves his houseplants so it fit well.	0
he got me nothing.	0
didnt do anything besides say happy anniversary before i left for work.	0
i know this sounds so nitpicky, because he has been sick, but for the past week since he came home from the hospital he's done nothing but sit on the sofa on his phone, the least he could have done is order a card or plan on ordering dinner.	0
and it's not like this is some one time thing, he didn't get me anything last year, and has never gotten me anything for valentine's day.	0
i've gotten him a small thing each time.	0
he makes more than 3x as much as me, thanks to me being a full time grad student for the past 4 years, so money's not the issue.	0
last night i asked if he could order our dinner for the night and he pouted and whinged about having to download the apps and buy it, when i have been the one to order food our entire relationship despite the fact that i make less than $20,000 a year.	0
something broke inside me when i was practically begging this man who is supposed to love me to just download a god damn app to order us food, so that in my mind i could pretend he cared enough to get me something for our anniversary.	0
we ordered bbq, not some 5 course meal.	0
fucking hell.	0
so when we sat down to eat, he asked what was wrong and i told him that i've been feeling unappreciated, and that i wouldn't be upset if this was the exception not the rule.	0
and i told him the following: of course i know he can't go out and shop right now, but i'd be just as happy with a small handwritten note or a cool rock he found outside.	0
its not about getting a gift, it's about being considered.	0
and he wasn't sick for our anniversary last year or the past two valentine's days.	0
"but he hemmed and hawed, claiming he did get me something in the past, and that he couldn't believe that i was so hurt over ""just a gift""."	0
"he said ""we've had this talk before"", which we have, i've asked for more empathy and nothing changed other than now he actually says ""thank you"" when i do something for him, a skill he should have mastered 30 years ago."	0
"so i said ""exactly, weve talked about this several times""."	0
he just turned away from me and turned on the tv.	0
we haven't spoken since, i slept downstairs, other than what's necessary, because i'm still his primary fucking caregiver.	0
am i losing my mind, because i feel like i am.	0
"why the fuck am i breaking myself to pieces for you, who cant even be bothered to talk to me, care for me, or say ""i love and appreciate you"" when i'm literally begging for it?"	0
i'm not your wife, i clean your ass and cook your food and bend over backwards because i care about you.	0
yet when i had surgery last year you wouldn't even drive me to the hopsital prior and didn't come visit me that night.	0
can't even do the bare minimum when the roles are reversed.	0
does he just not care?	0
would that make this easier?	0
am i just asking for  too much and putting my expectations on to him?	0
am i blowing things out of proportion because i am just too tired and emotional?	0
am i being too hard on him while he's sick?	0
should i have waited to say something?	0
sorry guys, i clearly needed to rant.	0
my brain feels like it's been put in a blender.	0
i'm just so so so exhausted.	0
maybe this would have been a better fit for relationship advice, so i'm sorry if this is the wrong place.	0
i just feel like caregiving has shown a glaring spotlight on our relationship and i don't like what i'm seeing.	0
to clarify, we have been fortunate to have a lot of help from both of our parents and his friends, i could not have gotten through this past month alone and i don't want to pretend like that's the case.	0
we are incredibly lucky to have them.	0
and i know i'm not perfect and this is only my side of the story, i've made mistakes too but i just feel so lost right now.	0
to anyone who makes it this far, thanks for reading.	0
by early, i mean before the need for constant assistance is there.	0
my grandmother moved in with me two years ago, when her parkinson's symptoms were very minor.	0
she was just afraid to live alone in case she fell, and grocery runs were getting harder for her, so having her move in then was more of a roommate situation.	0
pros:  she wasn't really all that dependent, so we had an extra set of hands.	0
it wasn't emergent that she moved in, so there was no rush when she inevitably fell to get her room and all settled before she returned home from the rehab... everything was as she left it.	0
the company helped me cope with a weird time in my life... dealing with the postpartum roller coaster of being a new mom, in a new house, with a new baby, a new job working from home, and a new roommate.	0
she took care of my great-grandmother, and she also picked me and my brother up from school every day.	0
so my great-grandmother was always there to read to us, have an afternoon snack with us, play with us.	0
so it's nice to see my daughter have that same experience that i had.	0
&#x200b; cons:  i see the small decline, and it is heartbreaking.	0
i see from month to month or year to year what she's losing the ability to do or comprehend.	0
"we've lost most of the ""mutually beneficial"" relationship."	0
we don't work together much anymore... it's mostly her needing me.	0
which i don't mind, it's just heartbreaking because, to me, the change feels drastic, so i know she feels that way too.	0
i get the tough questions.	0
"""why didn't soandso call?"	0
do you think i'll get better?	0
why doesn't familymember visit anymore?	0
"do you think i'll live to see xyz?"""	0
she won't ask anyone else those questions and that's fine, but it weighs on me because i get mad at the relatives that don't check in on her.	0
&#x200b; i don't know why i felt the need to share this.	0
maybe you're on the fence about moving in with your loved one.	0
points to consider, i guess.	0
my feelings of resentment toward the person i care for are at an all-time high.	0
over the past month i've lost my cool about 3 times - it's not anger, it's just overall distress, and i need to find a way to redirect these feelings when i get overwhelmed.	0
i can feel myself starting to blame her for things that aren't really her fault.	0
she isn't emotionally or physically healthy enough to be my punching bag.	0
it isn't fair, and i need to get these feelings under control.	0
has anyone else experienced this?	0
do any of you have strategies for managing resentment?	0
(other than respite which at this time is not an option for us.)	0
shonmy father die of angiosarcoma on january 19. we have been fighting this beast sincet december 2016, chemo in 2016, radiation 2017 and palliative the la	0
be warned now, due to my reservations about posting here for some time, this story is long.	0
to avoid as much confusion & inaccurate judgments as possible, i'll try to provide as much background info as i can as the past 10 years of my life have been a hell of a roller coaster to say the least for which i've had minimal outside support.	0
with my husband's blessing, i think it's time i finally vent about this.	0
some history: i'm a 28f & have been a caregiver for my husband, j(35m) for 9 years, we'll have been together 10 years in a matter of months.	0
i met him shortly after an accident with an ambulance where he was driving that caused ptsd & hyper nerve sensitivity(hns); he also deals with general anxiety & some depression on top of all this.	0
let me also clarify by saying he wasn't the one at fault in the accident and the one who hit him literally fled the scene!	0
he deals with a fair bit of anger because of this & from being misunderstood by many doctors he's seen over the years misdiagnosing his ptsd & trying to treat him for bipolar instead which he doesn't have.	0
but i also need to clarify that to me, he's one of the most kind, generous, understanding people i know who's supported & taken care of me when i'm unwell.	0
he encourages me to pursue my own interests alongside taking care of him & has even expressed understanding if i ever wished to vent to reddit as he knows he's not the easiest person to deal with at times because of the frustration he deals with so i needn't feel guilty for talking about him behind his back.	0
he's also been self medicating with cannabis for the past 9 years & only recently got an official prescription from a pain clinic for it in 2020, but it's not meant to be a long term solution because it's expensive af.	0
there's also been concerns from doctors over the years that the cannabis could result in psychotic episodes.	0
he's been in & out of hospitals over the years infrequently due to these episodes, the last one(4 years ago) getting so bad that he could no longer recognize me & he lashed out.	0
while i sustained no actual injuries, i called 911 in a panic & he was arrested for assault for which the charges were later dropped due to mental illness but was let off with a warning that if it happened again, he may have to go to jail.	0
when i was finally able to see him again, he'd completely cleared up from the psychosis, he was back to his kind, loving self & told me that if he ever started showing signs again, i should do what i can to get him help & that i have that permission as his spouse/caregiver.	0
fast forward: so for the past 4 years, j had been stable, while he was back on cannabis to help mitigate the pain from his hns, he was also on some mood stabilizing medication that's normally for bipolar.	0
problem is this medication would make his joints lock up to the point he could barely move.	0
approx 9 months ago he decided to ween off it since he got an actual cannabis prescription from a pain clinic & in time, his mobility improved.	0
he still dealt with pain spikes, but he could now actually use his hands again to some degree.	0
both me & his parents were reluctant about him going off the medication at first, but j's really smart, like abnormally high iq smart & is a very logical person who advocated his reasons for doing so well so we agreed that if it felt right to come off it after so much time on it, then maybe it's time.	0
for the past 7 months he seemed fine with the exception of some anger toward one of his doctors, the one that prescribed him the medication that made his joints lock up, because he's been asking how his 2 kids are for the past couple years every time he sees him.	0
we don't have nor want kids so it's been frustrating for him trying to get a new doctor when the hospital apparently sees nothing wrong with this guy not having his files straight & declined his request.	0
seemingly small matters at times started meriting larger bursts of anger than necessary & while it wasn't directed at me & he doesn't damage anything, the loudness still triggers some trauma from what i experienced 4 years ago.	0
he knows the impact his anger can have on me & often tells me to go to another room in the house when he's like that so it doesn't impact me as much, but it still worries me.	0
this month: now at the start of april, the signs of psychosis started showing themselves again.	0
dramatic changes in behavioral patterns, paranoia, skewed perception of elapsed time, talking to things that weren't there, almost like he was having discussions with these delusions where they'd answer back, stopping normal social contact with his friends online & spending majority of his time either in the bedroom hiding under the covers, or in the shower talking to someone/something.	0
this time, it seemed like one of the things he was talking to was an imaginary version of me at times.	0
by day 2 of the strange behavior i informed his parents.	0
"by day 3 j was getting so riled up by these delusions he told me to ""get the f out of my house!"""	0
to which his parents came & got me & i've been staying at their place ever since.	0
over the next 2 days, his dad stayed at the house to do renovation work & keep an eye on j's behavior & make sure he didn't hurt himself or damage the property.	0
after 2 days, j requested his dad take him to the hospital.	0
for the first time in 10 years, he went willingly, but then thought his dad lied to the doctors about what he witnessed.	0
he was there for a little over a week & was in denial about the psychosis.	0
after only 2 days of receiving treatment, he released himself against medical advice & returned home.	0
i was informed a crisis unit may reach out to check on him for updates & that they'd have my number if he couldn't be reached.	0
the doctor also advised i don't move back home right away for my safety.	0
the day after returning home, j started back up on the cannabis.	0
i went to visit him to check on him & verify the integrity of my belongings that were still there as well as make sure he had something to eat.	0
he was back into the affectionate, child-like state of day 1 psychosis where he hyper focused just wanting to be near me with some minor out of place discussions with things that weren't there which he dismissed.	0
the incident: by day 2, he showing the signs of irritability again, he wouldn't answer his phone, & the discussions/behavior patterns were picking up.	0
he didn't acknowledge me as much & was getting really upset about someone who hadn't been in our lives for years, insisting they killed our cat.	0
to clarify, this guy lost our cat while he was suppose to take care of him, and made no effort to find him, but i don't believe he killed him.	0
i made him something to eat & tried to convince him to come off the cannabis to which he agreed to surprisingly fast, kinda passive aggressively, and allowed me to remove the stuff from the house when it was time for me to leave.	0
i also tried to convince him to take the medication the doctor at the hospital prescribed, but he wouldn't take it.	0
i left feeling really worried about him.	0
a couple hours later, i decided to call the crisis unit & express my concerns about his behavior & told them he wasn't going to return the call like they wanted him to.	0
i described the behavior patterns i saw & how i couldn't convince him to take the medication that was suppose to mitigate the rage/psychosis/anxiety & they suggested i request a wellness check which would send non-emergency officers to check on him & determine if he needs to go back to the hospital.	0
following those instructions, i did just that, but felt really guilty & worried about him.	0
me & his father rushed across the city to meet with the officers once they were on site to describe in more detail everything i saw over the past 2 days & how it resembled the first instance before he told me to get out.	0
shortly after another car rolled up saying it was time to take him & that they had a bed ready for him at the hospital; they determined he needed help & force may have to be used to get him back to the hospital.	0
mortified as i knew what was about to ensue, i ran for my in-law's car & we parked further up the street so he wouldn't see us when he was brought out so i wouldn't be blamed because i was the only person he still trusted even in this state.	0
tldr: for the first time in a few years now, i had to watch the person i love most be carried out of our home by multiple officers & forced into a car as he screamed at the top of his lungs...again.	0
he was readmitted to the hospital despite his incessant protests that he was fine & could look after himself.	0
the sight made me sob uncontrollably & i'm overwhelmed with guilt as i feel it's my fault i couldn't do more to help or stop the psychosis from taking hold again.	0
i feel like i betrayed his trust because he doesn't know i'm the one who requested the wellness check even tho his parents tell me it was inevitable because he wouldn't answer his phone when they crisis unit called to check on him, & j's the one who told me to do what i could to get him help if he started showing signs of psychosis again tho i'm not sure he remembers..not to mention he's currently in denial about the psychosis.	0
i miss my sane husband so much, i miss all the things we'd do together & the way he'd always go out of his way to make me smile or laugh at least once a day.	0
i miss all our fun/logical conversations & inside jokes.	0
i miss our bed, & living in our house, i just want our lives to go back to normal so we can keep working towards the future we'd talk about together, but it feels like that reality will never come if he doesn't get the proper help he needs & i'm scared of that uncertainty.	0
it's painful watching the person you love slowly descend into madness & not know how to stop it or snap them out of it & i feel incredibly alone & guilty in my experience regarding this.	0
i feel like any shred of happiness or calmness i have rn while he's in the hospital in a rage without my help makes me an awful person.	0
it's made my struggle with suicidal ideation more difficult than usual & i'm just curious if there's any advice, encouragement, or similar experiences anyone has to share regarding a spouse with psychosis because no one in my daily life can relate to this horror..?	0
once again, i'm surry for the novel, but i felt it better to be thorough as possible rather than skew details & be misunderstood as it's a very complicated situation.	0
over a year ago, spouse was diagnosed with stage iv colon cancer.	0
he's had numerous surgeries, 6 months of chemo, two more hospital stays, a stay in a nursing home, home health care, blood transfusions, the works.	0
i sold our farm, moved us to an area nearer to hospitals.	0
i used up all my leave to take him to the medical services.	0
i sold my beloved car and bought a more comfortable van.	0
i researched cancer and fill out forms.	0
i take care of the bills and paperwork, taxes, rx and keeping his family informed.	0
i am his only caregiver and the only breadwinner.	0
his cancer has exploded and he only has about 5 months left.	0
incredibly, he wants more treatment!	0
i am exhausted, burnt out and desperately need closure.	0
he sits at home and watches tv all day.	0
the fact that his spouse is staggering with exhaustion and sick from anger doesn't register with him.	0
he has no pension, no benefits except from my job and basically contributes nothing but always wants something.	0
he's forever ordering rubbish from amazon and running up credit card bills.	0
he refuses to see the misery he's created.	0
my life is wrecked and will not get peace until after he passes.	0
oh, and he's rude to his doctors, too.	0
"i cry with anger and exhaustion and he's say ""i'm glad you love me so much and grieve for my passing""."	0
which is of course, totally wrong.	0
i'm crying because i'm exhausted and am no longer grieving, just needing him to get on with it.	0
thanks for letting me vent.	0
my grandmother is 90 years old, and i do all the cooking and cleaning around the house.	0
it's just the two of us living together.	0
i recently overheard my grandmother telling my family lies about me over the phone.	0
then to confirm my suspicions, my uncle confronted me about what i heard her saying.	0
she said that i am deceptive, and that i lie to her and hide things from her.	0
this is incredibly hurtful, as i do almost everything for my grandmother and would never lie to her.	0
the worst part is, i think my family believes her.	0
i have absolutely no reason to lie.	0
i thought i was helping by telling my family about how she forgets things, or how she smears feces on the walls and floor.	0
i thought my family would give me assistance helping my grandmother, but everyone seems to think i'm making things up.	0
when i talk to my grandmother, she denies everything.	0
she says she loves me and would never talk poorly of me, and that she appreciates everything i do.	0
i'm fine with doing everything, but i'm having trouble dealing with the fact that she's talking about me behind my back.	0
does anyone have some similar stories to share?	0
any advice to give or suggest books for me to read?	0
alright guys so ive diapered for a year now but one thing thats always a hit or miss is changing the diapers before they get too full i have a hard time feeling if theres any pee any advice?	0
sometimes the diaper doesnt poof out enough too.	0
so i had hope when my grandpa started eating this past weekend.	0
doctor did too, we thought that oh!	0
maybe he doesn't need a feeding tube!	0
all his vitals are doing great.	0
well, our luck ran out.	0
grandpa's not eating again, even if they switched the diet to more flavorful things.	0
it's hard to do - given it has to be pureed.	0
so it looks like we're back to the tube plan.	0
i have to go to the hospital after my chores and talk to him about it.	0
him eating 15% every meal isn't enough.	0
does anyone know how it'll feel?	0
does the pain go away after a week or two?	0
if you have experience, what helped to dull the pain?	0
i feel bad putting it in him but we don't really have a choice....	0
my sister was diagnosed with stage 4 mbc almost two years ago.	0
i wasnt in the best mental state at the time and its been the most difficult thing ive gone through (i feel like an ass saying that when my sister is the one with the disease).	0
i have been with her as much as possible to help her through treatment and her responsibilities.	0
ive hit a new valley in my grief cycle.	0
im back to fits of uncontrollable crying that pop up when im tired or alone.	0
my sister doesnt want to see me upset, it increases her fear and stress.	0
i dont want to scare her daughter.	0
my parents and siblings have essentially given up on my sister, i think in effort to minimize the pain down the road.	0
so i have all these overwhelming emotions of grief/fear, and feelings of responsibility to not only try to keep my sister happy and alive for as long as possible, but to make up for everything my family lacks.	0
im ill-equipped emotionally but im the only one who is helping.	0
and my family is so emotional ally stunted that any attempt to talk about things is ignored or im gaslighted.	0
im so alone that i cant breathe.	0
and im such a fucking selfish asshole for feeling so terribly about my situation when my sister is fighting cancer.	0
i dont see any options anymore.	0
im cornered, im alone.	0
i dont want to continue living anymore when all i experience is stress, grief, anger and pain.	0
i dont want this life anymore	0
a long term friend of mine, who is also my roommate, has bad hygiene.	0
rarely ever uses soap - he's never even bought his own.	0
can't kick him out even if i wanted to, but i've been falling into the role (unwillingly, but it's my current lot in life) of his caregiver.	0
i don't bathe him, but his bo and the residue he leaves on surfaces is.. frankly more than i can take.	0
i have bought him gentle soaps (he says rougher ones irritate his skin - and i believe it, his skin will likely react to anything that pulls oils and grime off), all sorts of cleaning wands, soft and hard bristle, etc.	0
i need advice and don't know where to turn to.	0
i've sat down with him, discussed with him earnestly several times.	0
today, for the first time, i offered to help him do a deep clean.	0
just once.	0
approached clinically.	0
he declined.	0
this is becoming an issue.	0
can any of you give me advice to things i can do - maybe a soap/hibiclens soak he can just use in the tub that will help?	0
or a way i can approach him to convince him to take time to actually cleanse himself in the shower?	0
im not the caregiver.	0
but i am one of the babysitters for my niece when she goes for her weekly chemo treatments.	0
and other times.	0
my niece and i have always been very close.	0
we are only 17 years apart.	0
her mother lives out of state, her father, my older brother died several years ago.	0
shes an only child.	0
i live around the corner from my niece also.	0
her husband of course is lost and overwhelmed emotionally.	0
shes not even 40 yet.	0
their twins are 3yrs old.	0
i talk, of should say...listen to him as often as i can.	0
i just let him get it out.	0
i cant give him advice, ive never been where he is.	0
ive let him know out family, that i am there for him whenever he needs me.	0
however, and heres the tricky part, i know my niece, she has always been an extremely independent person.	0
and she has been raising her daughters to be the same.	0
i know her wishes.	0
weve talked.	0
i know her.	0
ive been instructed, when shes gone out of town previously to let him do things himself with the girls.	0
not to run over there for every little thing.	0
he has to be able to do everything with the girls in tow.	0
i have said no to him on occasion.	0
sometimes because i had to, i really was not available.	0
however, with her condition taking a bad turn and his emotional state understandably overwhelmed, i cant say no if i can help.	0
what im worried about is later, after, i dont want him to lean on me too much after.	0
ill be overwhelmed emotionally also.	0
i love this girl like my own daughter.	0
and, i do have my own health issues, as well as a teenager at home, and aging mother, granddaughters, etc.	0
i dont plan on leaving him high and dry.	0
i want to help and be there for him.	0
but i dont want to be his crutch.	0
and most of all i want to honor my nieces wishes.	0
and....i dont want to be seen as the asshole who isnt there for him and says no to him.	0
by him or anyone.	0
how do i handle this?	0
i did tell him he should talk to a professional.	0
it would a good idea.	0
and there is grief counseling.	0
i plan on telling him to circle all of his wagons.	0
its time.	0
because when he needs it, if one person is not available he can reach out to the next.	0
he needs to know who to go to.	0
i just need some advice from people that have been there, done that.	0
or are there doing that.	0
help.	0
my boyfriend and i moved in with my grandparents in january of this year because my grandma was having excruciating leg pain and needed help.	0
well, the same week we moved in, she was admitted to the hospital and they diagnosed her with leukemia.	0
she went to the closest treatment center for a week or so and then came back home.	0
once she was home, it was incredibly difficult.	0
she was still in so much pain, and now she had to go to more appointments to try and figure it out.	0
its been 3 months of just trying to get through each day.	0
her oncologists kept saying that her bone marrow results look good and that the chemo is working.	0
she even had radiation on some lesions that were found on her leg and back, but it didnt help the pain.	0
well, we were able to get a break in the chemo treatments to try and fix her leg and back pain that never got better.	0
within a week of stopping the chemo, she was so confused and hallucinating that we had to take her to the er.	0
at first they thought it was a uti, so i was relieved and expected her to come home.	0
but she wasnt responding to the antibiotics, and the doctors saw spots on her in the cat scan.	0
so now, theyve said that the cancer has spread up and down her spine, to her liver and pancreas, even her feet and neck, and its untreatable.	0
the confusion is most likely caused by the cancer spreading and her dying.	0
shes been in the hospital for almost a week now and has been not coherent really the whole time.	0
we take my grandpa to visit everyday, but he just gets tired and wants to leave because she mostly sleeps.	0
ive talked to him and said that shes dying and not coming home and he kind of repeated me, but then later that day, he was asking someone when she would be home.	0
this has all been so much harder than i anticipated.	0
im just so sad that i didnt realize she was dying and spend more time comforting her while she was still coherent.	0
i just thought she would get better and then we could do normal things again.	0
its been only three months, and ive gone from expecting her to die to expecting her to be okay to now trying to grasp that she really is dying.	0
the whole three months she was really begging to go to the hospital, at least when the pain was occurring.	0
once we got her comfortable and laying down, she would forget and be a little better but mostly just slept.	0
i can find in my pictures and notes when it started going downhill.	0
every time we raised concerns with her doctors, we were ignored and pushed aside.	0
im so sad for her but also so relieved that shes no longer suffering.	0
its so painful, but i also know that she came home to make sure grandpa would be taken care of and im honored that she trusted me to do it, but im also terrified because hes relied on her for years to help with everything.	0
i have no idea how this is going to work going forward, how to best support my grandpa, or just what to do everyday now.	0
i left this sub after i realized that she was dying, but now i remembered that im still caregiving for my grandpa with dementia.	0
i get maybe a 30 minute window when im sure i can use the bathroom because my father is up and down in the toilet multiple times.	0
idk why, does this mean he has a prostate problem?	0
he wont go to a doctor.	0
its driving me crazy.	0
zero privacy.	0
the minute i head into the bathroom to shower he has to go.	0
if i have to go he beats me to it.	0
ive been a caregiver for about a year now and most of my clients have been able bodied.	0
i recently started working with a bedbound client and i feel really nervous and terrible because she is not able to communicate with me what she would like for me to help her with.	0
any tips?	0
would really appreciate it!	0
a neighbor of mine who lives alone is going through a major surgery soon and will need help recovering.	0
do i give a two weeks notice?	0
can i stop immediately?	0
ive only got one 8-hour overnight shift with them.	0
but ive had the past 3 weeks off.	0
and ive noticed how much better my back has been feeling/how much better i have been feeling.	0
this house has been super stressful for me over the past two years; and honestly the past few months its been really killing my back.	0
would it be possible for me to ask to stop service with me immediately for these reasons?	0
i dont want to be harsh / make them short on services.	0
but i really think it would benefit every party to find a new caregiver for this person.	0
any advice would be greatly appreciated.	0
i guess i should have seen this coming.	0
he's gotten noticeably worse the past few days.	0
i think it was 3 days ago that he asked me if i'd fed the kids yet (i only have one child and he's an adult that makes his own meals most the time).	0
later that day he asked me if i'd seen my daughter lately (i've never had a daughter, or anyone like a daughter to me, or anything like that).	0
today dad and i were sitting in the living room.	0
him on the couch snuggled with the dog watching bowling on tv.	0
me in the chair next to the couch, fervently crocheting a stuffed dinosaur for a sick friend of mine.	0
"he started to speak, and you could tell in his voice that he almost didn't want to ask the question (you know that feeling you get when you're asking a question that you might feel is stupid, or you'll get laughed at over, or you should know the answer to) and he said, ""where's meghan""?"	0
i'm meghan.	0
i'm the only meghan he knows.	0
i'm the only meghan in our family.	0
there is no other meghan.	0
"my brain was a bit slow on the uptake because i was distracted by this stupid dinosaur pattern so without even looking up i just said, ""you mean me?"""	0
"and he goes, ""oh, there you are!"""	0
and kinda chuckled.	0
but over the 20 minutes that have followed, it's really hit me.	0
my dad just asked where i was when i was sitting in plain sight of him.	0
did he forget my name?	0
did he not recognize me?	0
why did he ask it the way he did?	0
is this temporary or is this our new normal?	0
(my dad tends to have good days and bad days, maybe this is just bad days and he'll get better soon?)	0
i'm having a hard time with it.	0
part of me is freaking out because my dad forgot who i was.	0
part of me almost doesn't care because my dad and i aren't exactly close and i grew up with him largely not in my life so the emotional attachment is almost nil.	0
i cried for a few minutes but i'm not sure why.	0
having a hard time understanding my emotions surrounding this.	0
hopefully he doesn't forget who my son is anytime soon, those two are like best buds.	0
my grandpa passed away 10 years ago.	0
my grandmother has alzheimers.	0
my aunt has lenox-gaustaut epilepsy.	0
before my grandpa passed i promised him it was ok to go.	0
i would always take care of my aunt.	0
she is 6 years older than me.	0
she wears diapers, is mostly non verbal and has daily seizures.	0
she had internal bleeding and was in the hospital, shes been out almost 2 weeks, but she doesnt seem to be getting much better.	0
the bleeding was from an ulcer in her esophagus that ruptured.	0
she is weak and falls every time she tries to walk.	0
i talked to her doctor today and he said that she probably will never get all of the function she had before.	0
i feel like i missed it and she didnt go to the hospital soon enough.	0
i have been her caregiver for 10 years full time and 20 years all together.	0
i am so scared and feel so guilty for not noticing sooner that she was having problems.	0
i feel like a failure.	0
i've lived with my grandma for 8 years.	0
she has finally moved from stage 4 to stage 5 kidney failure.	0
she is mid-90s and is having some short term memory issues.	0
she regularly gets frustrated and asks why she is so tired when she hasn't done anything.	0
"it breaks my heart because the answer is ""because your kidneys are shutting down and you are going to get more and more sleepy until you just stop."""	0
it is very traumatic and heartbreaking and i don't know how to handle it...the doctor said it would probably be another 6 months to a year...or any time.	0
this might be a little bit of a long post, but all this has been really stressful to figure out and i'm hoping for some advice.	0
i'm sure many people here are going through similar situations, so i appreciate the help!	0
i'm a 23f who was adopted by my parents when they were in their 50s.	0
my mom just turned 73 and my dad 67. my mom's physical and mental health has slowly been declining in recent years.	0
she hasn't left the house since 2018 and has just started using a walker.	0
she's always been a very independent person and doesn't want any outside help (doctor, therapist, caregiver service, etc...) so my dad and i have been doing everything for her.	0
she seems to be in some denial about her condition and keeps tell us that she's getting better.	0
even so, her body is in a lot of pain and she frequently lashes out at us, which is especially hard since some of her pain could be eased if she'd go to a doctor.	0
we took in my grandma with alzheimer's back when i was 16, so i definitely know the toll that care giving can take and i don't feel like i'm prepared for my parents in the slightest.	0
a couple years ago, i promised my mom that i wouldn't move out till i got a degree and was financially stable.	0
flash forward to the present, and i have a great full-time position in my field and am graduating with my associate's in may.	0
i'm planning to continue with online college in july to get my bachelor's.	0
i've been looking around for apartments to rent and was approved for a one in a great neighborhood that i can afford.	0
the only issue is the move in date isn't till september.	0
my friend said i could move in with her until then, but my mom wants me to stay with them for another 6 months.	0
now i love my parents.	0
they've been some of the most amazing people i've ever known, but my mom and i's relationship has been deteriorating fast.	0
she deals with massive anxiety and has been getting more controlling the closer i get to moving out.	0
some of the stuff she tells me has been really hurtful and it's getting harder for me to be around her.	0
i know she's in a lot of pain, but i wish she wouldn't lash out so much.	0
i feel like every time we talk it turns into an argument.	0
even more now that she knows i'm getting ready to move out.	0
she's been really hostile about the whole situation, says that i don't care about them, and am abandoning them.	0
i don't intend to leave my parents to fend for themselves.	0
i've already been making plans to still be there for them as much as i can, but my mom keeps acting like she doesn't believe me.	0
i plan on helping them on my days off by cleaning, getting groceries, and giving my dad a break.	0
i currently am working remotely, so i can even work from their place as needed to provide extra help.	0
i just don't know if it's going to be enough.	0
my dad's health isn't in the best shape either and i feel immensely guilty and selfish about the whole situation.	0
i know when things get worse i'll eventually have to move back in, but i just want a chance to live my own life for a little bit.	0
i really would like to move out in may, but is that selfish of me?	0
should i stay till september?	0
apologies this is so long... i just dont know how to be concise about this.	0
my dad (71) has had ms for about 50 years and my mom has been his caregiver for their entire marriage.	0
my younger sister and i do not live in the area so try to find ways to support when we can, but arent able to provide consistent in person help.	0
the amount of care thats hes needed has increased over the years and our mom has been his full time caregiver for the last 10 years or so.	0
she has always shied away from taking good care of herself because she has always put my dads needs first.	0
she has some hobbies that are therapeutic for her, but she doesnt go to therapy or have many other confidants to process everything that is going on with my dads illness.	0
for now they dont have any in home nursing, but i could see that changing soon.	0
my dad  had a terrible fall a few weeks ago that required a long surgery and a few weeks of staying in a rehab facility.	0
long story short, his health is really declining from not being at home and under my moms care.	0
hes getting good care at the rehab facility, but they arent as attentive as my mom is.	0
on top of that hes dealt with some hospital psychosis which has just been so heart breaking.	0
seeing my dad go through this and deteriorate is becoming very difficult for my mom and im not sure how to support her from afar.	0
i would fly down to visit, but im recovering from hip surgery and cant travel for another month.	0
we talk about everyday or every other day and shes needed to verbally process more and more.	0
ive told her i am able to be a listening ear but i dont have the tools a therapist would have to really help.	0
i cant imagine how hard it is for my mom (my heart hurts for her so much), but im starting to feel like i am out of my depth.	0
i brought up finding a therapist again and she finally seemed receptive to it.	0
does this group have any suggestions on how i can support my mom?	0
my dads health is in the hands of the doctors and nurses, but i worry about who is taking care of my mom.	0
also if there are any books that are recommended for this situation, id be so appreciative.	0
thanks for reading.	0
my husband has been ill for the past 6-7 years but his healthy has gradually declined to the point that now he is on bed rest with constant debilitating migraines.	0
he is angry and frustrated.	0
there is a treatment to try and we are going to try it but it is a full month away and living like this is driving me insane.	0
he is rude and ungrateful for the things that i do and all of the responsibilities i took on.	0
if im honest he has always let me carry the burden of the household.	0
now i make all decisions for our daughter, make every meal for both of them, bring him water and remind him to drink/eat/lay flat/ email his doctors to check in on treatment etc.	0
today i took a nap and both of them woke me up and were laughing about how funny it was that they were waking me up to make them food.	0
i always make food for my daughter and its not a big deal to make food for him either but its the idea that my time isnt valuable that bothers me.	0
im also finishing up my last few weeks in my college classes and approaching finals and i have zero time to myself and for myself.	0
i think ive snapped.	0
i walked the dogs today and it started raining and i just... kept walking.	0
now i am no closer to being productive than i was earlier.	0
i guess im just venting but it would be nice to hear how youve all overcome these feelings of being unappreciated and unsupported.	0
so i'm not really here for any specific advice or anything, although comments and stories are more than welcome.	0
my grandma, who is sort of like a second mother to me, got diagnosed with stage 4 terminal ovarian cancer back in september 2018. at the time of finding it, it had already grown and spread far too much to ever be able to completely remove it or cure her.	0
they told us that she could either just live until it takes her (and at this time, they told us that would probably be 2-6 months) or she could do chemo to shrink the cancer and give her more time, but again, it would never be a cure or a fix.	0
she was only 63 at the time and was not at all ready to go, so she chose chemo.	0
also, around the time of diagnosis she started having neuropathy due to a stroke that they think was related to the cancer.	0
so not only was she dying from the cancer, but basically overnight she lost all mobility and freedom.	0
she couldn't walk or do anything alone.	0
because of that me, my mom, my aunt, and her ex husband (my grandfather) stepped in to rotate as full time caregivers for now two and a half years.	0
back in august the doctors noticed that the cancer was starting to grow even while on chemo.	0
"they had done many different types of chemotherapies to try and give her more time, and basically, the way it was told to us, was that her body sort of became immune to all of them and the cancer was beginning to outsmart the medicine, therefore, her ""extra time"" via chemo was coming to an end."	0
she stopped the chemo in early august of 2020. from then until now we have all noticed a slow decline in her health, her mobility, etc etc.	0
but the past month it has really gone downhill.	0
march 15th and 16th were the first two days we really noticed drastic difference.	0
those two days she stopped asking for her morning coffee, stopped eating often, and began sleeping a whole lot.	0
since then it's been a bit of back and forth between a few days of being really, really bad.... no eating, sleeping a ton, wanting to be left along, and then she will randomly come out of it for a day or two and come back and sit in the living room or on her patio and be more herself.	0
never eating a ton, but some days a few bites here and there.	0
we now know that this was likely the beginning of the pre-active phase of dying.	0
she has been in at home hospice since august when she ended chemo, and they have been incredibly helpful through all of this, educating us on the process of dying and trying to prepare us mentally and physically as best they can, but it has just been such an emotional rollercoaster with no real answers.	0
today she had a really bad morning, and for the first time seemed more incoherent than usual.	0
"saying things that don't make a lot of sense, speaking about/to somebody named robert who none of my family or i know of, even reaching her hands out to the foot of her bed, saying ""now?"""	0
in a happy tone with bright eyes.	0
this isn't even to mention the super swollen legs from clots that she is having, the skin mottling, etc.	0
basically, we know these are all signs of impending death.	0
but how do we know when she has gone from the pre-active stage to the active stage of death?	0
her main hospice nurse told us to be prepared because she could go at any time, but it could also be a couple of more weeks because she is a fighter who seems to be hanging on for family.	0
this is what is killing me most.	0
the waiting game.	0
the wondering if today will be the day.	0
how far away is that day?	0
how long does she have?	0
it's so mentally exhausting.	0
i'd love for anybody to share any advice or knowledge they may have or stories from dealing with the pre-active and active stages of dying.	0
thanks a lot.	0
xo	0
ok so i(m20) love my grandparents, and have always loved visiting/staying with them when i was younger.	0
they are now old and i have to come over in the morning and night to help them up and down the stairs, as well as drive them to appointments and it usually means i sit around in the house a lot or waiting around for them that being said one of my biggest pet peeves is hearing people eat food.	0
my grandfather is the worst offender of this and it actually just drives me up the wall it makes me so mad lol.	0
my grandmother also sits at her computer at nighttime like grunting and making a bunch of random little noises that have started to annoy me.	0
i also get like no quiet time so the time im at my grandparents would usually be my relaxation/quiet time but i dont get any now and its giving me this low level of resentment cuz of how frustrating it can be theres a lot more going on too because my grandmother is so stubborn and refuses to let me and my family do things to make there lives easier and more comfortable and causes huge unnecessary fights with everyone.	0
i think im getting some burnout here too but i just needed to vent and its driving me nuts.	0
like genuinely insane	0
i am currently taking care of my father who doesn't want help of any family members other than my mother who doesn't stay longer than 2 hr for once or twice a week.	0
parents are divorced.	0
i understand he is terminally ill but i am only 27 and i dropped everything for him.	0
my job and social life.	0
i'm trying to get him on medicaid he has really bad trust issues and doesn't want to give me his information.	0
he has food stamps but refuses to put food in the house.	0
receives money from the government but doesn't want to put a dime toward anything he wants i pay for everything out of pocket food, clothes everything.	0
he will demand me to ask my boyfriend for money for things for my house but my boyfriend does not live with us.... my family has offered to help.	0
refuses to wear the clothing his family has gotten him because i am running low on money.	0
if i can't get him on medicaid i can't afford any type of assistance for him and i want to know what i can do legally to get my father out of my house at this point i don't care where he goes he still has his apartment he pays rent for.	0
he told me he doesn't want to go back to his apartment but he keeps paying right there and he keeps it.	0
i told him his 3 living options were assistant living, his apartment or another family member and he wants assisted living but i can't get information out of him to apply and he can't apply on his own.	0
he is currently on in house hospice and they won't take him into a facility unless he is deteriorating at an alarming rate.... for whatever reason he does not trust his family he has also told me he does not trust me i feel like he is only here because the hospital told him he needed someone to take care of him.	0
my father stop being active in my life after i turned 18 i am currently 27. what should i do?	0
i don't want to be evil and drop him off at his apartment for him to struggle and suffer alone.	0
but he doesn't want anyone else is help in i will be homeless trying to take care of him.	0
other family members have offered to house him to feed him and to help him but he refuses.	0
i have started relapsing in things that i have recovered in, i have been fighting with my friends and boyfriend and i've been very unhealthy to myself because my mental health is deteriorating.	0
i can no longer stomach this.......my life is falling apart.	0
what do i do?	0
this is just a rant.	0
as caregivers, we're told to find time for ourselves, and it's true.	0
but how the hell do i do that when i hire help and then 3 weeks later they quit.	0
and then i bring in someone else, and every day for two weeks i'm correcting simple things that they should be doing.	0
or they can't decide if they want to show up at their assigned times and i have to pick up the slack.	0
i'll always be glad to do what i need to for my mom, but fuck some of these people.	0
this is my life, 24/7.	0
it's going to be.	0
but it almost seems like bringing in help is harder than just doing it myself.	0
i'm not sure what to do and am scared.	0
i'm not sure where else to ask this and since many of you have gone through some of this i'm hoping you can help.	0
my mom surged a stroke in jan with only some aphasia that we worked through.	0
however in march she was diagnosed with terminal cancer with 6 months left.	0
and at the beginning of this month she fell, and hurt herself and is unable to walk.	0
it's been a whirlwind to say the least.	0
on monday we will be bringing het home on hospice.	0
i'm freaking out.	0
what if we can't care for her.	0
my mom is a bariatric patient that outweighs me by at least 80 pounds.	0
i'm scared and am worried about what i don't know to expect.	0
it seems as if her cognitive ability has crashed in the past two weeks while in rehab.	0
when you brought your loved one home what would've helped you prepare better?	0
what do you wish you knew before hand?	0
what was surprising for you to find out?	0
does the fear of not being able to ever go away?	0
for those of you who's ss is heavier than you and bed bound, any tools you can recommend to make things easier on both of us?	0
thank you so much	0
so i have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and am not on meds.	0
my dad is disabled and needs to be taken care of, am i allowed to be his caregiver?	0
any help would be greatly appreciated	0
we have a commode, shower chair, wheel chair and walker.	0
extra lights for her room, i want to get plastic sheets for her bed.	0
is there a plastic sheet alternative for the floor because the woman can walk but will go to the bathroom as she is walking to the comode.	0
portable doorbell to call me in the middle of the night, what else?	0
should i get a baby monitor?	0
(i dont really want to get one has her tv will be blasting 24/7 but if i have to i guess i have to) we were going to get a bar for the toilet but if she is using the commode then why bother?	0
i'm going to be imprisoned in my house taking care of her anyways so i wont need life alert.	0
quick overview, i (29f) recently quit my job to move home and help my mom (60f) take care of my 91 year old grandma full time.	0
my mom and i trade off night shifts and whenever its my turn, i simply cannot sleep.	0
during the night, im constantly anticipating my grandma waking me up for something (water, bed adjustment, diaper change, nightmare, etc) and when its daytime and she or my brother takes over, i still cant sleep because its light out and everyone in the house is incredibly loud.	0
i can start to see and feel the effects of sleep deprivation on my body and mood.	0
im losing my appetite, im irritable, i have outbursts, i get lightheaded constantly, and i dont feel comfortable driving my car although i need to in order to run various errands.	0
i cant continue to function like this.	0
im constantly riddled with anxiety and although im exhausted, sleep evades me.	0
i know melatonin only works at night, so im at a loss.	0
please help.	0
yesterday we had to admit grandpa in....he was just at the hospital three weeks ago and now he's back.	0
the doctor came to speak to me and it was....not good.	0
i have to make a decision to put him on a feeding tube or let him be.	0
with a feeding tube, there's a small chance he'll do well and will stay alive.	0
but its not a solution.	0
he will be back one day, maybe soon.	0
as a 22 year old, its difficult.	0
i hate that i have to make that choice.	0
but its evident that my grandpa's time is almost up.	0
his body is shutting down slowly - he can't even eat properly bc he doesn't swallow.	0
it's heartbreaking to see.	0
he doesn't even fight the staff anymore bc he's weak now.	0
tonight i have to talk to everyone and let them know whats going on.	0
wish me luck.	0
ive been a caregiver for 3 years now.	0
and i just started working at a facility with people who have dementia.	0
i was appalled at what i saw today.	0
first, i found out that every person in that facility has had covid.	0
i had no idea.	0
thankfully im vaccinated but you would think thats something to disclose.	0
a resident urinated on the floor and no one cleaned it up.	0
one resident has a dog and they allow the dog to pee and poop all over their room, the smell is so horrific i gagged when they opened the door.	0
another resident doesnt speak english or understand english, and not one person makes an effort to use google translate to talk to them.	0
they walk around trying desperately to communicate and they cant.	0
lastly, there is one resident who is dying, no comfort is offered to them, they spent the whole day alone in their room.	0
i am disgusted and i dont want to work here.	0
i mean they dont even have books, magazines, or puzzles!!!!	0
nothing!!!	0
just todays hits playing.	0
should i quit??	0
?	0
i have a small business where i provide services to seniors.	0
it's mostly just non-medical companionship.	0
i love it, mostly.	0
i was referred a new client last week and was with her for 2 hours on tuesday and 3 hours on wednesday.	0
she's 65 and has cerebral palsy.	0
she may have mild cognitive impairment.	0
i'm not sure.	0
she was asking me for tasks constantly during the 3 hours we were together.	0
things like driving her to get a toy at mcd's, then a balloon, then to the drugstore to look for another toy, then to the library.	0
we were driving for almost 2 hours making stops.	0
when we got home, she was asking me to buy her 3 twelve packs of soda at the store near her condo, then helping her adjust bags in her closet, then sweeping the floor, then sorting her books.	0
it was brutal.	0
3 hours with her literally felt like 9 hours with my other clients.	0
it was grueling.	0
her sister told me she has tried to set boundaries for her non-stop requests to no avail.	0
how do you deal with nonstop requests for frivolous things?	0
i (22yo) need to hire someone to take over the minor care of my mother asap.	0
shes 42 years old and only needs help with very, very basic household things like occasional store trips (cigarettes/groceries/whatnot), light cleaning around the house and someone to walk her dog once a day.	0
sometimes she needs help making phone calls and scheduling doctors appointments and twice a month she needs someone to escort her home after ketamine infusions.	0
i have absolutely no idea how to go about finding someone to do all these things or if any or all of these things are fair things to ask of a home attendant or caregiver.	0
she has a chronic pain condition that limits her mobility but she doesnt require too much help.	0
does anyone have any advice at all or anything that might help me start my search?	0
can i find one person to do all these things or will i need a dog walker, someone to clean and someone separate to care for those other needs not met by the other two people?	0
help!	0
does anyone have experience with chronic cellulitis?	0
we wash feet in hibiclens and watch for breaks in the skin.	0
we never can see where the infection starts.	0
the doctors seem to not understand what or why of this.	0
hes had it four times since january.	0
i know this is a long shot but was hoping maybe someone had seen something similar.	0
just in need of some positivity.	0
how do you get through the day?	0
what helps you remember its all worth it?	0
i dont know what is the point of this post.	0
but i need it i guess.	0
three months ago, my dad had an epileptic seizure for a first time.	0
pretty scary and new for us.	0
since that day, he was diagnozed with three brain tumors, we do not know much about it.	0
some docs claim it is inoperable, but we know that two of the tumors are cancerous.	0
for three months i (24) am taking care of my father.	0
naturally, my mother must go to work everyday since my father cannot work anymore so i am the one staying with him.	0
my father does not requre any special treatment yet, he just needs to be watched almost all the time in case of another seizure - that is the easiest  job for a caregiver from all the jobs possible.	0
but.	0
the tumors are in the memory and speech area- my father is forgetting a lot, always talking about the same things, asking the same questions, always is talking about how life is not fair, how he wanted to do a lot of things, how he looked forward to retire and now everything is fucked up, how he is hurting, how he is bored, that he is just laying in bed for three months, and he wants to do the things he cannot do (drive a car, do stuff in the garden etc.)	0
and when i remind him that he just cant, he is angry af... yes, life is not fair, i dont know what its like to have a cancer and so, i absolutely agree with his problems, questions, complains and mental state.	0
i really want to help him, be the support he needs.	0
but he refuses any advice,  therapy, shuts down any kind of positive energy, activity, thought..i dont  know what to do.	0
i am a weak person i guess, and i am sorry.	0
i have to watch him , answer the same questions, cook, clean the house, take care of my dog, write my diploma thesis and prepare for the diploma exams, go to online classes, do the shopping all by myself and i am fucking exhausted.	0
i want to be more supporting, more positive, more understanding.	0
my mother cant help because the work.	0
my brother has his own life and works a lot.. the rest of my family cannot help because of the  corona.	0
i cant stand feelings of guilt, anger, loneliness and sadness anymore.	0
i honestly thought id be a pro at this caregiving thing.	0
i was a happy stay at home mom and a great house keeper before falling into this role.	0
i thought it would be natural transition.	0
its officially been 1 year and reality couldnt be more different.	0
the first 6-8 weeks were smooth.	0
i was honored to care for my grandpa in his old age.	0
i would play relaxing music and watch his westerns with him every night until he got tired.	0
i learned to cook his favorite recipes from scratch.	0
i made sure the house smelled nice and the atmosphere was comfortable.	0
i would have coffee with at the butt crack of dawn every morning.	0
he had just lost my grandma (married 63 years).	0
i didnt want him to be lonely.	0
i still remember the day things got rocky 8 weeks in.	0
there was a tiny tree far out on his property that he wanted cut down.	0
he said he heard it cracking and popping as if it would fall.	0
it was dead but it had been dead for years.	0
i cannot stress how small this tree was.	0
nobody in the house was in danger.	0
nobody went near this tree.	0
it was ~105f outside and not a necessary chore.	0
i told him no.	0
i told him to leave it be or call my dad since he did all of the outside property maintenance for my grandparents.	0
he threw a fit and told me i must want my child dead.	0
that it would fall on her and put her in a coma.	0
he got attitude id never seen before.	0
called me a negligent mother and told my husband he was lazy for not cutting it down.	0
we were floored.	0
quickly after that his true personality came out.	0
he tried more manipulation.	0
he became nosy and intrusive.	0
started picking us apart for our beliefs, weight, choices...literally anything.	0
he said if he was miserable he wanted everyone around him to be miserable too.	0
we tried communicating.	0
he refused so we set our boundaries and stuck to them.	0
that pissed him off more.	0
slowly i stopped spending so much free time with him since all he did was talk down to us.	0
our relationship has turned into a business transaction.	0
i cook, clean, pay his bills, and take him to appointments.	0
nothing else.	0
there is no grandfather/granddaughter relationship anymore.	0
i no longer have coffee with him.	0
no longer watch his westerns or make and effort outside of his normal care.	0
his nasty attitude has stuck since that day the tree almost fell.	0
my husband is fed up and angry.	0
hes works long hours and goes to college at night.	0
he wants to get the hell out of here but were stuck until he graduates in 2022. im upset that my grandpa is not the man i thought he was.	0
my parents tell me hes always had a nasty side but since i never saw i didnt believe it would happen to us.	0
they warned me and i ignored them.	0
i thought bc our relationship was different this would be easy.	0
clearly thats not the case.	0
i feel like i let my husband down.	0
i feel like this  toxic household is my fault.	0
maybe if i tired harder wed still be living here peacefully?	0
my grandpa says hes lonely a lot.	0
my parents visit 4x a week but thats not enough.	0
i told him wed spend more leisure time with him when he stopped crossing boundaries.	0
he denies he has attitude so we continue to stay in our bed room separate from him (once hes been fed and cared for of course).	0
its just bad feelings all around.	0
i hate it so much.	0
anyway.	0
if you made it this far thank you for listening.	0
it feels good to let this stuff out sometimes.	0
maybe im not the only one struggling with someone like this.	0

are you ok?	0
sending you warm embraces,  sending hugs.	0

thanks in advance for your thoughts	0
i'm in my late 20s stuck taking care of my elderly disabled grandmother and i hate it.	0
i'm going to sound heartless and i am but i have no relationship with this woman prior, my mother took care of her for a couple years until she died suddenly of cancer and prior to that my mother hated the woman because of how she treated her, she only reconciled because my grandmother had a stroke and no one to take care of her.	0
there's even some resentment, although unfairly, because this woman stole the last few years with my mother who was my best friend.	0
she made my father promise to take care of my gram, and naturally like everything my father pushed it onto me (he's abusive and loves the bottle more) i take care of all her needs from small stuff like changing tv channels to big stuff like bathing and feeding her.	0
she has gastritis she ignores and eats food that makes her shit everywhere and i'm left to clean it up, i asked doctors and they shrug and say since shes in her right mind and what not, i cant deprive her of what she wants.	0
i tried cooking her a diet that works with the illness and she flat out wont eat and sulks.	0
she's miserable to be around she sucks the life out of you, every time i sit with her she brings up my dead mother, my life failures, my dog that will be dead soon, yell at me for not doing things i'm supposed to (cant, i have to watch her).	0
she recently had a fall because up until then she was walking fine but she likes to turn and plop down onto things expecting she's fine, she did it when she lived alone she just doesnt pay attention.	0
now rehab says she's the best she'll be meaning i not only have to wash, bathe, and do everything else but that i'll have to stay on-call 24/7 for when she has to get up and hold her gait belt, i even have to get a buzzer for when she needs to get up at 3 am to go.	0
"not to mention she'll be making ""messes"" constantly."	0
this isnt the life i envisioned, i wont even have time to listen to music with headphones or leave to do boring errands, my life will be devoted to taking care of a miserable woman who treats me like crap all day.	0
i can't leave either, i'm mentally disabled with a chronic illness, you can't live on your own, i'm stuck.	0
everyone i reached out to agreed.	0
"it's just a miserable situation that everyone seems fine passing the buck off to me because ""i'm family""."	0
best part?	0
my father is going blind soon, so i'll have 2 seniors to take care of.	0
i have guilt because of how much i resent them, i know alot of it isnt their fault lord knows my grandmother has reasons to be miserable but how is it fair to me, to take someone who has to take medication just to be touched, now cleaning, wiping, bathing other people and getting more depressed because i'm told how much of a fuck up i am the entire time?	0
hello all.	0
brand new here but have been taking care of my mother since 2015. i'm curious if anyone has found a way to manage time and all of the duties that come with very little sleep and more to do than one person can do.	0
i have about 6 hours to do 18 hours worth of work with deteriorating physical health.	0
i can answer ahead of time and say that there isn't anyone else to help so no need in suggesting that.	0
i'd like to hear someone's schedule and how they cram everything in and stay on top of it.	0
has anyone out there maintained an insane schedule and be able to stay balanced or is this something intrinsically impossible?	0
thanks	0
i (25f) am the primary caretaker of my grandmother (85f) and at first i was excited to be spending all of this time with her.	0
i love her so much.	0
but its been really hard and i had no way of knowing just how taxing it would be mentally.	0
she resents me for helping her and, for the first time in my life, has begun to be cruel to me.	0
shes kicked me out of her house for asking her to shower, take medicine, etc.	0
i call her before i come over to remind her to take her medicine and im realizing now that the decline has truly begun.	0
she cant find things that have not been moved in months, and insists they arent there (her calendar for example).	0
and this morning i called and she said she was taking her medicine while on the phone.	0
i heard her sip her water and then i got here to pick her up and there her medicine is, still in its labeled cellophane package, on her bedside table.	0
she also keeps forgetting who my dad is even though he sees her almost daily for a little check in (he lives just a few blocks away).	0
its just been super tough lately and any tips on transitioning through this mentally would be greatly appreciated.	0
if you read this far, thank you.	0
if im screaming into the void, thank you.	0
tldr my oma (dutch) is finally going off the deep end and im trying to figure out how to deal with it mentally being her primary caregiver and most involved granddaughter	0
hey all, firstly i want to show some love to all us caregivers doing the hardest job we've ever loved.	0
shout out to the strength and vulnerability we all share here.	0
secondly, does anyone have any advice or knowledge about assisted living when on either plan?	0
my mom is declining rapidly and it's to the point that instead of living with me, i'm taking more care of her than i can handle as an only child working 15 hour days.	0
she can do some thing independently and i'm totally willing to help her as i can.	0
do her laundry, cook, shop for her, help her shower; but a nursing home will take a huge chunk of her quality of life away.	0
she's only 65 and i really feel that she would be completely miserable there.	0
we've had terrible experiences in nursing homes when she's gone for rehab from injuries and i really fear about that happening again.	0
"she's not one to speak up much because she ""doesn't want to get anyone in trouble""  however, i need my life back."	0
i'm 31 and have been by her side for the last 5 years.	0
i'm exhausted and truly can't see my life getting any better financially, emotionally or mentally; than hers if things stay this way .	0
she just needs more and i'm lost on how to help.	0
does going to a facility mean she loses her ssdi, car (as just an asset), life insurance and bank account?	0
"i don't want her to feel like everything has been ""taken"" from her because she truly is an angel and has worked so hard for so long to achieve goals."	0
thank you for any and all help, i appreciate everyone!	0
i finally got assigned a caregiver.	0
unfortunately she is underpaid and i dont really know what to do about that.	0
theres strict rules against supplementing the pay and i dont want to get kicked off the program so i have to wait till i know her before i can do anything like that.	0
what else can i do to make it a better job?	0
i have 18 hours a week and i probably only need like 10 so they will have lots of downtime or can work at whatever pace they want.	0
i'm getting some help to detail my house so it's super clean and organized when she starts.	0
i thought of maybe writing a list of what all needs to get done, but i dont know if this would seem too bossy or not.	0
i also though of writing a list of things that might be useful to know about me, just cause i have periods of being nonverbal and though it might be useful, like what all i generally need help with and what symptoms are normal and not to worry about (like sometimes people think i'm having a seizure when i'm not).	0
but i dont know if this will seem too pushy or weird.	0
i dont know, i dont want to come on too strong, but i want to do whatever i can to make things as easy as possible.	0
people have a hard time keeping caregivers that arent family or friends so i want this person to have the best job possible.	0
i constantly work to become more independent, hopefully i will need her help less and less as time goes on.	0
i'm also super flexible with scheduling.	0
really i'm thinking of just letting her know what my awake hours are and letting her know she can work whenever she wants as long as we get the basics taken care of (like bathing twice a week- but any time or day is fone as long as it's a few days apart).	0
i dont know what the hardest part of caregiving is, besides the lousy pay.	0
i've even considered asking if she wants to work a few extra hours and then just pay her crazy good for that time to balance out the other hours, still waiting to hear back of that's allowed.	0
any input would be appreciated.	0
sorry if this is the wrong sub, i wasn't sure where something like this would get responses.	0

im 56m caring for my 83y old father.	0
tonight as im packing ham, from the fridge to the freezer.	0
he says, son you left the fridge door wide open as hes walking by from the restroom to his tv room having no clue what i was working on.	0
then i sort of exploded and said at 56 i can count on one hand the number of times youve passed me and said i love you.	0
here i am putting away the dinner and freezing some left overs, and the best you got is ive left the fridge door open  do you know how many times i tell my kids i love them?	0
he says i apologize but, i love you just isnt a word weve used around here ugh!!	0
no wonder why i have issues, been divorced twice and now living at home taking care of dad.	0
hello,  im new to caregiving.	0
i have an older patient with dementia and sundowners.	0
she gets agitated easily and im just trying to find ways i can distract her and make her feel in better mood next time i see her.	0
shes not mobile so i cant do anything really exercise related with her.	0
anything yall recommend?	0
how do you respond to a spouse who is in their 30s?	0
they're condition is deteriorating and they are giving up?	0
honestly.	0
we can understand why they are doing so.	0
we are drowning and don't know what to do.	0
my (40sf) dad (68m) was diagnosed last month with gbm, it's been a rollercoaster the last 3 weeks.	0
after the biopsy he was unable to walk or sit up on his own, his neurosurgeon directed us to place him in a nursing home.	0
he was discharged to a nursing home, they literally did not take care of his basic needs, he went without clean clothes for 3 days, no assistance to/from the bathroom, feeding, bathing, oral care for 5 days.	0
my mom (67f) and i got him out of there as fast as we could and he's now home.	0
his agitation has eased somewhat, he's wobbly when he's walking, has no pain complaints, and we have hospice assistance in home 2x a week to help him bathe.	0
i make most of the meals and take them over, do grocery runs, order necessities from amazon or buy in our local shop.	0
this is all unbelievably overwhelming for my mom, she's watching my dad worsen each day.	0
glioblastoma is fast.	0
he was driving a month ago.	0
what can i do to help my parents?	0
what support should i be giving my dad?	0
how can i support my mom?	0
thankfully we are neighbors, so that helps.	0
:)	0
pre illness my dad was a very intimidating guy to the point that his requests sounded like demands.	0
"he wasnt aggressive or anything but just his demeanor and his authority kind of made you ""hop to it"" fast forward to his illness he is still that demanding guy but some of his demands are a bit ridiculous."	0
my family says i spoil him because i do whatever he asks (they do too but because i'm the main caregiver the burden falls on me).	0
his demands are sometimes irrational and i feel that what he wants isnt always a need and it can wait.	0
he hates it when i go against him.	0
he gets frustrated and he pulls the woe is me card.	0
he gets all morose saying that if he wasnt ill he'd be able to do it himself or he shouldve just died instead of being a burden on us.	0
for example today after his bed bath he wanted to sit outside in the sun.	0
ok no problem i got him dressed he sat outside for 30 minutes.	0
we then took a short walk down the street and he went inside to his recliner.	0
it's pretty hot out (florida) so by the time he came in the back of his shirt was sticking to him.	0
it wasnt soaked but it was visibly damp.	0
so i grabbed a new shirt and grabbed his scale for his daily weigh.	0
i get his feet up on the scale and as i'm trying to get him to stand he asks me to change his shirt.	0
shirt in hand i say ok i will just stand up for a second so that i can get your weight.	0
cue the tantrum.	0
he gets all woe is me and fussy.	0
so i get his shirt off, which takes a minute because he's hemiplegic, then weigh him.	0
these little things bother me to no end.	0
everything has to be done his way and it's annoying.	0
i understand that a lot of it is about him having some control over his life but ugh.	0
i have to deal with this all day.	0
every little tiny thing.	0
i have little to no control of my life.	0
everything i do is for him.	0
i wait on him hand and foot.	0
i'm constantly either doing something for him, about to do something for him, or waiting to do something for him.	0
i'm 29 y.o and have been resenting him soooooo hard lately.	0
dont get me wrong he is a great dad.	0
he provided for me financially and he takes care of the family but he was absent in other ways that hurt.	0
i'm in need of some heavy therapy if it isnt obvious but i'm broke (not working because of caretaking) have no insurance (see: not working) and take very little care of my mental health anyway (e.g.	0
my life).	0
i spend a lot of time thinking if i had gotten sick and he was well i know for sure no one in my life let alone this house would care for me the way i do them especially not my dad.	0
just another weekly rant.	0
i hate my life.	0
hello everyone, my name is devon.	0
tl:dr: i am a [31f] taking care of my father, a [59m] who had 2 strokes in september 2020. my family of 5 moved into his house in october to care for him and my two young sisters he has joint custody of.	0
i'm losing my mind.	0
i have worked my entire life towards pleasing my father.	0
it was conditioned into me at an early age.	0
he started a restaurant franchise, and groomed me to take over from the get go.	0
i have dedicated most of my life to helping him achieve his goals, and do all the paperwork for said business.	0
while starting his business he found out he was type 2 diabetic, but because he was preoccupied, never cared for himself properly.	0
in july of 2020, i told him i was done at the end of the year and would be focusing on my own family for a while.	0
i have 3 children, all with their own unique needs and extra curriculars.	0
my husband works from home, and has a fairly demanding job.	0
at the beginning of september my father suffered two strokes (one hemorrhagic he left untreated for almost a week, and then an ischemic 2 weeks later).	0
the week after the second stroke, his youngest daughter [11] went into dka and was lifelined to our state's children's hospital.	0
she was diagnosed type 1 diabetic, to go along with her severe nut allergies and asthma.	0
our father remained in the hospital/rehab until the end of october.	0
it was decided between my sister and i, that i would move in to his house so he could continue to have uninterrupted 50% custody and help care for my young sisters, since he wasn't able to.	0
so here we are 5.5 months later.	0
my dad doesn't want to do his exercises, or eat properly.	0
the older of my two young sisters [14] is bound and determined to end up in juvie.	0
everyday is it's own new challenge.	0
how do you not lose your mind?	0
i feel like a mother to 6. i'm a 31 year old who practically adopted teenagers with no clue what i'm doing.	0
my father is stubborn and grumpy and starts more problems than he tries to solve.	0
the dishes never end.	0
the laundry never stops.	0
the restaurant never stops needing something.	0
corporate always has questions.	0
paperwork always piles up.	0
i tried to learn my stress levels this year, sand they have tripled instead.	0
please send help!	0
any good online reads for learning how to deal with a dementia patient?	0
perhaps there is no amount of reading that can better equip me.	0
i just feel like i am constantly loosing my patience and every thing is a loosing battle.	0
there are still things they can do for themselves but then there are parts they can't do and it seems to change everyday.	0
and i try to anticipate the problems and come up short.	0
it's unreasonable that i get so agitated every day when they put on their oxygen tube or when they keep turning the portable oxygen machine off.	0
if they were in a wheelchair i would not get mad they can't walk.	0
is it just that see saw between what they can't do and what they can do that makes me upset?	0
because not course i never mind helping them.	0
hello everyone, my name's sonic!	0
and i'm feeling might conflicted at the moment.	0
so there's a few things.	0
1. i went and saw my psychologist yesterday (my neurologist wants me to see her for stress management and to keep on top of brain stuff.)	0
so, i got the results of that really long personality test thingie back.	0
welp, i'm not faking it like the government thinks!	0
:d so that's a positive.	0
but, she also ran another mmse.	0
they started the mmse when i first started and i was at 28-29. now, i'm at a 21.  and, well.. i don't know what to do anymore.	0
she's finding me this workbook that she's heard of.	0
but it just, i don't know, kind of hit me like a box of rocks.	0
i was thinking i was going to be much higher at around a 25-26, not a 21.  it's frightening.	0
i'm way too young to be experiencing this time of stuff and nobody can figure out why...	0
my mom has dementia and about a month ago she stopped eating and was put on hospice.	0
she started to decline and was slowly dying from severe dehydration.	0
i couldn't take my mom dying in that way and asked for them to put her on an iv for a couple of days, but that same day i requested the iv her kidneys shut down.	0
so now she's dying from kidney failure which to me is more peaceful than the dehydration death.	0
my blood pressure is ranging from 130/96 to 102/60 throughout the day.	0
i'm so stressed out and i cry all the time.	0
no one in my family has ever died on hospice.	0
she is the first one that i know of.	0
it's hard for me but i'm glad she's still hanging in there.	0
i'm the only family member that cares about her and i have been taking care of her for 2 years because she had breast cancer at one point.	0
i feel like my anxiety and emotional stress are getting the best of me.	0
people tell me to take off a few days from her, but to me, i will just have to walk right back into this situation at some point.	0
i love her very much.	0
my mother finally found peace following a 13-month battle with glioblastoma.	0
it's weird; right after she was taken away, i sat there not sure what to do with myself.	0
she's been the focus of my time and attention since lockdown.	0
i want to thank this sub for the support.	0
i didn't post a lot, but when i did, every one was kind and supportive.	0
this experience has changed me so much.	0
i'm always going to wish i could have done more or been a better carer, but that's something i'm going to have to work through.	0
thank you again.	0
and, of course, love and strength to everyone who cares for others.	0
i've (27f) been debating about posting on here for weeks now about my situation.	0
it's pretty hard for me to open up but i'll try my best... so some background story.	0
my mom (63) is suffering from dementia and it's progressed so quickly i don't even know what to do, in a total of 3 months she went from forgetting a few things to not being able to do anything on her own, i care for her with help of a part-time wound nurse.	0
the upside is at least she still knows me and loves me.	0
due to her dementia her nutrition levels have gone down and she doesn't like to move out of bed and shes pretty weak even though she still has days she's really lively and happy she's just always been good at hiding her pain from me.	0
long story short she had to be admitted to the hospital from an infection in her knee (a knee she had a complete replacement on) so at one hospital the took out the prosthetic and eventually transferred her to a hospital with a better specialist.	0
here they are giving me two options.	0
complete reconstruction on her knee or an amputation.	0
the doctor said the only reason these are the options is because he doesn't believe she strong enough to recover from the reconstruction of her knee.	0
she still has some insight to what's going on but not much.	0
i just don't know what to do.	0
if anyone has experience with a family member who has dementia and needed a amputation i would appreciate to know how that outcome was physically and mentally.	0
also either way the doctor said she will be bed bound reconstruction or not.	0
looking to hire a live in caregiver in lake oswego oregon.	0
me (32yo) and my partner have been caring my father (81yo) who has vascular dementia but is ambulatory and continent (with the occasional accident).	0
"we previously have been asking favors from friends to ""babysit"" and prepare food for him but as we are looking to the future, i've been trying to research some respite care options."	0
there are so many though!	0
does anyone have any advice on finding a company, what to look for, expected price range(s), and anything else we should be expecting?	0
we live in the atlanta area.	0
i really appreciate the advice.	0
i am just always angry at my father.	0
i need to vent so hard.	0
this is long.	0
he planned for us to be his caretakers and friends.	0
i grew up with the abuse while my younger brother did not.	0
my dad would mention how when he is older, we would be taking care of him.	0
i told him i'm sending you to a retirement home.	0
his health was never good.	0
he never took care of himself, hated seeing doctors, had jobs that refused to give him hours, refused to go for job advancement exams, and at the same time never seemed like it was about working hard for our futures.	0
it felt like as soon as we would be old enough to work we need to pay rent.	0
as soon as we were sixteen, we were screamed to get a job to no longer be a financial burden to him.	0
my dad never could afford us.	0
child support was never enough.	0
he would keep us from our dreams with requests to find a job, don't go to places, go to college, but i am in college too long.	0
i need to get a job.	0
a job!!!!!	0
he would interrupt my doing school work all my life as it was an inconvenience the time and work required.	0
my brother went to a two year program for his dream career which honestly i never saw him that interested in.	0
but he dropped that path after finishing his two year program for a retail job a friend got him.	0
he needed to help out around the house.	0
i was struggled to find a job and keep it.	0
i'm not a fast paced worker and have late diagnosed autism.	0
i was forbidden to volunteer or do internships that would benefit my major.	0
i needed to help out.	0
i spent those summers from college doing nothing valuable as i never got hired.	0
i kept hearing we three could rent a better place.	0
all my life as children i was okay to have around as a portion of rent at a better home (fantasy).	0
he dislikes that i am so different in thoughts and personality from him and my brother.	0
i care about people and the world outside of him.	0
he would threaten to kick me out multiple times, saying i am ungrateful and rude when i never did what he wanted of me.	0
how dare i insult him by saying we should look into eating healthier or need to be on the computer long to do twenty page papers.	0
how dare i do my school work.	0
i am doing nothing when i should be having a job!!!!	0
i don't care about him he said as i was asking if we can have skinless chicken thighs on a rack.	0
i am insulting them as both are overweight and insecure about it.	0
my father is a horrible uncaring person, and i think he had us to fill a loneliness, to have friends, and to help support him.	0
then a couple years ago while i had a part-time job i was kicked out.	0
my brother made my father choose.	0
my brother makes more to support him, and my father could no longer work.	0
my father keeps saying it is unfair i don't give him money, any little bit.	0
he needs money.	0
he's always needed money.	0
my 94 year old mom is now on hospice, very weak, incontinent and unable to move.	0
shes just short of 200 lbs., eats well and her mind is sharp.	0
shes tired, as expected, and sleeps most of the day.	0
shes been diagnosed with copd and chf.	0
she doesnt have long.	0
my dilemma.	0
i currently have severe back problems that cause me much pain when i walk.	0
i cant lift mom, roll her to change her diaper or reposition her.	0
i need help, which is expensive but im managing.	0
the hospice nurse, social worker, case manager and physical therapist have all suggested that a group home might be a good fit for mom, with 24 hour care.	0
we found one, run by a social worker and a nurse.	0
beautiful home, private room, home-like setting at  a price i can afford- but just one problem.	0
theyll only allow me to visit twice weekly due to their covid restrictions.	0
im vaccinated, mom isnt.	0
what would you do?	0
my mom is dying.	0
id like to see her more often than twice weekly.	0
these restrictions seem harsh.	0
even the rehab centers and nursing homes allow daily visits after testing and while wearing their ppe.	0
i sat on this post a little while, so i do feel less charged as im posting this now.	0
still, i feel this way quite often and hope that maybe others in a similar situation will read my darker thoughts and not feel so alone?	0
anyway... hi all, its me again.	0
so many of yall had such kind words for me the last time i was nearing a breakdown.	0
im not in as bad a place as last time, but i just got into another fight with my mom (41yo).	0
im 22 and have been caring for her for most of the last year.	0
i keep mentioning that ill be leaving in june (for a graduate program that will inform the basis of my future career) and every time i bring it up, she gets really angry/sad and says really mean things to and about me.	0
when i try and talk to her about what she says she either starts crying because shes scared of becoming like her abusive father or she accuses me of emotional blackmail and gaslighting her.	0
i absolutely cannot continue doing this indefinitely and i cant just ignore the fact that im leaving until i leave because last time i tried that there was a huge blowout fight.	0
im in therapy twice a week where im trying to be okay with her being upset with me and shes in therapy twice a week too.	0
i dont know what shes working on but her chronic pain is probably a much bigger focus for her than my feelings and our relationship.	0
i know theres a point where i have to just back up and be okay with her saying things about me but i just keep wondering if i am being abusive or manipulate or if im gaslighting her without knowing it.	0
i dont want to be that type of person.	0
anyway, that was all... im just struggling emotionally, and most of my time is spent grappling with the fact that i hate being with her and i hate spending time at home but she needs me and my feeling bad just makes her feel worse.	0
any kind words would be greatly appreciated.	0
tyia...	0
hello everyone.	0
thank you all for listening, being here to hear us vent and for all of the advice/comfort.	0
i'm a very new care giver (40s m, son) and now am only about 8 months into care giving for my mom who had a stroke 2 1/2 years ago and was starting to show signs of dementia prior to said stroke.	0
my father was her care giver up until his passing last july.	0
after his death, i decided that i would quit my cozy and very good paying it job at a large law firm and move in with my mom at our family farm in rural mn.	0
so far things with mom have been going rather good (knock on wood), her and i have always gotten along very well and she still recognizes who i am and she is also pretty easy to care for.	0
she can bath herself, eat, walk and carry on basic conversations on topics her brain still can remember.	0
she also likes the food i cook (which i never really did being single), cleaning we do and games we play.	0
however as the months have gone on, the issues i'm having are related to our farm.	0
its like everything is literally falling apart each day.	0
today it was the garage door and that issue just kind of broke me a little on the inside.	0
their farm home is prob over 100 years old and really starting to show its age; electrical is half modern and half old/out of code wiring, concrete slabs are all cracking / breaking, sheds/barns falling apart and down, trees dying and falling.	0
to top it all off, they have two kitties (which are the sweetest kitties ever) and one is about 14 yrs old and requires three meds each day and a saline injection every other.	0
i just am feeling a bit overwhelmed this week since i've been looking at everything the last few months and the amount of things that are old, broken, need fixing just keep coming and added to my list.	0
mind you, i'm an absolute computer geek/nerd but not very well versed in maintanence or construction (i also own a condo in minneapolis and reason i own said condo is because i didn't want to have to deal w/the things i'm now having to deal with).	0
oh yea, i forgot that they also usually had a garden each year too and about an 2-3 acres worth of lawn to mow along with old tractors not working now and lawn mowers/weed wackers/tillers that don't start and hell i don't even know if they are diesel or gas or gas mixed w/oil let alone the starting procedures (which i can find online but..) not really looking for advice but mainly just needed to rant, get things off my chest... i seriously wish my dad would have asked or hired more people to fix these things.	0
he was a very independant, man of many trades and damn good at it and they did have a good savings he could have tapped into to get things fixed.	0
i guess i'm just a little annoyed, frustrated with dealing with it all when i know if addressed sooner than later it wouldn't be where it is now.	0
yes, i knew this wouldn't be easy but i didn't expect to have to deal with so many things in so many areas and get frustrated.	0
the care giver part feels easy compared to all of the other things.	0
today was one of my first days where i had to go out to the garage and just sit for a few mins and have a smoke.	0
i really missed my prev life today; my modern tech filled condo that required zero work, my high paying it job that i was a rockstar at, having weekends to just sit in bed or on my couch and game.	0
so mad props to all of you other care givers, esp those that have been doing this for years.	0
you are all saints, amazing people.	0
sorry for the long rant/vent but todays garage door problem was the straw that broke this camels back for a little bit.	0
i'm better now but dread what will be the next thing to break.	0
very tempted to say fuck it and just tear down the old house and build a smaller single level 2 bedroom so i'd have one less thing to worry about.	0
love you all, hope your day is going better than mine and always.	0
peace and love to the best bunch of redditors on this earth and for the work you do.	0
hello!	0
i've been taking care of my grandfather in california (78 with alzheimer's and dementia) for awhile now since he is running low on funds and cannot afford to stay in a senior care center.	0
i was looking into possibly finishing my bachelors online and taking care of him full time and ihss would be the way to go for the additional funding, allthough as he has medicare it seems he does not qualify for this.	0
is there a way around this problem?	0
would anyone recommend a different method of paying for his care?	0
i know my situation is nothing compared to what so many of you are facing but i have to get this out somewhere.	0
im on day 9 of covid quarantine and finally reached a breaking point today.	0
the whole family (mom, younger sister, and i) got sick.	0
ive been caring for my mom, sister, the house, and managing contact with the outside world for everyone this whole time and it feels like i never got to recover.	0
im exhausted, im supposed to go back to work tomorrow, and im sick of taking care of everyone when im sick too.	0
im only 22... i yelled at my sister today that shes 14 and needs to start carrying her own weight (or even just pick up after herself).	0
i cried.	0
i feel terrible emotionally and physically.	0
my mom has pneumonia now and is completely helpless but simultaneously the most needy and obnoxious person ever.	0
nothing i do is right or good enough.	0
i have a great supportive family and i love them so much i just dont want to do this anymore.	0
i feel like myself and my family are in a rock and a hard place.	0
my mom has been bed bound for the past few years due to a deteriorating left hip.	0
she last saw the doctor for it in 2018 and hasnt been back since due to her mobility declining.	0
this is due to after she had her left hip replaced, she decided after 6 physical therapy sessions that she didnt need it anymore as well as exercises at hone and stopped everything.	0
this has caused her left hip to compensate and speed up the wear and tear on it and ultimately has now taken her mobility.	0
she has had several sessions of home care and physical therapy come out and treat her but to keep her motivated to do what she needs to do to get better doesnt last long.	0
shes also diabetic on top of everything else.	0
she cant pivot to get out of bed and when she sits up, she complains thats shes lightheaded and dizzy, probably because shes been sitting in a certain position for so long.	0
i think she may have congested heart failure and shes lost a considerable amount of muscle tone.	0
i dont know what to do to help her and to see her like this, its so frustrating to just accept it and do nothing.	0
my dad is retired from his job and he saw them traveling together as well as moving to fl.	0
all of it is on hold until she gets better.	0
some days i dont think she wants to.	0
my dad has, naturally, a considerable amount of weight on him being her caregiver but it would be easier on him too if she did some things to help herself.	0
she just doesnt.	0
if any of you reading this have been in a similar boat, how did you motivate your loved one to get better?	0
we all want to see her walking and be mobile again.	0
she has said she wants it as well but then also talks about being fine if shes destined to be in a motorized wheelchair.	0
i am worried that maybe her left hip is to far gone and theres nothing they can do being its been 3 years since its been looked at-but thats something you dont know until it comes to that and im not thinking that way right now.	0
any help or advice is appreciated more than you know.	0
thanks in advance.	0
im struggling hard tonight.	0
i want to fix this for my dad so badly but i cant and i hate it.	0
i hate that he has no idea whats going on or why its happening and i hate that i cant just make this all better for him.	0
he always made everything better for me and i cant do the same for him.	0
im frustrated and angry that i cant help him.	0
this process sucks.	0
it just freaking sucks.	0
summary: wife and i are in our early 30s, no kids but a few pets.	0
ive worked from home since the pandemic and my wife hasnt worked since a little bit after that.	0
so were home all the time anyway.	0
my grandma is mid 80s, and has been living alone for a few years.	0
she has a rough time at night due to sun downers, and has her kids over multiple times a day for small things like getting the tv working, whereas night time calls are more anxious like thinking theres someone at the window.	0
we offered to move in with her and help take care of meals, mobility, tech, etc.	0
but im worried sun downers may be too advanced for two newbies to properly help with.	0
were used to quiet evenings and know this will be a change but thought she would be happier in her own home vs an elder care facility.	0
im wondering if the change of us living there plus our pets and bringing our own stuff with might just make it worse.	0
would appreciate any advice from people who have made this decision before.	0
are you glad you did it, would you do it again given the chance?	0
any thoughts on the pet situation?	0
theyre like our kids and we dont want to have to choose between them.	0
thanks in advance.	0

i realize that my elderly relative was having trouble cleaning back there so i got a toto attachment bidet toilet seat.	0
i must be missing something because no matter how long i run it for them on all the different settings ( different positions, pulsating isolating) they still managed to stand up and get refuse all over the floor.v the only thing i can think of is that maybe my house water pressure isn't good?	0
i've never used one, people seem to love them from all the reviews that i read  do these really get you clean?	0
can anyone comment?	0
i really thought i had the perfect solution.	0

so this is my first and probably only post, (since i want to stop being so scared of this damn demon spawn!	0
), but i have a question.	0
my family has never had a history of dementia.	0
my mother and her family members have told me over the years that the family line has never had dementia.	0
my grandmother (whose's around 80 now) can recall stories from as far back as 1950. and according to my mom, my grandfather (who died 3 years before i was born) stayed alert and sharp until he passed away in his 90s.	0
my ex father's family side also had no sign of dementia.	0
&#x200b; but do i have a chance of getting dementia still?	0
i've read that it's genetic but after listening to everywhere at the end of time, i've been terrified of dementia.	0
i just wanna know if i'll have it or not, with the knowledge my family has given me.	0
i'm 31 with 3 kids which obviously has its own stressor.	0
in the past year my mother who has had krohns for my whole life has also been diagnosed with duodenal cancer.	0
they cut out 2/3 of her stomach to try and avoid chemo, but it was unsuccessful.	0
now she has fistulas from surgery that refuse to heal so she can't start chemo or try any other operation.	0
she's dieing in front of me with nothing to do for it.	0
its so hard.	0
my grandmother has copd and dementia, that in the last two weeks has gotten much worse( the dementia).	0
my mom has no license and my grandmother is in no state to drive.	0
i drive them to all their appointments,pick up all the medicines , drive for surgery/appts/ etc 6 hours away somewhat frequently.	0
since covid i got on unemployment and have stayed on it longer than i would have probably because they started to decline around the same time.	0
so income has reduced drastically.	0
on top of it my best friend has (i believe) undiagnosed schizophrenia or multiple personality disorder and wont get help/ believes he doesn5 need it, and i'm his main source of venting or aid when he needs it.	0
and i constantly feel like i'm neglecting my kids,wife, mom, grandmother,friend, and self because they all neeed so much.	0
and they all make me feel that way too.	0
(besides kids).	0
im short and angry a lot so my wife gets mad and i just feel like i'm on the edge of a mental break.	0
( not suicidal at all, just...i don't know what i am)sorry this is so long, i just..... i feel like i'm going to break, i try so hard.	0
i'm irritable, tired, stressed, depressed, and crumbling.....is there any kind of programs or anything that can help me?	0
not even with money although it would help.	0
but with managing all this stuff, or rides or help with grief.... i don't know... help with knowing what i need help with.	0
thank you in advance for any suggestions.	0
it's getting so bad i can't think straight and have trouble with everyday tasks that i normally do almost without thinking like make a transfer through online banking.	0
like i'm just flooring it full speed through dense fog.	0

if this is not the appropriate subreddit, please feel free to remove it.	0
my (35f) friend (55f) has been her husbands caregiver for about 3 months.	0
he has end stage liver disease, and while getting evaluated for a transplant, the doctors discovered he has a very aggressive form of cancer.	0
he is not eligible for a transplant now and the treatment for the cancer will complicate his treatment for the liver disease.	0
my friend is devastated and exhausted, but she is incredibly independent and does not want to burden anyone with her problems.	0
i understand completely how she feels, as she is a very selfless person who takes great pride in hard work.	0
she does not have any local family and neither her nor her husband have any family that is in a position to help with his care, so right now she is the sole caregiver and breadwinner for her husband (she is on leave from work right now).	0
she has been an incredible mentor to me and is an absolute lynchpin for our workplace.	0
she is an eternal optimist and can find a silver lining in any situation, including the one shes in right now.	0
but i (along with our coworkers) worry about her mental and emotional health during this incredibly challenging time.	0
it would be enough to break the strongest person.	0
i have offered her my ear, to send or pick up food/groceries for her, money for home health care help, etc.	0
i text and call her at least once a week to check on her, but she usually doesnt reply or pick up, which is absolutely fine.	0
it is just out of character when we typically talk/text every day both at and away from work.	0
our coworkers even refer to her as my work wife because we work so well and often with each other.	0
we are extremely close friends and what shes going through breaks my heart.	0
i adore her and there is no favor she could ask that my family wouldnt do for her.	0
i know that having help (especially home health care) would ease her burden, but i dont want to be too pushy.	0
she is very isolated right now and even though i know she is a strong person and could get through everything alone if needed, she doesnt have to.	0
my question is: how often and to what extent do i offer help?	0
i dont want to do anything that causes her more stress.	0
any ideas on what kind of help to offer, ways to show support, or resources would also be appreciated.	0
thanks!	0
i've been on here through various accounts.	0
my grandmother passed from this disease coming on 2 years ago and i still hurt like she just passed.	0
over the years during her care, i worked in healthcare where i'd see various patients, some with dementia.	0
it ranged from someone starting to need care because they didn't remember meds/lived alone/disappear for days on end, etc.	0
but two specific people stay in my mind, one of them having a medical chart that stated the title.	0
the woman came in when covid was really just starting to ramp up.	0
she was in a facility and i guess had symptoms after covid hit the nursing homes here.	0
she wouldn't respond to her name.	0
she wouldn't respond to requests for a name, dob, etc or to put on her armband.	0
i did like i would do for my own grandmother and just talked her through everything i was doing (mainly putting the armband on and then adjusted her sheets).	0
"but reading that phrase-""severely demented"" brought me almost to tears."	0
my grandmother never got to that state.	0
she was able to somewhat respond until she fell comatose.	0
she could say yes or no to whether she was in pain and even could muster a good morning every now and again.	0
she knew us and even could name my godfather by name while in hospice care.	0
but seeing this woman and a man a year prior who was in a similar state saddened me.	0
this disease is treacherous.	0
it triggers me when i see people fighting this disease, being taken down by something that could've been out of their control or hell, even if it wasn't (noncompliance with high bp meds for example), no one deserves this.	0
what life did this sweet lady live before she was overtaken by it?	0
i'd hope she wasn't a mean person, onery, etc.	0
i so often feel i have deep seated trauma from the 4 years of watching my grandma decline but i also feel bad because dementia (especially how my grandmother left this world) isn't even the worst that could happen.	0
keep your heads up everyone....i'm thinking of you.	0
i miss seeing my mom's handwriting.	0
she was a note sender.	0
there was always a card in the mail from her.	0
i took them for granted.	0
and of all the things dementia has robbed her of, her lost ability to write those notes hits me sneaky hard.	0
can anyone relate?	0

my granny who is my hero, was a mother figure growing up, has been on hospice since august 2019 was formally diagnosed with vascular dementia within the past year.	0
lives in a nursing home.	0
she is usually angry, can act combative, paranoid, etc.	0
was having a rough weekend, called me multiple times looking for me, (i'm usually able to reorient her with my voice), well, the younger me, she can't seem to comprehend i'm not a baby, especially when the lady two doors down starts screaming it seems to trigger her to search for me thinking i'm a toddler who is crying and needs saving.	0
she's been refusing all her medication except her anxiety needs for almost a month.	0
nurses said she slept most of yesterday, and today she isn't making sense at all.	0
there's inappropriate emotional reaction to anything i try to talk about, was just telling her i planted some tomatoes and she started crying, lots of echolalia, started laughing when i told her yesterday was easter.	0
just wondering if this is normal for dementia or could there have possibly been a stroke?	0
not that the course of disease or timeline would change, i'm on her timeline and only want what's best for her but scientifically minded me is curious.	0
honestly rather see her laughing than the combative and anger, seems better quality of life this way.	0
although my heart hurts that her body just keeps going and her mind doesn't.	0
i work with all kinds of dementia as a music therapist.	0
a client of mine who's daughter recently emailed me wanted to share this article.	0
for reference i have been seeing her father for about 2 years now and use music to promote cognitive wellness and improve the quality of life.	0
the outcome yields emotional wellness because he loves the music we go through within our time together (which is over the phone sessions due to covid restrictions).	0
i highly recommend this article and music for anyone who could use a voice.	0

ive had many illnesses for many years and was diagnosed with lewy body dementia, on wed last week every time inhaled it felt like 2-3 broken ribs so i went the er thursday am and was told i have pluracy, omg the pain is horrible but its made dementia symptoms worse, i wake up talking, im answering question i hear but nobody speaks, my spasms are 10x worse, nauseated, and more, this is devastating	0

my dad is about to turn 79, vascular dementia had been creeping up on him for a few years... probably two years since he last called me by name... he was moved into aged care just before xmas... mum had done her best but it was beyond her... 57 years married, barely a day apart in that time.	0
now she gets an hour day with him... and has him home for four hours away on weekends.	0
i live two hours away.	0
family 'dynamics' in the last thirty years have driven various wedges between us four kids, one sister i haven't spoken to in 19 years and i'm not about to break that streak... dad was such a sharp man.	0
a mining mechanical engineer almost his entire working life.	0
could remember anything, manage things to the finest detail, so organized... he worked for over fifty years, leaving school at 14 to support his family after his dad was injured.	0
he never recieved an unemployment benefit in his life.	0
he should be enjoying his retirement.	0
instead, he's in an aged care facility and has no idea why.	0
a heart episode in 2008 saw him have a pacemaker installed.	0
i felt it sapped his confidence, dented his sense of vulnerability... us scots will never admit there's anything wrong... i don't know for sure but i curse that thing in his chest sending foreign electrical signals to his brain... i could be wrong.	0
he's now incontinent.	0
he can't hold a conversation.	0
"the only thing he worries about is his ""wee dug"", their little dog that mum takes to the aged care facility every day...  yesterday, i tried to speak to him on the phone."	0
"he stumbled over two sentences, before saying ""i'll put ye back on tae the lassie'""."	0
he was handing the phone back to my mum.	0
he can no longer associate me as his son, and her as my mum.	0
he doesn't know who i am anymore.	0
but i know who he is.	0
i love him and i wish for the remainder of his journey to be brief, because in there, he's terrified.	0
the last time he was at my house, nine months ago, he had no idea where he was.	0
i knew then he was scared.	0
"my dogs will never get to see their ""granda"" again (very loving pit bulls but not exactly aged care facility visitor material...) dementia sucks."	0
my husband of 13 years has cholangiocarcinoma.	0
on saturday night he had a stroke.	0
he's in the icu, where i've pretty much been with him since it happened.	0
it's too soon to tell what the prognosis is.	0
they just did the mri yesterday, and i'll be meeting with his doctor today to discuss results.	0
i also need to meet with the social worker.	0
i also need to take the animals to the vet and get their shots.	0
i need to get the cars serviced.	0
i also need to talk to hr at his work about disability.	0
i also need to take out the trash.	0
i need to shower.	0
instead i'm sitting on my bed, trembling, and wishing i was the one who was dying.	0
i'm so tired.	0
i don't know what kind of person i'll be when this is over.	0
my hair has already gone from auburn, to threaded with silver and white.	0
hopefully a shower will perk me up.	0
i've got a long road ahead of me.	0
hi.	0
im not sure if this is the right place to post this, so if its not, please please direct me to the right subreddit... most things ive seen or read have been about in home caregiving.	0
i just got a job at a retirement residence, housing elderly people who simply need assistance with daily living, to people with alzheimers or dementia.	0
ive always thought about trying to go into this line of work because i have always wanted to be doing something where i am helping people who need it.	0
i have only ever really worked in customer service, things like restaurants and grocery stores.	0
while i am thrilled and super super excited for this new experience and opportunity, i feel so so so nervous.	0
i honestly have no idea what to expect here.	0
if anybody could share with me just some things to expect, things theyve personally experienced in this line of work, anything would be helpful!!	0
thanks im advance ~	0
so my father has parkinsons, he was diagnosed around 13 years ago and he also now has dementia as a result of his parkinsons.	0
i have put my life on hold to help my mother take care of him and she has also sacrificed a lot to provide the care he needs.	0
the last few years he has really declined and he has started to have episodes where he acts very confused, stumbles and falls, makes littles sense.	0
i know these episodes will just get worse and longer as time goes on.	0
the problem is, is that i am moving out at the end of the summer.	0
i know its a bit selfish but i am 27 and i would like to start my own life.	0
my mother also has to continue working full time to pay the bills.	0
this leaves us in a predicament where there is no one to care for my father at home, except for my little brother (and it would not be fair to put this burden on him.)	0
when my father was first diagnosed he made my mother promise that she wouldnt put him in a home, but i dont know if well be able to keep that promise as much as he doesnt want it.	0
but even then we wouldnt be able to afford it?	0
what does the state do for people who have no one to care for them?	0
just let them rot?	0
im so frustrated at this point.	0
how are people supposed to work a full time job to pay the bills and caregive full time (for free).	0
right now it seems like were in a never ending hell and its only going to get worse as his disease progresses.	0
what are our options?	0
we live in utah and my father is 65. we cant afford an in home nurse on our own.	0
are we just screwed?	0
should i just resign myself to being stuck here forever?	0
from mid 2018 to early 2020 i lived in my family's vacation home while attending classes.	0
my grandma lived less than 5 minutes away.	0
during this time i would visit her almost daily for hours.	0
her symptoms began with delusions and paranoia.	0
i immediately knew something was wrong and at this point in time the rest of my family was on board with me when i said she needed to see a doctor.	0
however as her symptoms progressed much of my family fell into denial.	0
i witnessed my grandmother hallucinate, cry, beg to feel better.	0
i witnessed her tear up her house looking for money she was convinced some man had stolen.	0
i witnessed her stare out her window for hours saying she saw kids playing when there was nobody there.	0
i saw her lose weight and watched as her quality of life dwinded.	0
i was there every night and hugged her when she was frightened of the man who she said sat in her chair.	0
i begged my family to get her serious help.	0
i remember them constantly telling me she doesn't have dementia she doesn't have dementia.	0
nobody would listen to me.	0
i am currently 22 and had just turned 20 when i moved up north.	0
my family saw me as a child.	0
my words held no weight.	0
the worst part is that they saw it too, they just chose to ignore the signs.	0
my aunt and uncle lived next door to me and therefore also frequented her house.	0
they saw what i saw, maybe not to the same degree as i spent the most time with her but they saw it nonetheless.	0
they had her see neurologists, they had her put on vitamins they thought were her eyes, they thought it was everything but dementia and refused to listen to me.	0
my family is large, very large.	0
not one single person made an effort to get her the help she needed.	0
i had no control over the family finances so i couldn't just do it myself as much as i wanted to.	0
we have the money for a live in aid, we have the money for good doctors and facilities.	0
i know dementia is incurable and eventually leads to death but i also know there are ways to greatly improve quality of life especially when treated early.	0
today i visited her for the first time in 6 months.	0
i moved back downstate at the beginning of 2020 and covid made it quite hard to travel.	0
she did not know who i was.	0
my grandmother, the woman who helped me through the hardest times of my life, the strongest most amazing woman i know, asked me who i was.	0
currently one of my aunts is living a few houses down from her and takes care of her.	0
i no longer try to speak my mind on her care as it was made clear to me that my opinion means nothing.	0
i don't know if she's seeing doctors or getting the care she deserves.	0
i told my sister how distraught i am that for so long my family blew me off and ignored me and know that my own grandmother doesn't recognize me.	0
they finally admit she has dementia.	0
my family has been telling me that i need to visit her more before she dies.	0
i want to scream at them, scream that i was there for her every day when she was hallucinating, i want to beg them to tell me why they didn't listen to me, why they didn't listen to her.	0
it's too late now and i expressed to my father and sister that i was upset that nobody listened to me.	0
my father blew me off and while my sister was understanding and supportive i think she thinks i'm overreacting.	0
i really miss my grandmother, i dont know how to  deal with any of this	0
my mom is 76 and has a ton of medical issues (the biggies though being strokes, heart attacks, high blood pressure, and now on oxygen since having pneumonia in december).	0
she got the first pfizer vaccine 2 weeks ago.	0
she had no side effects at first, except she did say her left arm (her bad stoke side, and not the arm she got the needle in) ached.	0
9 days in (4 days ago), she starts talking about joint pain in her right knee.	0
3 days ago the knee pain makes it hard for her to transfer to the bathroom on her own (the one thing left she must be able to do in her own).	0
yesterday she became more fatigued than usual.	0
today she gets super fatigued, a stomach ache, a mild (99.3) fever, and has chills.	0
yikes.	0
could this be super late vaccine aide effects?	0
anyone else experiencing this?	0
there isn't much online about delayed side effects.	0
it makes me wonder if she should get the second shot.	0
i'm going to call her doctor tomorrow to get their opinion.	0
i really hope she feels better tomorrow.	0
i'm interested in anyone's opinions.	0
in case anyone asks, i do not know if she had covid before.	0
the pneumonia the doctor's thought was covid, but she tested negative 4 times.	0

"we told him to ""try it out"" because he would not move on his own."	0
he thinks he's been there for weeks and asks when he can go home.	0
hopefully with time he will like and accept it, but what should we say in the short term?	0
i have been attending to my sick wife for a few years now.	0
she has had ibs for a few years and more recently joint pains throughout her body since a few months ago.	0
she had a reaction a few days ago to a skin test, she fainted, and had to be given an adrenaline shot.	0
since then, she has been in pain most of the time and in a bad shape.	0
i am heartbroken and in despair seeing her condition deteriorates.	0
i just feel like it's going to get worse and worse.	0
i have a therapist but there's no one else that i can talk to about this.	0
i'm just wondering how do you all keep going?	0
how do you cope?	0
i've seen countless posts of folks who have unclear boundaries or who are burnt out after a time of caregiving.	0
i'm [34f] about a week out from starting to care for my fil [60 m], and would love advice on how to set expectations early on so we'll have a great relationship in the future.	0
a few details:  he is going through a spinal fusion, with an 8+ week recovery time.	0
i'll be driving in from out of state and living in his basement.	0
my husband is not coming because my work can be remote and his cannot.	0
fil is single, lives alone in a small rural town that is not walkable.	0
i shared that i'm happy to take leave from work, starting with 3 weeks, to care for him full time and will extend as needed.	0
after i'll  plan to work remote and stay at the house while splitting care once he seems on his feet.	0
i still get my full pay and benefits for up to 5 months so this just makes sense.	0
we talked about me cleaning, cooking, laundry, driving him to appts, but i drew the line at wound dressing and bathing.	0
i don't think he'll need that help, but am nervous because he said he will not pay or take any professional care (part of why i offered to come out).	0
"he's started hinting at bigger projects without yet asking: ""oh, i wish your husband were coming i've really been meaning to finish the hardwood floors."""	0
"""i'm putting together a list of sewing projects you can get done while you're here."""	0
"""i'm hoping you can plant all my garden beds since it's april."""	0
"""the basement storage could really use organizing / a purge."""	0
my fil is great, but i already have years of him expecting me to cook and clean when we're together, having high expectations and generally not thanking me.	0
in normal times he is picky and demanding and critical, and doesn't acknowledge the work put in to please him.	0
i want this time to be one where he gets his needs met to recover, and his house taken care of, while i can feel good on the other side and not taken advantage of.	0
ultimately i love him and i am the best suited to come out and help him, so advice like don't do it is not what i'm after.	0
ideally this is also an opportunity for us to get closer.	0
any advice or lessons learned on setting clear expectations before diving into a short term care scenario?	0
i'm 20 years old and i'm adopted.	0
my 90 year old mother is at her end stage of dementia and the doctors say she doesnt have much time left.	0
it's been such a hard battle and i keep kicking myself because i feel like it could have been avoided or i did something wrong and i already struggle with depression anxiety and mpd.	0
i have a huge heart also and i dont handle heartbreak well.	0
i knew this was a long time coming but i'm having a really hard time coping and i keep having suicidal thoughts.	0
any advice is good advice.	0
thanks guys	0
my mother's husband is showing signs of cognitive decline.	0
like many i moved in with them at the beginning of covid and he blames everything that goes missing or wrong or that he forgets on me.	0
he lost his meds, shoes, wallet, keys, phone, and watch and even called the police to make a report, strongly implying that i stole them.	0
he's also threatened to call the police on me for stealing these things then they inevitably show up somewhere that he left them.	0
it's literally every week and i'm fucking tired of it, and of being afraid for my and my mother's safety when he has a tantrum.	0
he locks his room with a key, too so it's not like i could get in and he still accuses me.	0
i could leave but then i worry about leaving my mother and putting her at risk.	0
he refuses to get help, and today she got pissed off and told him to move out if he's going to keep accusing me of stuff.	0
she'll help with the downpayment for his own place, etc.	0
i know it may sound insensitive but he's so combative at this point, or pretends not to hear or see you if he doesn't agree so there's really no other option.	0
he was manipulative and controlling even before all of this so i'm terrified about him being a danger.	0
my mother keeps saying 'not to worry about it'.	0
just.	0
how do you deal?	0
what do you do?	0
i started caring for my brother last year due to covid and shielding and i wasnt working anymore.	0
i thought i could get some advice here or just get this off my chest as i wouldnt know where else to do it.	0
my brother is absolutely fine mentally, just physically hes got a spinal injury.	0
everything is fine mostly caring for him as im pretty introvert with no bf, children etc i dont really find it demanding and hes very laid back as a person.	0
one thing tho is toileting and showering is slightly embarrassing.	0
hes extremely well endowed lets say and hes erect alot, which is cumbersome and a little awkward.	0
its clearly visible through his bottoms most the time, so its not just when he has it out.	0
when im toileting him once hes finished and i pull his bottoms up its just still poking above his waistband a lot of the time and i have to physically hold it and tuck it in his bottoms somewhere more comfortable.	0
in the shower on two occasions when ive washed him hes accidentally ejaculated.	0
i know hes not helping it along himself as he cant hold his penis.	0
im not sure how to feel about it if im honest.	0
i mean its just a body and all that, and i know hes obviously got needs and cant exactly relieve himself, plus hes never acted inappropriate to me.	0
he apologised both times, and i could tell instantly it wasnt deliberate.	0
is this a normal thing?	0
im guessing with guys its not unusual.	0
please tell me its not just me this happens to haha.	0
i dont know if its a sensitivity issue, as when it goes down, slight movements can make it erect again.	0
hes circumcised so i wonder if that adds to it?	0
sorry for the venting and if this is deemed not for this sub i apologise.	0
i'm a caregiver to my 90 and 82 year old paternal grandparents.	0
they live alone but are so close to needing a nursing home.	0
mobility is almost gone.	0
my father takes them to appts.	0
but doesn't do much else.	0
he's a partially functioning addict/alcoholic with grief and underlying mental health issues.	0
my mom died two years ago from cancer.	0
he was already leaning on me and my husband to care for my grandparents before my mom died.	0
since then, not only have they dramatically declined in ability, but he's been perfectly content to let us do the work although he's their child.	0
he's an only child.	0
i have an adult sister, but she is overall more needy rather than providing help due to her own issues and upbringing.	0
she doesn't work but is not on disability.	0
she has some legitimate issues but a lot is personality.	0
i just can't get her to help more.	0
my husband and i work full time.	0
we don't have any kids and at this point couldn't if we wanted to because of them.	0
now, on top of all this, my dad is hospitalized and we may be looking at long term severe disability,  beyond anything he was facing before.	0
and a large part of it may be due to his alcoholism.	0
i want a life with my husband.	0
i'm tired, i didn't ask for this.	0
my family was a good family to me overall growing up, especially my grandparents.	0
but i still don't want to do this anymore, and i feel guilty.	0
my husband goes back and forth between mot wanting to do this and then feeling obligated to see it through to the end with my grandparents.	0
he doesn't want to help my dad.	0
my grandparents are grateful for our help, but they also don't cooperate well at all and make this  so much harder than they have to be at almost every step or decision that we face.	0
now this is happening with my dad, i just can't.	0
i want to move across the country and have them all put in a nursing home.	0
i've been two hours from home since wednesday with him at the hospital with no definite end in sight.	0
i miss my mom.	0
my dad is 59 years old, an avid cyclist, and extremely smart.	0
since november he has been extremely depressed with some psychotic symptoms.	0
after multiple anti-depressants and trips to the psych er, he was hospitalized in late january.	0
during the first two weeks of hospitalizations, he tried to commit suicide by climbing a 2m fence.	0
luckily he only broke his collarbone and got surgery for it.	0
over the last few weeks, the doctors have started a new anti-psychotic and multiple anti-depressants.	0
the psychosis is now gone, but my dad has been getting progressively more aggressive.	0
most psychiatric conditions have been discarded by now (bp, psychotic depression) and it seems like he might have ftd or another form of dementia.	0
i am from a developing country and i live abroad with my husband.	0
i am an only child.	0
i am utterly devastated by this.	0
i have no words.	0
i don't know what to think or feel.	0
i am so scared for my dad.	0
i feel so hopeless and depressed, i can't stop crying.	0
happy easter everyone!!	0
as some of you have seen, my wife is in pretty bad shape with lupus, malabsorption, malnutrition and massive pain.	0
my mother in law and i are wondering if there are programs out there that pay caregivers like us for taking care of our loved ones.	0
(by the way, my wife is on medicaid if that helps.)	0
i work as much as i can, but with one income, making ends meet is close to impossible right now.	0
also, my mother in law is 75 and is totally burned out from having to take care of my wife while i am working.	0
we need to somehow get some extra money coming in so we dont have to sweat things out so much.	0
the anxiety caused by our finances is just killing me and my mil.	0
thanks in advance and hang in there everyone.	0
hi, my mum (55) is diagnosed with als and frontotemporal dementia, and recently came back home after a 5 month hospital stay while she was diagnosed.	0
she is frequently upset, basically crying, repeating phrases like 'i wonder why' over and over again.	0
i have been trying to find things for her to do to take her mind off things.	0
i made her a fidget mat and have tried to show her how to use it, but all she does is fold it up and push it away.	0
i have made puzzles, and tried to use puzzle apps, but again they just get pushed away.	0
she doesn't want to do painting, or help me plant some seeds etc.	0
all she seems to want to do is watch tv and eat, which i would frankly be okay with if she was content, but she's still so upset and anxious.	0
i have tried to ask her what she would like to do, but between the als and the ftd, communication is tough.	0
anyone have any suggestions or advice on how to help her?	0
so my dad is 71 and had a couple strokes about 10 years back.	0
he and my mother have been married for 40 years and recently he has had growing delusions in which he thinks my mother has cheated on him.	0
he will wake her up in the middle of the night and berate her with accusations of infidelity; stemming from the most inoculous incident (like a friendly greeting from another man).	0
the arguments will become very intense but not violent.	0
his demeanor is usually very pleasant.	0
no amount of logic will persuade him and my mother feels like divorce may be the only option.	0
he's a very intelligent man but very stubborn.	0
he has seen a couple therapist from the va but thinks the don't know anything or that my mother has turned them against him.	0
my questions are: does this sound like dementia or bi-polar syndrome?	0
can medications help dementia and reduce his delusions enough for them to find some harmony?	0
can bouts of the same reoccurring delusion ever be fully subdued through logic?	0
thanks	0
so, i'm not sure if i (31) should be worried about this or not, as my mom gets older.	0
my mom (55) is getting more and more aggressive behind the wheel.	0
like, she can't drive without criticizing others or feeling like everyone is out to get her.	0
she's started being less cautious about other drivers, insisting that she has the right of way and if she did get into an accident, she would be in the right.	0
it's toxic to hear about how other drivers are terrible and she's the only person who knows how to operate a vehicle safely /s.	0
example: today, mom and i ran errands and someone ran (or rolled) through a stop sign as we were making our way out of the parking lot (we did not have a stop sign and the guy was turning into the lane to get to the stores we went past).	0
he didn't stop and she could see that.	0
she clearly had enough time and space to stop, but even though the guy was clearly not stopping or even seemed to care about her 10 second horn toot, she kept moving forward as if she wanted to hit him (and parade around that she had the right of way and all).	0
this isn't the only incident -- someone was obviously turning into a parking spot aisle and she rolled forward as the other car was turning.	0
she's not wrong, i guess, but it just seems really aggressive to me and sometimes being right is more trouble than it is worth.	0
my mantra for driving is to drive defensively -- if i was driving, i would have stopped immediately after seeing he didn't.	0
"it's like my mom is more interested in being ""right"" as opposed to being safe."	0
"i honestly don't feel comfortable driving with her because of her verbal aggression and tendency to put being ""right"" above being safe."	0
i don't have a car of my own to drive -- a personal choice and possibly because of how unappealing she makes driving sound -- and she drives a stick anyway.	0
i usually walk to where i need to go or use lyft which comes with its own set of issues, but i digress.	0
anyway, am i overreacting or will this get worse as she gets older?	0
my dad lives across country with his girlfriend.	0
we noticed something was off about a year and a half ago.	0
he stopped taking care of himself i.e.	0
showering, brushing his teeth, he stopped eating, didnt pay his bills etc.	0
he started drinking way more than he used to and basically stop leaving the house.	0
with this, he began showing signs of memory loss which was a red flag for dementia due to my familys history (two of his sisters are in assisted living for dementia and my grandmother died of alzheimers).	0
he refused to go to the doctor, but i flew out to see him this weekend and forced him to go.	0
the doctors have diagnosed him with severe depression and possible dementia.	0
when this it was explained to his girlfriend, she decided she could not take care of him and left.	0
now that his care is on me, my dad insists i am meddling in his business.	0
i know the thought of moving across the country to be closer to me and other family will overwhelm him, but i also know that this is the best for him.	0
at what point do you make the decisions for them?	0
i have such anxiety about leaving him here to live on his own, but i also know that he is not going to come with me willingly.	0
we are setting up home health aide so i know that he would be safe for the time being, but im also trying to mitigate having to fly home just to get back on a plane and fly back here.	0
he has literally no friends or family where he currently is.	0
it was just his girlfriends friends and family.	0
i feel very selfish, but im sick of living on edge and not knowing what the next steps are.	0
i am so nervous ill lose my job over the constant back and forth.	0
i'm a 28f living at home with both my parents (78m, 74f) and my sister 32f.	0
about three years ago my mom was diagnosed with fronto-temporal dementia and right now seems to be in pretty advanced stages.	0
she needs help with almost every task and cannot be left alone but it seems that putting her in a facility seems kind of far down the line.	0
i moved home a couple months before covid hit, thinking that it was going to be temporary.	0
then i quickly saw how much help my mom needed which has increased in the \~15 months that have since passed.	0
in my household, i am the only one working.	0
my sister is unemployed (and not looking for a job) and my parents are both retired.	0
i'm a teacher and have been in the classroom with students in person this whole school year and it has been a lot weighing on me to have this stressful job (also my first year as a teacher) and then come home to my family.	0
i feel guilty for feeling this way but i just wish my life were different and that i could move out without feeling guilty.	0
i love my mom so much and i love caring for her in the ways that i can because she has done so much for me and i feel like its all coming full circle now.	0
but i feel stuck at home.	0
i want to live with my friends and have my own space and have my own schedule and eat what i want for dinner and basically just have the independence back that i had before.	0
i know things are obviously different now and i don't want to abandon my family.	0
i know if i left it would be a lot harder on my dad but sometimes it feels like i just can't take any of it anymore.	0
things with my mom are certainly extremely difficult but the hardest part of all of this is that its a package deal living with my dad and sister.	0
has anyone else had to face this decision?	0
a friend just asked me if i wanted to move in with her and i already said no last year in order to stay home.	0
i just don't know how i feel about this and i want to make the right decision.	0
i would still live close to home (prob no further than 20min by car) and could visit and come to help often.	0
but i wouldn't be around for when she needs things in the middle of the night etc.	0
i posted a month ago alittle about the situation.	0
in feb 2018 i got out the military and my wife and i moved back to our home town after 6 years.	0
my gma has end stage copd.	0
we moved in with her to help for the time being.	0
figured it benefited everyone.	0
boy was we wrong.	0
my grandparents took custody of me(34yo) when i was 4yo.	0
well my wife and i had our own life since 23yo or so.	0
i joined the military and did that until i was 31yo.	0
"we decided to ""help"" her out when we moved back."	0
that went down hill quick.	0
after multiple er visits and nursing home visits for pt, she depended on us a lot.	0
"during all this time she has always been one of those ""i'm always right"" and if you do stuff differently than she does/did she will definitely let you know you should do it her way."	0
she is very opinionated.	0
she will tell you about yourself real quick and what your problems are.	0
you say something to her about her attitude or anything, instant victim mentality.	0
you're the bad guy.	0
there's more and i'm sure you guys have heard it or been there done that.	0
ugh.	0
my brain.	0
so 6 months ago we told her we was moving into our house.	0
which btw.....we bought...1.5 year ago...and have never stayed there.	0
yes, you read that right.	0
a year ago we told her we was going to stay at our house on a saturday night we was both off.	0
she threw a fit and said she couldn't be there (her house) by herself.	0
i think it was that moment we realized this was much more than we intended.	0
so since feb 2018 we have been tending to her needs, working ft professional jobs (i do rotating shifts) and went from living in our own space to being in a bedroom and small bathroom in her house.	0
our stuff sat in storage for 1.5 year before we bought our house.	0
we actually sold a lot of furniture so it wouldn't get ruined in storage.	0
so when she was given her 6 month notice, she wasn't happy.	0
she was saying we was trying to put her into nursing home etc.	0
no, we gave you 6 months so we could contact whomever (care coordinator) to see what option you had like maybe in home.	0
she denies any help cause she don't want to pay for it.	0
she told me she will lay there and die.	0
over the 6 months i tried having an adult convo with her but she said she was staying in her home.	0
she said we told her we would take care of her till the end, we didn't.	0
so yesterday we moved and she didn't say much.	0
she said how she wasn't feeling well and her anxiety was getting to her.	0
i called a care coordinator weeks ago to call her and try and discuss her options.	0
my gma hasn't said anything about it.	0
she prob told the lady to get lost.	0
gma can walk to bathroom and kitchen and she needs a long break.	0
she can't cook but can do microwave dinners and sandwiches.	0
which again involves a long break.	0
she can barley put water in her cpap.	0
she is one mistake away from death honestly.	0
we feel bad of course but also so angry.	0
she berated us so much and never wanted to listen to our advice because she knows better.	0
i feel bad cause i know she is alone in the house by herself probably scared and doing simple tasks is a project for her.	0
as much as i am upset with her and the way she would talk to us and blame us for things.	0
i'll never forget what she did for me as a child and the situation she took me from.	0
i feel terrible one minute like i abandoned her but resentful the next.	0
in the end it does hurt knowing i will be looked at as the bad guy.	0
my wife and i need to live our life though too and i understand that.	0
something had to give and we tried our best to get her to help herself.	0
it's an emotional roller coaster to say the least.	0
i just wish she could understand we want her to be part of our life, not our life.	0
btw i will go there once or twice a week to take her trash, set up pills, and just check on her.	0
like everyone.	0
i have so much to say and don't know how.	0
thanks for the rant.	0
my father started cognitive decline a few years ago.	0
he was very neglectful and basically ignored my sister and i in favor of his wifes kids.	0
until he started to get bad and his wife left him.	0
my sister and i are the only ones who have stepped up to care for him.	0
hes stubborn and wont let anyone manage his finances, we spend hours helping him with various things only to discover hes undid our work.	0
after 3 years of caring for him im at the end of my rope.	0
i went on antidepressants, i am in therapy.	0
that didnt stop me from having a full blown meltdown at work.	0
they asked me to rake fmla to care for myself.	0
less than one week into this my father had a massive heart attack so the entire self care break was spent in the hospital feeling massive anxiety and exhaustion.	0
now he is facing round the clock care, and will probably run out of money before he dies.	0
the money he left is was basically his olive branch because he knew he was a shitty dad.	0
i was going to use the $ to get out of a job i loathe and go back to school to do what ive always wanted to.	0
now he will die penniless and leave us nothing more than likely.	0
i feel shallow for resenting him, for feeling transactional about it.	0
but its deeper than that.	0
when a parent has neglected you and then you find yourself caring for them when no one else will .. i honestly dont know how to cope anymore.	0
i am in an ocean of depression and anxiety and dread with  no end in sight	0
one of my cousins shared this (after someone shared... you know the routine) i found the original!	0
https://www.instagram.com/p/cnaicehjgy9/?igshid=1h8fbjomu4rle one of my cousins shared this (after someone shared... you know the routine) i found the original!	0
you are loved.	0
we put my mom into care two weeks ago and after a very rough start she is beginning to settle in a bit.	0
the people who work at her memory care center are wonderful.	0
i am asking those who have had family in care and also the caregivers- what are some good ways to show appreciation?	0
they work so hard.	0
thanks for any ideas.	0
anyone else deal with this?	0
he's wearing depends cause he's had problems for a while now but it doesn't stop the diarrhea, which i feel happens far too often at least weekly if not bi-weekly.	0
we've tried, probiotics, metamucil, pepcid and results are always identical.	0
i'm wondering if this is just what old people deal with on the regular.	0
my dad is 76 and clinically diagnosed with dementia, but he says he is fine and not forgetful.	0
the doctor scheduled an mri but during it he freaked out and made them stop as he wasnt comfortable with it.	0
are there any alternatives or ways to get him comfortable with doing one?	0
[removed]	0
i (25) take care of my grandmother (83), who we think has mild to moderate dementia, essentially all by myself.	0
she will not allow me or my mom to seek help for her memory issues though, and becomes enraged if you talk to her about it.	0
but i initially moved in with her for a place to stay while i was going to college, but her health has gone downhill so rapidly that i decided to stay with her and care for her.	0
during this time my depression has gotten much worse, and i have to really talk myself out of self harming, because no matter what i do for my grandmother she is never happy, and im almost always in some form of trouble with her.	0
i feel like such a failure of an adult that im in a position that im financially dependent on her because i dont make enough to live on my own, and im working on my masters degree, and if i were to move out the rest of my family would be disappointed in me for not taking on the task (more of a burden though) of caring for our family member.	0
i just wish someone would help me with taking care of her, shes too much for one person to handle 24/7.	0
but we cant afford to pay for a caregiver or a retirement home with a memory care unit.	0
and my mom will only spend about an hour or two with her once a week before she gets tired of my grandmothers behavior as well.	0
anyways, my grandmother wanted easter at our house this weekend, and its been nothing but stress from being asked numerous times about the food, keys to the doors, to family spending the night, and the list goes on.	0
after she made numerous worried phone calls because she couldnt remember that easter is tomorrow and she couldnt remember how long people were staying for, she then screamed at me and told me she was so embarrassed of me that she could literally just die because i did not greet my cousin and her kids exactly the way my grandmother wanted me to.	0
and that she was never going to have easter at our house again, due to my actions (which was accidentally oversleeping this morning), so i dont know why i even try anymore.	0
im almost to the point where living in my car sounds better than living in this house with her.	0
it makes me feel really bad because i do love her, but between the stress of my job, school, and my grandmother im finding very little reasons to continue on living.	0
im just exhausted...	0
my dad has had two pretty major operations (a heart stent and an ostomy bag installed) and has been in the hospital three times for extended stays this past march.	0
he's lost a considerable amount of his physical endurance and stamina and i'm doing most of the housework, errands, making sure the bills get paid, etc.	0
i'm also usually making his meals and getting just about anything else he needs.	0
he can get to the bathroom on his own, which is great.	0
he's not that old (60) and neither am i (27).	0
i moved in with him a few years ago after i graduated from undergrad to help defer some of the cost of going to grad school.	0
my graduation from grad school lined up almost perfectly with the pandemic, so in a way it's good that the job market is rough right now because i can be here and his job has been amazing with his extended leave of absence.	0
my point is, i'm also dealing with some health issues, one being chronic fatigue syndrome, likely caused by my second (known) infection with the epstein-barr virus.	0
between my normal exhaustion, pandemic stress, and the stress of him (he also hasn't been able to drive for a year due to vertigo likely induced by a small tumor they found on his pituitary gland last march), i can't sleep.	0
i can't sleep well.	0
i feel like i'm going to miss him trying to get me to help with something or because he's my dad and wants to let me sleep he will accidentally push himself too far and he will end up back in the hospital.	0
i feel like i have a new puppy or something and i'm constantly listening out to see if they need to go out or something in the middle of the night.	0
i don't know what to do with myself.	0
i go to therapy, i have a psychiatrist, and i've seen my pcp.	0
i'm worried, anxious, and exhausted.	0
there's really no immediate family closer than 2.5-3 hours away and with this and all his other medical issues we've been trying to just stay away from people in general.	0
occasionally i can get some help from my boyfriend (he's fully vaccinated because of his job and joined my quarantine bubble right at the start of the pandemic last year).	0
i'm not sure now where i'm going with this but i think mostly i'm just looking for support?	0
i don't know how to do this all by myself.	0
i don't know what to do.	0
i know me not sleeping and worrying so much is worse for both of us in the long run.	0
tl;dr i'm a 27 yo now tasked with taking care of my retirement age father after some surprise health issues and i don't know how to handle it.	0
i'm exhausted.	0
he's exhausted.	0
he hates that he's put me in this position.	0
i can't say i don't mind but like.	0
this is my dad.	0
of course i'm gonna put my life on hold to be here for him.	0
i had to leave a job today because i couldnt meet the availability they needed from me.	0
i went from three jobs to one in the span of a week.	0
it wasnt a terribly hard decision because i would more rather be home for my dad to help him than work a few stressful minimum wage jobs, but the benefits from one of them could have put me through school and therapy...i cant help but feel a little resentful of my situation as a caregiver that i missed out on those opportunities.	0
i have little time to myself to handle personal chores, to simply relax and unwind at the end of the day and some days i definitely handle it more gracefully than others, but lately ive found it so hard to be positive and provide my best care because more than ever im imagining for myself a life of independence where i have no one but myself to worry about.	0
at this point for my dad and family, its just not realistic.	0
i feel so guilty and selfish admitting these things, especially knowing how much my dad still struggles on the daily despite pt/ot helping him grow stronger every week.	0
i just want to jump back into the past when things were easier on everyone in my household.	0
my 91-year-old mom has been to easter services probably every year of her life until now.	0
she is not allowed out of her facility, which is once again on lockdown because of a positive covid case, and no one is allowed inside except employees.	0
however, the administrator gave me permission to create a short, simplified easter service for the 25 people in the memory care unit.	0
it's a 3-page service with the resurrection story from john, youtube hymns and matching lyric sheets, plus an abbreviated communion.	0
one leader (activity director) can conduct the service.	0
if anyone else would like to use this, i am happy to share this 7-page word document.	0
i'm writing a report about alzheimers disease for my school project work.	0
i am currently studying about community care and social services.	0
i would like to ask those who loved ones who had / had alzheimers disease what was their occupation before the disease and how did it affect them?	0
if you don't mind, i will be using some of your responses to help aid in my school report.	0

join this sub a few months ago after receiving my (26f) fathers (73m) frontotemporal-behavioural variant diagnosis.	0
we experience the sun downing, the roaming, the incontinence amongst many many other things.	0
i would have never thought i would be a caregiver in my mid-twenties and its been a steep learning experience.	0
i just wanted to say thank you to everyone sharing their personal stories.	0
it has been so very helpful for me to understand what others are going through and that i am not alone.	0
this disease is awful, but ive processed the grief and things are all lined up for in-home care/next steps.	0
take care of yourselves folks, its important.	0
out of the ordinary, i mean	0
whenever we take my dad out of the house, he's like a child lost in the woods.	0
when he's at home, it's almost like he's totally normal, only with decreased mobility.	0
the community health nurse says that it's simply the comfort of the routine that enables his normalcy, and it's only masking the actual deterioration.	0
but i think, even that mask is valid.	0
dad has never been more like dad, when he's home.	0
when we take him outside, i'm always a little shocked by his inability to function.	0
i do worry about his physical health, but i'm also equally concerned about his cognitive health, and i 90% believe that his cognition will plummet, not decline, when we remove him from the house.	0
but am i biased?	0
am i deluding myself?	0
are other people afraid of this?	0
pros to assisted living:   there is a lot of pressure from the community health nurse to jump on it when availability happens.	0
the wait time is pretty significant.	0
if we lose our window, we might have to wait a long time.	0
"if we move him now, he'll get into the ""good"" wing, where the residents have more independence and are cognitively alright."	0
if we wait to move him when we feel we have no choice (i.e.	0
significantly declined) he'll have to go into the wing where the doors are locked and the residents are in decline, but there would be more one on one attention.	0
he is at risk of falling.	0
mitigate that risk by having him around people more or less 24/7.	0
better meals than what he's getting now.	0
the assisted living place isn't what his mother had.	0
no roommates.	0
condo-style.	0
cons  visiting hours.	0
"you can't just ""pop in""."	0
we'll need to schedule around waiting hours.	0
he hates people.	0
he hates socializing.	0
he hates social activities.	0
when younger he hated boarding school, hated camp, hated church socializing, hated even the implication that he should have to talk to people (especially in his generation, who mocked him for his stutter).	0
the fact that taking him out of his comfortable place where he's cognitively okay may spur on a significant cognitive decline, therefore negating most of the pros above.	0
i have been a caregiver for my wife for the last year or so as she suffers from a brain disease, malabsorption and malnutrition.	0
just last week she had a feeding tube placed so the caregiving has gotten more intense.	0
my question is do you all forget the seemingly little things like what you are doing at any given time, forgetting simple tasks and almost forgetting how to function due to the stress?	0
there are days that i almost wonder how i am able to breathe without step by step instructions.	0
does anyone go through this as well?	0
thanks!	0

my gran was moved to a memory care facility last year.	0
she lived with us since 2014. when we cleaned out her mil suite attached to our house, we were left with containers upon containers of shit just thrown together that we didn't have the brainpower to organize at that time.	0
"""i'll get to that later""."	0
"well, those boxes are taking up 40 sq ft of space in your basement, and ""later"" is looking a lot more like ""soon""."	0
it's silly to jump into it without a plan.	0
so i made you a plan.	0
i developed your method.	0
you have one less thing to think about now in this emotionally taxing project.	0
get your coffee, and read through this guide.	0
you're going to freakin' conquer this.	0
let's make sense out of that chaos.	0
here we go!	0
determining the scope take a gander at your stack of bins and boxes.	0
take out each bin and rustle through it.	0
focus on identifying what youre going to be working with.	0
example: for my gran, we had notes, paperwork, photographs, household items, memories (more on that later), and more fucking paperwork.	0
number your containers this will save your ass later and help keep you organized.	0
number each box and tub.	0
physically.	0
write on those things with a thick ass sharpie tub or box and then a number.	0
it doesnt matter where the box came from.	0
it doesnt matter what order theyre in.	0
just as long as you establish inventory, youll be grand.	0
example: i have tub #1tub #5 and box #1box #6 isolate one box & make room take out a container from the collection.	0
place it in a comfortable spot where you have room to move around.	0
you may be getting up and moving from place to place, so make sure your room is clean and clear of obstacles.	0
a clean room is a must.	0
put all the other containers in a separate area away from your organization room.	0
trust me.	0
if you look at it, it will only intimidate you.	0
establishing categories you know the term when organizing, never touch anything twice?	0
thats bullshit in this kind of project.	0
we are taking this rollercoaster in steps.	0
the purpose of, what i call round 1, is to separate trash from the important stuff, and put like with like.	0
youre going to make an area, preferably with another big empty container, for each category.	0
here are the categories that will mostly encompass everything youre bound to find in the hoard of miscellaneous small belongings thrown together at the end of a clear out.	0
memories photographs paperwork paper memories i have no idea trash let me go over each category.	0
"""photographs""."	0
every photograph you can imagine.	0
even the printed ones.	0
not the ones in frames.	0
if you want to be really progressive, keep the polaroids seperate from anything else.	0
the two types of chemicals used in the processing of the types of film degrades both of them.	0
portraits, cat pictures, garden pictures, the literal only picture of your great grandfather.	0
all of them.	0
"""memories""."	0
these are objects, artwork, books, etc.	0
anything a person keeps for any reason until they leave the earth.	0
or your house.	0
a lot of them are only sentimental to the individual and dont mean much to you.	0
dont evaluate this concept yet.	0
focus, remember your categories.	0
move along.	0
"""paperwork""."	0
this is the serious shit.	0
your boxes will.	0
will.	0
have paperwork that you do not know if you should keep or not.	0
"place every 'document' that is professional correspondence, medical records, housing inspections, homeowners insurance, receipts, etc, into one designated ""paperwork"" box."	0
don't stress yourself out wondering what it actually is and if you actually need to keep it just yet.	0
"just determine if it's administrative paperwork or ""paperwork memories"" and sort it first."	0
"""paperwork memories""."	0
this can sometimes be easy to determine, and sometimes it can be difficult.	0
because in my gran's final year or so living with us, she clipped everything out of the newspaper from articles on bird care (she has no bird) to saving full page advertisements.	0
there was also a lot... and i mean a lot of notes that she wrote down from day to day that don't make a lick of sense.	0
a grocery list.	0
"the word ""hair""."	0
someone's phone number.	0
"the name ""nick""."	0
"the name ""lenore""."	0
notes from my mother who was her primary caretaker.	0
"notes that say ""i'm going to the store."	0
i will be back by 2pm.	0
"i love you.""."	0
if in doubt, keep it.	0
and go through it later.	0
"but these are still paper memories and go in the ""paper memories"" box."	0
this also includes stuff that is obviously important and needs to be stored like college diplomas, yearbook pages, letters from loved ones, cards, etc.	0
"""i have no idea""."	0
you will come across some shit that's just... weird.	0
like you really won't have a single idea what to do with it.	0
make a box for your confusion and come back to it way later.	0
trash is anything you determine to be trash.	0
if you don't need it, and it doesn't tell a story or represent your mother, let it go.	0
you might not want the scribblings of your parent in their decline of mental capability.	0
you may want to hold onto those pieces a little bit longer.	0
that is absolutely okay.	0
things you will need for sanity youre almost ready to go through your first container!	0
you will need a couple of things to keep yourself organized.	0
post-its (brand name.	0
they stick much better) a couple of black sharpies.	0
i say a couple because you will misplace it every single fucking time you put it down and you need to be able to pick up another while the first one is probably sitting under a pile of crap.	0
buy at least 3 boxes of sandwich baggies (sealable) and 4 boxes of freezer baggies (gallon).	0
a notebook on a clipboard and a hoard of pens.	0
trash bags.	0
get the good brand.	0
white mailing labels.	0
file folders scotch tape  opening pandoras box once you have all of your supplies within arms or legs reach, your organization room is clear, you have one container, and youve had your coffee put on a playlist.	0
pro tip: nothing sappy or sad.	0
one sad tune is enough to keep you tunneled on a certain object for way too long and emotionally exhaust you enough to cut your organization day short.	0
open the box.	0
take a breath.	0
when you come across any of these things, grab a gallon baggie, slap a blank mailing label on it, and grab a sharpie photographs or polaroids admin paperwork paper memories example: baggie labeled tub #1  photographs or tub #1  admin paperwork the bulky important paperwork this is something i learned the hard way.	0
youre going to come across certain things that take you a couple of minutes to figure out.	0
and they will be bulky, but skirt the line between important admin paperwork and memories.	0
for example: i found scatters of 400 pages of my grans book she published in 1998. it took me a good minute to accumulate all of the pages.	0
and they just kept showing up in boxes.	0
for like 3 days, that manuscript was its own category.	0
i threw them all together in the end with the paper memories category.	0
label.	0
all.	0
non-obvious.	0
items.	0
the term when organizing, you should touch everything only once, has a more important mental and psychological message, which is when organizing, you should determine what something is, only once.	0
that folder in tub #3 that just says west palm beach.	0
at first glance, you dont know exactly whats in that thing.	0
could be anything, really.	0
so take a look inside.	0
grab a pen and a notebook on a clipboard.	0
write down the contents of the folder.	0
for example: on my notebook, the west palm beach folder had homeowners insurance, property tax assessments, receipts, email correspondences, inspection reports, final floorplan, and a couple of other things i dont really remember.	0
grab a post-it note, or a piece of paper big enough to tape onto the outside of the folder.	0
write down, in sharpie, on the note, the contents of what is in that folder.	0
why: when you go through the collections stack of paperwork during round 2, you wont have to spend critical time and energy determining the contents of every folder.	0
when you have big bold labels on stuff, youre saving your brain from expending energy doing critical thinking later on.	0
you really dont want to have to pick up the same stack of west palm beach 3 times, and every time having to flip through it to figure out the contents.	0
do the dirty work the first time, and you will save yourself the trouble later.	0
use those baggies!	0
so many things can fit into baggies!	0
notes.	0
tiny school portraits.	0
business cards.	0
newspaper articles.	0
they can all fit into baggies!	0
label the bag with a the container number theyre in along with the category they belong to, and fill those babies up!	0
method established.	0
work through your collection.	0
go ahead and sort the rest of the containers into your designated categories.	0
sort yourself as you sort their stuff never let your piles become super crazy and unorganized.	0
if you have a hoard of labeled baggies just sitting around without being put into their main category, take the time to place them there.	0
it is really easy to let the process take over your entire room/house/life.	0
dont let it.	0
clean as you work.	0
rome wasnt built in a day remember:  it will take days, maybe even a few weeks, to go through every single thing.	0
especially if you're getting rid of their clothes and food and dishes, furniture, etc as well.	0
you may have put off the boxes and tubs because of the physical and mental and emotional exhaustion it creates.	0
you need to give yourself breaks, remember to drink water, and remember to drop everything and come back to it if it's just getting to be too much for you.	0
you have time.	0
and the process takes time.	0
so take.	0
your.	0
time.	0
just as an aside: i really, really want to emphasize a practice of self-care that i had no idea existed until this: taking your time.	0
it's easy to have a cup of coffee and rush through half a box, but you will be burned out, exhausted, and super irritable every single time.	0
taking your time will help you be more organized and will let your brain go through the process with ease rather than make it feel like it's some sort of race.	0
you will thank yourself.	0
remember to eat.	0
don't become too tunnel visioned.	0
don't get too caught up in what you find.	0
and do not try to create more categories unless you absolutely need to.	0
round 2 you will end up with containers filled with categories rather than containers filled with uhhhhh.	0
the photo container will be a whole project within itself.	0
save that baby for last.	0
sit down with a category and start figuring out if you need to keep it, keep it and digitize it, shred it, or toss it.	0
the digitization process is also another project within itself.	0
if you determine you need to digitize a document, shove a label on it saying digitize, a label of description of the contents, and then put it in a new digitize category.	0
i have a method for digitizing and organizing your documents that i will probably write up another time (im still doing this and figuring out a solid method.	0
im not finished, and i wont be for a while).	0
like with like put things related to each other in their own folder.	0
in paper memories, you will need to determine sub-categories.	0
example: paper memories went from a box of loose papers to \~7 sub-categories such as phylliss education love letters from nick childrens artwork cards notes and a couple others.	0
another example: paperwork went from a box of loose papers to a crazy amount of sub-categories including sale of west palm beach house medical records 2016 receipts bank statements lawyer miss kittys vet records, etc.	0
bonus round: photos once you finish everything but the photographs, you can move to the photos.	0
but you will have trained yourself enough through the first process to know how to sort the photos.	0
and it's basically along the same lines as subcategorizing the other categories.	0
i have about 2000 photos, and i think i have even more at the bottom of another box.	0
so far, i have 34 categories of photos.	0
"everything from ""roeltgen family 1996 - 2006 sonora house, tx"" to ""cindy's wedding"" to ""strange photo tour of cindy's house"" to ""granny pre-1985""."	0
im still working on photos.	0
its a trip.	0
but it is super rewarding.	0
all in all you will become much more comfortable with the entire sorting process the more you go through them.	0
and it will get much, much easier.	0
i wish you the best of luck.	0
may the organization gods smile upon you.	0
youre not a robot.	0
you will get through this.	0
and i am so, so, so sorry for your loss.	0

hello all, i have stumbled upon this sub for some possible resources o can provide my family in regards to supporting my (age 55) step dads early onset alzheimers.	0
my mom is the only one around to help him at the moment and it pains me every time we talk and i hear about how fast he is losing it... i want to help them so badly but so far have just been told by those i have talked to that that sucks, only will get worst....  im really looking for ways i can support my mom so she doesnt lose her mind with depression and overwhelmed with living with someone who has alzheimers and caring for him.	0
if there are any books or blogs/groups for early onset alzheimers i would deeply appreciate it.	0
wishing all the best.	0
my mom has been taking care of my grandma, who has dementia and cancer.	0
we don't know how much more time she has, but my mom is working full time and then every hour of her free time is devoted to taking care of my grandma.	0
it's impacting her mental, physical, and financial health.	0
i've moved in to help while i'm working remote, but it's not enough.	0
i feel that having an in-home caregiver come 3 days a week will give my mom free time to focus on herself, that way when she spends time with my mom it can be as her daughter, not just as her caregiver.	0
she is very against it, thinks my grandma will not enjoy it.	0
imo i don't see the point in my mom putting her life on hold for someone who's already lived her life.	0
it's not like i'm asking to put her in a home, just to give her time back in her week to exercise, spend time with friends, alone, whatever.	0
just joined the sub, sorry if this has been covered before, but wondering what are good solo activities that are good for someone who has limited mobility, poor vision and is hearing impaired?	0
its a tough trifecta.	0
my 97 yr old grandmother is sharp as a tack but bored out of her mind because theres seemingly nothing to do but sit around.	0
she has macular degeneration, so she can see, but its got to be very large print, so reading is mostly out shes got hearing aids and enjoys audiobooks some times, but she has difficulty seeing the screen to start them on her own (see above) tv is ok, but has similar issues with the remote, etc any ideas from the redditverse would be greatly appreciated!!	0

my daddy is the strongest man i know.	0
he is 83 years old.	0
he worked hard his entire life to provide for his children.	0
he was a trucker.	0
a custom harvester.	0
a farmer.	0
its because of my dad that i understand where our food comes from.	0
its because of my dad that i have the work ethic i do.	0
dad was diagnosed with dementia a year and a half ago, but we knew he had it for a lot longer.	0
its hard.	0
its so hard to watch him deteriorate.	0
i hate it.	0
i hate the thought of losing my dad.	0
whats even worse is he told my mom that he would be dead within a month.	0
i have never heard of dementia patients predicting their deaths, but she has, and so has my fianc.	0
it scares me.	0
how do you prepare yourself?	0
!	0
warning: long post ahead!	0
i (27f) have helped take care of my granddad for the past 10 years of my life.	0
i had my family with me to provide the care, so i didn't have to struggle alone and we coordinated over the years.	0
as time passed, my granddad's health required more care.	0
health appointments, in-home healthcare, feeding, bathing, bathroom, dressing, and through all of the really scary breathing episodes and hard conversations about death...  we handled it together.	0
i loved him so much.	0
he passed away this past may.	0
after his passing, my family and i were evicted from our home, homeless for a month so had to stay in a hotel and our savings dwindled to nothing, and finally moved into a small townhome.	0
holidays came, new jobs, and court cases followed (spoiler: we lost; lesson: don't get involved with shady landlords).	0
things have been far from easy, but definitely not as hard as they could have been.	0
so this is all to say: i'm in a very different place than most of my peers now.	0
i mean, i still live at home, my credit is shot, my experiences are so vastly different than others my age, and emotionally...  i'm just so done.	0
i'm now in a place where i can evaluate what i want to do with the rest of my life without having to take someone else's care into account and i don't know what to do.	0
i'm struggling so much with his loss, the grief, and having the center of my world completely taken away.	0
it's like my skeleton is gone and i'm just a giant puddle of what used to be me.	0
i don't know myself outside of his care.	0
i didn't even have time to process his loss and it's hitting me now wave after wave and i can't catch my breath.	0
because of covid, we didn't even have a proper burial.	0
i feel so lost and just don't know how to proceed to pick up my life and make some kind of progress.	0
i know this is incredibly emotional and probably self-pitying, and it's really not meant to be that way, but i wanted to share where i am and see if others can relate?	0
do you have advice?	0

when you come across any of these things, grab a gallon baggie, slap a blank mailing label on it, and grab a sharpie photographs or polaroids admin paperwork paper memories example: baggie labeled tub #1  photographs or tub #1  admin paperwork the bulky important paperwork this is something i learned the hard way.	0
youre going to come across certain things that take you a couple of minutes to figure out.	0
and they will be bulky, but skirt the line between important admin paperwork and memories.	0
for example: i found scatters of 400 pages of my grans book she published in 1998. it took me a good minute to accumulate all of the pages.	0
and they just kept showing up in boxes.	0
for like 3 days, that manuscript was its own category.	0
i threw them all together in the end with the paper memories category.	0
label.	0
all.	0
non-obvious.	0
items.	0
the term when organizing, you should touch everything only once, has a more important mental and psychological message, which is when organizing, you should determine what something is, only once.	0
that folder in tub #3 that just says west palm beach.	0
at first glance, you dont know exactly whats in that thing.	0
could be anything, really.	0
so take a look inside.	0
grab a pen and a notebook on a clipboard.	0
write down the contents of the folder.	0
for example: on my notebook, the west palm beach folder had homeowners insurance, property tax assessments, receipts, email correspondences, inspection reports, final floorplan, and a couple of other things i dont really remember.	0
grab a post-it note, or a piece of paper big enough to tape onto the outside of the folder.	0
write down, in sharpie, on the note, the contents of what is in that folder.	0
why: when you go through the collections stack of paperwork during round 2, you wont have to spend critical time and energy determining the contents of every folder.	0
when you have big bold labels on stuff, youre saving your brain from expending energy doing critical thinking later on.	0
you really dont want to have to pick up the same stack of west palm beach 3 times, and every time having to flip through it to figure out the contents.	0
do the dirty work the first time, and you will save yourself the trouble later.	0
use those baggies!	0
so many things can fit into baggies!	0
notes.	0
tiny school portraits.	0
business cards.	0
newspaper articles.	0
they can all fit into baggies!	0
label the bag with a the container number theyre in along with the category they belong to, and fill those babies up!	0
method established.	0
work through your collection.	0
go ahead and sort the rest of the containers into your designated categories.	0
sort yourself as you sort their stuff never let your piles become super crazy and unorganized.	0
if you have a hoard of labeled baggies just sitting around without being put into their main category, take the time to place them there.	0
it is really easy to let the process take over your entire room/house/life.	0
dont let it.	0
clean as you work.	0
rome wasnt built in a day remember: rome wasn't built in a day.	0
it will take days, maybe even a few weeks, to go through every single thing.	0
especially if you're getting rid of their clothes and food and dishes, furniture, etc as well.	0
you may have put off the boxes and tubs because of the physical and mental and emotional exhaustion it creates.	0
you need to give yourself breaks, remember to drink water, and remember to drop everything and come back to it if it's just getting to be too much for you.	0
you have time.	0
and the process takes time.	0
so take.	0
your.	0
time.	0
just as an aside: i really, really want to emphasize a practice of self-care that i had no idea existed until this: taking your time.	0
it's easy to have a cup of coffee and rush through half a box, but you will be burned out, exhausted, and super irritable every single time.	0
taking your time will help you be more organized and will let your brain go through the process with ease rather than make it feel like it's some sort of race.	0
you will thank yourself.	0
remember to eat.	0
don't become too tunnel visioned.	0
don't get too caught up in what you find.	0
and do not try to create more categories unless you absolutely need to.	0
round 2 you will end up with containers filled with categories rather than containers filled with uhhhhh.	0
the photo container will be a whole project within itself.	0
save that baby for last.	0
sit down with a category and start figuring out if you need to keep it, keep it and digitize it, shred it, or toss it.	0
the digitization process is also another project within itself.	0
if you determine you need to digitize a document, shove a label on it saying digitize, a label of description of the contents, and then put it in a new digitize category.	0
i have a method for digitizing and organizing your documents that i will probably write up another time (im still doing this and figuring out a solid method.	0
im not finished, and i wont be for a while).	0
like with like put things related to each other in their own folder.	0
in paper memories, you will need to determine sub-categories.	0
example: paper memories went from a box of loose papers to \~7 sub-categories such as phylliss education love letters from nick childrens artwork cards notes and a couple others.	0
another example: paperwork went from a box of loose papers to a crazy amount of sub-categories including sale of west palm beach house medical records 2016 receipts bank statements lawyer miss kittys vet records, etc.	0
bonus round: photos once you finish everything but the photographs, you can move to the photos.	0
but you will have trained yourself enough through the first process to know how to sort the photos.	0
and it's basically along the same lines as subcategorizing the other categories.	0
i have about 2000 photos, and i think i have even more at the bottom of another box.	0
so far, i have 34 categories of photos.	0
"everything from ""roeltgen family 1996 - 2006 sonora house, tx"" to ""cindy's wedding"" to ""strange photo tour of cindy's house"" to ""granny pre-1985""."	0
im still working on photos.	0
its a trip.	0
but it is super rewarding.	0
all in all you will become much more comfortable with the entire sorting process the more you go through them.	0
and it will get much, much easier.	0
i wish you the best of luck.	0
may the organization gods smile upon you.	0
youre not a robot.	0
you will get through this.	0
and i am so, so, so sorry for your loss.	0
my mother is in a nursing home and her caseworker has asked me to purchase a recliner chair for her because she keeps falling out of her wheelchair.	0
has anyone else been asked to do this and if so what kind of recliner should i purchase?	0
do you have any advice for a new caregiver?	0
i have to get all of this off my chest.	0
a couple weeks ago, grandma, who was living in an assisted living place, decided she was going to quit dialysis (which would cause a painless death within 14 days).	0
she said her life wasnt worth living in a care facility, but she didnt want to burden her family with caring for her.	0
we had a meeting, in which her 4 children and i (her grandchild), told her how much she meant to us, and that wed like to try making her life better.	0
so instead of quitting dialysis, it was decided she would move in with me.	0
why me?	0
well i live the closest to where all her doctors are.	0
she has 4 retired children, and somehow making grandmas life worth living, became my burden.	0
i naively thought this would be easy.	0
i just had to cook for her, help her shower, and drive her to and from dialysis three times a week.	0
im a freelancer, so ive been working while she naps.	0
but i hate my new life so much.	0
its so draining.	0
my complaints are so petty.	0
but this woman who used to be the dependable matriarch of our family now calls me over ever time she needs a tiny little thing.	0
shell ask for a tissue, which is just barely out of arms reach for her.	0
so i stand up, walk over to her, move the tissue box a little closer, and shell say, i just needed one.	0
ok.... then i sit back down, and shell say, i need my chapstick too.	0
so i get up and go find that for her.	0
as im handing it to her, she says, while youre up, could you dump this tea and make me a latte?	0
of course i can, thats easy but why do i feel so bitter as i walk to the sink.	0
i make her a latte (more peppermint than white chocolate, she explains).	0
i hand it to her, and without fail she asks me, did you stir this?	0
oh my god.	0
why does she ask me that every time??	0
yes grandma, i stirred it.	0
cooking is a whole other hassle because she has so many dietary restrictions, and she turns up her nose at anything with spices.	0
no cumin, basil, paprika, and definitely no pepper.	0
no onions, garlic, or bell peppers.	0
ive basically been rotating through macaroni, pizza, and pasta for dinner.	0
at night, its the worst.	0
for example yesterday she told me, after you finish working, come help me shower and then ill go to bed.	0
good deal.	0
but after i finished working, i went to her and she said, i didnt know youd be done so quickly.	0
ill shower in half an hour.	0
its 9pm at this point, but ok, i guess i can wait half an hour.... half and hour later, i come back and help her shower.	0
instead of coming straight to bed like i expected, she said, im going to the couch to let me hair dry.	0
....... fine..... so she turns on ncis.	0
i come back half an hour later.	0
its past 10:30 now.	0
i tell her im getting ready for bed, and she says, wheres my dessert?	0
she wants a cinnamon roll, a whole one.	0
i bring her one and she says, i want you to cut this into pieces for me.	0
im pulling my hair at this point.	0
i cut it up into little bite sized pieces and go downstairs to brush my teeth.	0
i come back up and shes in the middle of a new episode of ncis.	0
i tell her i need to go to bed.	0
and she sighs and says, after this episode.	0
so i come back as soon as the episode is over, and she has finally taken a bite of her cinnamon roll.	0
she says, if i knew you were coming back, i would have eaten this faster.	0
i ask her, does that mean you dont need my help getting to bed?	0
and she sounds frustrated and says, i might fall, but i dont know when i will.	0
so i need you nearby.	0
i ask her if shes done with her dessert and she says, fine, take it.	0
its midnight at this point.	0
then for some inexplicable reason, she opens her laptop up!	0
gah!	0
i tell her im going to bed and i leave.	0
15 minutes later i hear her calling me from her bed.	0
i get out of bed and go to her and she says, turn off the bedroom light for me.	0
and bring me my cell phone in case i need to call you.	0
but dont turn the hallway light off this time!	0
i go back to bed, its past midnight, but my head is so full of negative thoughts and emotions, i cant even fall asleep.	0
is this my new life?	0
i hate it so much.	0
i hate it.	0
i resent my grandma.	0
i used to respect her, and now i borderline despise her.	0
but what choice do i have?	0
if i tell her that im feeling burdened, shell quit dialysis and die.	0
for what??	0
because i was tired of making her lattes and cutting up her food?	0
i keep telling myself that im just going through and adjustment period and the strong negative emotions will fade with time.	0
but so far they seem to be getting worse.	0
i heard her talking on the phone yesterday with her friend.	0
grandma told her friend that i was one of her favorites, and that i spoil her, and that shes really happy that she left the care facility.	0
so at least my sacrifice isnt in vain.... but does she realize how difficult shes being?	0
i feel like caring for my grandpa with lewy body dementia has been traumatic for me.	0
i have nightmares of him chasing me and poping out of nowhere.	0
is this normal??	0
i feel like i shouldve moved on.	0
my grandpa had lewy body dementia.	0
its been 7 years since he has died now.	0
my grandpa started being ill when i was 10 and slowly got worse until he died when i was 15. we didnt live with him but came to visit often.	0
it was distressing seeing him get progressively worse, have hallucinations and become extremely paranoid.	0
he very quickly forgot who i was and what time-period we were in.	0
he was also awful to my grandmother who looked after him, he would be extremely rude and at times violent.	0
it was also hard seeing him physically change until he was unrecognizable.	0
the worse thing was probably seeing what it did to my mum, who is extremely closed off emotionally but was clearly holding back how depressed she was during that time.	0
he has been gone for so long but its like i was never able to grief.	0
i respected him so much before it all started.	0
now i feel so guilty that most of my memories with him make me hate him.	0
and im so scared my mum will have the same illness as she ages.	0
last night was the first time my grandpa was in my dream and looked completely powerless and didnt chase after me or anything, as i was explaining to a child what was going on with him.	0
anyone else feels this way or has tips to deal with a traumatic loss like this?	0
22f, looking after grandfather who is entirely dependent.	0
after two years of being his caregiver with one being dependent, the time has come.	0
i guess after his recent hospital stay, after just about every doctor and nurse basically made sure i knew that care homes existed, i guess it was finally hitting me.	0
"to be honest i was seriously looking into the idea before the visit but as a ""maybe"" kind of thing."	0
but now i think i'm sure - he needs to be around more skilled nurses.	0
the internal medicine doctor who worked with us told me that his care is only getting more intense.	0
his blood vessels are now too narrow for medicine to make a permanent effect and that he will have another stroke.	0
she says that i also need to live my life.	0
my family members don't really check on us.	0
not even my mom, who only messages me once every few months to apologize and ask me how i'm doing.	0
my aunt seems to be more passionate but tbh whenever she suggests it....she's kinda drunk.	0
i have three uncles and only one of them has been a little involved but he doesnt visit anymore.	0
apparently he's begun college which is great but also i feel a little envy haha.	0
i sometimes want to ask why but honestly, grandpa wasn't the best parent growing up.	0
even to me.	0
i'll spare the details but....sadly, i do understand.	0
i do get it.	0
but still, couldnt they just help for the sake of me?	0
idk maybe that sounds selfish.	0
i think i was always my grandpas favorite grandkid.	0
so he was kinder (ish).	0
i feel really bad for sending him away.	0
but its getting harder.	0
i want him to go so that he can be comfortable.	0
for reference, i'm 4'10 and skinny.	0
lifting him around has definitely caused some body pain.	0
waking up every three hours and not getting proper sleep has left its toll.	0
my anxiety goes up bc hes nonverbal and refuses to use any communication other than nodding.	0
so i never know whats wrong.	0
i always think itll be better if he goes but then i imagine him alone at night in the care home, his family not around.	0
it kinda breaks my heart as i do have a soft spot for elderly people.	0
i say i'll visit every day and maybe even get him an ipad once i get a job again but would it be the same?	0
how is he going to make friends if he can't even talk?	0
will he be comfortable with his nurse?	0
do i even deserve to put him there, it hasn't been that long?	0
so many worries.	0
if you have a similar experience, i'd be happy to read it.	0
my 95 year old mother is in home hospice care, her only disease being a more long term critical heart problem.	0
she moans a lot.	0
sometimes for hours.	0
often she's basically ok and can smile and chat a little between moans, with considerable dementia, albeit coherent/rational.	0
i wish i could make her a little more comfortable.	0
she's on oxygen, not a severe breathing problem tho.	0
it seems like it's more cellular exhaustion.	0
anyone dealt with this kind of moaning?	0
hi everyone, throwaway account because i don't want this linked with my main account for privacy reasons.	0
so, my (38f) father (85) has been living in a nursing home (specific for alzheimer's) since november 2019. caring for him was impossible at home, my mom was his caregiver and she couldn't take it any longer.	0
he was much happier at the nursing home than at his own home, always in a good mood, he thrived.	0
this is, until covid came.	0
then, basically the whole nursing home caught it, he had mild symptoms but i feel that the isolation and the temporary stop to services like therapy and stuff really made the disease worse faster than it would have been otherwise.	0
also, he was still recognizing us in february 2020, then not anymore after covid, at least not constantly.	0
so, covid robbed me of that.	0
his condition worsened slowly, until last tuesday they admitted him in the hospital for labored breathing.	0
they sent him back to the nursing home, since the only available therapy seems to be hydration and oxygen (sorry english is not my main language, and i'm a bit confused, i hope it makes sense).	0
basically, he's dying.	0
despite covid, they suggested us to go visit in person, they didn't say it out loud but it's clear our visit's purpose is to say goodbye.	0
i went to visit, he's unconscious and breaths very heavily, if i didn't know it was him i wouldn't have recognized him.	0
he's so different from the last time i saw him in person (a month ago, more or less).	0
my feeling are mixed, my relationship with him was always so difficult, he was abusive towards my mother (even if in subtle ways and doing things that were accepted as normal 50 years ago).	0
i'm sad, but deep down i think my feelings should be stronger.	0
i'm waiting for the news, and i don'd feel dread at the thought.	0
i feel like the inevitable is happening.	0
i'm calm, i function almost normally.	0
i have been grieving for the last two years and this feels like the end that was supposed to be from the beginning.	0
i hate that he has alzheimer's, i hate that we never spoke about our differences, that our conflicts never went away and he just faded away with no resolution.	0
i guess i'm not hating that he's dying.	0
all of this is just awful.	0
sorry, i think i just needed to get this out of my chest to strangers.	0
&#x200b; tl;dr: my father with alzheimer's is dying and i needed to vent	0
after many months of frustration and being the primary caregiver i scheduled a break.	0
meeting my best friend out of town for a couple of nights.	0
shes a single mom and ive been a caregiver for my mother for the last two years, so this was well earned for both of us.	0
i could hardly contain my excitement for this weekend!	0
well its night # 1 and my friend is sitting in a tub of vomit and water while i beg her to get out of it.	0
i came away to be a fun single woman again - remind myself that theres life out there.	0
instead, ive found something more challenging than looking after my mother....a drunk stubborn woman who cant hold her liquor.	0
i just posted about finding photos of my family cut up and shoved into plastic bags in her belongings.	0
she went to live in a memory care facility about a year ago after it was evident that she needed to be watched absolutely full time and have skilled nurses around full time who know how to restrain her.	0
gran started believing she was still in college when she was still living with us.	0
she used to ask us what time lecture was today, and would ask if we read the assigned texts.	0
we would of course play along for the time.	0
the problem started when we would need to give her medicine.	0
it was actually a little bit cute.	0
she said she felt so wrong taking drugs from her sorority sisters, but if we promised not to tell her boyfriend, she would take it.	0
this only worked for a couple of times before she absolutely refused to take the pills.	0
she would have triggers, where she would get a small realization of reality, and then have a psychotic life threatening breakdown.	0
this happened 4 times before we took her to 'her dorm' (the memory care facility).	0
we would visit her every couple of weeks, but every time we came, she would snap into 'reality' so hard that it would leave her in a state of absolute inconsolable crisis and eventual full blown psychosis.	0
the head of the facility gave us a call and had a heart to heart with us that we ultimately understood.	0
they said that seeing us tears her away from her delusion, which is the only place in her life that she believes is comfortable.	0
they said that when they have to sedate her after our visits trigger psychosis, the medicine puts her life at risk.	0
we came to the agreement that having us visit her is putting her through unfathomable stress and that we should only visit when things are dire.	0
i thought i had come to terms with my grandmother not knowing that i exist.	0
i didn't think that being seen by her would threaten her life.	0
losing a parent/grandparent is hard.	0
but this is one cruel experience for all of us.	0

&#x200b; ex: mental/neurological ability of the person  - a problem or question requires a bunch of steps for them to understand the question  - or you have to convince them to take some action but the reasoning requires more than 2-3 steps to explain -> it becomes impossible for them to understand the reasoning  &#x200b; what are your options at that point?	0

i just dont understand it, sometimes.	0
i simply cannot comprehend the reasoning.	0
this must have happened before we took away sharp objects.	0
this is so painful to experience as a family member.	0
even after theyre not in your care anymore.	0
but its almost impossible to know what she is going through.	0
i cannot imagine.	0
i think i might tell a little more about her story in another post.	0
but right now i have memories and a mind to mourn.	0
my 65-year-old mother has been severely mentally ill (schizophrenia, bi-polar, depression, anxiety,  etc) since the 70s.	0
she is medicated and receiving therapy.	0
she also has a history of alcohol abuse.	0
starting around a year ago, she began to have issues with memory/cognition/anxiety that usually begins roughly around 4 pm each night, but is gone by morning.	0
the next morning/day she is back to normal.	0
since the pandemic began, she spends most of her day watching youtube, netflix, etc.	0
she is has been evaluated (always in the morning) and nobody has picked up on anything.	0
i've read about sundowning, but isn't that usually occurring in people who have advanced cases of dementia/alzheimers?	0
my parents believe it is a medication thing, but i'm unsure.	0

so if you can great if you can share thats fantastic.	0
love you guys and this community.	0
my dad raised us alone after our mothers suicide and i just want to give him comfort in his remaining time.	0

today, a visiting nurse came to see my grandma to check on her overall health.	0
my dad, and my grandma's in-home caregiver were there.	0
the nurse checked on grandma's bed sores, medications, and overall home safety.	0
after her visit, she called me, and told me she felt it wasn't safe for grandma to be at home by herself.	0
finally.	0
someone friggin' understands.	0
i've been telling my dad for months and months that it's not safe for grandma to be in her house by herself.	0
he kept arguing saying that if we get grandma more help she's gonna get mad and nasty at us.	0
but now, there's a nurse actually telling us that it's time to either get grandma a 24/7 caregiver or to get her into memory care.	0
and we can't argue!	0
cause if we don't get her help, we could get in big trouble.	0
when i told my dad what the nurse said, i think it finally sunk in.	0
i told him that if the nurse makes an aps report, that police could get involved and something seemed to click.	0
he's still scare grandma's going to throw a huge fit, but i told him it doesn't matter how mad she gets.	0
it's not safe for her to be in that house alone.	0
i've already been reaching out to memory care facilities near her home, so now it's just a matter of filling out applications and planning the transition.	0
i feel so validated today, and such a huge relief that someone understands and is listening.	0
and grandma's going to be somewhere with people who can help her 24/7.	0
help her take her meds, help her take a bath, keep her company when she gets lonely.	0
and she's going to be safe.	0
i'm at the er with my mil today.	0
her nursing home found her on the bathroom floor this morning.	0
they're doing the normal tests to research that, but in the 4 hours we've been here she's requested to pee 5x, without drinking anything.	0
she doesn't remember going and gets mad no one has been in yet.	0
they're checking for a uti.	0
i wonder if part of the problem is that she doesn't remember peeing a few minutes ago and assumes she still needs to pee - without the actual urge to pee.	0
she's used a bed pan that is emptied outside her room each time so i can't speak to the volume or anything else.	0
it used to be that i could reason with her or distract her, or basically give her the benefit of the doubt and let her save face, now i don't know how to talk to her.	0
it went downhill after she broke her leg on the porch (sneaking out for a cigarette) in november.	0
after she came back from rehab, she was still stubborn and sometimes she thought i was a caregiver lady who looked similar to her granddaughter but she wasn't angry about that (actually she was nicer when she thought i was a stranger).	0
in the last month it is even worse.	0
she is sundowning several times a week, thrashing and sobbing because she doesn't recognize her own kitchen cabinets and doesn't believe she's in her house.	0
yesterday she left the bathroom faucet running, and she got angry at me because i didn't let her go into the bathroom while there was standing water on the floor.	0
she gets utis regularly because she insists she doesn't need help to change her depends, surely it doesn't help she refuses to be bathed or even use a baby wipe.	0
she will turn 90 soon.	0
how long does this go on?	0
does she ever become more docile or does it just get angrier and more distrustful from here?	0
my mother has been having memory issues for a while but we dismissed it as her being too much of a social drinker.	0
in the last 6 months, things have gotten really bad.	0
she would get weird theories in her head, ex.	0
she was positive that my husband and i were closely related and only me saying that we had had genetic testing while pursuing infertility treatments could allay her fears.	0
when my father, her ex husband, passed in december she took an extreme down turn mentally.	0
she is going to therapy, and her husband and the doctor believes that it is alzheimers/ dementia.	0
is there any advice that you can give me as we head down this road?	0
i just feel a little lost, like i lost my father and then immediately started to lose my mother and i dont know what to do.	0
i just found this company that pays people to be family caregivers ...https://www.aidaly.com/  anyone tried it?	0
how much do you make?	0
curious because i might have to quit my job my mom needs so much help but she cant afford a nice retirement community and so it is going to be me and if i have to quit my job i'll be on unemployment and then have a hard time getting another job.	0
getting paid would be awesome.	0
didn't know i could - hope this is real!!!!!	0

hi everyone, my mother (68) has begun showing a new symptom.	0
she will look in the mirror and see herself, and talk to this other person as if she is just meeting them.	0
she also talks to empty areas of the house that she thinks are people (no one is there).	0
has anyone else seen this?	0
i dont think its harmful since the people seem to be friendly/nice, just curious of others experiences.	0
my mom has started saying un-politically correct things, racist jokes.	0
it's the kind of stuff you would see on the office, which is super cringey and wrong, but not in the heat of the night-level.	0
she is still lucid but is experiencing cognitive decline.	0
should i say something to her, or just let it be?	0
hi all, ive posted before, but im 20 years old and the chief caretaker of my 96 year old grandmother.	0
about a month ago, she declined sharply.	0
every two minutes, shed say she had to use the bathroom.	0
sometimes immediately after getting off shed want to go again.	0
when we denied her request, or just asked her to wait a little while, shed wail incessantly.	0
two days ago, we decided to send her to the hospital to be checked out.	0
as far as we know right now, its a mental thing.	0
shes not constipated, and uti tests are negative.	0
my mom called me and mentioned that we may have to put her in a nursing home.	0
i dont know.	0
i feel like im quitting on her.	0
shes horrified of being put in a home.	0
i feel horrible, and at the same time relieved.	0
in just the two days shes been gone ive cleaned and caught up on my schoolwork.	0
if im being honest with myself, i know the care i provided to her wasnt good, and the care i gave myself nonexistent.	0
i dont know.	0
its nothing set in stone yet, just a passing comment really.	0
i dont know.	0

hi everyone!	0
ive been caring for an elderly, disabled parent for almost 3 years.	0
ive posted here before.	0
im in this 24/7/365.	0
no help.	0
we recently lost our car, and we live in a rural area.	0
the car belonged to my parent but was sold to a sibling years ago, because my parent cannot drive.	0
the deal was that the car would be available to my parent as needed.	0
i lived out of state so it benefitted for my sibling to get the car, with the typical handshake and promises.	0
my parent paid for repairs, upkeep, insurance and gas.	0
for years!	0
i used it for 3 years.	0
until my sibling decided to give it to their child.	0
the traveling wheelchair in the car was never returned.	0
in spite of pleading.	0
and the safety belt i used to lift my parent?	0
gone.	0
brand new tires, too.	0
fine!	0
i got a new wheelchair delivered from a local organization.	0
i have a belt on order.	0
i make arrangements with friends to get meds and groceries.	0
we cant buy a new car.	0
my money is gone, from my move back gone to care for my parent.	0
my parent lost their life savings to a nursing home, before i got back.	0
im not able to work outside of the home.	0
im not looking for money, at all, but grateful for advice.	0
my parent has private insurance, and federal insurance.	0
how do i find out how to get my parent to appointments and for short trips?	0
no taxis here.	0
at all.	0
im not sure for how long this situation will be sustainable.	0
i need to brainstorm options.	0
buying a new vehicle is completely off the table.	0
any advice is appreciated.	0
ps: is this new biden plan, for caregivers, going to pay family members like us?	0
god, that would be a huge deal!	0

this is such a stupid question but i cant seem to find an answer on the internet.	0
if you move into a ccrc (continuing care retirement community), and then die without spending all your assets (aka never enter nursing home level care or only have for a short period of time), do your children still inherit your remaining assets or does the ccrc keep everything?	0
my parents will be able to pay the entry fee with selling their house, and then pay monthly expenses at the independent living level through pensions/ssi, and will still have a remaining ~$500k in retirement funds.	0
i understand that if they need a higher level of care for any long period that $500k will go quickly and thats fine, but i was weirdly under the impression that the ccrc kept everything no matter what.	0
but just typing that out makes that seem crazy!	0
i cant believe i dont know this.	0
i read your stories when i hit low points and man.....people are dealing with some brutal situations out there.	0
i makes me feel guilty when i read them.	0
so it makes me wonder if it's the emotional element that makes this role so draining.	0
it's the worry they are safe and happy.	0
comfortable as well as engaged.	0
it's the wanting things to be ok that makes this such a wipe out.	0
it's fine to have an accident in the bed, easy to clean up, get the person clean but the stress comes with the keeping their dignity, worrying about why this happened, concern about what it means.	0
that is the stuff that wipes me out.	0
is it our emotional ties that add the stress to this role?	0
this is my first post here and i'm on mobile and very tired so sorry if this is a long mess.	0
for quick background, i'm 24, in the us, and i've been a caregiver for my 63 y/o mom for over 8 years.	0
she is physically disabled with a lot of health conditions (too many to list at the moment).	0
we live together alone with no other family nearby.	0
my mom has been physically declining over the last year.	0
she has been getting very tired and nauseous often, unable to do household things like she used to and only small tasks, which exhaust her for the rest of the day.	0
in the past when i helped her with things, the work was fairly minor like helping with vacuuming, cooking and bringing her things.	0
she was able to do some household tasks from time to time and she enjoyed being able to do some things.	0
recently she hasn't been able to do pretty much anything except walk to the bathroom/kitchen/computer, which tires her out.	0
i've been doing nearly everything for her.	0
cooking, all cleaning, paperwork, phone calls etc.	0
for now she is still able to drive very short distances and bathe/toilet on her own.	0
but that's it.	0
this is the thing i could use some advice for if possible: how to emotionally support her.	0
she has been very upset about her declining health, which is definitely understandable.	0
this week she had a long overdue doctor's appointment.	0
her bloodwork results came back and they said the results were concerning.	0
they said they will need further tests she's been especially upset about this and has been crying.	0
however, i'm struggling to help her with this.	0
it's always been difficult for me but it's gotten worse.	0
my mom has always had some occasional anger issues and when she vents she vents with a very angry, aggressive tone and it sets off my anxiety.	0
i have depression, anxiety and adhd.	0
i have some trauma from yelling/ verbally aggressive people from my childhood and it shows very obviously when she vents because i start shaking and my heart races.	0
a few hours ago she needed to vent and and told me she's scared and doesn't want to get sicker or die.	0
i started feeling a panic attack coming on and i tried my best to hide it and listen but i started shaking.	0
she saw this and got upset and thinks she can't talk to me about this anymore.	0
i feel awful about this she doesn't have any other friends/family to talk to.	0
she refuses therapy because of a bad therapist she had in the past.	0
i'm all she has for emotional support and i need to learn to help her and try to be a good listener.	0
i'm scared and i've been having mental breakdowns even before this.	0
i feel like i'm worthless as a caregiver i do have my first therapy appointment scheduled but it's not for a while yet thank you for reading this post... i'm so sorry it's so long	0
i miss talking to my mum normally.	0
she's deteriorated very quickly and can't convey her thoughts and feelings very well any more.	0
it was only last year that we were chatting normally - feels like so long ago!	0
how do you cope with knowing your loved one will never be the same again?	0
it's hitting me hard tonight as we got some bad news today and i'm thinking about all the things that will never happen again...	0
this happened about a week ago and thus far we haven't seen unusual activity above what the bot handles.	0
we try to be fair but firm, and still practice forgiveness (on occasion).	0
cheers.	0
hi, im billy and im 22 years old, turning 23 at the end of the year.	0
im in the hoarders and child of hoarders sub reddits and i post there mildly whoever im going through things with my hoarding grand mother.	0
she has this cycle where she makes big messes in our house, stays up extremely late which results in me having to clean the mess, sleep, wake up, take a nap, then repeat.	0
ive noticed after most of her naps she gets really aggressive, although im not sure if its just aggression towards me or in general.	0
a friend with very credible medical knowledge told me today that shes developing onset dementia.	0
what would you guys suggest i do?	0
(side note: im currently unemployed rn but will start work at bath and body works in late april when the new store opens up... if that matters)	0
i'm a psych nurse but have worked with younger patients mostly, presenting with schizophrenia and personality disorders.	0
my mom is rapidity progressing through dementia and i find myself at a loss on how to respond to her, how to keep her safe and comfortable.	0
she lives at home with my dad, who is bed bound 2d to strokes.	0
there is a caretaker there 24 hours and my sister and i visit daily.	0
"mom has started to try to ""go home""."	0
she asks over and over for us to take her home and does not recognize that she is in the house she's lived in for 40 years.	0
any advice or sources of information are welcome.	0
mom passed 3 years ago the 13th at 94 years of age and is on my mind.	0
she was sweet like mother teresa until you threatened her family.	0
for a small woman she was pretty tough.	0
the last few years she suffered increasing alzheimers and i suspect dementia.	0
she had oodles of energy til the end.	0
they had a banker named jaime, super nice guy.	0
mom called him hymen.	0
couldnt get her to say jaime.	0
it was always hymen no matter what.	0
i explained it and she just stared at me lol.	0
"""yea, hymen""."	0
trips to the bank were fun lol.	0
i moved back thanks to a job change and very glad i did.	0
i was needed.	0
mom withdrew from the outside world a year after i came back.	0
she forgot most of cooking and she was always excellent.	0
so i took over more and more of chores, until i did all the shopping etc.	0
she quit her library club and no matter how hard dad tried she wouldnt go back.	0
dad was dead wrong.	0
you dont ever force them to do anything.	0
then when dad was in rehab hospital mom tried to drive out to see him and got lost.	0
dad always had to have a shortcut, feeling that made him special.	0
it was a very simple drive and he confused her and she got lost.	0
thank god she found her way home but it scared her so bad she never left the house again.	0
i wish i could get a do-over now that i know more.	0
this society does not prepare us to help people or ourselves with aging issues.	0
if you're wondering if your loved one or friend suffers from an aging disease get some answers.	0
do some research.	0
if they act a bit odd or you dont understand then they may need help.	0
never think theyre being lazy or dumb or mean.	0
thats not it.	0
most of us will suffer near the end with this.	0
be patient and compassionate.	0
most importantly its simple things like a hug or a call or just spending some time.	0
mom loved arranging flowers.	0
i would get her a bouquet from work and she would arrange and rearrange them for a couple weeks.	0
its the little things.	0
its looking into their heart and playing a string.	0
you can reach them if you try.	0
just dont ever have regrets.	0
theres a big rose bush outside the dining room window.	0
moms roses.	0
she would sit and watch the birds and love the flowers.	0
the day after she passed it had more roses on it than id ever seen.	0
its been through so much bad weather the past 3 years and we thought we lost it during the winter storm here in tx.	0
but i trimmed it and its coming back strong.	0
.posting this now instead of sunday, because i have it in front of me, and my current abilities are just too fragile to be sure i will remember how to do bring it up later.	0
\>> https://truthfulkindness.com/2021/03/31/tied/ ; #dementia #mood .	0
i'm going to crosspost this to both the bpd and dementia subs to see if anyone can help identify this.	0
wife... early 50's.	0
here's what's definite: 23andme shows high probability of alz.	0
often forgetful.	0
definitely has abandonment issues and splitting.	0
"probably covert npd (doesn't seek public attention but constantly over-focused on self and other clues) problem: occasional late night episodes of emotional instability and blaming me and children for lots of problems: (""our kids don't listen, you might have a secret gf, we're not getting anywhere in life"", etc etc)  these tend to happen after sundown and often get worse into the night, sometimes to the point where she'll rant past midnight until she just poops out to sleep."	0
then seem fine in the morning.	0
strange thing: often times taking a hot shower before bed will exascerbate the episode, or spawn one out of nowhere.	0
do all these clues tend to indicate a bpd or early dementia episode?	0
hi all.	0
my grandma has mid-stage alzheimers.	0
in having conversations with her you know that things arent right-very repetitive mostly, so i know her friends all know already that she is forgetting.	0
i would love advice on how you officially shared the news with the people close to your family member?	0
and did you tell your family member with dementia that you were going to do so?	0
my grandma doesnt realize she has it, despite being in the doctors office when the diagnosis was made, so her telling her friends isnt an option.	0
thanks!	0
has anyone else ever had to figure out at-home hospice care for their loved one that has magellan complete care?	0
i'm trying to figure out who my moms case worker is and what hospice services they cover but i'm having problems figuring out what services they cover and who's in-network	0
i am wondering if anyone here has purchased one of these clocks (several brands available, all appear to be the same) https://www.amazon.ca/dp/b01n0l8u8d/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_glc_i_3agrz88gs61hn4a70stx do you recommend?	0
the reviews are always a bit iffy, and there are no really recent reviews, so i'm on the fence about getting one for my dad.	0
also, for the price i feel like i could get a tablet with a stand and just run some similar clock app.	0
suggestions?	0
thanks.	0
an elderly gentleman lives next door, i'm fairly sure he has dementia but i don't know of any official diagnosis, though his behaviour points to this.	0
he keeps to himself but i've noticed he's deteriorated over the years and has had a few hospital admissions.	0
he lives alone and has carers that visit 4 times a day.	0
anyway, the odd behaviour...he's been seen naked in the garden a few times that i know of, i've had a few people knock on my door to tell me.	0
he was just rummaging around in some rubbish in his garden with no clothes on, his garden is not private, it has a low wall and school children walk on the path right behind it.	0
i'm worried that it's undignified for him and possibly upsetting to children who have and might witness it.	0
it's not really any of my business but people keep bringing it to my attention.	0
my husband mentioned it to his carers once, should i bring it up to them again?	0
i'm a soon to be registered nurse and i work on an elderly care ward so i'm very used to taking care of people that present like this, but he is my neighbour who i don't have a relationship with, i don't want to overstep any boundaries.	0
hi everyone, my father suffers dementia  we arent totally sure which kind because he refuses to admit that anythings wrong/is too proud to admit that anything is off.	0
he was very successful, professionally and was always praised for his smarts during his career.	0
in fact he has several patents from his career as a fiber-optical engineer, which he earned and is deservedly proud of.	0
anyway.	0
my mother, and his wife of 45 years, recently had open-heart surgery, which was so scary and so complicated.	0
she suffered a stroke as a result, and it was an incredibly scary moment for our family.	0
during her surgery and throughout her hospital stay, i stayed with my father.	0
he had delusions about her whereabouts (suspected shed taken off to mexico; it was around the time of the freeze/power outages in texas and i blame ted cruz).	0
it was awful.	0
hed wake me up in the middle of the night demanding answers.	0
i did a shitty job explaining.	0
i was so frustrated!	0
but there was an evening where he woke me up, totally lucid.	0
he apologized for what was going on, admitted he knew his mind was waning, and apologized to me and our family for the burden hed left us with.	0
i was totally floored.	0
i hugged him, i told him that we loved him, that it wasnt his fault, and that it was just as hard on all of us as it was in him.	0
it made me feel like shit, honestly.	0
but it was also so amazing.	0
i documented all of it and reached out to my mom and sister.	0
i...sort of cant believe this actually happened.	0
in hindsight, it feels like a dream.	0
but it did happen  it really did!	0
has anyone else experienced something like this?	0
i suppose that it doesnt actually matter.	0
my father wont get any better; hell only get worse.	0
but have any of you experienced this moment of clarity?	0
it seemed to me so unreal.	0
i posted sometime back asking for advice on how to help support my husband whose 95 year old dad had dementia bad with violent tendencies.	0
well, everything went downhill after that.	0
his delusions got the better of him, despite our regular attention and talking to him several times a day.	0
basically he got kicked out his assisted living facility for trying to kill the staff (he went after them with knives and stated that he wanted to kill them).	0
it was like a psychotic break.	0
he ended up being hauled away by cops and paramedics then sent for a psych hold.	0
day 1 into the hold he declines rapidly and ends up in the icu.	0
husband was asked by the doctors whether they should intervene, and he said yes.	0
(don't ask why.	0
he said he didn't know why he said yes.	0
he sorta regrets it now).	0
anyway, he seemed on the brink of death for at least a week, such that my husband called the family to come naay goodbye.	0
but by some miracle he eventually makes it out of the icu and is slowly but surely going back to normal.	0
we're now looking at him being released to a skilled nursing facility and eventually a memory care place.	0
meanwhile, hubby has had to clear out his assisted living apartment and deal with trying to find alternative housing.	0
today, visiting his dad, hubby saw his dad behaving like he was back to his normal - foul, violent - personality and be extremely rude to the nursing staff at the hospital (he's now in a normal room not the icu).	0
something along the lines of yelling at a female nursing staff member to suck his genitalia, when she asked to check his iv.	0
this is how bad he is at like 10% of his normal strength.	0
you get the picture how foul he is.	0
meanwhile the hospital is talking about releasing him soon.	0
but we can't put him in the nearest skilled nursing facility to us because his dad got kicked out of there a few months back - for being extremely foul and violent towards the staff - after the was placed there to battle a serious infection.	0
hubby said he couldnt take another round of this sh*t again.	0
but of course he can't abandon his dad, no matter what.	0
he says now that he regrets having the doctors intervene, maybe he should have just let nature take its course.	0
but i know if he had decided that, he would feel guilty for the rest of his life as if he killed his dad.	0
and then now he feels super guilty for even saying that regrets the decision.	0
i now know that no matter what, he would feel like this no matter the circumstances.	0
it's so frustrating.	0
i don't know what to do.	0
nothing i say helps.	0
i can't reason with him about it because it's a very emotional reaction (understandable) cos it's his father.	0
but this man has always been a manipulative asshole and has basically psychologically tortured his son for the past decade or more - even before his dementia got out of control.	0
hubby realizes this, and even said that he understood why his mom went first, because his dad was psychologically abusive.	0
but at the same time, he cant help feeling this way.	0
how do i help support him?	0
and will i have to deal with this nightmare for the rest of my husband's life?	0
as in, even after his dad dies, he'll still have a psychological hold over my husband?	0
hello all, i am gathering information on demand out there (specifically vancouver island, bc, canada) for a respite bed & breakfast.	0
a place that functions like a b&b-full 3 meals/day plus snacks, some entertainment, outings, all the lovely things about an inn, but that provides personal care, intermittent supervision,  and medication assist for those who need help.	0
this would be a respite destination for family members looking for a break, or even a place for elderly travelling from out of town who need more than your basic hotel.	0
what do you think?	0
is there demand for this?	0
i went to visit my mil (79, parkinson's & dementia) today, and at 5'4 she is around 97 lb and she looks like a walking skeleton.	0
she is pretty discombobulated between failing memory and other failing bodily issues.	0
she is scheduled to be moved to memory care facility at the end of april.	0
every time i go see her, i walk out depressed... i am a very empathetic person and i have a difficult time compartmentalizing...  what mindset would be helpful in these situations?	0
thank you in advance.	0
im 26 and im an informal caregiver, caring for a friends dad whos 84. ive been here for a few months and i realized ive been feeling more and more depressed and fatigued by watching his decline.	0
i dont feel like i can talk to his daughter about it, since its her dad and i feel like i have to be the strong one for her.	0
my mom has suggested i find a community or support group so i dont get burned out, shes pretty worried about me.	0
do you guys have any suggestions on how to care for my own mental health while taking care of him?	0
or support resources?	0
im pretty new to this so to already see it affecting me so much emotionally scares me.	0
i'm not sure if this is the appropriate place to ask about this, but i'm not really sure where else to post with people who would get it.	0
i've been caring for a man in his late 70s since october.	0
he had a stroke back in august and lost his wife, so i was meant to go check in with him a few times a week to give his family a break.	0
he is very independent still and mobile, i was quite literally just there to wipe the counters and check in, maybe go on some walks or do some activities.	0
i go over before and after work since it's just 10 minutes down the street.	0
i've volunteered in nursing homes before and would love to work with the geriatric population later in my career, so i was excited for this opportunity.	0
fast forward to now and i just can't do it anymore.	0
i've turned into a glorified maid that he micromanages and nitpicks.	0
i don't make his bed right or fold his clothes correctly or put the forks away to his liking.	0
he's an old military guy, so i suppose i understand, but i also can't help but feel like he wouldn't treat a man the way he treats me.	0
he stands over me and watches what i do, he goes back over where i just worked to redo it.	0
i've really tried to keep him active and engaged, but every single thing i think might be fun he isn't interested in.	0
he only enjoys playing slots on his phone and watching hallmark movies, both very solitary activities.	0
books for a book club?	0
nope.	0
cards?	0
nah.	0
drawing or crafts?	0
no.	0
crosswords or puzzles?	0
no thanks.	0
board games?	0
not interesting.	0
on top of that, it's nearly impossible to even have a conversation with him because he won't wear his hearing aids half the time.	0
come to find out, multiple people in his family live in the same apartment complex as him.	0
he had an alcohol problem and now has a strained relationship with them.	0
but it makes me so resentful that i'm turning my 8 hour work day into a 10-12 hour day so they don't have to walk 30 yards to check on him.	0
this has translated into his daughter in law texting me that i need to make sure he's bathing because it stinks at his apartment (...um sorry but not happening) among other strange requests she doesn't want to deal with herself.	0
the past couple of months she's also been forgetting to pay me on time which is just so inconsiderate.	0
the thing that has really put me over the edge is him recounting a story of beating up a black little boy when he was a kid and calling him the n word over a trivial disagreement at a store.	0
a different time and all that, but as someone in an interracial relationship, i just can't excuse that.	0
how do i break it to him that i'm quitting?	0
we have established a cordial relationship, which is the only thing keeping me from just not showing up all together.	0
i couldn't care less about his dil, but i know he will be upset because i'm one of the only people that comes by besides his physical therapists and he obviously doesn't get out much with covid.	0
just typing everything out has helped solidify my decision, i just can't help feeling a bit guilty about quitting still.	0
i'm tired of being exhausted constantly and sacrificing for someone i'm not ever sure is a very kind person.	0
my dad is showing signs of dementia.	0
he repeats himself a lot, can't follow a conversation, can't make decisions, can't remember words, no focus/concentration.	0
he's been to a memory clinic, but they say he doesn't have alzheimer's.	0
however, it's very clear something is wrong.	0
i went to the emergency room with him because he was complaining about a cold that wouldn't go away.	0
(his family doctor was not available).	0
his inability to talk about why we were there was so bad that the doctor asked if he still lived at home, and anytime they asked him a question, they would look to me for confirmation.	0
i'm thinking he needs to see a neurologist.	0
would that be the kind of doctor he needs to see to get a proper diagnosis?	0

during my stay at home, i noticed that my mom tends to forget that she had a conversation with me in the morning and then comes and proceeds to have the same conversation with me in the evening.	0
this is not a regular thing.	0
happens like once a 1/2 weeks.	0
it usually happens with stuff she's a bit happy about to tell me.	0
earlier i used to tell her that she's told me this already but now i don't.	0
i just listen.	0
i was also going through alzhimers and dementia webmd.	0
short term memory loss is one of the earlier symptoms.	0
i am sort of worried about her.	0
she's a working lady and the stress on her job has not reduced but increased.	0
what all steps can i do now to make sure that the rest of her life is happy and comfortable?	0
and what can i do to reduce chances of her getting a brain disease in future?	0

my husband has had a career that required us to move frequently internationally, but he has finally earned a position that will be stable and in one place (ma).	0
his parents are entering their 70s, but have numerous serious health issues.	0
his mother is in a wheelchair and has a nurse visit her daily.	0
his dad has cardiac issues on top of diabetes and mobility challenges.	0
they live on the west coast (northern/colder climate) and have no family near them.	0
since the pandemic, theyve been isolated.	0
my husband is having to fly out to support their medical procedures/life every 2-3 months for a week+ at a time.	0
its not sustainable with our jobs/kids.	0
now that will be in one place (ma), we want to ask his parents to move closer to us.	0
we miss them and worry about them often.	0
they need more support and social interaction.	0
they own their own home and seem to be ok financially (this is never discussed though).	0
we are currently house hunting and can consider a multi-generational/accessible situation.	0
i dont even know where to begin, but what are the kinds of things we need to consider?	0
how does their medicare (?)	0
and other stuff change?	0
my husband is most concerned about travel, but i think its a one time deal and they could get through it.	0
his mother is very resistant to air traveli think its an independence issue.	0
she doesnt want people to carry her etc.	0
i cant possibly understand the complexities of her life, so i want to be as sensitive as possible.	0
any advice is welcome, as we are just starting to realize this may be for the best.	0
it may take awhile to convince them, but we want to have it all in place for when/if they are ready.	0
there has been one thing that has genuinely surprised me in the short time that i have been on this sub.	0
that is the number of people in their teens and twenties who are shouldering the responsibility of  being a caregiver.	0
i'm in my fifties (jeez, that sounds old!)	0
and by that age, it's kind of expected that parents are going to need some help.	0
to those of you who are younger caregivers, i am in awe of you.	0
"caregiving can be a frustrating, infuriating, thankless, and soul-crushing ""job""."	0
it is a situation where we often have to endure things that we would never tolerate in a paid job.	0
it can also be very isolating and lonely dealing with the decline of a loved one day after day.	0
it's a situation where our very best efforts can only help ease problems and suffering, not permanently fix them.	0
that alone is frustrating.	0
to all of you who are caring for someone else, especially those of you who are younger, you are awesome.	0
this is especially true if other family members won't help and you are doing it alone.	0
"i have to think that one day, their selfishness will be ""rewarded""."	0
cosmic payback ain't fun!	0
please know that there are many of us in the same situations that you face every day.	0
we may not be able to lend you strength and encouragement in person, but we do offer if to you from the heart.	0
you are indeed incredible and you have our awe and gratitude!	0
im not sure if this is the right place for this post.	0
my husband of one year, partner of 4 years, has been dealing with severe anxiety and depression on and off the entire time we have been together.	0
hes been hospitalized four times, has had several close calls with his most serious suicide attempt happening in december.	0
i should also mention he was laid off from work last march because of the pandemic.	0
after this last attempt, he was hospitalized and then started electroconvulsive therapy (ect).	0
ect is a controversial therapy but can be very effective for treatment resistant depression.	0
it requires regular anesthesia and can cause temporary memory loss and loss of executive function.	0
taking care of him during his acute treatment period was exhausting and very lonely because i couldnt really find anyone to relate the problem to.	0
ever since he started ect, things have only gotten progressively better.	0
he has been himselfgoofy, go-lucky and energetic.	0
last night, however, he took a turn and was aggressive, angry and completely irrational.	0
he got mad at me for trying to encourage him to eat and this morning canceled his temporary work appointment.	0
i am not sure what to do anymore.	0
he has family nearby so i have let them know.	0
i feel like they need to step in but i feel so deeply guilty.	0
i just know i wont be able to handle it if he tries to hurt himself again.	0
and im also a bit at a loss as to what to do for him.	0
ect was our last option and weve tried everything.	0
i dont feel like i have anyone to talk to and im so scared.	0
dad is 82, we never had a formal diagnosis but it's been very clearly advancing for at least 3 years since moved in with me.	0
five months ago, i moved with him back to his native country so that he could be with his family and familiar culture for his final years.	0
the move itself was difficult and probably traumatic for him.	0
like a previous hospitalization the year prior, it was the type of experience that probably advanced his dementia somewhat.	0
however i've seen a steeper than usual decline in the last 2 or 3 months.	0
his language is gone.	0
he says words, but they are disconnected and make no sense.	0
he tries to communicate with me but it's gibberish and frustrating to both of us.	0
sometimes i can make out what he's saying just through context cues and because i'm with him 24/7 but most of the time it's unintelligible.	0
he pretends he can take care of his hygiene, he is very private and doesn't allow me to help him very much.	0
he wears the same clothes every day, sleeps in them even.	0
frequently soils himself in the bathroom and i find evidence afterwards of his efforts at cleaning up.	0
i cook every meal for him,  otherwise he'd just eat bread or spoonfuls of jam that he finds in the kitchen or cold leftovers from the fridge.	0
the other day, he somehow managed to lose his wallet, which he always kept in his pants pocket.	0
he never left the house the entire day, and we tore the place apart down to every garbage can and can't find it.	0
it has upset him deeply and i think this another trauma, he's been very different since the wallet loss.	0
his normal routines are completely gone.	0
he paces, he is agitated, he has paranoia about being robbed, he babbles incessantly about revenge, etc.	0
his sleeping patterns are off, he used to sleep through the night but the last 2 nights he's been pacing in the dark with his flashlight, mumbling to himself.	0
luckily we live in an apartment building with locked entrance/exit doors so he has no way of getting out, but the way he's been talking lately i wouldn't be surprised if he tried to escape.	0
unfortunately we have loud upstairs neighbors and he interprets their noise as intruders.	0
he is on an anti-depressant and an anti-psychotic med, but at low dosages that probably need to be re-evaluated.	0
i'm just at the end of my rope.	0
i don't know how to help him anymore.	0
i have hit the wall and my compassion is gone.	0
i can't sleep well from worry, i am tied to him 24/7 and can only leave the home for short times to get groceries.	0
i am past the point where a full-time nurse during the day here at home would be a benefit.	0
i am ready to turn him over to professionals.	0
i'm just not sure if he is at that point.	0
i struggle with guilt about him realizing that i have abandoned him.	0
there are fleeting moments when the dementia seems to recede and i see those flashes of his old self and knowing that he's still capable of being fully aware just kills me.	0
luckily i have the support of his siblings here, they will agree with the decision i make.	0
i just fear how i'm going to hurt him.	0
i have an appointment tomorrow afternoon to tour a place that i found that might be a good option for him.	0
maybe i just need reassurance that it really is time and not me giving up too early and making it worse for him.	0
it feels so final, so much an end of everything for him and what he wants for the end of his life, making that decision for him is so difficult.	0
my grandmother who is 84 lives with both me and my parents and has lived with us for over a decade now.	0
before the alzheimer's, she wasn't very easy to get along with- being her only grandchild, she was always very much in my business in a nosey x100 way.	0
she would go through my room when i wasn't there, read through my journals, look through my garbage, etc.	0
and i was always a good kid so there was no reason to do any of that (i mean there wasn't any real concern).	0
but in the past few years, the dementia and old age started kicking in, triggered by a fall where they had put her heavy drugs for a few days before her surgery, and now it feels like it's getting exponentially worse every single day.	0
my heart aches for her when i see her forgetting things and talking to the cat like she's a person, and all the other things that come with memory loss and dementia.	0
but what really has been upsetting all of us are her delusions and suspicions.	0
she doesn't trust any of us anymore, mostly my parents.	0
it always revolves around conflict- she's convinced i'm constantly arguing with my partner, or that i'm crying in my room all night, or that i'm arguing with my parents, or she hears our neighbours arguing (we don't have neighbours anymore, the apartment next to us is empty).	0
"and when we tell her, everything is fine, no one is upset, no one is arguing, and no one is crying, she gets upset and says that we're hiding things from her because she ""knows"" something is going on."	0
when we ask her why she thinks these things, she can't give any reasons other than she just knows it's happening.	0
it's getting to the point where multiple times a day she barges into my room or into the living room where my parents are and tries to interrogate them on things that are simply not true.	0
i feel like a horrible person for getting so upset at her, but it just feels like everything about her is heightened.	0
don't get me wrong, i do love her, she's my grandma, but it's just so hard to be around her.	0
and i don't know what to do.	0
it feels like i'm going insane, and i try really hard not to lash out at her, but when i'm already dealing with my own problems, this just feels like the cherry on top and i don't have the mental space or patience right now to deal with this.	0
covid has absolutely made things worse because i barely have an escape- nothing is open, i'm just stuck at home doing zoom university.	0
if you've made it this far, thank you for reading.	0
i guess i'm just looking for some validation and maybe some advice on how to deal with this?	0
not sure if there's anything that would help though.	0
after taking care of my mom who has vascular dementia 24/7 for the past 7 months, we moved her into a memory care facility last friday.	0
it was the best decision for her and my family, but miss her terribly.	0
i miss the funny, warm, sociable person she used be.	0
it's so sad that she's not with us anymore in any capacity.	0
i was recently hired as an in home caregiver for a family.	0
the woman i took care of was 80 and was bedridden with dementia.	0
she had incontinence issues and wore adult diapers.	0
i was told that unless she had gone number 2 to not change it.	0
i was told that if she just peed i wasnt supposed to change her, even though i only have her to take care of and have plenty of time to help her.	0
i also suspect that after i put her to bed when i leave she isnt being moved at all or changed for the 14 hours shes in bed.	0
should i report this?	0
my dad is extra dependent, being that he is so weak he cant even use the remote or his phone to call me.	0
after missing him screaming my name early last night, unable to call me, i downloaded a $5 baby monitor app on my phone last night and its sooo helpful.	0
i have an iphone and ipad thankfully.	0
being able to just check in on him or hear him if he says anything from where i am is so helpful.	0
[removed]	0
well he is 71 years old i'm 16... i know a weird one, we live alone and most of the nigths he gets an asthma attack his medication doesn't seem to help like it used to and i can't do anything about it, i wake from 1-5 am to hear struggle to breath, actually rn his medication seems to be over... i'm really scared i don't know what to do anymore, i don't want to see him suffer, it feels like everything is ou out of my control.	0
most of the things in my life will just go really bad if something happens to him, i don't things to be this way... any tips for asthmatics?	0
any emotional support?	0
"my father thinks he has a ""perfect memory"" even though his short term is mostly gone."	0
he denies that his mother ever had it even though he was the one who had her hospitalized for it.	0
it seems like most dont know but are there people who do?	0
this is more of a rant but also sharing my experience to help others.	0
my grandma is 87, has dementia from alzheimers.	0
my grandma moved in with me, my wife and my son because the assisted living place she was at managed to get everyone, people living there and also nurses/ workers sick with covid, to the point that they had to hire an outside company to come take care of people living there.	0
my grandma ended up in the hospital for 2 months.	0
so my wife and i opened our home to her because she had nowhere else to go and we wanted her to be in a safe place.	0
i do not work so i became her caregiver.	0
everything i do is based on her and what she is doing.	0
my life literally revolves around her, her confusion, and her depression.	0
we have changed everything in our home to make her life better, painting a bedroom, buying her furniture, installing a chair lift, giving her our master bathroom to shower in because its a walk in shower and would be safer for her.	0
yes we knew things like this would come up and would need to be done.	0
i want to stress that we agreed to take this on and help her as best we can.	0
today started out great, my mom came over to help her shower and get her dressed, then her hospice nurse came to check her out for her weekly check up and things were going great.	0
recently we noticed that my grandma has been having terrible days after she was out for 4 plus hours driving with my mom the day before.	0
she would barely know who i was, didnt know where she lived, and constantly saying i dont know what im doing all while crying her eyes out because she thought she lived alone and didnt have money or food.	0
well we told the nurse about this and she said that is very common for dementia patients and that its possible she had too much stimulation the day before and suggested we do only and hour or two out on drives or being away from her home (my home).	0
so the nurse leaves and we start having a nice conversation about the weather getting nice and that the tree are changing and she will have some really pretty views on her drives.	0
then i made the comment about her only being able to go out for 1 or 2 hours because of the horrible next day she has, she said thats not enough time to do anything and also said so that means im not going on any more vacations?	0
she hasnt been on a vacation in years, probably 5-10 years.	0
she did not like the our answer when we said no.	0
i added, grandma youre 87 years old and you can barely make it to the steps without passing out.	0
keep in mind my mom and i were keeping calm the whole time and trying to have a normal conversation with her.	0
she blew up and started yelling, started telling us she isnt going to be told that she cant do anything.	0
my mom and i looked at each other and were confused.	0
she started screaming at us telling us she will do whatever she wants and we cant stop her and we attempted to calm her down but there was no stopping her.	0
she eventually started calling me names and telling me im a piece of shit but with nicer words only because she doesnt cuss much.	0
thats when my mom stepped in and got on her for acting like that and calling me names etc.. she then stood up and got in my moms face and telling her get move and not to get into her face but my grandma was the one who got up and got in my moms face.	0
thats when i told her sit down and shut up because my nine year old can hear her acting like a nine year old.	0
after some more arguing she went upstairs to her room.	0
we let time pass and gave her the agitation medicine we have for her.	0
after 30-40 minutes she came back downstairs and asked for food, i got it for her and she sat in her chair and after two minutes she started again.	0
talking about things that had nothing to do with the last conversation, telling us we are horrible people, that she is going to find somewhere else to live because apparently my constant caretaking of her wasnt enough.	0
she said that i told her to get out of my house when i actuallly said grandma if you continue to do this, act like this and scream then you will have to leave because my son can hear this and i wont put up with him having to hear this and get upset because of this behavior.	0
so she took that as get the fuck out now and she held onto that but could not remember anything else about the conversation except that we were treating her poorly.	0
which it honestly was the other way around, we have learned to just agree with her nonsense talking and plans of vacation etc.... but this time we were trying to inform her that the next day out she has will be shorter...so we were doing our best to stay calm and it just didnt help.	0
then my wife stepped in and she told my grandma who started screaming and yelling again that she needed to shut up and go to her room upstairs until she calms down because our son can hear all this.	0
my grandma then threatened her by saying i really like you so dont make me hate you and my wife said enough go to your room and calm down.	0
my grandma screamed at her to shut the hell up.	0
thats when i lost it and screamed stop so loud it made everyone jump.	0
(i rarely ever get mad and have never been this mad in my life) after i did this she got in my face telling me to get out of her face and i was so angry i didnt just let it go like i should have and told her she was the one who stood up and got in mine so if you dont want me in your face then move.	0
thats when she started getting in my moms face and then started walking towards my wife, i stepped in front of her and then my wife said this is enough, go to your room.	0
eventually she did after us repeating that our son can hear her which scared her because she doesnt want him to see her upset or mad etc... then after some time of calming my mom down and my wife trying to cool me down and trying to figure out what the hell happened she started to come back down but kept her head down and asked for food.	0
i put my nice, caregiver, grandson face on and took her some food, she took her medicine, and after 30 minutes i went back up to get her plate and she was back to normal and acted like nothing happened.	0
so we are stuck knowing what happened and feeling bad or upset or mad while she gets to just forget it all and not know if anything happened at all.	0
how does this help anyone?	0
well i understand people may lose their cool sometimes, they may get frustrated and angry, but remember its pointless.	0
in my case i only ended up making myself feel upset and same with my mom and wife.	0
i knew just to always agree with her and move onto the next topic because she wont remember what she said anyway, but this time i let my anger get the best of me and in the end i lost, my wife lost, and my mom lost because we have to deal with every horrible thing she said to us and us getting angry with her.	0
now i have to move on knowing how horrible she was to me after i have changed my entire life for her and continue to care for her while she gets to go back to a normal day for her.	0
tldr: grandma went off on us after trying to explain how to help her with confusion after going out for the day before.	0
in the end we lost, we are hurting, we are upset and she remembers nothing.	0
hi there.	0
i hope its okay to post this, but i wanted to post something in hopes of anyone pointing me towards some helpful resources or give me some advice.	0
im 19, and my mom is physically disabled and getting progressively worse.	0
my parents just divorced a few months ago, my sister is awol, and i had to come home from my dream college at thanksgiving to care for her as she can no longer live by herself.	0
and no one in my large extended family wants to help either.	0
we now both live together alone in an apartment.	0
i have been struggling with a lot, of course.	0
im a full time student (online), however i dont have a job and barely leave the house due to these responsibilities.	0
even with school being my only other responsibility (which im very grateful for), i can hardly even manage that.	0
so how could i handle even a part time job?	0
were trying to get her on disability but she cant apply by herself and the rest of my family isnt really trying to help at all, and i cant help her with that because i dont understand any of it.	0
i dont even know what a mortgage is.	0
to sum it up, i have no idea what i  am doing, and welcome any advice to help make our lives as bearable as possible as we try to get thru this.	0
im in the most painful and complex situation of my life, father dementia worsened after couple of years and seems mother also apparently has some sort of dementia but so far no neurologist or psychiatrist have been able to properly diagnose.	0
im only child and barely able to care for both due to fatigue and own mental health issues.	0
not much help from others as its chaos here due to covid and du to fear cant hire nurse and tbh cant afford it im in a 3rd world country, pakistan and due to covid, treatment and diagnosis almost impossible, dilemma is most experts advice antipsychotics for her extreme anxiety and agitation but im afraid as fda warnimg says it can be fatal if she actually has dementia.	0
i have videos of her that i can share in pm to respect our privacy, hope to find proper treatment, memantine gives me hope but must check from a neurologist as mother also has comorbids like hypertension and copd diabetes and donepezil an rivistagine patch is contraindicated etc unable to get mri after repeated tries as she becomes agitated and sedation ia contraindicated due to copd.	0
following notes from a book -onset of depressive symptoms preceded much earlier, perhaps years than cognitive impairment and memory problems -memory problems fairly sudden onset eg within 1 to 2 months of hospital admission october 2019 often identifiable onset of cognitive impairment especially during and after hospital stay, which was definitely a shock as she never had to be hospitalized for so long and become so much dependent in life.	0
-often emphasize inability to think,concentrate, and remember, especially when asked questions -signs and symptoms of depression include: -loss of appetite.	0
-loss of interest in cooking, overseeing house cleaning and other chores she used to love.	0
-more silent -less mobile or willingness to move -less pain and discomfort tolerance probably and less temperature tolerance as evident by asking to switch on and off ac in short time -much less patient than before much more 'i dont know' or 'not feeling well ' replies when trying to test cognition or memory ---------_------ short term memory so bad that she forgets the meds she just took a minute ago sometimes all of this in last 1 year: prolonged anxiety that makes it impossible to mobilize her, or even let her sit for few mins very bad short term memory rf 3 object test 3 courses of ssri avg 2 month each last one 14 days but no visible impact and stopped due to sodium imbalance mostly 1 exapro 10 mg od oct to dec 19 2 zoloft 25 mg od + busron 10 mg bd june to aug 20 3 cipralex 10 mg od and stresam 50 mg bd 12 to 25 sep 20. stopped due to low na 119 but also high bsr n bp ebixa and exelon patch 4.6 given in late jan 20 but had to be stopped when t2rf on 28 jan. dont know how much effect they had for breathing issue but 1 neurologist advised to not give exelon patch again.	0
bedridden diaperized probably severe depressed, very low mood, debilitated etc confusion unable to communicate problems emotions cognitive dysfunction rf 93-7 and clock draw no desire to move, not even to hold spoon to eat  strange behaviors: not much care for personal hygiene, have to fight to make her wash hands n face at her bedside.	0
earlier she used to be most adamant about hygiene and cleanliness.	0
become totally dependent, not able to properly sit or change sides or adjust her sheet.	0
became very impatient, earlier she was the most patient became inconsiderate, calls me even when im about to eat or sleep antisocial and moderately rude rf rashid uncle khi eg, who is very dear to her being husband of her favorite sister, but she didnot talked to him or even turned towards him couple of hours he was sitting close to her infrequent aggression, eg forcefully pushing my hand away when i try to feed her or offer water keeps side bars of bed tightly clutched, she doesnot know why very frequent repeated questions, sometimes in anxiety she asks to call doctor or for meds more than 15-20 times in 30 mins or hour.	0
ask to fan or ac on off or bedsheet on off in anxiety cant be left alone even for few mins, she starts calling and anxiety panic attacks start combing her hair and massaging her feet with oil somewhat calms mild anxiety, but doesnot do much when severe attack.	0
much more nosepicking she tries calling me even when im trying to sleep beside her, apathy?	0
,-++------ she especially asks for feet massage with oil, something she never asked infact disliked even when i tried to earlier than 10-11 months.	0
few mins in seemingly calm state, even seems asleep but suddenly wakes up and ask for milk or call doctor or says too much ghabrahat or sob unable to do any test properly eg mmse or even 6cit due to extreme anxiety or unwillingness frequently repeated phrases include: 1 bahut ghabrahat aur bechane hai, dr se baat karo, koi dawai do.	0
dr kiyani ya dr yousaf se baat karo (these two were longtime family doctors and friends of abu ) 70-80% of the time 2 saans nai aarah, kuch karo, kuch laga do moun pe (asks for bipap mask, even though oxy meter shows good stats, oxy 90+ and hr 80 or less) 3 maine kuch khaya hai aaj?	0
(sometimes within few mins of eating food) becomes angry even if asked to hold spoon to eat or when trying to wash hands and face at bedside.	0
exact phrase test repeated 14 in 30 mins kisi dr ko bulao ya uss se baat karo, bahut ghabrahat ho rahi hai, bari tabiat kharab hai ----+++--------- *bedridden since 1 year, doesnot seem any motivation to get up or even sit, even after informing her repeatedly that all doctors insist she must sit atleast 30-45 angle and stand and walk to rid infections and better respiration.	0
sometimes keep asking for bipap mask even when she is wearing it in anxiety  moderately apathetic, especially when more anxiety used to be self sacrificingly caring no specific times of anxiety or panic attacks, so possibly no sundowning no specific timings of sleep, continuous sleep maybe only 2 hours straight, rest fragmented sleep.	0
avg daily sleep 3-4 hours.	0
feels more cold than warm on avg, especially past 3 months not much new talk, most of the time repeated questions or complains or phrases few days she when she did got better sleep eg 6-7 hrs, still seemed same  ***on some days she was very positive and motivated uncharacteristically.	0
especially 8 june, she tried to getup burt couldnot due to weakness but she was moving her legs and arms to exercise while lying.	0
almost whole day she was very positive.	0
could not test or remember how her memory was.	0
i wish and pray everday she becomes atleast like that.	0
14 june abt 70% of 8th june 9th july abt 50% and for few hours like 5 afterwards a few days might have been somewhat positive but not that much and only for couple of hours **socially bad behavior with guests she cherished to meet and loved earlier.	0
eg husband of her favorite sister came from karachi but she couldnot turn from left side where she feels less agitation to right side where he was sitting even for few seconds.	0
**mobility was actually not very much since 2 years+, especially after father had to be admitted in hospital for 50 days when he had multi strokes and dementia and cpm central pontine mylosis and recovered from record low sodium 101 couple of years ago --++++++++++ main reason for less mobility, since 2 years especially was extreme back pain and breathlessness, weakness.	0
but now i think mental/ mood disorder or illness also had a considerable role.	0
eg she used to love cook and later oversee cooking food for me and father, but after father hospital stay and return she didnot want to.	0
she also used to love going to nearby mart to buy monthly groceries with me, but since i think sep 2018 she was unable to and told me it was due to fatigue breathlessness etc.	0
she often like every other day weep and become very emotional when i refuse to do a certain task due to my own fatigue might have had delirium when after t2rf condition became better on 31 jan 20 and shifted to another hospital in night.	0
she was weeping very much and complaining and was not accepting anything at all and much more restlessness than usual.	0
that condition lasted for some hours.	0
***she asks for doctor home visit, which never happened even when father was grade 20 officer ***not much sense of time, year or month wakes or try to wakes father and me by calling our names repeatedly which never happened before hospital admit sometimes says pain in whole body but after few mins when asked again says only anxiety ***anxiety or panic attacks lasts too long, hours, though not too intense seemingly, such as mostly verbal complaining about not calling dr or repeatedly telling she has too much anxiety so call family dr etc.	0
"sometimes say 30-40% she asks for something to eat, but after few mins when i bring it she seems to have forgotten ---+---------- rarely, when she wakesup from a nap she seems somewhat positive for sometime eg use spoon to eat on her own etc keeps saying ""ajeeb si ghabrahat hai, kuch samaj nai aaraha"" eng translation: strange anxiety/ agitation, i dont know what is happening to me also very prolong stomach pain which even after ct abdomen and pelvis with contrast and consulting with many gastro experts couldnot track and mostly attributed to being bedridden"	0

28(f) here, i left my full time job in july of 2020 to become my mom's live in caregiver after my dad died.	0
i feel like my mom is always comparing how i care for her to how my dad did.	0
she is constantly pointing out my shortcomings.	0
also will continue to instruct me on things we do every day.	0
"things i don't need directions for but she insists on ""reminding"" me."	0
what it normally does is disrupt my focus.	0
i know the list if things she needs and wish she would trust me to do it instead of treating me like a child.	0
today she began to make snide remarks about my shortcomings in front of my siblings.	0
i ended up leaving the room and having a breakdown because i'm exhausted.	0
it feels like no one understands how much effort this takes physically and emotionally.	0
i feel like my mom resents me for not being my dad.	0
today was the first time i actually wanted to truly quit.	0
"to say ""start paying someone to do this because i'm done."""	0
my grandfather has been showing signs of dementia for the last few years.	0
he is not just forgetful, but his personality has changed or at least become less inhibited.	0
he is very mean, makes inappropriate sexual comments, and is paranoid.	0
he lives alone in a small rural town that is pretty sick of him.	0
honestly, so are his kids.	0
attempts to get him to move closer to family (not in assisted living or a nursing home, just get an apartment in the same town as one of his kids as he is now a 9 hour drive from the closest family) are met with hostility and verbal abuse.	0
at this point, no one wants to talk to him, let alone visit, even though they arent bad people.	0
it just feels pointless.	0
he is on lots of meds and has diabetes that is not well controlled and im not confident he is able to manage himself well.	0
he has had a number of fainting spells and falls and no one is checking up on him so if he doesnt wake up, or wakes up but cant get himself off the ground, he would be on his own.	0
do we have some responsibility or liability there?	0
what happens if you just ignore dementia?	0
i worry that he is too far gone to be reasoned with (he never really was a reasonable man to be honest) but not so far gone that he can be legally declared incompetent or whatever the phrase is, and i just dont know what happens next.	0
any insight or similar stories would be appreciated.	0
[removed]	0
the dementia relative im caring for started wetting his pants, so hes started wearing pull ups.	0
except now when he goes to the bathroom he doesnt know how to/forgets to remove his pull ups and ends up soiling himself.	0
what should i do?	0
if he stops wearing pull ups he sets himself, but if he wears pull ups he poops himself.	0
any help is really appreciated.	0
thank you	0
i take care of my grandfather i don't mind, but what i do mind is he doesn't even try to make his own food and expects a big meal cooked for him every night he's very entitled to it too and demands it , he's even mentioned me cooking a big meal with a lot of prep time as he knew i was walking out the door and leaving to go do something.	0
if i leave he constantly calls me and asks me to grab him food on the way back and he's not a direct person so he will call 3-6 times pestering me and hinting that he doesn't know what he wants to eat until he finally asks.	0
now i don't get paid for taking care of him so i'm broke & can normally only afford a little for myself as this is my job right now (it's a full-time fucking job) but i don't get paid for it.	0
okay so yesterday i pretended to leave the house but actually just stayed upstairs i know that sounds fucked up but i honestly needed a break from him.	0
i heard him downstairs up and moving, rummaging for a good hour????????	0
i was so shocked!!???!	0
this actually pissed me off because he cooked for himself and he can clearly do it!	0
i heard him up and moving several times yesterday.	0
i am dumbfounded.	0
"when i am ""home"" he only gets up a couple times a day strictly only to use the bathroom."	0
i'm just so mad because i know he can cook for himself and he proved that yesterday.	0
also i want to add, i didnt normally cook a big lunch and dinner everyday when i lived alone, i normally like to free for all it.	0
(i eat a lot of quick frozen dinners) they're so easy to make.	0
he also has frozen easy food to make but still insists on me making it for him & he literally starves himself all day waiting for me to cook, complaining and whining, but i don't get why he doesn't do it himself he clearly can?	0
he exercises by walking laps around the house but can't get up and put something in the microwave & view it as exercise?	0
on top of this he will tell the family how i'm so awful and don't cook for him.	0
so ungrateful when i am constantly doing everything for him.	0
im 23 i dont have a social life i dont get to go out all night like other fucking people my age do.	0
i dont get any of that i cant even leave the house for 2 fucking hours to the gym without a phone call asking where im at.	0
i dont have the normal life of someone in their early 20s.	0
i'm just so furious with him.	0
i just wish he would do something for himself because i know he can, he's just being lazy/entitled & taking advantage of me.	0
he waits until i'm hungry and i make food and then he asks what i'm making and then he wants that or wants to split it.	0
( normally it's a frozen dinner so it's not splittable ) or it's the last one left.	0
"or he will make comments ""i'm going to have to eat i don't know how you do it and go all day""  like okay?"	0
make yourself something to eat.	0
oooh when i bring home food he also complains because he wants mine also or i didn't get enough ... not to mention he's low-key loaded and i do everything for him and he expects more from me when i have no money it's just so ungrateful and a slap across the face tbh.	0
it makes me feel like shit.	0
it sucks.	0
thank you if you read all this i know it's a lot.	0

i loft my job at the start if the pandemic, and moved back in with my parents and disabled brother.	0
both of my parents work full time, so they asked me to make dinner, do the laundry,  take out the trash, clean the kitchen etc.	0
since my brother cannot help and they are working.	0
they said they wouldn't expect me to work so much once i got a job.	0
that is reasonable and i have been doing it.	0
however, there have been times when i fell behind on housework, was busy with other things, or just didn't have the kitchen clean by the when my mom got home.	0
she gets angry when this happens, and one time she went ballistic and threatened to kick me out of the house.	0
she has never apologized for that.	0
i just got a new job that will start in 2 or 3 weeks depending on when some paperwork goes through.	0
i have to do things to prepare for this, yet i'm still getting angry texts from my mom saying the kitchen hasn't been cleaned when i'm out doing stuff for work.	0
how do i make her understand that i have work stuff to do now and she can't rely in me to do as much housework?	0
(i know that this isn't a great living situation and i'm working towards moving out, but the job is starting out part time so i can't move out quite yet.)	0
my (32f) granny (85) was officially diagnosed with alzheimer's disease last year, but had been showing symptoms for around 4-5 years.	0
she has declined a lot quicker the last 1.5 years, since my grandfather died, and she is less mobile so can't be occupied like she used to be.	0
she get specific numbers, seemingly plucked out of the air, stuck in her head.	0
she needs to repeat them, and will try and write them down, then gets frustrated when she remembers them wrongly.	0
she also asks what they mean and where they have come from.	0
similarly, she also gets confused when she hears a story (sometimes even a word will spark it) and thinks it is her experience.	0
an example of this is when i told her i had cleaned under the fridge as it smelled.	0
"she engaged with the story normally initially, but then towards the end of the conversation started saying things like, ""oh i'll have to go, there's a horrible smell in here, it's disgusting, it's coming from the fridge"" (there was no smell)."	0
is this something that anyone else has experience of?	0
i am struggling to know what to tell her; when she gets fixated on something she can get upset and frustrated about it, and i feel awful for putting the idea in her poor brain.	0
is there a way i can change how i tell her things or what i tell her to avoid distressing her?	0
sidenote: this is so hard, especially as we're unable to see each other in person at the moment.	0

this morning routine was normal.	0
but add her delicate emotional state.	0
we are ready to get up and walk from the room to her chair in the living room, but before she gets up from sitting on the bed she has a cry.	0
when she steps into the tv room she pauses and has a cry.	0
when her daughter greets her, she has a cry.	0
now i'm at work around town.	0
her daughter, my wife is at work too.	0
but another daughter arrives to spend the day till we get home from work.	0
noticing her eating is changing.	0
she loves what's in front of her, others times she just sees all that food and moans about attempting to eat it.	0
last 2 days she has had minimal intake.	0
nagging her in a way, to keep eating.	0
just a few more bites.	0
also water intake.	0
drink more water.	0
she tilts her body backwards to drink and all that effort and it's just a sip.	0
she needs more water.	0
we are after her, we keep reminding her to drink some water, eat your lunch.	0
finish the banana.	0
i am an only child ambiguous caregiver who moved home (3 months ago) after my mom was struggling with tasks (my dad died 9 months ago and my mom has dementia (mid/early) is pretty independent but clearly increasingly needs help with bills, etc).	0
my mental health due to grief and caregiver stress, isolation from covid and the fact that my partner of 7 years travels 90% of the time for work and the fact that i am quite young, is very bad.	0
sometimes i find myself thinking about suicide (but i never would act on it) but i think this is a good indicator that i need help.	0
he is wonderful and has been there for me and even came home to be with my mom for a month after my dad died so i could finish grad school, and i probably should have asked him to come home sooner and been honest about how bad my mental health is.	0
i hold it together for mom but its daily secret breakdowns and getting worse as my mom gets worse (its so slow i think maybe i m the only that notices and im worried im over reacting)  anyway hes going to come home for the foreseeable future (and he will have work but its going to be less financially beneficial), but it means leaving the project he is on now (less $$).	0
hes coming home because its the right thing to do for our family.	0
i would do the same for him.	0
he wants to be there to support me through the most difficult time in my life.	0
i feel so guilty about it because i feel like im ruining his career and i also feel like i should tough it out.	0
asking for help makes me feel like a failure.	0
i also feel like i should have asked him to come home months ago and that this is the right thing to do.	0
im very afraid that his parents and others who dont deal with dementia arent going to understand and pass judgement on me being needy.	0
i just need to hear that making the best decision for my family (my mom, me, my partner) is more important than others opinions and also that im not over reacting about how scary and real dementia symptoms are	0

my mom keeps calling me in the middle of the night wanting to know where i am.	0
i just feel so much heartache.	0
my dad has alzheimers and my mom now has dementia.	0
ive also been doing ivf this last year, and its disappointing news after disappointing news.	0
ive been trying to stay strong dealing with all this, but when i talk to my mom i just breakdown and cry.	0
i try to tell her i cant talk because im upset.	0
it then sets off her dementia and she constantly calls me saying things like i dont know where you are at (we live in different states) and im going to call the police if you dont call me back.	0
shes done this the last few nights even thought i keeps calling her back and telling her where im at.	0
its just all so much for me.	0
hi, this is all new to me and i'm looking for support and advice from those going through the same thing.	0
my dad is a pretty stubborn person and refuses to change his diet or unhealthy habits.	0
he is an alcoholic, has type 2 diabetes, chews tobacco, and he is overweight.	0
last week i got a phone call that dad was in the hospital because he had a rapid heart rate and could barely breathe.	0
it has now been almost a week and he is still in the hospital, though his condition is improving.	0
the diagnosis is stage c congestive heart failure.	0
well, i have a pretty firm idea that this is the beginning of the end for dad.	0
in all likelihood he has 5 years or less to live.	0
my mom is frightened and sad.	0
she looks to my sister and me for emotional support, but i have no idea what i can do for her or for him.	0
i know my dad: he isn't the kind of person who is going to change his life around and start exercising or change his diet, or quit chewing tobacco.	0
he will start using a c-pap after this, but other than that nothing will change.	0
so where do i go from here?	0
call and visit him more?	0
do i share with him how it makes me feel or do we just all ignore the elephant in the room and pretend that he is going to live a long time?	0
should i expect that soon i will need to hire a caregiver to help him with baths?	0
will this be the first of a series of taking him to the hospital all the time?	0
any words of advice is appreciated, thank you.	0
[removed]	0
thank yall for reading this.	0
my dad is 52 with ms. its been a long 2021 in the hospital pretty much, and long story short hes coming out with a colon removal needing ann -ostomy bag which needs to be emptied every 4 hours changed every 3, permanent feeding tube in his stomach, which he is already not really tolerating well, even at the lower doses.	0
he already has a catheter, which draws many utis.	0
he gets tired after being up in his chair for a short time and goes back to bed.	0
his mobility is so low, hes essentially a quadriplegic, therefore ill need to be doing everything along with his parents who are 75+.	0
(me and my grandparents already butt heads, partly because they do not understand the need for things to be sterile and clean in therms of needles and catheter supplies.	0
which i suspect is the main cause of his constant uti and sepsis. )	0
in the hospital he needs helps with something every 5 minutes, whether it be for comfort, because he cant move his body, arms, or hands, or something medical needs to be done on him.	0
he was saying he still feels pain and discomfort from the surgery and they went from trying to help him to saying the pain may just never go away??	0
he cant eat or drink without feeling sick anymore.	0
this is on top of the problems weve had before him coming in i was already feeling overwhelmed, with covid i feel trapped considering im 22 living with 3 at risk people, 2 got the vaccine, my dad didnt yet.	0
maybe it has always been, but at this point isnt this just palliative care??	0
non curative?	0
especially the permanent feeding tube, and him saying the pain will never go away?	0
my mom (his ex) but is still in my life, has been supportive but realistic has been wondering if hospice, or a skilled rehab facility shouldnt be in the question?	0
we have a nurse who comes once every 2 weeks for a hour.	0
and no other help.	0
i dont even know if his medicare covers that.	0
its been 1.25 months since his surgery and to me hes not doing well enough to come home but i cant bring myself to say that without knowing the repercussions with all the horror stories ive seen about aps.	0
im partially venting but, im really concerned about this.	0
will they tell me when hes at an end stage of life?	0
my grandpa's back home and everything else i can do but i'm struggling with the food.	0
its 1 am and nothing looks right.	0
my grandpa just ended up falling back asleep and i feel really bad....and nervous.	0
and sleepy.	0
i pureed his food but idk, maybe it doesn't look appealing.	0
tbh cooking isn't a strength of mine.	0
i don't have that culinary sense that some people have.	0
i'm also hungry for some reason so there's that.	0
i feel stressed out but hopefully i can get this right soon.	0
i don't want my grandpa to go back again especially when he looks much better atm.	0
hi everyone.	0
just came across this page while searching for some answers on google (lol), but i'm so glad i did as just by reading some posts here i already feel less alone.	0
i'm not quite sure what i'm looking for in writing this, maybe just vent and put my feelings into words.	0
so early this year my dad (66yrs old) had his second stroke (the first one was 8 years ago, but it wasn't enough to change his bad habits, so here we were again).	0
luckily he left the hospital after 5 days without any sequels but a speech impairment.	0
i think that this time the scare was enough for him to understand that he needs to change his habits, eat healthier, cut all the bad food, and reduce stress, which was the main cause of his stroke.	0
his time in the hospital was very scary for me and my mom since the last time it was pretty ugly.	0
so just when things were starting to go back to normal, my mom (74 yrs old) took a fall and broke her femur.	0
had to go into surgery, and after a 7 day stay in the hospital, is coming home in a wheelchair and won't be able to move for at least a month.	0
we were able to get some things to help her navigate the apartment (toilet support, shower bench, etc), but we have no idea how that's gonna go because my mom is...difficult.	0
she is in denial of her health issues for a long time and before this incident, always refused to go to the doctor to get a check-up, often self-medicating when something hurt or felt uncomfortable.	0
there was nothing i could say or do to make her behave otherwise.	0
adding to that, she smokes like a chimney.	0
so i'm really scared of how this period is gonna go.	0
i just turned 30, work at least 40hrs a week, and last year got a lot more responsibilities in my job, but still don't make a lot of money.	0
due to my parent's lack of concern for their health, i've been saving all i could for the last 6 years in case something like this happened, but now that it did...i feel depressed, stressed, and alone.	0
my boyfriend whom i live with is an angel and helps me in so many ways, but family-wise i feel this huge weight on my shoulders as my closer family member lives in another country.	0
my parents have almost no income, and all they earn goes into house bills.	0
i love my parents and will do all i can to take care o them, but i feel guilty for sometimes thinking of how unfair everything is.	0
if only they took better care of themselves maybe they could have better outcomes than this.	0
my boyfriend and i are moving to a larger apartment and i can't even put a lot of money into it because of how scared i am for the future.	0
how do you guys juggle all of this without feeling that life is losing colors?	0
guess i just need to grow up.	0
for the last 3 or 4 years, my grandmother had been declining cognitively.	0
she would do things i dont want to talk about, they diagnosed her with alzheimers 2 years ago but it was clear that it had been present for years previous.	0
at times i was mean because i didnt want to talk to her, it wasnt her fault.	0
a year ago, she had a heart attack in her bed and died, and i never got to say goodbye, sometimes i still have nightmares of it happening to me.	0
why couldnt i have said goodbye?	0
why couldnt i have just had the grandmother i had years ago?	0
its hurt my own mom and she cries a lot, and i fear that some day it will happen to her.	0
i'm  trying to get ihss approved for my grandmother, but i keep filling out  their application, sending it in, and then never hearing from anyone.	0
it's really hard to get anyone on the phone, and if i ever do they don't  now anything about my application.	0
does anyone have any idea how i can  get them to approve it?	0
or even look at it?	0
im in the most painful and complex situation of my life, father dementia worsened after couple of years and seems mother also apparently has some sort of dementia but so far no neurologist or psychiatrist have been able to properly diagnose, im in a 3rd world country, pakistan and due to covid treatment and diagnosis almost impossible, dilemma is most experts advice antipsychotics for her extreme anxiety and agitation but im afraid as fda warnimg says it can be fatal if she actually has dementia, i have videos of her that i can share in pm to respect our privacy, hope to find proper treatment, memantine gives me hope but must check from a neurologist as mother also has comorbids like hypertension and copd diabetes and donepezil an rivistagine patch is contraindicated etc mri couldnot be done even after many tries due to her claustrophobia and extreme agitation and sedation contraindicated due to copd	0
for the past 5 years my father had suffered from  presumably cardiovascular dementia.	0
usually he was alright, just a little distant, but the past year he started forgetting pretty much everything, then last week he collapsed and when he came to at the hospital was just oblivious to my mom and brother, i dont live nearby.	0
he had other health problems, so my family was offered the options of either hospice or palliative care.	0
but before the choice was made, he passed at the hospital.	0
while i dont like that my father is dead, i honestly feel like he truthfully died several years ago and ive been slowly mourning his death until now.	0
and more importantly my mother, whom while in her 70s is very lively and active, but she feared that the rest of her life was going to involve caring for my father, who didnt even know her.	0
i dont know, im still gathering my thoughts on the subject, and ranting a little i guess.	0
but these are real thoughts.	0

i'll keep it short.	0
i'm too tired to go through the circumstances right now but i do have a question.	0
so i truly loved my dad, more than anything else in the world.	0
he was an amazing parent.	0
we were close, and there isn't anything we wouldn't have done for each other.	0
he died in the best way possible, and that gave me comfort.	0
i'm trying to figure out why i'm grieving the way i am.	0
i'm numb, tired, and can't seem to cry.	0
i can't seem to get my head where it's supposed to be.	0
i can't focus.	0
i don't know what i'm doing.	0
he didn't leave a will.	0
i'm going through the process of setting up his burial.	0
when it's done, is it normal to want to follow them?	0
i miss him so much, and feel like i didn't get enough time to spend with him.	0
well, not too hard but still a little nerve wracking.	0
his diabetes got worse so i learned how to do insulin.	0
he needs pureed food.	0
he needs his catheter for two weeks.	0
and i have to figure out how to navigate the catheter without making it rip or something.	0
crossing fingers i don't mess up.	0
his nurses were nice though and one of them told me i should try nursing school bc it seems like i'd do well.	0
we are looking to put him in a care home or foster home soon because his doctors are certain he's only going to get worse and will probably have a stroke again later, no matter what medicine he takes.	0
one day he'll probably need hospice.	0
they say its too much for one 22 year old.	0
i'm just hoping a nurse aide will come in and until we get him into a care home, i need to hold it together.	0
my aunt asked me if i was going to get a job or if i liked living a life of leisure.	0
i had to interrupt her to take my mom to the bathroom.	0
hmmm.	0
looking for a favour from this wonderful community....im going to be speaking about dementia to search and rescue volunteers.	0
i have the knowledge and training for this i was just looking for some real life stories to use as the basis of my session.	0
stories that these volunteers might actually come across in their searches one day....many people with dementia go missing everyday and these volunteers are often tasked with finding them so my job is to prepare them.	0
is there anyone out there who will share their story with me?	0
(obviously this would be completely anonymous) all wandering stories are useful, not just the ones where a sar group was called in to help.	0
thanks so much everyone!	0
i'm sort of recovering... and sort of getting myself in more of a mess.	0
i'm changing my life!	0
- or at least thinking 'bout it... on occassion.	0
rando calrissian - me and lando been pulling together some randos for your dementia pleasure.	0
thank you.	0
- what's the first thing you do after every major life event according to everybody's grandma?	0
write your thank you notes.	0
basic background: my dad is nearly 80 and has lived alone for nearly 20 years.	0
he's gone from being a very methodical and neat person to a borderline hoarder over the last 12 or so years.	0
he has friends, goes out, has coffee with his neighbours, shops, and basically functions mostly normally.	0
i haven't been in his house for many years because i told him he needs to clean up the clutter and he wouldn't let me help.	0
i'm ashamed to say he successfully avoided resolving that since.	0
recently he was hospitalised for a while, now he's temporarily living with me.	0
we've had to go in and clean his house, and get it ready for him to move back in.	0
we have not let him go back to the house at all yet.	0
the house is bad - there's stuff everywhere, rubbish everywhere (not saved up, just tossed randomly, nothing gross thankfully).	0
things he was super careful about years ago, have been tossed like garbage, wrecked, shoved out of the way.	0
half his bedroom was just piled with stuff that had an inch of dust on it.	0
his kitchen was horrific, he would tell me he cooks but i have no idea how.	0
it's like the neglect has accelerated and taken over, we've cleaned, gutted rooms, fixed all the plumbing, and are about to start rebuilding.	0
he just wants to go home now that he feels better.	0
i don't have enough words to describe that although it's not quite a hoarders house, it's a f*cking nightmare, inside and out.	0
he yells in his sleep, a lot, every night.	0
he'll call out for his dog over and over (she passed over 10 years ago), or strange phrases and things that maybe have to do with the events of the day?	0
but it's loud yelling, and repetitive, and he often wakes himself up, turns his radio on quite loud, then goes back to sleep.	0
i'm not sure how to explain it, if it was once in a while i wouldn't be concerned, but it's every night.	0
he randomly calls our dogs by his dogs name too.	0
he has a few repetitive things he does too, just little weird things usually and mostly at night.	0
like banging his hand down on his seat next to him a few times, or sighing or this weird noise over and over.	0
sometimes he catches himself and stops, mostly not.	0
whenever we discuss his house and how it's going, he's always shocked when we advise him of the latest disaster we've found (we are shielding him a lot from the worst of it, there's no point) as he was sure it was just fine, he never had a problem.	0
and he's getting shirty if we say we want/need to change something for his benefit.	0
same with his car, he's not driving for now, but he's told us repeatedly it's perfectly fine, just due for a service.	0
so to help my brother took it for the service and there are so many things wrong he's been told to look for a new car, it's more than it's worth to even try to fix half the problems - and his mechanic said he told him this last time.	0
it's nowhere near roadworthy and the tyres were bald.	0
he had no idea.	0
all of these things on their own just seem like typical older people things that happen and we'd help with, i don't know how to explain it but.......this is not like my dad.	0
stuff he cared about meaning nothing to him, especially being so lax with his car, the state of the house.	0
and yet he can still discuss technical things, things from 50+ years ago are still recalled perfectly, he's mostly keeping up with current events and things.	0
i can't put my finger on it, which is why i'm wondering if the decline is gradual or vague enough that i'm second guessing myself.	0
are any of these things signs of dementia, or just depression or natural ageing?	0
i don't want to drag him to a doctor and say i think he's incompetent when all he might need is us cleaning up this damn house and being able to visit him more.	0
for example, my grandmother is 92 and has dementia and moved in with us and was somewhat ambulatory but one day she literally lost her ability.	0
its like she woke up one day, even more confused, even older and more aged..  recently she was very alert and then suddenly has lost her lucidity, in a day, shes lost her ability to talk well, eat, and has been hallucinating.. shes leaning to one side and its just happening all so fast, so suddenly but also at the same time, its such a drawn out process to see the suffering, i love every minute with her.. hate this disease	0
my partner of 2.5 years has been diagnosed with crohns.	0
he has been sick now for 8 months with no help.	0
the insurance companies are in no hurry to pay for any meds to help him.	0
i am so tired, i work 40+ hours a week, care for his 2 kids and my 2 kids; as well as the household chores.	0
he physically cant do much, in one year he went from a manly man 40+ hours a week working to now he can barley get through a 3 hour shift let alone have any a energy left for me.	0
i feel so guilty for feeling selfish.... to make matter worse i have noone no friends no family no one.... i am so tired....	0
hello to everyone here; this is my first post in this community and i hope to get meaningful feedback.	0
i am looking to buy a realistic looking baby doll for a friend of mine who has alzheimers.	0
i know that theres at least one specific doll meant for those with alzheimers but i wanted to see if there are any other options because i dont think that doll looks very realistic and it looks more like a toy to me.	0
ive found very little information about realistic dolls (often called re-born dolls) in regards to them being used as cuddle items; most are not suited for children or any type of handling/play which includes being a comfort item.	0
i know that silicone is not ideal (im glad i found this out because i was browsing silicone only dolls for a while) because its fragile and it needs specific care to prevent the skin from becoming gummy.	0
i would also prefer painted on hair because i think real hair gives it the uncanny valley look and it is susceptible to falling out or getting messed up.	0
im open to both a cloth weighted body, a full vinyl body, and other aesthetic features.	0
i really dont want it to look creepy, nor do i want one that looks very childish.	0
i would like it to be a normal size and it be able to fit into standard doll size clothes or preemie/infant clothes.	0
i dont want anything that is going to be smaller than a newborn baby who is big enough to go home after birth.	0
my budget is flexible although i think any dolls that are $500+ are likely to be made of silicone which wouldnt work.	0
my friend is someone i love very much and its been difficult to be unable to visit her.	0
she lives in kentucky and i live in dc, but i had been making trips two times a year until covid hit.	0
so this doll is something that i want to put real thought into and hopefully shell know that its a sign of how important she is to me.	0
i appreciate any feedback; including advice, retailers, websites, artists, and brands.	0
thank you all and i hope everyone is having a nice sunday!	0

i know in my heart my dad has vascular dementia.	0
i am a medical student in a family full of md's.	0
we all agree.	0
he got covid in april and subsequently has descended into severe behavioral changes with cognitive decline.	0
he is forgetting very basic things.	0
he has cerebral vasculitis confirmed by mri angiogram (post-covid).	0
he started cheating on my mom in june with a 35 year old (a few years older than me - his youngest daughter), divorced her in december after 33 years of marriage, moved to another state, and cannot keep a job due to angry outbursts.	0
he is getting paranoid.	0
he keeps thinking he can manage this with hyperbaric chambers and supplements.	0
his reality testing is intact - he knows something is wrong - but refuses to take the appropriate treatment measures.	0
&#x200b; the absolute hardest part is that my dad is and was so abusive.	0
at 8: he threw baskteballs at me, physically abused me, made me live with a 16 year-old-exchange student despite catching him in my room in the middle of the night.	0
he did not kick him out until he was caught being inappropriate with his friends 7 year old daughter.	0
he would shake me and throw me as a kid.	0
"he bruised my 4'11"" year old sister."	0
he made her eat pasta until she vomitted as punishment.	0
"he held  my foot in hot water while i cried because i ""need to recover as fast as possible so i could play basketball."""	0
at physical therapy he turned the tens unit up as high as it could go on me and refused to turn it down despite my crying to please make it stop.	0
he kicked me out of the house for telling the carpet cleaner to clean the wrong carpet.	0
i went to drug rehab and he taunted me about how he never read the letters i wrote him.	0
he financially and emotionally abused my mother.	0
most people say i got the worst of it.	0
he was obsessed with me playing basketball growing up.	0
his favorite method of punishment was public humiliation.	0
he would constantly threaten to abandon me.	0
he was such a cruel father.	0
he told me that all men would ever want from me is sex.	0
in response to my sobriety, he has frequently told me that i shouldnt expect a congratulations for doing what i am supposed to do.	0
"when i moved back in with my parents after divorcing my abusive ex-husband, he mocked me for being afraid him of murdering me and made a rule that i should not talk about the divorced around him because i should just ""get over it."""	0
he left me alone with coach known for preying on teenage girls.	0
even after i told him i did not want to see him because he called me to drink with him.	0
he tricked me into seeing him during a home visit from rehab.	0
when i told him about being sexually assaulted and harrassed by a coworker he told me - i will never find a perfect working environment.	0
trauma does not disappear because of his dementia.	0
it does not undo all of the terrible things he did to me as a child.	0
i do not want to live life in regret that i should or could have done more to help him but i also don't want to endanger my sobriety and mental health (bipolar disorder) by forcing myself into a positiion that re-traumatizes me and harms me.	0
my mother is a saint and has said she will do what she can (go with him to doctors, help him get into a home if needed, etc.)	0
because he is our father.	0
sometimes i wish that he would just go away forever and end everyones suffering including his own.	0

for a long time i've been putting down my mum's (71f) quirks down to her personality disorder (undiagnosed but likely borderline, maybe others), but something that happened today has made me look up dementia and i realised she has several symptoms.	0
&#x200b; according to her, everyone else is wrong, nothing is wrong with her, she would never need to see a doctor, if i question her about forgotten memories i'm the one who is crazy.	0
today she asked my partner if she had met my mum's partner.	0
she has met him mutiple times over the last 2 years, most recently 2 weeks ago when we had a coffee with them.	0
&#x200b; i literally don't know what to do now.	0
i just asked my mum's sister if she noticed anything similar and she told me of a similar event.	0
i won't get my mum to the doctor and if i confront her with what has happened she will just explode at me and still not see a doctor.	0
please, what do i do?	0
it's been a gradual decline over years but i think it's accelerated recently.	0
hello.	0
im 81 years old, and known my way around reddit for a long time, but decided to make an alt for this post.	0
ive just been diagnosed with dimentia.	0
my wife sent me to get checked out.	0
how do i proceed	0
my adult son oscar is very autistic and functions largely at a toddler level.	0
that's only one piece of him, of course, but it's the easiest way to give you the broad strokes of our life together.	0
oscar does not allow whispering, singing, or calling him by his given name.	0
(thanks, turbo.	0
";)  he is oscar now, thank you kindly, and if you call him anything else he will yell at you, ""that's not my name!"""	0
if he thinks that you should know better he'll throw in an f bomb.	0
my mil sent me an easter version of hallelujah and i've been stuck on the song since.	0
i walk my dogs out in the woods a lot and i like to sing out there where no one can hear me.	0
(sorry if you hear me before i know you're there!)	0
i wanted to learn the lyrics so i can sing along next time it comes up on my playlist.	0
so i'm in my bedroom with my door shut and he's on the other side of the house.	0
i turn my fan on high, turn my chair around to face the corner, and open the window next to me.	0
i sing as quietly as i can manage for about half an hour.	0
i felt like a teenager getting away with blowing my weed smoke out the window.	0
alas, i became overenthusiastic in my enjoyment of good music, and soon enough oscar was pounding on my door.	0
"""will you just!"	0
stop!	0
singing!	0
what did i say about singing!?!	0
"my eardrums are all falling off!!!"""	0
in a slightly related story, all 4 people and all 3 rambunctious 70lb dogs wound up in the same room at the same time.	0
it happened to be the room ouija's electronics are in which is where he spends most of his time.	0
all 3 dogs were  roughhousing and the other two boys and i were talking and laughing.	0
oscar: will you all!	0
just!	0
shut up already!	0
me: aww, oscar, are there too many people and noises in your space?	0
oscar, dramatically: i think that i would rather to die.	0
naturally, we moved the party.	0
what do i do?	0
mom had a stroke few days after my birth.	0
i've never known what she was like before she got a stroke.	0
exhausted.	0
i'm ripped apart emotionally and mentally.	0
is cleaning the bahtroom a task for a 6 y/o?	0
always having to care for her.	0
i don't get it anymore.	0
thankfully i came across this community, you guys understand the pain.	0
i hoped so badly one day that she would just be able to walk around again.	0
a miracle that i hoped that would happen.	0
it didnt.	0
thanks for reading, have a nice day.	0
my mom's condition has been getting worse and i am the only one takinh care of her.	0
she thinks i am dad and she tries to be sexual sometimes.	0
with no one around, could anyone please help me out with the situation?	0
i am a software engineer, so i mostly stay home.	0
any kind of advice would be appreciated.	0
my mom was fine up until 3 months ago.	0
then suddenly, she became like this.	0
this is so difficult	0
for context, im 32, and my mom is 72, other than a couple small things she is in good health for her age (not great) but she is always dropping hints and sometimes outright asking to move in with me and my significant other.	0
siting that children take care of their parents etc  however im starting to feel boxed in when i feel like ive only had 5 years of living my own real life.	0
when i was a senior in highschool my father got cancer and i ended up staying home what would have been my freshman year of college to help take care of him.	0
after he died a year later i worked and helped my mom pay bills etc until i was able to go to college finally (the plan was always to go) i never wanted to stay i just felt like it was the right thing to do.	0
i wasnt able to finally go to college until 22 because my mom didnt have citizenship (she does now) and her employer (my half sister, my moms step child) didnt file their taxes (my sister took over my fathers business right after he died giving no compensation to my mom or i for it) and i couldnt apply for loans without her income statements because my sister didnt file taxes for 2 years.	0
i went to school for 5 years to get 2 bachelors & when i graduated i moved to a city with my then boyfriend of some years and thats when the hints started, within months it was jokes about moving in with us.	0
i brushed the comments off at first and then after they didnt stop explained how and why that wouldnt work (i struggled right out of college and tbh am still not where i should be in my career).	0
i ended up breaking up with that ltr college sweetheart & lived with roommates for 5ish years, but now that im about to move in with my current bf (of 3 years) its starting back up but more aggressive this time and in the midst of a pandemic and major job setbacks (salary cuts with hours increased) im at my wits end.	0
i love and care about my mom so much but i put my life on hold for 3yrs 19-22 and received an immense amount of guilt for even leaving at 22.  shes always been a dependent person, first relying on my dad in a specific way i wont go into, and after he died, me.	0
i have a half brother and half sister who live in her town but she has no family on her side (like none) her parents died before i was born and her only brother died the year my dad did, which completely changed her as a person to the core.	0
but as you can guess from my short explanation of her situation years ago with my half sister, my half siblings are very toxic people for a multitude of reasons i wont go into.	0
for a while in college or before college i fantasized about running away and cutting all ties just to get out from under it but now that im older and shes older her pleas for help are more aggressive and in general she is meaner and more cruel (is this an early sign of dementia?	0
idk).	0
shes in a bad situation but she has been in a bad situation from the 90s and hasnt made any step beyond finally getting her citizenship in order (after years of ignoring the problem) she cries to me about her loneliness and lack of friends and wants multi hour intense calls every week (which i set boundaries on for a while and then break) shes very depressed and lonely and i really do feel bad for her, all her friends are dead or as she puts it falling apart (because she comes from a really poor working class background of manual labor i notice my mom and her peers in comparison to how my middleclass / rich parents or family arent as run down)  ive urged her repeatedly to get counseling or therapy and how it isnt just venting its also solving the problems shes struggling with and setting a clear path to solving it (summarizing here) but its like pulling teeth and i set a rule that we cant talk on sundays otherwise the calls stress me out so much im wide awake until 5am.	0
i have no plans of moving her into my new apartment with my current bf and ive told her in the past if she cant take care of herself at any point ill help transition her to a community near me where i can visit etc and work everything out.	0
but this doesnt seem like a good enough answer for her anymore and in my sharing future hopes and dreams with her mentioned possibly marrying my current bf and buying a house together (more like a building we can live above and run a venue below) and she was displeased hoping for a house with a mil suite.	0
i think my best course of action i can think of is demanding we table any discussion of where she will live either now or later until she has seen a therapist.	0
i am scared though because mentally i can see her slipping more.	0
she forgets a lot more, shes meaner, she just sent a text when my grandpa (family friend who i literally think of as a grandpa because all mine were dead before i was born because my mom was 40 & day 47 when i was born) had died and she didnt check back in to see how i was about that and never even brings it up.	0
i know im painting her in a controlling light but mostly she just likes to play the victim card and is uneducated (didnt even go to highschool) leading to her feeling overwhelmed by any life situation or responsibility.	0
idk... is any of this relatable to anyone?	0
ive just turned 32 and all my peers have parents finally kid free whooshing off to golden year vacations and getting one ear pierced buying motorcycles... i dont have anyone to relate to about this stuff.	0
i know shes being manipulative but she also does need some help to some extent or will in the future.	0
just recently, my dad (63) got diagnosed with ftd and has been having a hard time with his gambling addiction that was getting worst and worst.	0
my family now knows this is his sickness.	0
when my siblings and i found out, we helped my mom cut him off; changing his passwords, deleting his accounts on the gambling websites, etc.	0
at the time, he was glad we were there to help and recognized the gravity of the situation.	0
his doctor said we did the right thing.	0
fast forward to now, two weeks later, he is begging for us to give him money to gamble one last time.	0
his poison is horse racing and he wants to bet on this last race.	0
we have been pretty stern with him which has made him really upset.	0
he wont talk to us, he is refusing to eat and when he does talk to us, he says we are killing him.	0
i understand this is his sickness talking, but its hard.	0
im wondering if anyone that has experienced a similar situation can give me advice or insight.	0
i tell my mom to stay strong and i know that we have his best interest in mind, however seeing his sadness makes me question what were doing.	0
i think letting him make one more bet would set him back, am i wrong?	0
so my grandmother has dementia and her daughter, my mother, might be affected too.	0
i've noticed small incidents of her not remembering something i've specifically told her.	0
and maybe i'm trying to connect the dots but at some rare moments she reminds me of my grandmother during her early days.	0
maybe my mother wasn't paying attention or genuinely doesn't remember, i don't know.	0
any suggestions of how to go about this would be greatly appreciated.	0
so this is a bit of an update from my last post.	0
2 people in my family got sick from their 2nd vaccine shot.	0
step dad, and step grandmother (the patient) this was expected so i managed to plan it out where my sister helped back me for the next few nights and assist so i dont end up having a melt down from the work and lack of sleep.	0
first night was a nightmare.	0
my grandmother was throwing up the entire night so i didnt get a wink of sleep.	0
unfortunately for my stepdad, he had a dizzy spell and fell in the bathroom at 6 am in the morning.	0
luckily, all he got was a bruise forehead and i assisted him back to bed.	0
my sister came around 2 pm to take over while i slept.	0
at this point my gm was throwing punches and stripping off cloths every few moments.	0
she would only call my sister by bitch and not by her name.	0
about 3-4 pm, the fucking bass started to shake the entire fucking house.	0
the neighbor was working on his car and decided to blast music.	0
i kindly asked him to lower it because i had to wake up at midnight to start my second day shift and he kindly told me to fuck off.	0
now i know my laws, technically he is allowed to blast music at 4 pm during the weekend.	0
theirs nothing against the law to do that until it hit 10 pm.	0
i considered complaining to the home owner but he was a different owner then my own.	0
their was really nothing i could do about the noise since i couldn't file a complaint to his home owner or call the cops.	0
"they always looks at my gm with distaste since she refers to their son as a ""cute little monkey"" (they are black, unintentional racism?"	0
do not know to be honest....) to make matters worse, the abuse my sister is receiving from my gm has made her lost any interest in assisting for the next few days.	0
which i completely understand.	0
luckily my step dad is already feeling a little better but ill be receiving my 2nd vaccine shot in a few days and i feel like we are hitting our limits.	0
well, i have had 2 hours of sleep today and my shift starts in 4 hours so i'm going to bed.	0
(without the noise of rock today thank god.)	0
thx for listening in this has been helping me cope with my frustrations.	0
hi, i am 24 years old and female my mom and her mom, my grandma, have had early onset alzheimers.	0
my mom started declining super early, shes 45 right now and completely not there.	0
her mom died at 55 or so with early onset that she struggled with for years.	0
im sitting here looking at my daughter, feeling scared that i have such a high chance of that being me.	0
what do i do?	0
id rather be in control of my life when the time comes, if it does.	0
i dont want to decline in front of my daughter as my mom did or the thought of her getting it also, makes me just feel terrible knowing that i should have thought about that before having children.	0
but she brings me all of my happiness.	0
i already have a hard time with basic memory and learning things sometimes.	0
i always scare myself and think what if i have it.	0
my father is 70, he lives with 2 dogs on a travel trailer about 40 minutes from me.	0
he lives in the most vile filth i can imagine.	0
layers and layers of trash, aluminum cans, rotting food, jugs of spoiled milk, dog urine, feces, mice droppings everywhere, mice nests, mice just hanging out, etc.	0
everywhere.	0
also tons of stuff, its like an as seen on tv museum mates with the walmart clearance aisle.	0
just insane, of course everything is essential for some reason or another.	0
meanwhile, boxes of photo albums and mementos from my late mother were left sitting outside all winter.	0
last year i helped him clean out his trailer, and it was so bad that i made him move into a second trailer that he owned.	0
i helped him get set up in there.	0
new mattress, nice tv, cleaning supplies, everything was set to be pretty decent.	0
we sold the old trailer for salvage it was basically unredeemable.	0
yesterday he asked to help him replace an outlet that had shorted out.	0
this new trailer is filled with all the filth and nastiness now as the old one.	0
im torn between being angry and feeling sorry for him.	0
i fixed the outlet and then spent all day shoveling (yes, with an actual shovel) out garbage and shit and who knows what else.	0
filled the entire bed of an f350 with trash.	0
used the snow shovel to scrape all the stuck on stuff off the floors and tried to mop.	0
i let him and mom (before she passed) live with me and family in the past, it was a disaster.	0
he is super lazy and refuses to help with anything and there is no way id try that again.	0
my siblings dont ever help.	0
im at a point where i think im going to tell him that i wont help anymore, at least until he shows some signs that he is at least trying.	0
but what is my responsibility?	0
i get calls from his neighbors complaining about the smell coming from in and around his trailer.	0
i feel obligated to help, but it makes me so angry, it makes wish he would just die so i wont have to deal with it anymore.	0
has anyone used aidaly.com ?	0
well here we are at the very moment my father and i were supposed to enter the care community's doors so dad could sign the contract but instead we're sitting at home with the contract unsigned.	0
sigh.	0
dad's been struggling with constipation and this morning told me he was now in pain and didn't want to go anywhere, including visiting my mom in her rehab or signing the assisted living contract, until he gets some relief.	0
i called his doctor's office for advice, went to the store, and let's hope all is well soon.	0
we have already rescheduled for tomorrow at the facility.	0
so again we deal with the highs and the lows, for they're all part of moving my parents.	0
mom is 83 in deteriorating health mostly from join pain which hovers around a 8 or of ten all day for her.	0
shes had multiple surgerys and her heart probably wont survive another.	0
i care for her, and clean up and do everything that she will allow, but shes miserable.	0
im the same watching her in so much pain.	0
were coping with some pain pills, cbd/thc edibles and some over the counter meds.	0
ive stopped working which adds more stress of course but her and i can live fine on here ssi.	0
ive applied for public benefits too but didnt get a lot.	0
but im grateful for the small help with health insurance and some food assistance.	0
thats not the biggest issue.	0
its the waiting around for her body to just give.	0
its so hard to watch.	0
my dad was moved from a short term to long term care place early last month.	0
visits have not been allowed in either place.	0
at the last facility, he had a phone in his room.	0
when i would speak to him, he displayed the expected lack of memory and confabulation from his illness but he was alert.	0
in fact, he was moved partially because he was often agitated and trying to escape.	0
the new place has a shared phone screened by the nurse.	0
whenever i talk to him, he sounds half awake.	0
he barely says anything.	0
i know that they've adjusted his meds but i'm concerned that they are just doping him up so he's not a bother.	0
i don't know if there's anything i can do.	0
it's really frustrating not being able to see for myself how he's doing.	0
there are no open cases of covid-19 at the place and almost everyone there is vaccinated.	0
it doesn't make sense.	0
sometimes it seems everything just gets harder.	0
last night my mother called me from the rehab center where'd she's recovering from surgery.	0
"she was experiencing something called ""hospital delerium,"" evidently common among elderly people who become very confused when staying in facilities like this."	0
"her first call was a plea to me to come get her, that she didn't like this ""school"" and that she wasn't learning anything and wanted to go home."	0
"a couple hours later came a more urgent call, accusing me of betraying her and demanding that i come and pick her up from ""this restaurant"" or she would call the police."	0
my mother is typically very lucid so it's not easy to hear her speak like this.	0
in the meantime, my dad has been suffering from constipation and this morning advised me that i should go to the assisted living appointment without him.	0
well i can't do that because he hasn't granted me poa.	0
i simply said no, that he had to come, and that i'd do all i could to help him with all the challenges of the day, including providing him some prunes and calling his doctor once the office is open.	0
we're only 2 hours from our appointment and i still don't know if we'll keep it.	0
i'll update again soon.	0
in the meantime, it remains to be seen whether today we will, or will not, take a major step in the process of moving my parents.	0
im taking care of my step dads mom and she cries all the time.	0
im pretty sure its fake crying most of the time.	0
she just yells help me nonstop.	0
i havent seen anyone talk about using the cry it out method they use for babies.	0
is that not something we should do?	0
because if not, how the hell do you get anything done ever?	0
some days she cries every half hour.	0
and some nights, like tonight, its every ten minutes.	0
i told her to shut up for the first time.	0
i got so overwhelmed, im sick, and tired and i just told her to shut up.	0
i feel a little bad but also i really do want her to just shut up.	0
she cant get into any trouble seeing as she cant get out of bed on her own and cant walk without her walker.	0
so would it be so bad if i just ignored her for a while?	0
closed my bedroom door, turned off the baby monitor, and just ignored her for half an hour?	0
my first half an hour of peace at home since last year when she started getting progressively worse at an accelerated pace?	0
she is on 100mg quetiapine.	0
she started at 25 and it worked for two nights, same with 50mg, and now same with 100. but it only works for those two nights.	0
then its back to normal.	0
my step dad never comes to see her.	0
only once or twice a month.	0
we almost put her in a memory care facility but then my mom talked him out of it because it might disturb her routine.	0
so now my boyfriend and i are stuck with her for god knows how long with no help.	0
her insurance doesnt even cover a night nurse.	0
i dont know how much longer i can do this.	0
happy labor day weekend my beautiful caregivers!!!!	0
just want to check in on everyone, say hello and making sure all of you are okay mentally  and physically.	0
i often say who care for the caregivers?	0
so often we are overlooked and overwhelmed.	0
take a little time out for yourself today, you absolutely deserve it.	0
i (40m) have been living with and taking care of my aging father (70)with multiple health issues.	0
i am a very calm person and it takes a lot to get me upset but my father seems to be able to push all my buttons and get me worked up.	0
im having outburts when in certain situations where there are disagreements, mainly stemming from things hes done or said that is flat out wrong or offensive in some way.	0
i am not like this with anyone else in my life so this isnt a problem ive always had to deal with.	0
but i have become more reactive than ever and i hate it and want to change.	0
i think one of the things that bothers me is that i want him to be different and i know that isnt rational.	0
hes not the father i want him to be so it makes me frustrated in general.	0
im aware that this mentality of mine is also unreasonable and that i need to accept people for who they are, but because of the person he is, i cant handle my cool and its really starting to affect my own health.	0
im stressed out daily.	0
i do all the work around the house, pay the bills, shop, cook, clean.	0
all of it.	0
its a lot to deal with honestly and at first when i agreed to help him i thought it was going to be easy but as the years went on its only gotten worse.	0
im sure i am feeling the effects of caregiver burnout.	0
he is often very moody because he is not happy that he is having health issues and he has a small fuse so he gets upset and yells very easily.	0
often being belligerent and name calling.	0
im old enough now that im not emotionally affected by his comments, im more frustrated because i will explain the situation very clearly to him and why his behavior is a problem and he just tirelessly argues with me, mostly trying to manipulate me and talk his way out of it instead of simply owning up to the dumb shit he did or said and say sorry.	0
its really just that easy.	0
i wish i knew how to employ some tactics of my own to help myself recognize when im getting to that point and correct it.	0
but the ridiculous shit that comes out of his mouth sometimes just gets me fired up.	0
we never get to the point where it will  get physical, we just strongly argue with each other and of course it never gets to any sort of agreement with eachother.	0
i honestly have no idea how to stay calm anymore when in these situations.	0
we get into shouting matches when it gets bad sometimes and of course afterwards i feel bad but hes just as guilty with the shit he says.	0
i just dont know what to do anymore.	0
i love the guy to death but dealing with his personality is a chore in itself.	0
asking him to exercise, or take meds, or anything like that immediately sets him off.	0
most times i can just walk away but there are many times when i fall into the trap and its a 2 hour non stop argument of me trying to explain  myself that if i am to be caregiver this is how it is going to be.	0
im going to remind him to do things.	0
he doesnt take showers for 4 days or wash his sheets for weeks and the second i say something, its wwiii.	0
hes extremely judgy and very critical of me and the world in general.	0
always looking for that opportunity to complain to me about how the world is so messed up, etc, etc.	0
hes also a closet racist who often makes comments he doesnt even understand why they are offensive and incessantly will try and talk his way out of it instead simply saying hey sorry that came off as offensive but i didnt mean it that way.	0
what i actually meant was.... nope what actually happens is he starts shouting and getting mad because i pointed out what he said was rude or whatever the case is in the moment.	0
arguments never end well.	0
i will storm off out of frustration and sometimes slamming doors.	0
i often have to go for a run to cool off.	0
i just would like some ideas on how to deal with someone like this.	0
i have tried to just stay away from him but its not a very big house so its almost impossible.	0
now with all that said...there are good days.	0
but it seems now more than ever things are taking a turn for the worse and i need to figure this out or hire someone to take care of him and i need to find another place to live.	0
the problem with that is ive always promised him id never leave him and id always be there for him.	0
so im stuck in my mind what to do.	0
i could go on for days talking about the shit i have to deal with but ill save you the headache.	0
i think you get the idea.	0
i just want to be able to get through the week without an argument.	0
please give me some advice i can use to deal with this issue.	0
and i have a lot of respect for those of you who are caregivers and have to deal with this.	0
i dont know how you do it.	0
hello everyone, my relative has an elder aunt whom she is taking care of and she receives compensation from ihss.	0
last week she had a minor operation and she asked me to help her out for one week.	0
i'm working 12 hrs a day as a live-in caregiver  i'm suppose to have a reliever every three days for six hours during the day, but for some reason the caregiver didn't show up today is my seventh day and i'm suppose to leave tomorrow morning.	0
but she told me to extend because she have an eye checkup tomorrow.	0
so i told her i will wait until she gets back from her doctor's appointment then i will go.	0
few hours later, she asked me if i can stay more days if her doctor told her that she needs more time to recover.	0
i told her no, but i have a feeling she will ask me again to stay longer.	0
i don't want to, i'm burnt out.	0
i worked 7 days straight with no day off.	0
she's paying me $15/hr for 12 hours which is the rate the ihss is giving her.	0
i'd like to know is this real?	0
she's not paying me overtime and i got no day-off, i'm working for 7 days straight plus extended hours tomorrow.	0
if you are working 12 hrs straight, how much break time you are entitled to and what's the maximum days per week according to federal and california state law?	0
thanks in advance.	0

hey there after a broken hip, significant internal bleeding and another stroke, (in the last week!	0
), the hospital has encouraged us to enroll mom in hospice.	0
i had the initial conversation with hospice tonight and we are moving forward with it.	0
they kept asking if i had any questions, and if there was anything special they should know.	0
i walked through mom's medical and social history, but i keep wondering.	0
&#x200b; if you have engaged hospice for your loved one, is there anything you wish you had  known when you started it?	0
anything special you wished you had asked for?	0
my mother has been in and out of mental health care facilities for the last 2 years she claims she cant take care of herself and forgets how to do things like shower its very unclear if he really has dementia because most drs think shes playing a manipulative game.	0
(i tend to agree unfortunately).	0
shes tried committing suicide on many occasions.	0
i lost count how many calls to 911 have been made that havent resulted in getting any help.	0
im feeling defeated as fuck because im planning on calling adult protective services to relinquish power of attorney.	0
fuck the system here in the us.	0
what if alzheimer's patients are completely there but the way that the brain has difficulties functioning causes them to get trapped in memories?	0
as we grow up we develop memories and automation in our brains.	0
do we think about how we move our arms or how we touch-type after we've learned it?	0
it's automation.	0
my hypothesis is that alzheimer's is when the brain loses its ability to create new automation and memories and gets trapped in old ones.	0
the more severe the condition the more severely trapped.	0
however, my guess is that we still have control over these memories and which present themselves.	0
is the fundamental mind behind the memories actually gone or are they controlling the memories themselves to the best of their ability?	0
when alzheimer's is early they would probably have more control over the ability to create new memories and/or new automation but as it progresses the brain, while still functioning with the old memories and automation, it becomes harder and harder to do something fundamentally new.	0
when the grandmother of a child talks to him like he's her son... she might be completely aware behind the scenes but has a storng memory of talking to her son when he was young.	0
if she's doing this it's because she's desiring to talk to her grandson but the memory that is prominent or that she has focused on in order to actually talk is one relating to her son.	0
she  potentially doesn't have a strong memory of her grandson (especially at the age he is now) so even if she tries to hold on to the idea it's her grandson she might not have any memories where she was talking to him... so she has the choice of a memory where they don't talk or a memory of her son (and not her grandson) where they do.	0
i've had this idea for a while (i've been thinking about many things over the last two years).	0
all i've done is think the past two years.	0
three or four days ago i met a military retiree and spent a few nights drinking with him.	0
my idea about alzheimer's seems to fit him.	0
i even mentioned it to him.	0
he did not respond to me in any way to my question but before i mentioned it he actually was all over the place.	0
after that - while he was still all over the place - right after i would ask a question he would respond by jumping to a new topic but the first words he would say seemed to respond directly to what i said.	0
the guy appeared very smart to me but he didn't have the ability to speak what exactly was on his mind except for jumping from memory to memory or topic to topic - but after i mentioned alzheimer's and being trapped in memories the guy seemed to be doing it purposefully and was actually able to communicate.	0
"it seemed like his personality used to be very much ""don't inturrupt me when i'm talking"" but his only way to speak was to grab a topic or memory and then let it play out unless he has something specific to swap to."	0
if i'm right it was to be insanely frustrating.	0
if i'm correct he likely has somewhat severe alzheimer's but he's smart enough to understand how to control his mind still to communicate despite it.	0
he seemed like he was trapped in decisions that he thought were now a bad idea but was unable to change his mind about the decisions so he was constantly mentioning them and then mentioning a related subject that immediately had him stall out and not act.	0
he mentioned this same situation multiple, multiple times.	0
he was clearly trying to change his mind on his first decision but no longer has the ability to change the automation in his mind even if he can still control it.	0

when your relationship with the care recipient was toxic to begin with, how in the world are you going to be successful at pleasing them during covid?	0
"especially during the ""early"" stages when they are independent enough to dress themselves, but ornery enough to screech every time you remind them to wash their hands?"	0
i need help.	0
mil has started doing laundry, which means i get to redo laundry.	0
and shes taking my clothes.	0
i want to assume that she doesnt know better.	0
its crazy how with dementia even though you dont own any jeans, youll take someone elses and think theyre yours.	0
i dont want to share clothes with her, she doesnt bathe.	0
now begins the task of somehow taking control of the laundry again.	0
difficult conversations and dementia proof doorknobs i guess.	0
so much for yesterday's fireworks and champagne!	0
today my grandson, who works for a pest control company, stopped by while my wife and little granddaughter were sitting with dad while i went for my covid shot.	0
in my absence, and while my wife was dealing with our granddaughter, the grandson related a few stories to my dad of ant and mice infestations at the place where tomorrow we are scheduled to sign a contract.	0
i returned from my shot to get dad and take him for some banking.	0
on the way there he told me what he thought he had heard, and it was disgusting.	0
all the rooms were crawling with ants, the kitchen was filthy, full of mice, a real horror show.	0
he was considering cancelling tomorrow's appointment.	0
we completed our banking and returned to my wife.	0
"i left dad in the car and said ""what in the world did (grandson) say to dad?"	0
"he's about ready to cancel the appointment tomorrow!"""	0
"""he said a couple rooms had some ants because people had left food out, and that there had been mice in the kitchen because a 16 year old boy had intentionally attracted them by leaving balls of peanut butter on the floor, but (grandson) dealt with those issues and the place is good to go now."""	0
"""would you please come out to the car and straighten dad out?"	0
"he's considering cancelling the appointment over this."""	0
so she did, but dad didn't seem convinced.	0
and now i have to wait on my fireworks and champagne, because who knows what else could happen before, or even after, 10 o' clock tomorrow morning that might stop me from moving my parents?	0
my dad was diagnosed with lewy body dementia about three months ago.	0
he is 78 and my mom is 70. she is his sole 24/7 caretaker right now, and fortunately has no symptoms of cognitive decline and is in decent health.	0
they live almost 200 miles away from me.	0
i made the decision a few weeks ago (with their full support) that i will be moving in with them in a few months to help care for dad and support mom.	0
i've been approved to work from home permanently, so i will still have my full-time job and income.	0
their home is much larger than mine, and they have three cats and a dog that my mom doesn't want to have to give up.	0
i'm single and childless, so it only makes sense that i would be the one to move.	0
i truly believe this is the right decision.	0
i am very close to both my parents and i know i would regret not being there for them if i didn't go.	0
moving was 100% my idea and my decision.	0
my mom is also working with the va and the county to try and get some in-home care for him maybe once or twice a week so she can take breaks.	0
but i'm still really scared.	0
and sad.	0
i miss the person my dad used to be.	0
when i was young, i thought he was indestructible.	0
he was always intelligent, independent, stubborn, and strong.	0
now he doesn't recognize my mom or their house half the time, needs someone to help him get dressed and find the bathroom, and talks like he can't keep hold of a thought for more than thirty seconds.	0
until recently, he always seemed to recognize me as his daughter, but i visited them this past weekend (they're both fully vaccinated, and i stay quarantined to protect them), and there was a point where he looked at me like he wasn't quite sure who i was or why i was hugging him, and it broke my heart.	0
i guess my question is, do you ever get used to it?	0
because right now it just plain hurts.	0
i'm still very new to this and i'm still doing research on it but i was wondering if there's any financial assistance available to get additional caregiver services?	0
medicare does not cover this unless it's for rehab or something similar.	0
i'm looking to hire additional caregiver support like once or twice a week to help my mom with things around the house and possibly help take her to doctor's appointments.	0
i didn't realize how expensive it is and how quickly it adds up.	0
are there any sources for financial support that you're aware of in situations of this nature?	0
my grandmother (88) was recently officially diagnosed with dementia, and determined to be an upper 5+ on the gds.	0
while she's had forgetfulness her pcp has stated was early dementia for around 3 years now, in the past 5-6 months it has increased in severity rapidly.	0
we still don't have an official diagnosis on what type of dementia, although her primary 'symptoms' are forgetfulness (of words, the purpose of certain objects, and misplacing things), misinterpreting or misunderstanding info & directions given to her (i.e.	0
if you set a timer for her to take her meds, it's 50/50 whether she remembers what the timer is for once it goes off), and paranoia.	0
the paranoia is the newest symptom and is the reason we got the evaluation done, as i'm pretty worried she will accuse someone of something - she already accuses family of stealing things (most of the time, she'll give you a gift, then accuse you of stealing that item from her), she accuses people of stalking her, etc.	0
it bears mentioning that she has always been a bit of an odd duck, pretty stubborn, a little gullible, and has had pretty much 0 filter with expressing her opinions her entire life.	0
she's physically in great health (lives alone) & recognizes who everyone is, all details of her younger life, the date/address/etc, but she has started confusing memories of people recently (she told me she's closest to my youngest cousin because she helped raise her daily, even though that's me - she's only seen my cousin a handful of times; she told me my mom is becoming a great baker & cake decorator even though that's me, my mom never bakes; etc).	0
my mom was allowed to be in the room for her recent evaluation and while my mom has been the most aware & alarmed of the decline, she said that the questions really showed it's much worse than even she could have expected.	0
and my mom is with her daily!	0
the most alarming thing in the past 2 months is that she's not eating much or well and rapidly losing weight.	0
she sort of brags about it like not eating is a badge of honor, and sometimes makes comments that she can't eat a treat someone brought to her until she loses another 2 pounds even though she's becoming malnourished [side note: we kind of feel like this goes back to the misinterpreting info symptom, because she's been told by doctor's she needs to eat more but it seems like half the time she recalls it as needing to eat less].	0
in the evaluation, she was asked specific questions about safety while alone and gave extremely concerning answers.	0
after that, the memory specialists told my mom she needs to be in a home asap.	0
we definitely agree.	0
trouble is, my grandma is a) insistent that she doesn't have a problem and this is all a conspiracy for us to 'get rid of her', b) insistent that she continue living at home, and c) we are worried about the kinds of accusations she makes & what that could mean for staff.	0
i'm curious if anyone has experience in general with these types of dementia symptoms, and even better if you have experience with this situation in which a family member is a danger to themselves & needs care but refuses?	0
thank you!	0
tl;dr: grandma has moderate dementia and is recommend to be in a home or care facility, but is in denial she has any problems & will not agree to moving, in addition to being paranoid & combative.	0
advice on helping her?	0
my dad is 84yo with alzheimers.	0
i don't know what stage he's in, but suffice it to say that he generally doesn't recognize any of us as family.	0
and generally thinks that he's already in a facility.	0
my mom is the 24/7 caregiver - generally in good health, but physically/emotionally/mentally exhausted.	0
he knows her name and thinks it's an interesting coincidence that her name is the same as his wife's name.	0
up to this point, my mom has made it a point to rarely correct or argue with him about his perceived reality.	0
"but we're now at a point he's become fixated on the idea of asking his ""nurse"" to contact his ""wife"" ... and wonders why she won't call."	0
as if he thinks that his wife has abandoned him.	0
"so seems like our options are:  start correcting him and trying to explain to him that his caregiver is his wife or take this ""never correct or argue with him"" to the point of making the charade even more elaborate by faking a phone call or a voicemail from her to him  anyone ever deal with this?"	0
i'm not sure how he'll react when he tries to mentally reconcile that his nurse is actually his wife.	0
my wife has been in long term memory care for six months and while generally not aggressive, she does become confrontational when personal care tasks like washroom assistance and dressing happen.	0
she particularly dislikes shirts being pulled over her head to take them off, so im picking up more button-up tops for her.	0
ive also been looking at adaptive clothing options, so am wondering if anyone here has informed thoughts one way or the other on this topic.	0
she is not confined to a wheelchair, and is in fact still quite mobile at 61 years old.	0
any thoughts or shared experiences appreciated guys.	0
thanks	0
my grandmother has parkinson's disease and in my language/country it's called parkinson dementia, is in america parkinson also comsidered a type of dementia?	0
hello community.	0
i have been seeking the cease my caregiver role to my adult daughter and have found this community to be very helpful, especially in acknowledging all phases of caregiving including the few where the caregiver must stop dur to their own needs.	0
i am thus admittedly distant as i continue to assert my boundaries and ensure my daughter grows up.	0
it has recently come to attention that my daughter obtained food stamps behind my back, and qualified for expanded medicaid recently, so i no longer have to provide for her medically for the first time in her adult life.	0
i'm fine with the medicaid.	0
daughter has rare conditions and it will make seeing the proper specialists require more strategizing that i would do for her in the past, so now she will have something on which to spend her time (other than playing on her phone).	0
the food stamps are unacceptable.	0
daughter already goes to food pantries more than she is permitted to, and often takes my id without asking to get more food.	0
she has plenty of food.	0
"i have threatened to turn her in for charity fraud for her food pantry ""games."""	0
"she also tries to get help with bills and medical expenses i decline (because they are unnecessary) that i pay to ""lessen her financial burden on me."""	0
"i admit that i lost my temper a bit and said, ""where do you think that i am supposed to sh*t out money for you, daughter?"	0
you already take every bit of my social security check, something i worked for my entire life.	0
sorry i don't make as much money as i used to, but most people who are in their 30s don't still depend on their mommy to support them.	0
"if you can spend many hours cooking and many many hours on line, maybe you could put those skills to make some money of your own."""	0
i tell her to work, that you will not lessen your burden on me by transferring it to society.	0
she doesn't understand that's not an acceptable solution to her financial problems and that she will never be able to pay her medical and life bills by relying on the government.	0
daughter has continued to refuse to grow up, and i have recently settled her late father's estate.	0
there is about $25,000 cash leftover for daughter, which i have placed into a trust in my name with myself as the sole beneficiary.	0
(i sought free legal advice when creating the terms and this was advised as daughter is sneaky and manipulative.)	0
i have decided to place $325 into a po box i purchased on the 5th day of each month for daughter to use on living expenses.	0
i have assigned and paid another member of my family to carry out this arrangement, including if i should pass in the 4 years before the tryst is up.	0
"(i do not wish for daughter to get the full $25k as i do not feel she deserves it, maybe if her behavior improves her cash flow from my trust will, but i honestly foresee the opposite happening) and that is why another relative has been paid to ""deal with her for me."""	0
i pay for all of my daughter's living expenses.	0
she has zero unmet needs and her wants are simply that - items entitled children feel should be theirs.	0
after the first cash envelope of $325 is placed into the po box, i will then wait the legally appropriate 10 days, and if daughter has failed to report this money as income to support her to the department of health and human services - i will.	0
daughter doesn't work - a requirement in my state - but gets the maximum benefit of $234 per month in food stamps.	0
as usual, i will have to bite the bullet and give her more than she needs, but i am hopeful this will finally teach her to stop lying to the government and receiving benefits meant for people who actually deserve and need them.	0
has anyone else had this problem while trying to safely extricate yourself from a rorced caregiving situation?	0
your adult child literally succeeds at fraud and you have to dole out tough love, do the right thing, and allow them to understand that their actions have consequences?	0
i admit that it feels somewhat petty, but at the same time, in my heart of hearts, daughter is being provided for more comprehensively than she is reporting to the government and i do feel she must learn that's not okay.	0
i'm pretty certain daughter will not report her new income, which really leaves me no other options than to be the adult and report it myself.	0
how would you handle this situation?	0
when my dad (83 this week) or mom (80) who are separated but remain good friends after 41 years of marriage and 17 years of separation don't answer their phone.	0
called my dad last night at 6:05, okay so he is probably watching the news and will call me back, at 7:05 he still didn't answer.	0
i called him at 9 this am...still no answer.	0
he likes to talk on the phone and speaks with a group of people most days.	0
he thinks using call waiting is rude to the person he is speaking with and won't click over.	0
never mind....he just called me.	0
thanks for listening :)	0
switched to night shift so that my family could sleep.	0
i sleep during the day and start my 12 hour night at midnight.	0
literally the absolute worst.	0
she is a 300 pound women under multiple pills at night, making her an unmovable boulder in her bedroom.	0
old people pee a ton at night so my shift usually starts with me leading her to the toilet and spending a hour to help her pee or changing her sheets because she already wet the bed before hand.	0
sadly even adult diapers have a limit of pee it can withstand.	0
after making breakfast, lunch and starting the laundry, i can finally sleep.	0
or at least i try because she starts screaming loudly the moment i leave her care.	0
considering sleeping in the garage but their is no heater in there and a ton of spiders, but it beats 2 hours of sleep daily.	0
my siblings and i are caring for my mom whose dementia had been getting worse.	0
her worst life quality problem is just being bored.	0
before her decline she read, did crossword puzzles and crafted jewelry.	0
we are having trouble finding things that engage her.	0
"she gets bored and frustrated and repeats ""oh, i don't know what i should be doing""."	0
no solution is going to be perfect but i am open to ideas	0

my grandmother has dementia.	0
she cant walk up and down stairs anymore.	0
i need a way for her to get up and down my two flights of stairs by my self or to the doctors.	0
ive seen evacu trac but im afraid to splurge on some thing thats very exspensive if i dont know if it will actually work.	0
anyone have any suggestions?	0
i won't take time bringing people up to speed.	0
if you need to know what came before today please just find my older posts.	0
here's what happened since my last post: late last week my mother showed a great deal of confusion.	0
my dad had said earlier that there was no way he was selecting an apartment in assisted living unless mom got to see it and give her approval.	0
"i saw an opportunity after a troubling visit when mom was clearly not herself and i asked, ""dad, do you think mom is capable of making a decision as important as choosing a place to live?"	0
that's a lot of responsibility.	0
"i wonder if it might be more kind if you did this for her, so she could concentrate on getting better."""	0
"i thought he might say, ""no, we will just wait until she gets better,"" but instead he said, ""she can't decide anything right now."""	0
this was critical, because for the first time dad was prepared to act unilaterally.	0
i pressed.	0
"""dad, can you picture what it will be like when mom comes home?"	0
will you hire a nurse?	0
will you try to take care of her yourself?	0
"i can't stay a whole lot longer."""	0
"he said, ""yes you can, you just don't want to."""	0
i could tell the conversation needed to end there so i dropped the matter and left him to do some thinking.	0
"later he approached me and said, ""tell the lady i need to see the room and the contract before anything else happens."""	0
i wrote her an email saturday knowing she wouldn't see it until this morning.	0
the lady and i spoke twice today.	0
"after the first call i went to my dad and said, ""she wants to know if you're serious because they're not permitted to let people inside except if they're certain you're very serious."""	0
"i waited, wondering if he'd say ""tell her to forget it then."""	0
"but he said, ""yes, i intend to take the apartment."""	0
"i nodded and said, ""i think that's the right thing to do."""	0
we made an appointment for wednesday morning.	0
but now, what about my mom?	0
after all, she had been queen of this family castle for 56 years.	0
i offered the idea that we'd talk to her social worker, get some advice, certainly that person would have experience telling elderly people they couldn't go home.	0
how would she take this news?	0
my dad had never made such an important decision in his long life without the helpful input of his dear wife.	0
he and i spent an hour discussing strategy.	0
we were concerned about hurting her feelings, or making her angry or resentful, hating the place and being unhappy there because she wasn't consulted in its selection.	0
"finally he landed on the ""it's not you it's me"" approach."	0
"""i'll tell her the truth, that with my failing eyesight and forgetfulness, i need us to go there."""	0
next i called the nurse.	0
"i said, ""we need some advice."	0
"mom doesn't know this, but she and dad are going to assisted living very soon."""	0
the nurse stopped me cold.	0
"""yes, she knows that, she said it will be such a relief not to cook or clean anymore!"""	0
i couldn't believe it.	0
they had each independently arrived at the same conclusion on the same day.	0
dad and i were very relieved because the potential final obstacle had apparently removed itself!	0
dad will sign the contract on wednesday once levels of care are determined for each of them.	0
suddenly, after years of research, dozens of phone calls, debates, frustration and borderline despair, we are now apparently mere days away from moving my parents.	0
kia ora!	0
im encouraging my parents to get a dog to improve their quality of life, and help my mums loneliness.	0
my mum is in the early stages of alzheimers and becomes deeply depressed if either myself or my dad isnt home, or if we dont speak with her for a few hours.	0
its sad to say, but i find myself limiting my own social life just so she wont be alone.	0
i cant go out with friends or even learn how to drive because it would mean leaving mum alone at home for a few hours.	0
in this sense, a dog would give mum the company she seeks and allow more room for movement for my dad and i. several health professionals and psychologists have suggested we get a dog at this stage to help mum as the alzheimers and subsequent depression progresses.	0
in turn, the dog would have near-constant company.	0
the only thing is...my mum is adamantly against getting a dog.	0
she believes shell no long be able to travel and will lose her freedom.	0
my dad would honestly love the joy and company of a dog, but hell go along with whatever keeps my mum happy.	0
i know in my gut the right dog would provide all the things both my parents seek: infinite snuggles and unconditional love for mum, and routine exercise and play for my dad.	0
since im the one pushing them to get a dog, i dont want to load my parents with undue stress and put more responsibilities on my dad than he already has on his plate, especially since he will likely be the sole carer of my mother as well as the dog.	0
i hope this all makes sense, im just trying to find some guidance on all of this.	0
is it a good idea to push my parents to get a dog?	0
what breed is good for people with alzheimers?	0
and do you have any experience with this??	0
do the pros outweigh the cons in this instance?	0
i struggle sometimes coping with my mums condition, and i know my dad does too.	0
perhaps this dog would turn into a therapy dog for all of us.	0
im just trying to find a way to make my parents just a little bit happier, but id hate to burden them further.	0
honestly any comment, suggestion, or word of advice would be greatly appreciated.	0
i see many happy dogs and happy dog owners on the internet and i hope to give my parents the same joy.	0
ps.	0
for further detail, my parents prefer the idea of a small-ish, non-shedding dog that wants to cuddle all day and low energy (the last thing we want is a strong dog pulling my old parents over).	0
while mum has obvious health issues, dad is incredibly fit (think ripped master roshi from dragon ball z) and has the time, energy and experience to train a dog.	0
im personally inclined to a greyhound or a cavalier king charles spaniel, but its not about what i like haha!	0
thank you for reading this far!	0
hope youre having a wonderful day wherever you are xx	0

my grandma has been expressing sentences recently that are more coherent than normal as her experience with dementia are getting towards the end.	0
the most recent interesting one was my soul is tired.	0
when i recently asked her what she is doing today, she responded with dying.	0
she has been tired and at peace when she says the things.	0
happy to see anyone who shows up with a smile and says they are family.	0
has anyone else experienced this with a loved one going through dementia?	0
hi everyone, my partner is full time caring for his grandmother with dementia.	0
normally she knows who he is, but every once in a while, she cant recognize him, and will try to run away from him.	0
once, it was bad enough that she was screaming for help, banging on neighbors doors to try to get them to call the police.	0
he was finally able to get his father (her son) to come over and take over for a bit, and she reset to normal once she was away from my partner for an hour.	0
whats the best way to deal with this situation?	0
how do you calm down a person with dementia if theyre afraid of you and trying to run away?	0
thanks for any advice you provide.	0
i (23) previously posted here because i was having a lot of trouble with my grandmother and her relationship with my mom.	0
heres the other post from january.	0
as an update, my grandmother now spends half of the time at my aunts house and occasionally one day on the off week there as well.	0
youd think things were much better, but theyre really not.	0
my mom and grandma still argue very often.	0
my grandma finds even the smallest things to nit pick about and will be rude unprovoked.	0
her behavior is also becoming more dangerous.	0
she threatened to throw herself out of a moving car (according to my mom) during an argument the other day.	0
she hates living with us but refuses to admit it.	0
everything we do is wrong and everything my aunts family does is right.	0
(for even more context that i forgot to add in the previous post, my grandma previously hit my mom during an argument and left the country for a while, only returning during the pandemic last year.)	0
the other issue is that i am now feeling extremely depressed and overwhelmed.	0
i was doing okay before and really wanted to find solutions to our family issues, but now, im in crisis mode.	0
i cry all the time and rarely want to go home to where my grandmother is.	0
im writing this from the car as im parked in an empty lot after my 9-5. i cant live like this.	0
i feel nervous and upset and overwhelmed any time i am around my grandmother.	0
the majority of the time i cant even look at or speak to her.	0
i think im both depressed and traumatized from all the issues ive had with her.	0
i went from seeing her as a grandmother to being afraid of her.	0
ive considered moving out or even quitting my job and leaving the country.	0
the thing is, even if i move out, my mom and grandma should not and cannot live together.	0
and i need emotional support from my mom and i know she needs me too after her divorce.	0
no one seems to see that were unable to support my grandma.	0
after a family conversation (sans grandma since she cant take those types of conversations), i begged my aunt to let my grandma stay at her house a bit more permanently until we decide whether my grandma should return to her home country for a while or if we find her an independent living facility.	0
i told her it would only be for a little while, maybe a couple of weeks or so.	0
she never acts out in any way with other family members, only with us.	0
but since she does act out with us, it has become dangerous for her and also just absolutely wrecked my own and my moms mental health.	0
my aunt said no after finding several excuses (that she couldnt stay there on the days the room was empty because it would cease to be her son/my cousins room, who is now away at college, etc).	0
to a certain extent i understand wanting to have your sibling (my mom) step up to care for a parent, but it seems selfish to keep pushing it even after my grandmother is not happy with us after close to a year, has become aggressive, and after i am slowly losing my will to live and have expressed that.	0
my aunt has also said it is completely up to my mom and i (which really just means me) to make any changes to the current situation.	0
to find a family therapist, to get my grandma a flight back to her home, to find a living facility.	0
i can barely cook for myself and drive to and from work without losing it, especially now that she has refused to let my grandma stay with her more permanently so i can breathe.	0
i cant take on all of that while still going through a mental breakdown.	0
im so upset and feel so lonely.	0
if you have advice, feel free to share.	0
any support or words of encouragement would also work.	0
im not sure how much longer i can do this, and im working through feelings of shame, guilt, and also betrayal because it feels like no one cares or is listening.	0
sorry if the format is weird.	0
i'm on mobile and this is kind of my first actual reddit post ever.	0
at the beginning of the year my (27f) dad (64m) suffered a stroke, leaving him unable to speak, swallow, and move the right side of his body.	0
he already dealt with diabetes, high blood pressure, an amputation (luckily just some toes), extremely poor eyesight, and overall was a very disorganized person.	0
so prior to the stroke i was already somewhat of a caregiver.	0
i checked his feet almost every day for diabetic ulcers.	0
if he had wounds i would dress them.	0
i kept track of all of his appointments, and my boyfriend would drive us to all of them (i don't have a license).	0
other than that he was largely independent.	0
he cooked his own meals, remembered to take his meds, and was pretty normal!	0
but i had been taking care of him for almost 5 years already and was starting to feel the burnout.	0
my life was on hold until we could figure out a way for him to not constantly be on the verge of foot infections.	0
side note: his foot with the amputated toes has a longer medical history than my entire life.	0
it's kind of irrelevant now, since he's bed bound.....but my point is my life was stagnate and i was starting to burnout with no end in sight.	0
until... my older sister and her boyfriend decided to move back home to help me out.	0
i was excited to have some help and maybe enjoy my youth.	0
maybe find a job related to my degree instead of a part-time job (which i enjoyed a lot but wanted to move on from)...and then my dad had his stroke.	0
they're still moving back!	0
in fact my sister is here already to help out....but she's working from home and now i am our dad's full time caregiver.	0
i volunteered because i love my dad and i can do this.	0
we also didn't really have a choice because no care facility in my state would take him.	0
i quit my job, and take care of him all day and all night.	0
i'm stretched so thin i don't have the emotional capacity to deal with anything else.	0
which is awful!	0
my boyfriend and his family are going through their own trials, and i feel awful i can't support him more.	0
we've been together for 6 years.	0
his family is my family.	0
and my boyfriend is so stressed about my dad and his family, that he's constantly angry and/or depressed.	0
i don't know what to do anymore.	0
i just want everything to be okay.	0
i want everything to be normal but it can't be.	0
my dad can't move half his body.	0
he can't have anything by mouth.	0
his care and therapy are my priority.	0
but i don't want it to be.	0
i'm just so tired all the time.	0
and i feel guilty for not giving dad my undivided attention.	0
i feel awful for neglecting my boyfriend, who has always supported me.	0
i feel like my stress just adda to his stress.	0
i'm in therapy but it can only help so much.	0
i just....i don't know.	0
i'm scared.	0
i'm angry.	0
i'm sad.	0
i'm not even sure why i'm posting this.	0
to vent?	0
to ask for advice?	0
to seek validation?	0
i don't know.	0
i don't know what to do anymore.	0
all i know i can do right now is take care of my dad.	0
5 years in, these are the most useful pieces of caregiving advice i've received:     keep going   support not smother  stop correcting your mom   perfect is the enemy of the good   people want to help.	0
ask for it no matter what.	0
practical to philosophical, i come back to most of them daily.	0
what's the best advice you've been given?	0
hello!	0
i am a researcher with usf health, and we are currently preparing to release some of our treatments to the market.	0
however, we were given a grant by the national science foundation that required us to interview anybody affected by the dementia, whether directly or indirectly.	0
would anybody be interested in participating?	0
it would only be a few questions	0
[removed]	0
my mom was transferred for her quarantine in a different care place.	0
and at this place, they ask you to come in 15 minutes early to show you how to get dressed and all.	0
first of all, it took like 45 minutes because she kept talking to other people.	0
then at some point she goes, when i saw your mothers name on the list i got so scared, i know someone with the same name and i was like no way impossible!	0
but then i saw your mom and i was so relieved.	0
what the fuck?	0
am i crazy or thats just not something you say?	0
hey fyi i was so happy to hear your moms sick and not my friend.	0
fuck you?	0
i just looked at her dead in the eyes and didnt answer her on that or anything else.	0
i just stopped talking.	0
i cant believe this, it made me so sad.	0
i just needed to rant this somewhere :(	0
my dad just accused me of moving my daughter with special needs into his office without asking.	0
i wont even change a wall hanging without asking, much less remove all of his belongings out and moving all of hers in!	0
(they are directly across the hall from one another) i just tried to keep it moving, but then i told him i always respect him and his house.	0
after stepping away for a moment, i came back and asked him if i'm so disrespectful to him did he want us to move out.	0
after waiting a bit,i told him to answer me!	0
he finally said no.	0
its unfathomable to me that i'm speaking like this to my dad, whom i have always loved.his rns words regularly ring in my ears- once a man, twice a child.	0
for anyone interested in overcoming quarantine difficulties for their elderly parents i shared a solution for my 97yr old grandma that allowed people to reliably visit with her during the pandemic while she was in a nursing home.	0
the solution is also an excellent way to increase frequency of visits for extremely limited elderly.	0
i can't cross post it here, because picture posts are not allowed on this subreddit, but you can find the original post by following this link.	0
i have come to realize that those cute retro kitchen appliances can cause problems for folks with dementia.	0
they function fine, but my mother becomes convinced they are actually from the 1940-1960s, an era her mind is already focused on, which generates a lot of confusion regarding long-dead family members, anxiety about safety concerns, & not-so-good ideas (thinking they are valuable antiques) that can overwhelm the day and distract her from enjoyable activities.	0
"it's just a small thing, but i have found the day goes much more smoothly when the toaster is clearly modern & the stove is labeled ""purchased 2005."""	0
thought i would share in case it's helpful.	0
hello, after struggling with myself for years i finally reached the conclusion that my life's purpose is to work as a caregiver, i am a 28 year old guy who graduated from architecture school and i know nothing about the science of caregiving... i am willing to learn and take diplomas in nursing, psychology, social work or other things, but i don't know what would be beneficial for me as a caregiver... can you please recommend certain diplomas i should take, resources i can learn from, books, movies, courses, etc.	0
preferably free because my financial status is not so good right now?	0
are there online courses or college diplomas that i can take on edx or something?	0
i need guidance please.	0
thanks in advance.	0

my working memory has declined as well as my ability to retain information and recall information.	0
there may be some things i find really interesting but don't remember longterm, even if i want to (granted after i heard them once, still) wha baffles me the most though is that i quite frequently can't recall everyday words in casual conversations.	0
this may be works like erazer, ruler or the names of musicians i certainly do know.	0
i am not very forgetful in general when it comes to leaving my house with all my stuff etc...  any information you can share with me?	0

i 23 (f) have been caring for my grandma since i was 16. she lived by herself until i had to suddenly move her into a nursing home last year.	0
for about 6/7 years, i took care of her errands/doctors visits at least once a week.	0
whenever i had travel plans, i would arrange a neighbor or friend to bring her food and her meds.	0
around the time the pandemic hit last year, i had to go over 2-4 times a week (she lived an hour away) to meal prep and take care of her daily needs.	0
i was paid in lunch meals and coffee.	0
she never really learned english, became a retired housewife at 40, and hasnt driven a car in 5 decades.	0
so when my grandpa passed away several years ago, she became completely reliant on me, even though i had to finish high school, started college, worked 30+ hours a week in 3 part time jobs, had internships, finished college early and graduated with a masters degree a semester early too.	0
i thought her decline in cognition was a normal part of aging until she had a diabetic seizure (turns out she wasnt taking her meds like i thought, i think she was tossing them away or something) and the hospital informed me they were diagnosing her with vascular dementia.	0
thank god before things got bad i had her sign a poa and started diving into her finances when she was officially diagnosed with dementia because it occurred to me she maybe wasnt paying her bills.	0
i found huge credit card debits, helocs, loans, no savings etc etc.	0
i also found she stashed her bills into a drawer and was on the verge of having all her services cut off because she simply forgot to pay her bills.	0
i caught her up to date on everything and consolidated her high interest credit card debt and quickly paid it off.	0
now, after her diagnosis, all of her strange habits from about january 2020 - november 2020 made sense.	0
however, she was put in rehab care for her seizure and i had to quickly scramble to figure out what to do.	0
this is where im still having trouble coming to terms with what i had to do.	0
i decided to sell her home of 30 years, the house i sort of grew up in, and most of her possessions because i realized, i could not live in and take care of her daily needs full time.	0
i have zero medical training, and am starting my professional career in a cutthroat field.	0
my student loans prevent me from not working too.	0
well, i was unemployed twice in the middle of everything, but im putting all my remaining energy into finding a new job atm.	0
she also fell in a sticky position where she could not afford a live in caretaker in our state on her social security, but did not financially qualify for assistive services or welfare because her social security is too high... the irony.	0
the other stressor was that her home sold in 11 days, and i had one weekend to sell everything.	0
my grandma couldnt afford an estate sale company, so i spent a solid 72 hours on pure adrenaline selling furniture and all the crap she was semi-hoarding.	0
her extra clothes, photo albums, family docs, and a few china sets are currently piled in my closet.	0
i have now set up her nursing home to be paid for the next three years on private pay thanks to the sale of her home and estate and then she will be on government assistance.	0
she doesnt even remember her home anymore, and thinks shes in 1944 in her home country... its currently wwii.	0
why am i here?	0
i think i was led to this reddit group because im looking for comfort.	0
my grandmas only child, my dad, is incapable of helping because of his addictions.	0
my mom has accompanied me to a few things, and acted as an official translator for my grandmas native language twice, but legally has no role.	0
my sibling is a cancer survivor, and so i cant give her any responsibilities because most of it involves hospitals, and she understandably has severe anxiety around anything medical and is too young to understand the severity of the finances.	0
any other relatives are long dead or assholes living in another country.	0
i wont inherit anything because if anything is left over from the nursing home, it will go straight to my father, who will not be giving the inheritance to us.	0
and even if he wanted to, he owes thousands to debtors who will be seizing it all.	0
sadly my grandparents did not set up any protections for me and my sibling against our dad.	0
yes, i have consulted three separate attorneys.	0
it is too late.	0
my grandmas dementia is getting much worse, but physically she will be living for a long time.	0
she is now seeing her other son who died at birth as a ghostly toddler hanging around her nursing home.	0
she also had a full conversation to something standing next to her the other day when i had a window visit.	0
i have chills thinking about it because she talked into the air, and jumped as if someone had brushed against her.	0
i could see the whole room around her, nobody was there.	0
her face turned different and her eyes were not hers for about 20 seconds.	0
she also sees her mom sitting on her bed every night.	0
thank you for reading.	0

my 83-year-old grandmother pretty much has dementia.	0
she sees two neurologists in two weeks, but one of her former neurosurgeons told me that it sounds like she has dementia and depression.	0
long, long story short, she broke her hip last year one week before covid and quarantine (great timing, right? )	0
and i took care of her full time up until jan. of this year.	0
but she stopped being able to walk at all in december.	0
went to the hospital for what turned out to be gerd, and then was moved to a rehabilitation and care home.	0
she wouldnt do the pt and i could tell that wasnt like her, because she always talked about being able to walk again.	0
then she kept telling me that she walked the day before, or that night, etc.	0
even though they needed a hoyer (sp?)	0
to get her out of bed.	0
so they moved her to another part of the building around the end of january.	0
and since then, she hasnt left the bed.	0
so all of this to say: im stumped as to what to do.	0
we have to provide a phone for her (her old cellphone is nowhere to be found now) or else call and gamble with whether or not the cordless phone is available.	0
and shes not getting any kind of pt or cognitive therapy.	0
so are memory care centers different from regular nursing homes?	0
if so, how?	0
do they work to get her out of bed and just get some sunlight or movement?	0
so i have a friend and he is concerned he might have early onset dementia or something similar.	0
he is a 21 year old healthy male.	0
however during the whole time i have known him ( two years) he has sometimes forgotten what he was talking about mid sentence.	0
now he is doing it more often.	0
he said he noticed himself that over the past few months or so his memory has gotten much worse, he sometimes forgets what he's doing or saying, sometimes someone will tell him something and he will forget it pretty much immediately.	0
he is in school and does okay but it is a struggle for him somewhat, and now he says he is starting to doubt himself because of all of these things.	0
usually he is pretty much fine, but recently when i was at his house i think he forgot what he was doing or something for a few seconds.	0
"i told him "" you're in the kitchen"" and he was like "" oh yeah okay"" and another event that comes to mind was almost a year ago we were at a store shopping and he almost walked out of the store with the item and didn't pay for it."	0
i told him he had to pay for it.	0
there are other examples but yeah.	0
he is concerned he might have early onset dementia or something similar.	0
do you think he could?	0
he is a 21 year old male who doesn't drink or has never done drugs.	0
his grandmother on his mother's side does have dementia.	0
she's in her 70s however.	0
he said he has never had any head injuries.	0
sometimes he will have mood swings or get upset over things that i or most other people i know would not be upset over.	0
he has headaches often.	0
he said he can't remember when the symptoms started.	0
he said he is going to go to the doctor about this soon but i'm just curious as to what you all think this could be.	0
his legs are swollen and his feet are purple.	0
he never- literally never- showers and hes diabetic and incontinent; poop gets on his wounds daily.	0
hes of sound mind so 9/11 wont take him, but often gets angry and swears and screams.	0
wont take medication or see counselor.	0

so my moms social security and pension are going to be paying for the rent/services at a home with a caregiver.	0
she needs 100% of it and is in a ton of debt, i know that credit card companies cant garnish but she owes taxes which i recently learned can be garnished from her ss.	0
is there any help to get rid of this debt with the irs?	0
i can try and make her set up a payment plan but that's still going to be taking quite a bit away.	0
i mean is there a stage where the irs has to back off because she needs somewhere to live?	0
i apologise for the title i didnt know what to write.	0
my 74yr old nan who is suffering from early onset dementia is currently being investigated for leukemia the only problem is she is getting really confused and has no idea what is going on we dont know what to do i'm trying not to look worried/scared in front of her because she knows when something is wrong just by looking at me.	0
hi.	0
first of all just like to say im so glad i found a group for care givers.	0
okay so almost two years ago my grandmother had a stroke.	0
after this stroke my mother took her in.	0
so just a short back story.	0
my grandmother has 4 kids 3 boys and 1 girl (my mother).	0
and my grandmother has 10 grand children.	0
my sister and i were the only grandkids raised by my grandma because my my mother was the unmarried child with almost no help when were growing up.	0
(this information is important for later).	0
to add 95%of the grandkids and my aunts and uncles live within less than 30 mins of my grandmother.	0
and one of my uncles lives one street away from her as well.	0
also none of them have young kids to take care of except two of my 10 cousins.	0
fast forward to my mom taking my grandmother in.	0
for an entire year my mother and i and my sister (who moved back home 10 months ago from living out of state for 15 years) and started helping my mom full time ( my sister decided not to get a job at this time since her husband can support them for now) in september of 2020 my grandmother suffered two additional strokes (so thats 3 since sept 2019) after these last two stokes she is completely disabled where as before she was still able to walk around with minor assistance and needed minimal help with bathing , clothing etc.	0
now she needs 99% help with everything.	0
she can only feed herself and pick up a cup to drink.	0
she is slowly getting dementia.	0
at night she wakes my mother up at all hours to ask her random questions or tell her she is thirsty.	0
which before remember i mentioned she can pick up her cup just fine.	0
(she just like to let my mom know at 3am for some reason) as of right now my mother is the main caregiver.	0
my sister is there from 4am to 11am and from 11am to 4pm we have a family friend who we pay.. (whereas it could be someone from our actual family; but i digress) to take care of her monday- thursday.	0
on friday through sunday 2-3 times a month i drive down to my moms (2 hour drive there and 2 hours back) to help take care of my grandmother and give my mom some relief so she can grocery shop, get some sleep or just do any of the menial activities she wants to do for herself.	0
my question is, are any of you experiencing that its just a few people wanting to pitch in to help take care of the loved one?	0
out of all of the other 8 grandkids only 1 has come to visit her since shes been sick this whole time.	0
they dont call her or even ask me about her on social media.	0
its frustrating and tiresome.	0
my sister , mother and i fear that we will be the ones to blame if she ever has to go to a nursing home because the family will resent us for it.	0
this is the main resin why we have endured it for so long.	0
also to add my grandmother is becoming emotionally abusive to my mom.	0
calling her a liar and trying to make it seem like shes not caring for her like she should.	0
making comments like i wouldnt do this to you (when my mom doesnt coming running to her when she screams her name 20x in 2 mins for her to ask her to put her head up and down in the hospital bed) its really a lot and so much to explain.	0
hope the information makes sense  tldr: my mother, sister and i are solely taking care of my ill grandmother and feel stuck because other family members wont pitch in.	0
where to start... they were all set to move into assisted living when it is completed sometime in april when mom fell and broke her hip while walking their dogs.	0
she had surgery and was then moves to a closed rehab center close to their intended new home.	0
due to the pandemic, nobody can go inside to visit and she is doing horribly in isolation.	0
she is having hallucinations, delusions, aggression, and depression.	0
her husband said she cannot figure out how to charge or answer her phone.	0
when i am able to talk to her on the phone, she gets upset and begs to be taken out, taken home.	0
but she cannot walk yet and they say she is very uncooperative about rehab, getting nowhere.	0
she cannot come home until she does the rehab because her husband has physical problems and won't be able to give her the kind of help she will need.	0
but she can't do the rehab because her mental condition is taking over.	0
it is a mess!	0
they both got one vaccine shot now, but there is no end to the isolation in sight.	0
she saw an entire family with children in her facility, and is livid that she can't get out or any of her people get in.	0
there is no explaining to her that they were there for last rights/compassionate visit.	0
anyway, my question is, have any of you seen a loved one spiral so quickly out of reality and be able to come back if the environment improved?	0
we are hoping once she is with her husband again that she can stabilize, but it's all unknown and we want her to be safe.	0
my dad has dementia and lives alone.	0
he doesn't consistently take his meds and we think he forgets to eat.	0
i have power of attorney and we are going to move him to assisted living.	0
in the past, talks of him moving made him angry and resentful to me.	0
the facility we are moving him to advice was not to talk about the move or pack in front of him because it will just give him anxiety.	0
the plan right now is on moving day, take him out to eat breakfast and play with my daughter while other family packs up.	0
we then have a 2 hours drive to the facility.	0
should i say something that morning?	0
"""dad you're moving today"" wait until we are on the car ride there?"	0
wait until we are inside and he sees his stuff in his new room?	0
what are your experiences with moving someone who does not want to be moved?	0
my husband & i work in different cities.	0
his dad is 95 & lives in assisted living.	0
he loves his dad (so do i) but is finding it really difficult to keep caring for him because of the dementia.	0
before the pandemonium he used to visit dad daily (he lives within walking distance) & they talked on the phone like 5x a day.	0
he'd take dad to eat out etc.	0
but now, with the safety restrictions, he only gets to talk by phone or else he goes to the parking lot to wave at his window while they talk.	0
thing is, my fil goes through long spells of being super angry, where he is extremely combative, raves like a lunatic & yells horribly racist stuff (note that most of the home's staff & medical people are people of color!)	0
and he also will call my husband repeatedly to report conspiracy theories and saying stuff like people are coming into my room and eating my food (cos his short term memory is gone so he cant remember he ate his own food).	0
he also gets physically violent, like waving his cane around etc., looking for his gun (which we took away years ago) cos he was gonna shoot all these <insert racist words>.	0
it's gotten so bad that they have threatened to kick him out.	0
there's also where he rants about his late wife (died 2 years ago & also had dementia) being a lying whore etc., as if she is still alive.	0
he calls demanding to know where she is and then says he's divorcing her etc.	0
this is the one that really traumatizes my husband.	0
his mom was super sweet while his dad was always kind of a narcissistic asshole most of his life.	0
he has his charming moments of course, and fil has never been mean to me or our kids.	0
but that only makes it harder to deal with his assholery.	0
it's like being in an abusive relationship.	0
so my husband is all sorts of triggered when this happens.	0
i can see the stress is killing him and really seriously affecting his mental health.	0
but he is the only child and theres no one else, really, who can take care of his dad.	0
i commiserate but it feels like nothing helps.	0
we have no idea where to turn for advice or help.	0
the geriatric doctor seems to only prescribe meds and is  rather useless in terms of overall guidance regarding the situation.	0
my dad spends time in front of the mirror talking to himself about random things.	0
it's not every day but most days.	0
cant find the bathroom.	0
doesn't understand most things i say.	0
from your experience how long before there's no one home up there anymore.	0
he requires assistance with everything et this point	0
my father seems to have rapidly progressing lewy body dementia and i have no clue what to do.	0
he only occasionally deals with lack of motor skills and laspes in memory (this is very slowly getting worse) but his hallucinations are now often and they get bad.	0
he often hallucinates that there are people around the house trying to break in, or that there are people across the street throwing rocks at our house.	0
he's however only 55 and still fairly active so whenever these hallucinations happen he insists that he tries to take care of the situation himself.	0
this causes him to almost never sleep (he averages only a few hours of sleep a day, sometimes none) which then makes the hallucinations even worse.	0
one time i even saw on one of our security cameras that he was throwing rocks and oranges into a neighbor's house because he believed someone was there taunting him.	0
whenever we try to take him to a doctor he fights it and assumes we think he's crazy.	0
i'm only 21 and being kept up all night by him while trying to balance work and school has stressed me out past my limit.	0
is there any way i could get a diagnosis or treatment for him here in the us without it being painfully obvious that we're saying he has dementia?	0
my mother is 72  years old and my brother is expecting  my mother whose 70 to go to their house and watch his one year old alone.	0
during covid my brother and wife never left the house let alone their child.	0
now that they have both have to go back to work they expect my mother to watch the kid al day at their house my mother is getting up in age has not been alone with the kid at all.	0
i think its not smarter safe  shes by herself with the child in case something happens.	0
my brother and wife are too self absorbed to understand shes getting up their in age and it could be very taxing on her to do this alone when the baby is starting to walk and has a lot of energy.	0
if she  says no i know my mother and shell feel guilty like shes a bad grandma .	0
i feel like i have constantly step in and intervene on the  behalf of my parents.	0
any advice would be appreciated	0

i just got hired as a companion for the elderly.	0
it's like a professional caregiver but without any medical experience.	0
has anyone been a companion, or had a similar job that could let me know what to expect?	0
im really nervous because this is my first job in the field.	0
thank you!	0
hi all.	0
my grandmother has been slowly losing her mobility ever since she came out of the hospital after an extended stay in standard care.	0
imo, the hospital shouldn't have put her in standard care since she was incapable of feeding herself but that's another story.	0
she went to rehab at a care facility and was released in august of last year.	0
at first she was capable of getting up on her own, balancing, even walking to bed some days, but within the last couple of months has completely backslid into near immobility.	0
she can't balance to stand up, she doesn't realize when she's going to the bathroom, so it's basically transfers from bed to a portable commode, to the wheelchair, to a recliner in the mornings and reverse order for bed.	0
what i could use help with is dressing her.	0
she can stand, but doesn't balance herself and leans so far back that she has to be held up.	0
this makes it almost impossible for one person to get her dressed (and clean her up if there's a major accident).	0
if i could find something that would help her stand and to help hold her up, then it wouldn't be such a major hassle to get her pants on.	0
so i basically need to learn how to handle someone who is wheelchair bound.	0
anyone know of any devices to help her stand up (walker doesn't work) or any lifestyle changes we can make to help get her pants on?	0
my dad [82][m] 130ish pounds, has congestive heart failure that started causing him to be short of breath about 4 months ago.	0
it took about a month to figure out that he had heart valve leakage but the cardiologist said his heart was otherwise strong and he was put on a mild diuretic treatment 4 pills a week.	0
around this time, he started having issues with his chronic bronchitis as well so his other doctor gave him antibiotics and steroids for that and for a month he was doing really well.	0
with his own breath he was able to walk short distances, etc.	0
and manage it but once the antibiotics and steroids ran out, his lungs got pretty bad and he started gaining fluids not just in his lungs but his feet and by the time they increased the diuretics, it was an emergency situation and he was admitted to the hospital.	0
in the hospital, it was discovered that he had a blood clot in his lungs which from my understanding has the exact same symptoms as chf and  he likely got a few weeks earlier, i'm guessing because he was sitting and not moving due to not being able to breathe well and the combination of the two really did a number on his breathing.	0
they put him on lasix (he was on bumex before), really strong blood thinners, and of course oxygen.	0
after 3 days, the swelling in his legs were completely gone and they were drying out his lungs making him pee pretty much every hour and giving him something in a nebulizer.	0
his breathing was much better but he would cough up little pieces of blood now and then... kind of gross but he would feel a lot better later.	0
after 3 weeks in the hospital, he was somewhat weak but the blood clot was gone, his oxygen levels were higher, and the doctor was planning on discharging him and ordering an oxygen generator and nebulizer for him at home, but then he found out that he lived alone and changed his mind and recommended a temporary snf for rehab.	0
the key word was temporary because at this time, none of us are ready for a longterm facility even if we could afford it...which we can't.	0
the doctor's concern was that if he had a fall, due to his blood thinners and if he were to have a fall, he couldn't stop bleeding and nobody could help him.	0
he said 2-3 weeks and since medicare covers the first 20 days fully, we all agreed that this was best.	0
during his stay he has been getting some hardcore rehab and is able to walk to the bathroom, shower, etc.	0
and even take off the oxygen and breathe on his own if he's not being active.	0
he can also walk with a rolling walker for 50 feet at a time, take a brief rest, and walk another 50 feet.	0
during his care conference, everybody there agreed that he was getting stronger and the plan has always been to discharge him with oxygen at home and perhaps even allow in-home care a couple of times a week or whatever they recommend/medicare pays for.	0
we would take care of his chores like cleaning, shopping, etc.	0
here is the issue: he still gets fluid build up in his lungs.	0
it seems to be a combination of his old bronchitis (his lungs apparently have some scarring) and the chf.	0
when that happens, they give him an extra water pill and limit his water along with the nebulizer and he's fine again.	0
last week, they said that they had a discharge date set up for him to be next thursday which would have been the 23rd day he was there which means he would have to pay 3 days at $186 himself for the copay since after 20 days, it's no longer fully covered.	0
since he wants to go home badly, we asked if the extra 3 days really would make a difference and the social worker checked with the staff and said, we could take him back on monday....once the doctor signs off on it.	0
as soon as he did that, they would set up the oxygen machine delivery, give us the list of his meds, etc.	0
as you guessed it, today the doctor saw him (after 5 days of not seeing him) and said that he still had fluid in his lungs and was too weak so he wasn't going to send him home on monday.	0
he's had him under his care for 6 weeks now so i don't understand what is he looking for.	0
he will always have some fluid build up because of the chf but they've been managing that and whatever treatment they can do there he can do at home so i really don't know what's going to happen.	0
i will call his office on monday and see what the longterm goal is.	0
if it ends up being an extra few days then fine, but again money is an issue and $185 a day adds up really fast.	0
i really don't know what to do here if the doctor wants to keep him there indefinitely.	0
"his cardiologist who has also visited him there doesn't seem concerned - ""just make an appointment with me when you're discharged"" he said while he was still in the hospital."	0
he also has his primary care physician who has been out of the loop for 6 weeks.	0
our goal has been to do the home care and let him get a little stronger at home for 60 days and let all the medicare stuff to reset and then try to look at options like valve replacement.	0
"i asked this sub for an ""endgame"" when he first went to the hospital and someone on here said that with chf, it will just keep getting worse until they can't control the fluid anymore and to essentially start looking to find a longterm nursing place for him now and wait for him to die."	0
i was completely devastated by that answer yet appreciated the honesty but i feel he has a couple of more years left in him and in the last 2 weeks of the snf, they haven't done anything for him that we and him can't do at home.	0
if the doctor refuses to discharge him some time next week, can we go above his head somehow?	0
the nursing facility seemed ok with him being released.	0
again, i don't know what he's planning but it seems like its completely open ended and he expects him to be 100% ok before going home.	0
"moms dementia seems to be the worse at night and she try's to get up and go to the bathroom, she has trouble with ""safety awareness'""  and try's to walk instead of using her chair."	0
i have half rails on the bed and got her a bedside commode but she forgets it's there.	0
i'm also using a baby monitor so she can call me a night to come help her but she forgets about that too.	0
last night i woke up randomly at 1:30am and checked the monitor just in time to catch her trying to walk to the bathroom.	0
"i've also put big signs on the wall across from her bed that say ""stop"" ""call for help""."	0
does anyone have any ideas of other things i could do?	0
i feel like she is one more fall away from a permanent nursing home and she really does not want that.	0
i feel like she has the perfect storm of ailments going on, she's very unstable and her dementia makes her forget she's unstable.	0

my grandmother has dementia, she is refusing to go to the doctor and get the test that will let us help her deal with this.	0
her mother and a few siblings have had dementia & all of her symptoms are clearly dementia.	0
i moved in with her and my grandfather to help them.	0
the rest of the family is very rude and selfish and in my opinion takes advantage of her situation.	0
i do my best to be there for her & help her without her feeling like someone is babying her but she gets very angry when i have stopped her from doing unsafe things.	0
my grandfather has checked out and they havent gotten along for years anyway and theyre so nasty to each other, its exhausting.	0
the whole situation has left me unable to live my life and for the time thats ok but i dont know when it will be time to leave or realize i cant help anymore.	0
im so worried that if i leave i could have prevented something from happening since no one else is really looking out for her.	0
she also lies a lot, especially at doctors appointments and when they ask how shes doing.	0
its almost like she prepares herself for an appointment so they wont see something is going wrong with her mental health.	0
i have no support through this except for talking to a friend of mine but tbh i am hanging on by a thread.	0
i am so tired and exhausted and i try not to think about it because i dont want to be selfish and im here for her but its getting very hard.	0
hello all.	0
i hope the day is treating everyone well.	0
today is rough for me.	0
to put an extremely long story short, i'm 22 and i've been the primary caretaker for my mother, 46, since dec '17, though i've been technically helping care for her health since '12 (yes, i've been caring for her since i was a child).	0
it's been a lot, so much so that i've tried writing a short summary of the important bits 3 times but each time there's just so much to write, even if i leave stuff out lol.	0
she's non weight bearing on her right leg, she has osteoporosis, pkd and is a dialysis patient and has sleep apnea.	0
i help her with moving around, i cook for her (keeping in mind her dietary restrictions), make sure she's taking her meds, and get her anything she needs, big or small (and she always seems like she need something).	0
i am also her main emotional support (have been since i was young as my father left real early) which is extremely difficult for me because i have multiple mental illnesses (some of which is from abuse from her, funny how life works i guess) and i manage mental health poorly.	0
aside from that, she's a difficult person for me to be around.	0
"she's always been very ""my way or the highway"", she'll throw tantrums if i don't do things how she wants or if im not happy and don't want to socialize much (she's very extroverted and im very introverted)."	0
she'll make a mess, yell and scream and throw things around or at me.	0
she's always been like that but i think because her mental health is poorer due to her physical health, it's gotten a little worse.	0
i try to bite my tongue and do what she wants as much as possible now.	0
she's rarely understanding of how i'm feeling, always taking it personal and then getting upset, trying to guilt trip me even.	0
shes also very manipulative.	0
again, has been since i was a child but she's my mom and she's ill so even though i see her tactics, i can't help but fall victim still.	0
theres so much more there but i feel like im writing too much lol.	0
overall, i feel hopeless and alone.	0
i feel exhausted, mentally and physically.	0
i feel done but i can never really be.	0
i want to give up but i know i won't.	0
she knows i won't.	0
i have very little support, im managing my own life very poorly.	0
it's all just too much and today it's been hitting me hard.	0
it's currently midnight, where i am.	0
my bedroom is right next to my parents'.	0
an hour ago, i saw my father come out of the room.	0
i was assuming he's just wandering again, but approached him anyway and tried to ask what he wants.	0
usually, i just let him wander around the house, then after five minutes.	0
i'll guide him back to his room.	0
our house is locked for the night, and it's only one story, so there's less hazard to him.	0
before i could do so, i saw him sweating.	0
which was weird, considering he came out of an air conditioned room.	0
as a diabetic myself, i know the symptoms for hypoglycemia.	0
one of them is sweating.	0
i connected all the dots, and grabbed the glucose meter right away.	0
took his glucose, and the meter came back with a 31. yup, sure enough.	0
his blood sugar is very low.	0
(if glucose level is less than 70, that's very low btw).	0
then i proceeded to give him some banana bread, after 15 minutes.	0
i've checked his glucose and it dropped to 29. so, i gave him some more banana bread, and added a cup of warm chocolate drink.	0
after 30 minute, i've checked his glucose again, and thankfully it is now at 80 as we speak.	0
good thing, i'm still up (every one else are asleep) at this hour.	0
if i were also asleep, we might find him unconscious tomorrow morning.	0
i'm guessing, he doesn't know how to say that he's having symptoms for hypoglycemia?	0
so yeah... that was a close call!	0
i'm in a low place right now.	0
i can't do this anymore.	0
we're 5 years past her diagnosis of vascular dementia.	0
the daily stress of thinking of her and worrying about her and wondering if i'm doing the right thing and how long will her money last her.	0
and what happens when the money runs out?	0
how do i care for her then?	0
what makes this the absolute worst is that i love her so very very much and the feeling of wanting to be free from the burden of her care makes me feel so conflicted and filled with self-hate.	0
her dementia is caused by a lifetime of high blood pressure, so i have no idea how long her journey will be with this horrible disease or what her progression will look like.	0
most online guides say the average lifespan after diagnosis is 5 years but that's due to so many people with vascular dementia having issues with strokes.	0
the pattern of progression is also different for her because it's not step-wise, it's gradual.	0
i have no idea how far along she is.	0
i thought she was in stage 6 or stage 7 but now don't know.	0
she's talking pretty well still, can still remember some things pretty well, but she's mostly incontinent and sits in a wheelchair and scoots herself along with her feet.	0
she sleeps a lot.	0
she can't get herself out of bed alone but she can still feed herself and drink on her own with a straw.	0
so many of her symptoms are contradictory - i don't know how to prepare or what to prepare for.	0
i'm in my 30's, she's in her 90's.	0
i have a full time job and a young family and worry about all of them and the issues in my own life too.	0
most of all, she's unhappy and says she's ready to meet jesus.	0
we both just want to be free.	0
[removed]	0
my mom is currently in the end stages of dementia and i'm so tired of being told i need to be more thankful for the fact that she is alive and it could be worse.	0
i don't even want her to be alive.	0
i don't even want to be alive anymore.	0
why aren't i allowed to be sad and grieve?	0
why does everyone feel the need to compare my situation to others and tell me i am wrong for my feelings?	0
i'm so tired of being isolated and have no support from anyone.	0
initially i wanted to write another rant, as many of us do here, because it's one of the last things that helps us retain some sanity.	0
i still do, but for now i wanted to say to all of you all the things you'd like to hear, probably, because i know i would, so it'll be a bit talking to myself too.	0
first of all, thank you for all you've done for the people you care for.	0
thank you for all the sleepless nights, all the moments when your love won with the wish to just throw things and get out.	0
thank you for having patience with all that's happening.	0
thank you for everything you do that usually would take 5 people and their assistants, and you do it on your own, without any recognition, although you deserve all of it.	0
i recognize you.	0
i appreciate all the super hard work you're doing everyday.	0
i want you to know that it's priceless, and i wish you'll get all the good karma, all the good news, all the strength and power you deserve after all that you're doing and have done.	0
and i want you to hear the apologies, and even though i'm not the one who should, i'll try.	0
i want to apologize for all the shit you have to deal with.	0
all the appreciation you didn't receive, i'm sorry.	0
all the shit you've heard and picked up, i'm sorry.	0
all the complaints you didn't deserve, i'm sorry.	0
all the insults you've heard, i'm sorry.	0
all the bad things that you didn't deserve, i'm sorry.	0
you can have worse days.	0
you can not operate on full blast every day.	0
you can feel weak and sad whenever you feel like it.	0
you're doing your best, your stellar job, even if you don't feel like you do.	0
you deal with the situation you've been given as good as you can.	0
the world is a tiny bit better place because of you.	0
not many people are in out shoes, and hopefully we'll find, as a humanity, solutions to the stuff that we deal with, be it physical, spiritual, mental, or combination of those.	0
please be gentle to yourself.	0
you deserve all the love, you pour your heart out and sometimes you may feel you have nothing left for yourself.	0
i hope this message will be a tiny boost during your boss fight.	0
i hope everything will be good for you and people you take care of.	0
you're a magnificent person.	0
thank you, and all the love.	0

ive been taking care of my partner whenever they experience flare ups of an undiagnosed chronic illness.	0
its extremely exhausting for me listening to them vomit all day and wondering what i can do to help when theres really very little i can do.	0
im so tired of cleaning up disgusting vomit.	0
i feel physically ill because of what i hear and see.	0
i cant sleep in the bedroom when they have a flare up because its so distressing.	0
yet i feel incredibly guilty for sleeping on the couch and not being there every second to look after them.	0
its robbing me of romantic feelings towards them.	0
i have no idea how long i can do this for because its so far beyond what i signed up for when we moved in together.	0
i dont feel like they are grateful for me and i dont feel like theres any room for me to explain to them the impact their illness has on me, because what would the point be?	0
im at the end of my rope and i dont want to vent to my friends and family about this so here i am.	0
thank you for your support and for reading this.	0
every once in a while ill pop in to see how others cope with a loved one dealing with dementia.	0
i really dont know how you guys do it.	0
i am newer to this sub.	0
i only discovered that my mom has lewy body dementia a couple weeks ago.	0
i havent had contact with her in years due to her being an abusive drug addict.	0
i ran away as far as i could when i got the chance and i never looked back.	0
now the state will be taking guardianship over her.	0
i wasnt sure if i should reopen the door to my past and i still am unsure.	0
i told my supervisor id be taking some time off of work to go visit her ( i live in a different state) and now i cant get myself to actually go.	0
i coward away from the truth anytime her condition starts to creep into my mind.	0
today it got the better of me and i read many of your posts.	0
i just cant believe how strong you guys are.	0
some of you even taking care of them from home.	0
i guess i feel like such a coward because i could never do what you guys do, i cant even woman up and face my mother.	0
i wish you all the best	0
my father is 73 and a life long sufferer of anxiety and ptsd since serving in the vietnam war in 1968. he had a really hard time coping for many years.	0
i was born in 1985 making me 35, and he 73 years old.	0
tonight, my dad told me since he got his covid vaccine that he has had a very difficult time remembering things.	0
i asked him for examples, and he said that he couldn't remember his pin for his bank last week, and another small instance that he couldn't remember.	0
a few months ago, we were having a phone conversation and he insisted that it was november but it was february.	0
at the time, this was obviously extremely concerning.	0
i lived a thousand miles away for 3 years.	0
i just moved home to be 4 hours away and much closer.	0
i am his only child so there is a huge amount of responsibility involved on my end to care for him.	0
my dad has always been the most important person in my life.	0
he is seeing his doctor in a other week for a professional diagnosis.	0
i am terrified.	0
he does not seem to have serious issues as of right now, but i have concerns he will progress in to serious health issues.	0
looking for general advice from those that have been here.	0
he seems generally okay and hopefully just has normal old people issues.	0
i love him so much and i'm terrified he will not be around to meet my eventual kids or that this will be a financial burden i am not able to bear.	0
he has always been a hypochondriac and i also think this may be nothing and just paranoia over getting vaccinated since he stated that it only showed up after getting his first shot.	0
i don't believe severe dementia shows up over night.	0
help me, please.	0
i'm so sad.	0
brief background: i (31f) was my wheelchair-bound mother's (64) full time caregiver for about five years until she passed away suddenly (unconfirmed covid) in february, 2020. because i needed to find new work quickly, with no savings to fall back onto, i signed up to be a caregiver with a home health agency.	0
i've been bounced to a handful of clients, some great and some not so great.	0
currently i care for 2 clients, one ongoing for two 10 hour shifts, and one hospice (in other words, short term) for three 12 hour shifts.	0
this means my work week is 56 hours!!	0
it is f**king exhausting, and still not enough to pay my bills.	0
i feel stuck in a huge way, but lacking the time and energy to pursue anything new.	0
i'm woefully lacking in healthy methods of self care, and in the last 6 years, have developed some self destructive ways of coping.	0
last week i joined a bereavement group that meets twice a month over zoom.	0
i hope this will help me to stop bursting into tears at work, anytime i'm reminded of my mom.	0
my older sister (43) is taking classes to be a death doula.	0
i see this as her taking the academic route to examining her grief, while i've elected to take the hands on route.	0
i wonder which of us will come out stronger on the other end?	0
hehe.	0
alright i'd love to hear from you all.	0
tell me what's up in your worlds?	0
my 69 year old father is seemingly so afraid of being alone that he will accept very bad behavior from his girlfriends.	0
im only posting about this now because he announced that he is going to marry his current girlfriend.	0
theyve only been dating 3 or 4 months.	0
i was very happy at first with this girlfriend because his previous girlfriend used meth and xanax and alcohol on a daily basis.	0
when i would point out that she was obviously high, he was say ive told her i dont like it when she does that but i cant stop her from doing it.	0
i informed him that his grandkids wouldnt be able to come visit while she was living with him unless she got clean, he got very angry and told me i was being ridiculous.	0
this newer girlfriend seemed like an big improvement until she wasnt.	0
they had a breakup for a few days (less than a week).	0
during the breakup she slept with another man from a bar my dad frequents quite often.	0
the day they got back together they went to this bar to shoot in a pool tournament and the guy she slept with was there.	0
my dad and his girlfriend ended up getting into a bad argument and my dad left alone and went home.	0
the next morning he got a text from the girlfriends cell number that said it was the girlfriends daughter and she had found her mom dead that morning and found his number in her moms phone.	0
she would let him know more later after she went to give her grandmother the bad news.	0
my dad was devastated.	0
he felt responsible for her death because of the fight.	0
i had never seen him in such bad shape mentally and emotionally.	0
then 2 days later he finds out it was a hoax to make him feel guilty.	0
that was 5 weeks ago.	0
they got back together in the last 2 or 3 weeks and now are planning a wedding.	0
i am so worried that my dad will get hurt very badly.	0
my only hope is that both of dads recent relationships have been extremely volatile and involved constant fights and breakups before yet another reconciliation.	0
he doesnt seem to have any significant mental deficit except for making terrible decisions in regards to girlfriends.	0
both of these girlfriends are at least 20 years younger and cannot support themselves financially.	0
dad helps these girls out financially while all this happens.	0
i dont even know what question i should ask here or maybe this is normal.	0
im just anxious and concerned.	0
i graduated high school a few years ago, and have only worked entry-level jobs in healthcare.	0
i have done some kitchen work at two retirement homes, and i realized that i get along and connect very well with the elderly... especially those with dementia.	0
basically, i'm interested in becoming a caregiver.	0
however, i have some minor health issues, and can comfortably work only 3-6 hours.	0
in addition to that, i weigh very little, and can life no more than 80 pounds.	0
also i'm very slow-paced, and hate fast-paced work (i can still make split-second decisions).	0
what kind of caregiver jobs are right for me?	0
very rarely post on reddit but thought it might be good to join this community to understand other peoples point of view on having a relative with dementia.	0
recently, my mum had a diagnosis of probable lewy body dementia at a young age of 56. im currently 24, and just wanted to ask a few questions to you guys.	0
how much reassurance should i give my mum when she asks about the future of dementia?	0
how honest should i be about what will happen?	0
i struggle with impatience or sometimes anger with the selfish or ungrateful symptoms that occur with dementia.	0
i know its not really her feelings, but how do i avoid being hurt by these behavioural changes?	0
this is a very new diagnosis and we are trialling different medications to help the symptoms but some are reacting badly.	0
how long does it take to find the right medication?	0
im so glad there is somewhere like this where i can talk to others in a similar situation.	0
any tips or answers to these questions are appreciated.	0
thank you	0
uggggh; i really hate losing steps in quality of life  for the rest of my life.	0
beginning last year i lost sensors for the smell and taste of chocolate (boohoo).	0
yesterday realized that i can no longer smell or taste chicken.	0
tastes like eating cardboard.	0

my mom is dealing with her mortality and things aren't looking good health-wise in all likelihood she probably has just a few months left if i had to take an educated guess as her cancer has spread significantly.	0
she's given up all hope and pretty much cries daily.	0
i've suggested counseling which she dismissed.	0
i've given her a toll-free senior helpline number to call and she won't use it.	0
she does belong to a few online support groups but that's not really providing enough comfort for her right now.	0
she's not religious so she doesn't have any religious groups that she can use for support.	0
i am pretty much her only sounding board and it's becoming emotionally draining.	0
do you have any tips on how to deal with this type of situation?	0
how do i comfort her?	0
how do i keep my sanity intact through this whole process?	0
any recommendations would be appreciated.	0
i highly recommend these books with large font and large photos for people living with dementia and caregivers.	0
there are books for veterans, fishermen, cat lovers, faith-based, etc.	0
ive struggled for the past several years to find something to connect with my mom.	0
these books have been the only thing lately to do the trick.	0
best part is?	0
they dont mention in the book theyre curated for people with dementia.	0
my mother is prone to reacting (poorly) whenever she is reminded of the illness.	0
i love these books.	0
buy on amazon for about $10 a book.	0

my grandmother has moderate vascular dementia.	0
i was her primary caregiver for about seven years, and now i share that responsibility with her daughter (my aunt).	0
the three of us moved into a new house together last september, which of course was a major change that took some getting used to.	0
another major change that's happened recently (last november) was a cat joining our family.	0
my grandmother loves this cat.	0
i find them cuddled up together napping on an almost daily basis.	0
she was very, very withdrawn before we got him, and now she is much more engaged and chatty, both with him and with us humans.	0
when she's talking about the cat she speaks more easily and with a wider vocabulary than i've heard from her in years.	0
but it also frustrates the hell out of her that he's a cat, and can't be reasoned with.	0
she gets very upset when he goes places she doesn't want him to go, and she reacts by loudly yelling at him, demanding that he stop.	0
he is, of course, a cat, and doesn't listen, so she just keeps yelling until someone comes to physically remove him.	0
(she has very limited mobility, so she can't get up and move him herself.)	0
even when i or my aunt do come to deal with the cat, it's often only a few minutes until she starts yelling again.	0
often he's not even doing anything wrong - she's yelled at him for not cuddling with her, for sniffing at the front door (she seems to think he can actually open the door and leave), or for hanging out on the stairs, which we have firmly established as his domain.	0
i understand that i can't get her to stop yelling, at the cat or in general.	0
but for various reasons, it's very upsetting to me to hear loud yelling, even if i know it's not directed at me or a reaction to a serious problem.	0
honestly, this is a problem i need to be working on in therapy - but that's not an option at the moment.	0
does anyone have any suggestions for how to tune out her yelling without preventing myself from being able to respond when she actually needs something?	0
or how to accept that it's not my fault and not directed at me?	0
since my dad wont tell me anything and apparently needs to act like nothing is wrong, i want to ask a couple things.	0
he is 94, alzh, dementia, parkinsons and had a stroke about 3 years ago.	0
he went into depression a couple years ago when mom passed.	0
he is narcissistic and mom his enabler so it hit him hard that he lost her.	0
his outlet with friends he cant do anymore as well.	0
there are other things he can do and talks of being engaged with a hobby or reading.	0
but he doesnt try.	0
he sits in front of the tv all day no matter what.	0
what im noticing is he appears to be watching tv but if i walk in and ask what hes watching...his eyes are narrow and unfocused.	0
like he's just a vegetable in front of a tv.	0
then he starts making something up about the movie that makes no sense.	0
this isn't all the time.	0
many days he will actually be engaged with a program or movie and later tell me a bit about it.	0
but like today he fell asleep when i brought him his afternoon snack.	0
he vegged after that.	0
right now hes snoozing in front of a blank tv.	0
it's like he often has no volition of his own.	0
like there's no spark.	0
he will talk about how he's going to do something then it never happens.	0
i know his memory can be bad.	0
last night he was telling y big brother how he wants to do some woodcarving....he has bad tremors.	0
he seldom tells him the truth and acts like hes going to do all these wonderfull things.	0
as a result my brother doesnt listen to me when i tell him how dad really is.	0
bro has no idea whats going on or how bad dad is.	0
but should i try directing his attention?	0
he can never admit theres an issue, even when its very obvious.	0
is his dementia taking his attention and ability to concentrate and focus or is he just having a bad day.	0
thank you	0
the weather has changed.	0
the days have been beautiful.	0
and today the most severe sense of apathy overcame me after an interchange i had with my mother.	0
all i do is care for her.	0
but it's like it's never enough.	0
and when i even try to voice my sadness she brushes it aside.	0
i've always felt no one cared about my feelings.	0
i'm so lonely.	0
it's like a switch went off.	0
she's complained nonstop for the last 3 hours.	0
i've shut down.	0
i don't care about her headache.	0
i'm sick of hearing her nonstop farting.	0
i don't care if she's hot or cold or whatever.	0
i just want to walk out the door and never look back.	0
i hate this house.	0
the weather is beautiful and everyone will start planning vacations.	0
i'll be in this dayum house listening to her fart and complain.	0
when covid struck and everyone was quarantined, it felt like everyone was living in my world.	0
i enjoyed it.	0
i didn't have to hear about everyone's awesome weekend at work because they were doing what i've been doing for 5 years -- locked in their house watching tv.	0
now i'm miserable thinking of everyone in the world leaving me to be locked in this house with her.	0
i have never posted here, but occasionally lurked when i felt like i needed to be reminded that a lot of people have gone through this.	0
especially in the past couple days.	0
thanks in advance for reading this rant.	0
my grandmother is currently dying.	0
somehow, it happened fast and slow at the same time.	0
the last couple days have been fast -- on wednesday morning she was still talking, but by the evening she had lost awareness and only stared into space.	0
it is clear that her soul has already moved on, and her body is working to catch up.	0
her eyes look so dull and lifeless, and she cannot close them, which i think is the worst part.	0
she is moaning and gasping, and then twitching in response to the morphine.	0
it is awful.	0
but it has also felt slow.	0
wednesday night felt like it should have been the end, and every day since then felt even more so.	0
and in the scheme of things -- october was when they told us she was at the end stage.	0
we didn't think she would make it to halloween.	0
and then thanksgiving.	0
and then christmas.	0
every holiday a benchmark, we thought, that she would not reach.	0
"we were certainly happy that she made it each time, especially for christmas, when i asked her if she knew what today was, and she said in the tiniest voice, ""it's christmas."""	0
but at the same time, every holiday she was around for was marked with a sadness.	0
she is not the person she was.	0
she used to live for the holidays and worked so hard to make it special.	0
every holiday she was around for recently consisted of her getting confused and agitated about the slight changes to her schedule, or yelling about the extra people who were around.	0
now it feels slow again.	0
i would sit by her and hold her hand as she takes her last breath, but every breath has seemed like her last for the past 36 hours.	0
which is why i'm posting a rant on reddit, because what else can i do?	0
we are just waiting, waiting, waiting, for the battle to be over.	0
my aunt karen is the wooooooorst.	0
the dryer died and i thought itd be cheaper to buy a new one than fix a 25-year old appliance that weve already fixed 5 times in the last 5 years, but karen just laughed at me and said i clearly dont know how much dryers cost.	0
im an adult woman and this absolute doughnut wants to act like im the dumbest, most irresponsible person shes ever met.	0
she even treats my father (her brother) like that!	0
caregiving would be so much easier if shed butt out, but she just causes everyone in the household stress.	0
literally everyone!	0
ugh.	0
i could go into specifics, but im so emotionally drained from being talked down to that i just wanted to rant.	0
thanks for giving me the space to get it all out, yall.	0
my mom is disabled, copd etc and i recently looked into caretaker options as it would be beneficial to me and her but there only giving me 7.5 hours a week ?	0
like ?	0
at this point i'll take care of her for free.	0
"a year ago my mom, age 71, was diagnosed with ""significant cognitive decline."""	0
she is seeing a neurologist regularly.	0
"she said that the dr won't use the phrase ""dementia"" until after they confirm with an autopsy; that seems really unhelpful to me, but what do i know?"	0
what do i do now?	0
do i start asking questions and writing down life stories?	0
is there a book or a resource you recommend?	0
i feel like i am on a clock and have maybe 15 years left, based on what i've googled.	0
thanks.	0

i'm looking to get some insight on being a caregiver as a full time job for a person, or people, that you aren't related to?	0
meaning working for an agency or going out on your own.	0
just trying to get more understanding.	0
thanks	0
my grandmother (98 with alzheimers) takes a big extended release tablet that cant be cut, crushed or dissolved and doesnt come in suspension form.	0
usually she takes her pills pretty easily, but she cant seem to understand how to swallow them this morning.	0
i tried demonstrating and explaining different ways, i tried putting it in a spoon with some yogurt, i tried pushing it back on her tongue, but she just pockets in her cheek or under her tongue.	0
it took four of her normal glasses of water to get down two other pills and only because they pretty much dissolved in her mouth.	0
does anyone have any tips or tricks?	0
mom's hovering around a six year old.	0
she wont shower, wont change her clothes, wont take off her clothes when she goes to bed.	0
she cant put together a coherent sentence and doesnt know where or who she is most of the time.	0
we're on a family vacation together that involved flying and tbh i dont think it was a smart idea at all to have done this, that threw her off big time (i live in another part of america then them, so they came to visit).	0
i keep asking my dad to call a visiting nurse company to get some help for her but he's just saying i dont know how to integrate this into our lives.	0
i think if there's a nurse full time this might give him some breathing room and some relief.	0
i cant imagine the stress he's going through all the time.	0
i told him you just have to jump right in.	0
am i wrong saying this?	0

yesterday afternoon, i stopped by to see mom in her her assisted living facility.	0
she was moved from independent unit to assisted side in july'20.	0
she has lewy body dementia & parkinson's.	0
she has some good days where she can string together a sentence and then there is yesterday (in 95% of cases, there is no meaningful conversation with her anymore).	0
i walk into her apt and she looks totally frazzled.	0
she had been looking for her key for god knows for many how hours.	0
i walk into her closet and pat her jacket pockets and i found it in 10 seconds.	0
she says she is so glad i came to visit so i ask her to sit down so i can pour her some juice as she looks parched (heat is set at 78 f), her nose starts running so she goes into her room looking for tissue but she forgets why she is there and starts looking for her key again, opening draws and boxes, etc.	0
i have suspicion she may have skipped her lunch while looking for her key.	0
she wants to go take a walk so i dress her with think coat and go downstairs, only to discover supper has started at 4:30 so i had to leave her there to make sure she could eat something.	0
she really belongs to memory care for which we would have to move her to another facility which starts at $8,000/mo vs. current facility at $5,000.	0
current facility is so much better (bigger, and more room to walk around, allowed to walk outside, and more normal living) than memory care.	0
also at $8k/mo, her savings would run out in a few months (no other asset) and there is no 100% guarantee that our state would approve her memory care expense.	0
what would you do in this situation btwn assisted living & memory care?	0
(bringing her home is not an option)	0
recently there have been several family emergencies because my abuela suddenly is nowhere to be found.	0
thank the lord that the neighbors usually spot her before she gets too far.	0
what can my family do to prevent this?	0
i was thinking a child door lock, but i am not sure these will fool her.	0
my dads been living in a nursing home for almost 2 years.	0
i did a window visit on january 9th.	0
he is bedridden and can barely sit himself up or move.	0
he looked like death.	0
he was confused by my visit and when presented with an ipad to do facetime he told me to go away...i had my second child on 2/4 and want to tell him via a card but dont want to make him cry which im told he did last time i sent pictures.	0
my mom is 73. she has always said things to my sisters and i like i know your dad is cheating or your aunt is trying to get money from us  we have heard these things over and over for so many years.	0
the last couple of years things have slowly started getting worse.	0
last year around september she called me and said your dad told me he wants a divorce, he has another woman and he is leaving me i asked questions and then it came out that he never actually said those things.	0
i didnt ask my dad because hes a jerk and i knew he would yell at my mom if he knew she called.	0
at this time i had no idea that my mom was having back pain and im still unclear as to wether she was on pain meds at this time.	0
my sister went and said she was taking medicine and acting bat shit crazy so they went to a different doctor, got different meds that my sister decided my mom couldnt take.	0
my mom ended up getting a spinal block and we thought she would be better (she had a panic attack about a week after she called and told me my dad wanted a divorce).	0
my mom has been having crying spells since at least september where she is just sitting there and starts crying and asking my dad if he wants a divorce and bringing up that she hates his family and different people in his family did this or that to her 50 years ago.	0
she had a very traumatic experience when she was 19 or 20 and shes bringing that up but the story shes always told is now a little different.	0
she passed out about a month ago and she had blocked arteries and had surgery.	0
one was cleared but they couldnt get the other one.	0
these arteries run up her back the surgeon said that could be the cause of the emotions and memory loss (she only has memory loss like my dad will say something to her and 5 minutes later she doesnt remember what he said).	0
the surgery hasnt helped her as far as emotions or anything so now we are trying to figure out how to help her.	0
shes almost having panic attacks because shes so upset.	0
shes lost 30lbs also.	0
shes been to a neurologist and he said she has no dementia and seems fine but they scheduled her a memory test.	0
she also had an mri.	0
im really desperate to help her and i posted on fb and they think its dementia and said i need to get a second opinion.	0
she doesnt go into an episode of thinking she is in her past at all.	0
she just talks about her past as if she just cant let these things go.	0
she doesnt seem to forget her past or even who anyone is.	0
she doesnt forget where she is.	0
she does not remember what the doctors say at her appointments or where she put her glasses.	0
she is on a cholesterol medication and klonopin.	0
she also takes vitamins.	0
i know this is a lot of info but im trying to be thorough.	0
does this sound like dementia?	0
depression and anxiety?	0
could it be that shes just afraid she is getting closer to death and she scared?	0
i just dont know what to do to help her.	0
please, does anyone have a suggestion on how to deal with daily grief?	0
seeing my mother lose her humanity more and more each day is too hard!	0
i don't drink but i wish i did.	0
do you ever feel like people dont appreciate the things you do for them?	0
im unemployed, living with my parents and caring for my mom - cooking, cleaning, walking her to the bathroom every few hours since she has mobility issues.	0
her daycare has been closed for a year (guess why?	0
), and she is never as happy and bubbly with me as she was with her professional caregivers.	0
at home, shes moody, yelling and screaming and crying when she wants something and doesnt get her way.	0
i wonder what ive done wrong, but it never seems to be enough.	0
i feel the caregiver burnout looming daily, but cant hire someone to help.	0
my dad works, but refuses to have a stranger help in the house, even though he sees me struggling to do everything.	0
i try to be positive and buy treats and things for everyone, to get us through the pandemic, but its like nobody cares, or simply takes everything i do for granted.	0
thanks for reading.	0
my mum passed away last month after 4 years since being diagnosed with early onset fronto-temporal dementia.	0
she was only 51 and we loved her and cared for her until the bitter end.	0
i don't think i'll ever be able to articulate into words just how much she meant to me i can only hope that's she's proud of the man i've grown to become.	0
i never participated much in this community but i would always look here for ideas and advice to keep mum happy and active during this time.	0
it was comforting knowing that i wasn't the only one with a close relative going through this and i don't think i can express my gratitude enough to this community, merely for existing i hope as time goes on, i can become more active to help out those of you still confused and worried about friends or family with dementia - i know what it's like to be in that position - as a way of giving back to a community who's already, unknowingly, given me so much.	0
thank you.	0
dad has had bad experiences with his hearing aids.	0
he is at the point where he can change a battery...maybe.	0
but cant clean them or adjust the volume on the handset.	0
they were 2500 each.	0
he had some from the va but for some reason he and the va arent friends anymore.	0
i have taken over cleaning and watching the batteries.	0
when he cranks the tv way up i know to crank his aid volume up on the remote.	0
what im wondering is approx how many years they may last?	0
and when they wear out are the cheaper models near as good or are they junk?	0
thank you	0
this is a continuing account of the process i'm going through as i attempt to get my 90 year old parents to leave the home they've lived in since 1965 and move to a place where they will be more safe and i hope more happy when they make new friends.	0
for those just joining, my parents are really great people but they've been really stubborn in their refusal to move somewhere they'd be safer.	0
everything became more complicated last saturday when my mother fell and had to go to the hospital and have surgery on her hip.	0
they got even more complicated on tuesday when her heart went into afib and she was moved from orthopedics to the cardiac unit.	0
now you're at least a little bit caught up.	0
today mom was back in orthopedics, having moved from the cardiac unit where she spent the day before.	0
her heart had stabilized so she was ready to resume physical therapy from sunday's hip surgery and will be moved to a senior rehab center soon.	0
she was in good spirits, which helped my dad be in a much better mood.	0
a little later dad and i visited our third assisted living facility in the past few weeks.	0
unlike the past two tours, this meeting went great.	0
dad really seemed to like the place and especially enjoyed meeting the people there.	0
i tried not to act too eager for him to like it; it seems in the past when i've done that it causes him to back off.	0
i was there, but not much of a participant in the discussion.	0
"later in the day, i heard my dad on the phone saying things like, ""they have four nurses there, and (my mom) will get attention whenever she needs it."""	0
so he's speaking as if he realizes that the move is coming.	0
i believe he can see that he is not capable of helping mom when she's released from rehab and he doesn't want me to have to continue living here with them for much longer.	0
he has concluded that the move is inevitable, which is a major shift in position for him, and although he hasn't put the money down to reserve the apartment, i think today we took a giant step toward moving my parents.	0
i got home today to find my father's new home aid worker literally cooking (or attempting) to cook spaghetti in a friggen flour tin.	0
red hot burner, water boiling, in a flour tin.	0
i have no idea what went through her head.	0
the pots and pans are not hidden or hard to find.	0
she clearly did not look.	0
she also left all the windows open which is a security risk.	0
i don't even know what else to say.	0
just... wow.	0
i wish i was able to post a picture on here so you all could see exactly how insane it was.	0
my mom is near the end stages of dementia and lately she has seemed to be in distress.	0
the past few years as she has declined she's seemed to have gotten happier and a bit cheerful.	0
it's like suddenly it all changed.	0
lately when i've seen her, over zoom or in person, she just turns her head back and forth while looking concerned and makes noises trying to speak.	0
it is really just awful to watch and i hope she isn't suffering but it sure looks like it.	0
she is on all pureed food, hasn't been able to speak for over 2 years and has been confined to a wheelchair for even longer.	0
i think she's going to die soon but she's only 57 and otherwise healthy and has lived with dementia for over 15 years already so i'm worried this may be dragged out for a while longer.	0
has anyone else witnessed this in someone late stage?	0
glad i found this group in addition to my regular virtual support group and occasional therapist telehealth visit.	0
for about four years my adult kids and i have been dealing with my wifes (their mother) clear cognitive issues, combines with an overwhelming denial and anger when trying to talk about it.	0
refusing to see a doctor, even for other issues such as renewing a statin rx, or an unknown skin lesion.	0
just a horrible situation that were all so sad (and of course frustrated and angry) about.	0
dont see any way out until the inevitable train wreck.	0
our daughter even did an instagram live with a podcaster friend, that with her permission i shared with my wife.	0
last night during a particularly stressed conversation, i did that, with poor results.	0
a few friends have talked to me, but mostly to each other that i eventually hear about.	0
new suggestions would be great, but mostly just to share.	0
thanks	0

my grandmother had dementia and she thought she was a little girl.	0
"she'd always ask ""i want to go home, when can i go home."""	0
"instead of saying you are home, the half truth to get through the day was ""we'll take the bus tomorrow morning and go home."""	0
and that got her through the day, everyday.	0
she has since passed.	0
my dad is a new dementia.	0
it shows on his brain scans.	0
he can totally function, keep a schedule, drive and doesnt get lost etc etc.	0
you wouldnt know anything was up, except every 3-4 weeks he has a major yelling outburst about my husband stealing his tools.	0
no one is stealing his tools.	0
this is an ongoing theme-- now my husband's dad has stolen from him.	0
he'll yell about the thing being stolen.	0
say it's your last chance to give them back, and slam the door.	0
my parents live downstairs.	0
what is a half truth to get through the day?	0
it's not worth it to challenge.	0
so far we've been ignoring it.	0
now it's escalating to calling the cops, telling senators, telling social services.	0
it makes no sense.	0
but is there a half truth to address this?	0
hey everyone.	0
i normally don't promote things for purchase, but this is something that is very important for us as caregivers to address, and i know that its not exactly an affordable option for a lot of us.	0
i stumbled upon this bundle on the humble bundle website today.	0
https://www.humblebundle.com/books/unfck-your-life-microcosm-books  for those unfamiliar with the site, it's legit.	0
i've been using them for a couple of years now (mostly for games).	0
there are three tiers for this bundle, $1 (6 books), $8 (14 books- including the 6 from the previous tier), and $15 (27 books, including all lower tiers).	0
i'm planning on getting this for myself, and i thought that you all could use this information as well.	0
even if you cannot purchase these books, take a look at the list and see if your local library has them in stock!	0
&#x200b; sending hugs to you all!	0
finishing to kill a mockingbird with my 9th graders today.	0
i read it aloud to students (they can choose to read independently or in groups too) and i always well up toward the end, especially when atticus thanks boo for his children.	0
but today, while i was reading scout's imagining of what boo sees from his porch.	0
. . the thought of memories, then the thought of novels/stories in general.	0
. . his whole life, my dad was a self-proclaimed book-worm.	0
now, he struggles with newspaper headlines.	0
his command of language is gone and.	0
. . well, i don't know where i was going with this exactly, but i had to put it out there.	0
thanks for being out there.	0
are you the primary caregiver to a loved one with dementia or alzheimer's?	0

!i'm not anti vax!	0
this is a serious question!	0
my grandma has dementia/alzheimer since almost a year.	0
it was quite stable.	0
missing words, not keeping track of dates and time, repeating the same stories a few times in the same day.	0
she's receiving some medication from geriatric (going to have a next visit soon).	0
the thing is, after first doze of the vaccine her memory seemed to be getting worse (and for ex.	0
she started phoning her daughters at 2am).	0
now she's after the second dose and her cognitive functions are declining rapidly - she's becoming aggressive, very stubborn (will not let us explain her when she's doing something wrong, she knows better), forgets to take her meds, forgets and mixes up things.	0
generally i can notice way more symptoms of alzheimer (i know how they look like, my grandpa had it).	0
all those symptoms started appearing after she received the covid vaccine.	0
i know with alzheimer it can get worse suddenly but i dont know what to think about it.	0
is it just a coincidence?	0
does someone have experience with people with dementia/alzheimer that received the vaccine?	0
did you notice the symptoms getting worse?	0
or maybe you don't think there are any differences?	0
i appreciate all the replies.	0

i'm so beyond my breaking point it's not even okay.	0
so sunday my sister was watching my dad and there was a show on about cookies, my father's a diabetic and unfortunately forgets he eats and will continue to engorge himself and end up with blood sugar scores of like 400. so we had to lock up the sweets, well my sister went to the bathroom and he somehow found some old cookies, chocolate cookies made with blueberry kush distillate, 90% thc.	0
they weren't eaten because the terpenes in the distillate were so overwhelming, and please i really don't need to hear that i need to just keep this stuff locked up.	0
my whole damn house is under lock and key, sometimes things just fall thru the cracks and these things were hella old.	0
well sunday we think around 7 or 8pm is when he got ahold of them, around 9pm he reported feeling dizzy so we checked his sugar but it was normal but still have him a snack and he went to sleep.	0
monday was just scary hell.	0
he woke up and he couldn't even walk.	0
before i go any further and have to fight off all these weed snobs trying to tell me there's no way it lasted as long as it did, my father's health problems include having a shunt in his brain and not getting enough oxygen to his brain as he should, he has heart problems, kidney problems, and numerous mental problems other than the dementia.	0
he was mumbling and hallucinating sort of, like pointing at stuff that wasn't there etc and wasn't enunciating his words as well so i figured maybe it was his shunt failing or a seizure.	0
we gave him his pills but that just made him worse, now remember we had no idea he gotten ahold of some edibles.	0
i called 911 and they took him to the hospital, they did the standard tests and whatnot.	0
few hours later they had me pick him up and i expected to see him back to normal.	0
nope.	0
he started screaming like a bay he had to shit so i had the nurses take him to do that while i read his discharge paperwork.	0
"first page i saw was ""cannabis use disorder"" and thought it was a mistake."	0
"but there was ""reasons being seen today: dehydration & marijuana smoking"" then his labs every drug tested negative except for cannabis and it dawned on me what happened."	0
he was still unable to walk and we put him to bed right at what we think the 24 hour mark would've been of him ingesting it.	0
finally the next day he was back to normal except for feeling a little groggy, and he did lose his balance and fell once.	0
he's been fine since, and yes i did have another post explaining this for those wondering.	0
i had to delete it and rewrite it because some idiots wanted to try and tell me it wasn't possible for my dad to be high after 3 days.	0
then i wasted precious time trying to explain it was technically over a period of two days but only 24 hours, and he still felt weird on the third day.	0
i get this is reddit, but don't try an invalidate the hell i just went thru or take my post as the opportunity to brag about your cannabis knowledge because i'm no noob myself.	0

i'm sick of everyone including my mom.	0
i know it sounds horrible, but it's true.	0
i'm sick of no one listening to me and acting like i don't do enough.	0
i'm sick of my mom whining on the phone to her friends and extended family acting clueless about important stuff when we just discussed it.	0
i'm sick of everyone being condescending and acting like they know more than me when they've literally done nothing to help since she's been home.	0
"""have you considered..."" yes."	0
"""why haven't you...."" i have!"	0
"""actually, you need to..."" no."	0
like, why do they think i'm not taking care of everything?	0
you see she's doing well.	0
you see she's healthy and she has everything she needs.	0
why can't you understand that i am working with her medical team, like????	0
why do you think you know better than me and her doctors???	0
i just wish everyone would just leave me the fuck alone.	0
i need a fucking vacation.	0
uuuugggghhhh.	0
my mother has been in the hospital since january, and before she goes back to a care home, she has to spend some time in quarantine.	0
the place that is used as quarantine where i live, is also the place where my friends mother works.	0
and if she does see my mother i know she will tell her and she will also tell her what disease she has.	0
last time my mom went there was just for a game day with other people and her mom told her literally the same day.	0
and i know its stupid, but i just dont want her to know.	0
because then she asks questions and she wants to talk about it.	0
i think this time, if she does tell my friend ill call in and make a complaint.	0
its a hippa violation.	0
i dont care anymore if she gets in trouble.	0
like i work as a tech for a drug store, if her mom comes in for medications im not gonna tell her???	0
because thats a violation of her privacy.	0
what an ordeal that was, 3 days of things being abnormal.	0
i love with my father, 72, who despite what he says has pretty extensive dementia.	0
so sunday night he was watching a show about cookies with my sister (she also caregiver for him, we all live together so we can always watch him/keep an eye on him).	0
now he's one of those dementia patients who gets violent when you tell them they're not allowed to do something or can't do it; such as he has an obsession about wandering and leaving the house and he obsesses about eating food.	0
the medication that controls his violent fits is what's making him hungry, but he's a type 2 diabetic and he can't just eat junk all the time.	0
my sister and i locked up the sweets.	0
anyways my sis went to the bathroom, my dad did some digging around the kitchen, and found a potent marijuana edible.	0
he took it not realizing it was medicated.	0
around 7pm that evening he mentioned feeling lightheaded so we checked his blood sugar and gave him some food.	0
after a few hours no improvement so he wanted to go to bed, we had to push him in a wheelchair to his bed which is very abnormal as he can still walk.	0
i figured by morning he will be better.	0
wrong!	0
my sis and i had no clue he had an edible the entire time too.	0
he couldn't walk, he was giggling, talking or rather mumbling nonsensical stuff, and was hallucinating so i sent him to the emergency room.	0
i figured ok they'll get him fixed up and they'll figure out what's wrong so when i went to pick him up i was shocked to see him still so fucked up.	0
he started screaming he had to shit so i had the nurses go handle that while i went thru his discharge paperwork like results of his labs and stuff.	0
i notice a page that says cannabis use disorder and i thought maybe the doctor stuck it in there by accident... well his labs even said he tested positive for thc, then it all began to make sense.	0
there were these really old nasty cookie edibles that have been burried under some cabinets for a long time and everyone had forgotten about them.	0
my dad just probably thought oooo something sweet not realizing they were medicated.	0
i can laugh about it now that he's back to normal and there was no harm done, but man was he a major pain in the butt for two days.	0
even the day after the hospital he fell once because he was still tipsy.	0
the edible was made with marijuana distillate which was like 90% thc instead of just making it with  marijuana bud which is usually only like 20% thc so he was bakes for days.	0
i threw the cookies out and went on a mission for finding hidden treasures in the cabinets, that way i can know what we have in all our cabinets and know with certainty he won't get into anything like that again.	0
tw/cw: suicide, self-harm, mental illness, eating for context: my grandmother had a cardiac event on 1/24, discharged from hospital 1/28.	0
since then, i've been living in her house with her and providing 24/7 care.	0
the other two caregivers are here about 70 hours out of the week, while i'm doing about 140 hours a week.	0
she's bedridden and cannot do anything by herself.	0
while this is absolutely no fault of my grandmother's, i haven't been able to take care of myself.	0
this event has changed my entire life -- i'm still paying rent for an apartment i haven't been to in two months, on the brink of losing my job, less than 5 hours of sleep a night, my ed getting more severe, i only have time to shower on weekends, about 28 hours between saturday and sunday to do anything i need to do, depression and adhd and anxiety just whittling away at me.	0
i was having suicidal thoughts before the cardiac event, but was able to put them off for the first bit since i had someone who needed me to take care of them.	0
i've told my mom - one of the other caregivers - these feelings twice and it didn't seem something she was worried about.	0
other personal boundaries or anything i've tried to discuss is essentially ignored or written off.	0
yesterday, things really spiraled after my telehealth appointment.	0
i spend t/w/r/f alone with her until the evening, and my brain just kept strategizing ways to kll myself without her hearing or seeing me, but while keeping her safe in bed until someone else got home.	0
i felt trapped in my brain yet separate from my self in this intense desire; even as someone who has attempted this before, i have never* felt this way in my life and it was terrifying.	0
i gripped an armchair for two hours to stop myself from doing anything until i called my partner for help.	0
i can't keep doing this.	0
i have felt as though i have to because i know i am strong enough to pull my end of the work while the team does theirs (and are clearly overwhelmed by their responsibilities); it feels like no matter what choice i make, i am either 1) putting an unconscienable amount of work on two others or 2) my actions will directly cause her to be put in a facility, which also feels like a death sentence because of covid.	0
i just had so little control yesterday that i fear i can't do this at all anymore.	0
i am going to include part of this statement in a letter to the careteam to send out today -- i have asked for meetings with all of us present or for recommendations on schedule changes for weeks with little to no action from either of them, so i'm going to require a response from both by sunday or i just wont come back sunday evening.	0
i hate, hate, hate feeling like i'm letting my grandmother down, but i just keep remembering the day after i attempted the first time: i was 16, she came over to stay on watch with me, and we watched les miserables (2012) and just held hands.	0
she was heartbroken that i had tried to take my own life, and i feel confident that she would not want me to be in a position where i feel so driven to do it again.	0
thanks to everyone on this sub.	0
you're all incredible people moving through love.	0
i hope that when it comes time for me to return to this situation/be a caregiver for my parents in the future, i will be stronger and have my life better prepared for it.	0
hello, for those who are just joining us, this is the continuing story of my efforts to convince my parents, both 90, to move from the house where they've lived since 1965.  in the most recent post, my mom had fallen and was in the hospital after surgery on her hip.	0
my father had then conceded that moving might be necessary.	0
we were visiting her yesterday when a doctor entered and told us her heart rate was very erratic and troubling to the point they were moving her to cardiac care.	0
today she's better, but there's some damage to the heart.	0
my dad began finally to understand the degree of frailty and openly acknowledged that he couldn't care for her at home, and again, we began to talk about assisted living.	0
but strange things happen.	0
after we got home we got out the bank statements to discuss the financial picture so he could see how they could afford the care, but i looked at his face and could see him glazing over.	0
it was only noon and he was already done for the day.	0
the stress of seeing my mother in the cardiac unit had drained him.	0
tomorrow we are scheduled to see mom early and then go straight to our first meeting at the assisted living.	0
i know that might not sound like great timing, but if mom's condition is fresh in dad's mind, maybe he will be able to envision her getting the level of care she requires, and given her heart troubles, it will help him to see there's a fire station right across the street from this facility.	0
so tomorrow appears to be a very important day in the process of moving my parents.	0
my mom (74) mentioned to me today that her memory has drastically been decreasing lately.	0
she's otherwise healthy but is caring for my dad (81 with parkinsons and dementia) and the stress of caring for him + covid (being isolated from her friends and family) aren't helping at all and i'd love to suggest something easy...even a book i can have delivered to her house or something.	0
much appreciated!	0

i (34f)am doing hospice/pallative care for my grandfather (84m) with stage 7 dementia.	0
he came down with some orbital infection that is not pink eye (we've been on antibiotics for 5 days).	0
my grandmother (80f) wants to take him to the hospital for a check-up since we can not show the dr in detail what is wrong over video appts.	0
she is calling the ambulance tomorrow to take him in.	0
he is non-ambulatory (non-walking) person with astasis (the inability to sit up or move on their own).	0
how do we bring him home without a handicapped van.	0
i live in the metropolitan area of san francisco but am currently in rural maryland and where i live there are transport companies you can call.	0

you are doing a good and kind thing.	0
a thing that can only be made possible by love.	0
my client had a stroke in june of 2020. she has a drop foot from it.	0
she has a physical therapist who comes twice a week.	0
yet she still asks me to work her foot.	0
just basically bending and twisting it to work the muscles.	0
i dont see any improvement and feel it is unnecessary.	0
her physical therapist never even has her take her shoes off.	0
probably because any professional knows she needs to strengthen her muscles above the foot.	0
im sick of handling her sweaty, smelly feet for no reason.	0
how do i tell her i dont get paid enough ($11.50) to perform physical therapy to her?	0
..and its working anyway.	0
because of covid we have to hand him off like an unloved dog at the shelter.	0
hes going to hate us.	0
hes going to curse us out.	0
this is going to suck so bad.	0
the last 2 weeks have been very rough with my mom between her cancer progressing and the outbursts she is having with me.	0
today she received more bad news about her cancer spreading to her hip bone area.	0
i know she is very scared about her situation and has every right to feel that way.	0
she is in pain and slowly losing her independence.	0
i just can't take her mood swings and outbursts and today i reacted poorly.	0
i called her up this evening like i do every evening and she tells me that she is not feeling well.	0
she ate mcdonalds which did not agree with her system and pretty much sent her to the bathroom with massive cramps and such.	0
she knows that she can't eat that stuff because it causes a lot of stomach issues for her but she did so anyway.	0
i will spare you the icky details on that one!	0
all i told her was to make sure she stays hydrated so she does not end up in the er again for dehydration; she was at the hospital last week for it.	0
she started yelling at me yet again and i just could not take it and i yelled at her which is something i normally do not do but i just could not take it.	0
i told her that i was not her punching bag and that i get she is not feeling well but that does not give her the right to treat me this way.	0
she apologized but i felt like shit.	0
i normally stay calm but i just lost it tonight.	0
the last 2 weeks have been awful and i know it is going to get worse.	0
she does not have dementia or a uti.	0
she has been examined and is fine in that respect.	0
she has always been this way but has gotten worse since her cancer has spread.	0
she is becoming more volatile.	0
yesterday i picked her up to take her to a medical appointment and while we were waiting for the elevator in her building she started banging on the elevator door because it was taking so long.	0
i was just floored at her behavior.	0
she has always been impatient but this was just ridiculous.	0
it is like she is turning into a cranky child throwing tantrums.	0
how the hell do i deal with this type of behavior?	0
i feel so overwhelmed now.	0
here's the link to the earliest post from this morning.	0
this has been a god awful day.	0
so my dad was discharged 4 hours after getting checked out at the hospital.	0
they ran some xrays, bloodwork, ct of his head and neck.	0
everything checked out.	0
they say he's good to go and sent us home.	0
he got in the car we chatted like normal.	0
his speech was the same he was reminding me of appointments and things that we have scheduled this week.	0
all was fine.	0
we got home and he walked into the house with his cane just as normal.	0
he had to use the bathroom so that was all set up for him.	0
well once he's done my sister goes in to help him wipe up and get him in the shower.	0
suddenly he tells her that his blood sugar is low.	0
she screams for me to grab some juice.	0
so i bolt to the fridge and grab a cup of juice.	0
now this is very normal in my household.	0
everyone is diabetic except for me.	0
so whenever someone screams my sugar is low you're expected to drop what you're doing and hustle.	0
by the time i get to them my dad loses consciousness and is unresponsive.	0
so we're freaking out and trying to wake him up.	0
he's just completely out of it.	0
my mom who was outside at the time came into the house and i told her what was going on.	0
i then ran to grab his oxygen tank and glucometer.	0
everything was happening so fast.	0
i called 911 and was speaking to them while my family tried to wake my dad.	0
paramedics came got him on the stretcher at which point he was still very much out of it.	0
both of his arms were limp and his eyes were rolled back.	0
he was hardly breathing.	0
anywho so now i'm sitting in the emergency department parking lot waiting for my sister to call with an update.	0

hi there, once again turning to reddit in this journey of my mum being diagnosed  they have finally got neurology seriously involved and they have been wonderful so far, far more helpful in 2 days than the other doctors were in the 5 months she has been in hospital.	0
they told me and my dad that they wanted to do an mri this morning but that my mum was too agitated.	0
i just wondered if anyone knew what the proticol generally is with dementia and mri, do they sometimes put people under anesthetic, or sedation maybe?	0
because even if my mum is having a calmer day, i can't confidently say she would lie still for a full mri scan	0

i write this as i sit in the er a little back story: my dad had a stroke in 2019 that left him weak on his left side.	0
he has since regained a lot of his left leg function but his arm still has no mobility.	0
he uses a quad cane to get around and has been doing fairly well after a rough 16 months of being in and out of the hospital.	0
that is until today.	0
today, like many other days, he decided to walk on his own to get to the bathroom.	0
he asked my mom to take him out at the time she was in the shower and told him to give her a minute while she finished up.	0
my sister and i were asleep on the other side of the house.	0
he has his cell phone on his bedside table for this very reason.	0
we've told him a million times just call us.	0
no matter the time.	0
anyway, so he got up and was able to get to his room door before he fell.	0
he landed on his left side and possibly hit his head.	0
he screamed for my mom who jumped out the shower dripping wet.	0
my mother then screamed for my sister and i. we came running to find him sprawled out on the floor.	0
he's on blood thinners and has a long history of health complications so we called an ambulance.	0
he doesnt seem to be hurt aside from his pride.	0
he has little to no pain but we want to be extra thorough so they're going to do some xrays and a ct.  he hates the hospital.	0
he's had so many bad experiences so hopefully this will deter him from pulling another stunt like this.	0
on top of this he doesnt want to get vaccinated so he's at risk of contracting the virus by being out let alone at a freaking hospital.	0
i'm just so frustrated.	0
i tell him not to walk on his own all the time.	0
i know he's getting better and wants to be more independent but he isnt fully there yet.	0
just another weekly rant.	0
[removed]	0
just a bit of history that's relevant to this post: my mom has had a rough medical history.	0
it got worse as her father was dying, and that led to alot of visits to the er.	0
a lot of it was her mental health took a major dive, and then her body just followed.	0
when he passed in october 2016, she went to the hospital plenty, and then they realized something was really wrong with her.	0
after her health got worse, i quit my job and moved back home to help my dad (who was 11 years older than her and had his own health issues).	0
after my mom got a handle on her physical issues, her mental has been worked on.. but her severe anxiety keeps her from sleeping.	0
she would go days without sleep and would sit there looking drugged up.	0
"people even at the docs office asked me ""is she on drugs?"	0
"she looks like she is nodding off."""	0
this has been going on since 2017, and ontop of that, my dad was diagnosed with liver cancer in 2019, and passed away july 2020. so you can imagine how hard it is for her to handle his passing.	0
now, i'm the sole caregiver for her and i'm worn out.	0
when she gets sleep, she can be left alone without worrying about her forgetting to feed the dog, or her turning on the gas stove as she bops her head up and down sitting in the kitchen.	0
she goes weeks behaving this way, and she would not eat because she just sits at the dinner table and closes her eyes and makes arm gestures, or she will just randomly fall on the ground from leaning over falling asleep.	0
no matter how many times i've told her to go to bed or even take a nap, she won't do it.	0
"her stupid excuse is ""i'm not tired."""	0
"i've grown tired of the excuses, her behavior when she decides not to go to bed at reasonable hours because ""she's an adult"" and picking up after her."	0
(unrolling paper towels and making up stupid reasons why she did it) i've tried being kind, friendly, a quiet listening ear and a shoulder to cry on, but still no changes.	0
"she took sleeping meds, but they still made her groggy and not ""aware"" so the doc took her off those."	0
she won't use a sleep apnea machine for her sleep apnea, she is seeing a grief counselor finally, but everything else is just a nightmare.	0
i feel bad at times for being so short with her, or not talking to her unless it's necessary.	0
yet i'm so tired of the same bs every week.	0
she's fine when she tries hard to rest, but then it's like a complete 180 overnight and she's just...a mess.	0
i have two siblings, but they have families and less patience than i do.	0
it may sound like i don't know what it's like to have mental illness, but i'll put it into perspective like this- i've had severe depression and anxiety for over 20 years and counting.	0
on meds for it, have tried tons of therapy too.	0
i hate my life honestly.	0
i mean, i'm broke and barely see my boyfriend because i can't leave for a night.	0
thank goodness for my pup, or else i'd probably have jumped off the bridge already.	0
just needed to vent, i guess.	0

hi all who are reading this!	0
i am a photography student based in the uk, i am currently curating a body of work which is focusing on the ideas of dementia, my main source of inspiration being the work of ivan seal, if anyone who is able to open up and talk about any experiences either with dementia or know family members who suffer that would go along way to support my work, also it would be greatly appreciated to provide an image of the subject who suffers from dementia.	0
many thanks!	0
if you are interested please give me a private message.	0
my mother in law is 80 and her only child is my husband.	0
her husband passed away 5 years ago.	0
she has extreme anxiety over the smallest things that turn into fits of anger.	0
she repeatedly calls my husband and says she wants to die because this is no longer her world.	0
she is convinced that everything is wrong with her when in fact other than high blood pressure and cholesterol, she is pretty healthy for her age.	0
other members of the family used to reach out to her to chat but they no longer want to because she tells them how horrible life is all the time.	0
she has, for many years, created drama that is unnecessary.	0
lately, she will randomly forget a word for something.	0
yesterday it was hanger.	0
she referred to it as the thing you hang your clothes on.	0
she forgets sometimes how to spell her granddaughters name.	0
we spoke to her about seeing a psychiatrist and she said she knows too many secrets to go.	0
my question is, where do we begin with her?	0
i really think she needs to get evaluated professionally.	0
she sees her gp but i think pulls it together enough that he doesnt notice.	0
any advice would be appreciated	0
im finding my mom who was always pretty moody and touchy has started to get really aggressive towards random people.	0
now she is 75 and 5 tall so is very unthreatening but its causing her issues .	0
she yelled at a guy and knocked his cap off for smoking in a non smoking area.... had the police bring her to my house with her saying she was attacked .	0
cctv showed it was all her .	0
police dropped it.	0
we have a cleaner that comes in to help her once a week.	0
shes nice , doesnt mind doing her horrible bathrooms etc... ive found out through speakerphone that mom shouts at her .	0
when i call her about it she denies it .	0
its getting frustrating , embarrassing awkward calls and she is going to get herself in real trouble doing this to the wrong person one day.	0
were in the uk and getting her care is taking forever .	0
dad is coming home in 2 days after almost two months in the hospital.	0
he is going against everyone's advice and not moving into the main building where there is ample care, so what tech should i be looking for?	0
i am going to have to hire psw care for him, and i'm a little concerned about strangers in his unit when i am not able to be there.	0
for example, i have young children, and we are now quarantining flowing exposure to a positive case at school for the next two weeks.	0
"i've got my eye on a ""seniors"" clock that displays the time, date  and what part of the day it is (morning/afternoon/evening), and i intend to set up medical alert system with a necklace and call button, but i'm thinking about a video camera of some sort."	0
do i just get a video baby monitor?	0
something different?	0
i remember seeing old posts over a year ago about doing this, wondering how those systems are working for others.	0
thanks everyone.	0
beautiful, but very sad song from kings of leon that a lot of people here can relate to, i interpret it as being about late stage frontotemporal dementia.	0

my partner and i got married this weekend and did not tell my mil.	0
she does not like me.	0
in fact she actively dislikes me.	0
we decided not to tell her because her negativity was the last thing we needed adding to the stress of our wedding weekend.	0
we had a small 14 person covid wedding.	0
close friends in another friends backyard.	0
we told my mil i was staying with my friends for the weekend from friday and on saturday my partner told her he had to work out of town and left in his work clothes.	0
the plan is to tell her in two weeks.	0
well stay away for a night and tell her we got married on a whim.	0
its so hard not just being able to be happy and blissful in my recent nuptials.	0

my mom (80) lives alone in florida.	0
i live in washington state.	0
my wife is down helping her because she got shingles 7 weeks ago.	0
she has not recovered and is in constant pain.	0
in the past few days it has worsened and not only is she in pain, but she is severely mentally impacted.	0
now, she's been kind of on the gradual downslope in the mental department for years, but this is pretty severe.	0
so i guess looking to see if anyone has been through something like this?	0
and since neither my wife nor i are capable of dealing with this long term ourselves, what do we do?	0
if i have to what kind of place would take care of a person in this situation?	0
"oh and note - we are getting her back to the dr asap, she has been multiple times, but the dr is not aware of this latest severe deterioration, so far they have just been sending her away with ""just gotta let it run its course"" but we will see what they make of this new worsening state."	0

going by this chart: https://www.walkinlab.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/info-graphic-7-stages-of-dementia.jpg my grandmother is currently between stage 3 or 4.  i'd say she's been at stage 3 for about the past three years now, but in the last year she's moved closer to stage 4.  can't say she's 100% there yet, but getting close.	0
in the past few months though, she's started to have 1-2 much more severe episodes, that last anywhere from minutes to hours.	0
for example, last month she got into an argument with my grandfather when they were alone.	0
"she says to him, ""i can solve this right now!"""	0
she then proceeds walk into the next room, and start calling my grandfather's name and asking him to come settle an argument she's having with someone..... another example would be today.	0
i gave her and my grandfather a ride to get their vaccination.	0
for the entire 30 minutes, she thought i was her brother.	0
"she called me by his name, asked me questions as if i were him, asked about ""our"" sister, brought up a story about ""our"" dad."	0
this is the first time anything like this has happened, i didn't really know how to respond, and didn't want to get her worked up before her appointment.	0
i just told her i didn't want to talk much because there was a lot of traffic.	0
now, i see her seven days a week.	0
she has never once, ever, not known who i was.	0
and like i said, these incidents are rare, only once or twice a month, and started back in maybe nov/dec.	0
98% of the time, her symptoms put her around stage 3/4.	0
i know this disease is different for everyone and hard to predict how it will advance, but has anyone else experienced something similar?	0
is this kind of typical....happens once in a while for people around her stage.....or is this a bad sign that the disease is going to pick up pace and she might start to decline very quickly?	0

i have an amazing time limited funding resource ive just been made aware of.	0
please dm me.	0
looks like it ends in the next week.	0
when mom is having a day when she is friendly and kind to me and her caregiver, she also grunts and moans constantly.	0
it is rough to hear that 24 hours a day.	0
even at night and when eating, she kind of moans.	0
it's difficult to describe this noise (i sleep with ear plugs to block how bad it gets at night).	0
you can try to redirect, etc., but she will always go back to the groaning.	0
but one weird thing is that when mom is aggressive, she doesn't make these noises.	0
on days when she is threatening people, calling people names, etc., there is no grunting and moaning.	0
no clue why this is, but it's a weird phenomenon to observe.	0
"today is one of those days where even her medicine is ""poison"" and we're ""trying to kill her"" and all of that."	0
but the moans and grunts?	0
completely silent around here.	0
anybody else ever witness a phenomenon like this?	0
anyone here ever fundraised with the alzheimers association?	0
their the longest daytld program looks really cool to me.	0
if you have before, what did you do for your fundraising activity and do you have any ideas for fundraisers?	0
id love to make an impact even if its small.	0
my grandmother passed away from alzheimers and she was the greatest.	0
a little about my wife and myself.	0
i was in military from 2012-2018. did 2 combat deployment and use all my leave in those 6 years to help gma (and gpa till he passed in 2016).	0
my wife stayed with my gma during both my deployments.	0
my wife has helped so much and i could not have a better half.	0
this woman is a super hero.	0
god, i love her.	0
i got out military in 2018 and we moved in with gma, to help.	0
we never planned to be caretakers.	0
we planned to move back, help her out while we got our feet planted and yea.	0
well we bought a house 1.5yr ago.	0
this saturday was the first time we stayed in it.	0
yes, you read that right.	0
all of our stuff is in boxes still pretty much.	0
now to the situation.	0
gma has gotten worse.	0
gma is very nitpicky, rude, and def stubborn.	0
she can walk to kitchen and go to bathroom herself, barley.	0
she is winded.	0
she has never really asked about our house or anything about it really.	0
probably cause it was a threat to her.	0
her bread and butter might be leaving.	0
my wife told her out of the blue in oct that we are moving into our house in 6 months.	0
"gma said "" i can't stay here by myself, what am i supposed to do?""."	0
my wife said we will have to figure it out.	0
gma said she isn't going into nursing home and wants to be home.	0
she didn't want to talk about it.	0
iv since tried to bring it up and she isn't having it.	0
she said we bought a house to fast, she didn't expect to live this long, and basically just blaming me for the situation...the usual.	0
the thing is my wife and i are burnnnnnnned out.	0
this woman does everything to make our life harder.	0
all she worries about is proving you wrong, argue over the stupidest things, blame you for any issues, complain about everything.	0
she don't say anything nasty to my wife and won't to me when wife is in room.	0
if it's just me and her though, yeah.	0
example: she asked wife to see how much advair she had left.	0
my wife told her none, she used what she had.	0
she's on another inhaler now but she thought she had left over advair.	0
the next day she asked me to look.	0
(not knowing she already asked wife) i told her i didn't see any.	0
"she said something along the lines of "" well i know i had some, is mel (my wife) taking it and selling or something?""."	0
it really pissed me off cause my wife has sacrificed so much for this woman.	0
i advised her to watch what she says.	0
"her response "" or what, you going to beat me up?""."	0
like...what.	0
i was baffled.	0
i was just indicating that saying bs like that will have us move out quick.	0
i'm just ranting and venting at this point cause there is so much.	0
which i'm sure many of you know.	0
she refuses to get help.	0
we are moving in few weeks regardless.	0
we have offered to help her find help.	0
it's not that i'm worried really.	0
she made her choice to stay home when i have offered to find help many times.	0
i just know the impending blow up when we start moving.	0
she is going to be an a-hole and probably say some hateful stuff trying to guilt us.	0
it won't work but it's angers me so badly.	0
we have sacrificed so much, for what?	0
for her to treat us like trash.	0
little back story.	0
gma has 2 daughters 1 passed 10 years ago and my mom is a druggie.	0
they both was druggies.	0
gpa passed in 2016. gma put him in nursing home in 2012. she doesn't have no one else.	0
everyone that has ever helped her she has found a way to talk bad about them.	0
every.one.	0
my wife and i just want to feel like adults again.	0
having an elder try and boss you around daily gets old.	0
we live in a bedroom.	0
all of our stuff sits in our basement of our house.	0
our house stuff been packed up for 3 years.	0
i'm just angry, i'm tired, i'm tired of trying to explain this to gma and her flipping it like we are the bad guys.	0
thanks for reading.	0
idk what i'm looking for really.	0
i could write for hours.	0
we were just told my mother is in stage 6 of dementia and pretty much starting stage 7. stage 7 is when the patient is nearing death.	0
my aunt said its time to visit her as much as possible but were not allowed to.	0
no visitors are allowed in the hospital or in residences.	0
i dont know what to do... i could ask my aunt to be the person thats allowed to visit instead of her but then i take away her visits.	0
this all just sucks.	0
i can call her or video call her, but its just not the same.	0
i already lost my dad and my older brother and im gonna lose my mom.	0
my whole life just fucking sucks	0

i've had the same haircut or something that looked a lot like it, for years.	0
i'm now thinking about changing it, but i'm scared my dad with dementia might not recognize me after that.	0
what do you think, what are your experiences?	0
not a necessary read, but to paint a picture of his state: he still recognizes people close to him.	0
he wouldn't recognize an old friend, but he does recognize his brothers and sisters, even if they didn't visit for a year.	0
although, i wonder if he would recognize them if he accidentally ran into them at the street (not that he goes out ever, but you know what i mean).	0
he sometimes confuses facts about me with his older daughter (my half sister).	0
he once called her and talked about the pair of socks i bought him.	0
"when i left last sunday, he wished me a good journey to ""the place she used to live in 20 years ago""."	0
he was smart enough to notice that the colour in my hair changed, when he looked at an old picture of me.	0
but he tought it faded, he had forgotten that we both used to dye our hair for years.. i stay over for the weekend once every three weeks.	0

my dad is in a nursing home and in the last week or so he has started to tell me he thinks things are added to his food that is making him cough and sneeze.	0
he doesnt want to talk about it over the phone and keeps asking me to visit.	0
i visit as often as i can given the restricted visiting hours and full time work.	0
i dont know how to respond when he calls which he does a few times a day at the moment.	0
any advice?	0
the situation: my paternal grandmother is 87 years old, she has her own little house in our backyard.	0
my mother and i are her care takers eventhough my dad is retired and sits at home all day.	0
her 4 sisters died from alzheimers and she's been getting worse since her husband died in 2019. recently she's been having issues taking her medication.	0
my mother used to fill up her pill box for an entire week and hand it to her sunday night, then she'd either tell us she's out of pills in the middle of the week or she'd have pills left at the end of the week, causing a lot of arguing on whether or not she took her meds/took more than she should.	0
recently we decided to give her the pills everyday so she at least can't take doubles and we have a better eye on it.	0
she still sometimes claims we didn't give her the pills etc but its manageable.	0
now about 3 weeks ago my brother said he noticed our grandma has a bunch of pills in her kitchen cabinet.	0
my dad went to look for them and didn't find anything, grandma was insulted that we think she would hide pills.	0
"it was worrying cause ever since her husband died she'd make remarks saying she wishes she was dead too and that she would ""just take some pills and be gone""."	0
but since my dad didn't see the pills, we figured my brother must've seen something else and moved on.	0
now last night at dinner my mother went to the kitchen to get a glass and when she returned she whispered to me that my brother is right, theres a bunch of pills in the cabinet.	0
now we don't know what to do.	0
should i confront my grandma and possibly cause a lot of drama?	0
or should i just take the pills out of the cabinet without saying anything.	0
hello, what do you think are some common misconceptions people have about dementia which people who've actually interacted with affected people and caregivers know are not true?	0

mil has decided she wants to do laundry.	0
i get it, shes at home all day.	0
shes bored.	0
its something to occupy her time.	0
i have no idea if she is using detergent or not, she definitely isnt using fabric softener or dryer sheets.	0
i do not want her doing my laundry.	0
i fold my laundry with the kon-marie method, she has no chance of learning this.	0
my plan is to put my laundry in my closet so she doesnt do it for me.	0
the towels feel like sandpaper.	0
i hate it.	0
everything is folded wrong and i have to re-fold it for it to even fit where it goes.	0
really everything needs to be re-washed.	0
my partners work shirts that need to be folded are hung up on the coat rack.	0
not looking for advice.	0
just venting and hoping someone else out there might read this and not feel so alone.	0

godfather 1 and 2, fistful of dollars, for a few dollars more, good the bad the ugly, pink panther movies with peter sellers, lonesome dove, - movies around this time and that he may also like (cant ask him, he will say he doesnt like movies)	0
i've been talking care of a woman (whom i have absolutely zero family connections to) independently for about a year i guess?	0
something like that, maybe a little less.	0
we used to have an understanding that i'd sleep an extra hour or so on my days off from my second job but she's started telling my name until i wake up for very trivial things.	0
it could be sitting up in bed, dumping her ashtray, saying it's past coffee time?	0
all things she can do aside from coffee.	0
she doesn't do it when her family comes to visit, she lets everyone sleep and sit up on her own and whatnot.	0
even on my boyfriend's day off, she won't do it.	0
just when we're alone.	0
so i'm irritated and ranting.	0
it seems pretty unfair to me.	0
my (41f) mom (71f) was diagnosed with dementia about 2.5 years ago.	0
my dad is overwhelmed and trying to take care of her.	0
i am military and get home when i can and i am visiting for the week.	0
i can tell she has not bathed in quite some time and has some body odor.	0
how do i politely suggest she take a bath?	0
she will be hurt if i tell her she smells because she does not accept she has dementia and is super sensitive about everything.	0
she thinks everything is an personal attack against her.	0
should i just run a bath and set up a comfortable setting and say it is for her to relax?	0
or do i just be honest and tell her that it has been a while and it is starting to show?	0
my dad has smoked for over 50 years so i can believe he just doesnt notice.	0
i do not know how to help her.	0
she is crying daily and i do not know what to do.	0
she received bad news today from her oncologist that her cancer has spread significantly in her liver and that it is not looking good.	0
we are working with the hospital nurse to set up her palliative care.	0
she goes back for chemo next week and i will go with her when she see her oncologist to talk about next steps.	0
some of this is just me venting but i feel so unprepared to handle this - emotionally, financially and physically.	0
she leans on me for everything and i am trying to stay strong but i feel like i can't do this and i do not have any family members to help me.	0
it is just me.	0
how do you deal with all of this shit?	0
it is so overwhelming!	0
!	0
32f living with/caring for dad, 68m(for financial and other reasons, i cant move out.)	0
he: *shits himself nearly daily, and im almost out of underwear/towels from having to do constant laundry *refuses to wear a diaper or pad *refuses to give up sweets, junk food, and eats constantly  *flat out refuses to take medication or go to hospital or non-checkup doctor visits, even though his legs are infected and rotting  *is sweet and fun and childlike half the time... and the other half the time verbally abusive, demanding, and calls me a piece of shit and ball buster *constantly needs something, attention, help with things he doesnt really need help for, etc., but if i try to ignore it he just screams louder or throws something on the floor *does all these little hyper ocd things like adjusting the towel under his feet perfectly, picking up a little bit of lint, instead of rushing to the bathroom when he needs to go  *wakes me up in middle of night, sometimes for bathroom emergencies and sometimes for frivolous stuff  *can get himself up/dress himself but chooses not to and calls me down to help him.	0
he was released from rehab on condition he could do things himself  *has been through three or four nursing agencies- and been rejected by eight- because of his behavior and not following medical advice  *has miraculously skirted any mental illness diagnosis and as such we cant force him into care or a facility  how do i get this person to cooperate, or get someone else to force him to cooperate?	0
beginning to think my dad is making up issues so he can shop online.	0
for the past year it's been always needing an issue to solve.	0
we get one settled then go to another.	0
some are real and some imagined.	0
now its back to the cushions on his dining room chair.	0
typical wood chair with spokes on the back.	0
first it was his back felt the spokes, so i got a two-piece cushion from another chair and switched it out with the same cushion he's used on there no problem for a long time.	0
good for a bit.	0
then that wasnt good because he felt the spokes in his back.	0
so we shopped on amazon and got him a new one.	0
good for awhile then it dug into his back.	0
so i found him a nice therapeutic cushion made for people with back issues, gives great lower back support.	0
was great til now and he says he can feel the spokes of the chair in his lower back.	0
there is no way in hell he can feel the chair in his lower back.	0
i sat in it and pushed my lower back into it.	0
nothing.	0
i pushed both fists one on each side at the lower part and nothing.	0
the cushioning is fantastic.	0
i honestly have no idea why he thinks he is feeling the chair.	0
how the world do you explain that to someone with dementia?	0
i showed him the cushion and explained it was far better than the cushions that normally go in chairs.	0
bracing for the day i have to talk with him about spending too much money, esp on things that dont need replacing.	0
&#x200b; recently its his shoes.	0
i still dont understand quite what he means.	0
but a big toe i think is getting rubbed raw.	0
he will wear shoes around the house, dress shoes, when hes not going anywhere.	0
i suggested he just wear socks but he says the socks hurt his toe, but the shoes dont?	0
only thing i can tell is he is wearing an old pair of shoes with narrow toes on em and it rubs his big toe raw.	0
he has another pair that doesnt do that and he says thats his new favorite pair.	0
then today he has the old narrow pair on.	0
he doesnt need a new pair of shoes but maybe thats what it takes.	0
i also dont want to take him shopping.	0
which to him is spending the afternoon going from store to store comparing.	0
you go to all stores first then make a choice.	0
sigh, i dont feel helpfull, i need to study.	0
i am starting to feel like if its needed im there.	0
but the stuff like this, no.	0
and that makes me feel kinda bad, but i have to start shepherding my study time.	0

my mom has sort of bounced around houses for tge last two years.	0
each person expected rent.	0
i am the poa and she has now moved in with me.	0
i felt it was fair to pay everyone rent that covered room/food/utilities/errands dr appointments etc.	0
but i feel guilty paying myself.	0
i handle all medical and finance and now she lives with me as well...thoughts?	0
according to medicare she can pay for housing and auto expenses...why is this so hard?	0
my grandmother (83) had a stroke in august of 2020 and i've (34f) been her caregiver since then.	0
i live with my parents and in lieu of rent i take care of my grandma full-time.	0
she herself isn't difficult to deal with most of the time, but i feel like i'm going stir-crazy since i'm not able to leave the house except to go to work.	0
i have a lot of trouble sleeping due to auditory hallucinations (i wake up thinking my grandma is calling for my help and can't get back to sleep).	0
i've felt very isolated for several months and i don't really have anyone to talk to, because my mom doesn't want to listen to me complain about how i feel.	0
she thinks i am just being lazy and acting like a child.	0
it's hard keeping my emotions bottled up and i don't want everything to keep blowing up into fights with my mom or my poor mood to affect my grandma's health ( i was diagnosed with major depression and anxiety when i was 13 and have had to deal with it since then).	0
i used to take antidepressants but haven't been able to get a new prescription since i don't have health insurance.	0
i was hoping if anyone knows of how i can get my prescription renewed so i can get my medication again and be able to deal with everything a little better.	0
i have so much guilt for having caregiver fatigue.	0
i am the primary/only caregiver for my 86-year-old grandmother.	0
my grandfather passed away in november of last year and they had been married for 66 years.	0
two weeks later my grandmother fractured her back and was unable to care for herself.	0
i tried to move her into my home but she refused.	0
she can take care of her basic needs thankfully but aside from preparing simple meals and hygiene she is very limited.	0
i feel like im not doing enough for her even though im over there quite often during the week.	0
thankfully she only lives 10 minutes down the road but i still worry that she is alone too much especially since my grandfathers passing.	0
with the pandemic she cant have visitors and also aside from me and my sisters she does not have any other family members who are still alive.	0
with a busy three year old and working a full-time job i find myself starting to have panic attacks if i dont take time for myself/self care.	0
but when i do take that time i feel so guilty.	0
i am tear up now as i write this.	0
just a note i am in therapy working through this and she is in good spirits most of the time considering all the unfortunate events.	0
i just need to vent to a community that understands.	0
so, my parents are in a nice retirement community, that has a car service.	0
"but my mom thinks she wants to drive - it is her ""freedom""."	0
thanks to covid, since her facility was in lockdown in october, she couldn't leave, so when it came up that the car needed an oil change, i drove 90 min.	0
from my house to her facility and took the car our for an oil change.	0
"and then, since we had an opportunity, i said ""you aren't going to be able to drive the car over the winter, maybe i should keep it at my house so i can drive it once/week and keep the battery charged, etc."""	0
"and she said ""what do you mean i can't drive?"""	0
"and i said ""since you aren't allowed to drive, due to covid"" and she said ""okay""."	0
then, 10 days later she has forgotten that conversation.	0
she knows i took the car, but she thinks i took it without talking to her.	0
so, now, it's march, and she and dad have both had two shots, and she is starting to make noises about wanting the car back.	0
and, if she can't have it, maybe she should just buy another car.	0
but she was having trouble remembering where she parked, long before covid started.	0
(she had to take a cab home from an art fair in town, because she couldn't find the car in spring 2019).	0
i know she shouldn't drive.	0
but her memory is such that she could easily forget where she parked (actually has happened).	0
"she also is in a different part of the city she has lived in for 40+ years, but complains ""she doesn't know her way around out here"" but it was an area we visited multiple times per month when i was growing up."	0
so, i fear she could get lost trying to go somewhere - a lot of landmarks have changed during covid.	0
and, her response time is not good - i'm asking her mulitiple times in letters, texts and phone calls, to send important tax papers along to me.	0
so, i'm worried that if she is in a traffic situation, she is not going to deal with honking, changing lanes, etc.	0
so, i'm hoping to push the freedom of having the car service, or taxi cabs, or friends coming to pick her up, and not having to worry about oil changes and buying gas.	0
i also thought i could arrange a cab company to come get her every tues afternoon from 2-4 or wed from 1-3 or whatever, to run errands, or just drive around.	0
anyone else have any other ideas?	0

my father has been diagnosed with early stages of dementia.	0
it feels surreal, as he's only 56 years old.	0
although this helps explain a lot of his memory issues.	0
he had a stroke and wound up in the er early january.	0
this resulted in a neurologist requesting an mri.	0
his g.p.	0
called to let him know and to expect a call from the neurologist in the next week or so with more information.	0
she did let him know it could be slowed down if he quit smoking.	0
he is a chain smoker, and he refuses to accept that quitting smoking may help him.	0
while we're waiting to hear back from the neurologist, what can i expect moving forward?	0
does dementia progress rapidly?	0
will he need to be put in a home?	0
he requested today that if it does progress to a certain point he wants an assisted suicide.	0
i don't know if dementia qualifies for having an assisted suicide in canada.	0
or if assisted suicide is even legal?	0
i know it was being discussed but i haven't researched the topic.	0
tldr; what can i expect when someone has been diagnosed with dementia?	0
after years and years and years of literally thinking this would never happen.	0
my mom *finally* having an appointment with a geriatric psychiatrist.	0
she's 75 and has had untreated mental illness (likely schizophrenia) for over 20 years.	0
this summer she injured her foot and required in home nursing care to change the bandages/take care of the wound.	0
the head nurse of home care was concerned about my mother's mental health and submitted a referral to senior's mental health services.	0
thank god.	0
the mental health nurse she's met with told me they are concerned about her mood/depression and memory issues.	0
she has an appointment coming up in 2 weeks.	0
"i've only just gotten in contact with the mental health nurse who made several visits to her house in the fall and she filled me in on the details, as my mom is quite ""tight lipped"" about such matters."	0
"my mom doesn't say much beyond ""i'm fine"" and ""i'll be okay"" and things like that to the doctors/nurses when she sees them, but she's much more canny when they're not around."	0
"so i think giving the nurse the low down on my mother cleared up some things and filled in her ""backstory"" for them."	0
however, due to the impact of her mental health on me... i think i was a bit too self-centered when talking to the nurse about her.	0
the mental health nurse told me that the psychiatrist will probably want to speak to me about my mother (of course), but i'm afraid of repeating the same mistake i made with the mental health nurse.	0
i talked forever.	0
it was embarrassing.	0
i'm thinking of creating a list of bullet points to mention to the psychiatrist so i don't lose track of the issue at hand.	0
i'm going to highlight: her initial diagnosis 20 years ago (but i'm not the best witness because i was 12 when this all started 20 years ago), her poor hygiene, lack of concern about her physical well being (i had to take her to the hospital for her foot injury, she let it sit for a week and did nothing, it got so bad she had to be admitted for an infection), self medicating with alcohol for a number of years... i'm not sure what else would be important for the psychiatrist to know?	0
is there anything you'd all recommend to mention?	0
truthfully, i kind of doubt that she has memory issues.	0
"she's fine around the house in her ""limited"" capacity."	0
she's a bit more savvy than she lets on to the doctors, which i think... makes them think she has memory issues?	0
like, she refuses to answer any question they ask her about money.	0
she absolutely refuses because she thinks it is beyond rude of them to ask!	0
"i know for a fact she does telephone banking, she takes care of her ""investments"" (not much, but still), she has a good idea of how much money she has."	0
i'm the one that does the bill payments, practical stuff, but she is aware.	0
do i tell the psychiatrist this?	0
she has told me multiple times how rude she thinks that question is!	0
"but i can't say she doesn't have ""memory issues,"" but she's always been just... ""off"" and she's been consistently ""off"" in a general sense."	0
i've just gotten used to her being mentally ill. any advice?	0
what would be most beneficial to tell the psychiatrist?	0
hello!	0
i am wondering if anyone else has experienced this with someone who has dementia.	0
my grandmother sings all the time, for hours.	0
she wont sleep as she will be singing nonsense songs that dont make any sense, and she is literally losing sleep because of this.	0
its very strange and a symptom i was not expecting.	0
she sings during the day as well but mostly at night time.	0
does anyone else experience anything like this and if so have you tried anything to help?	0
thank you!	0

as the title indicates, this is a sequel to the post i wrote yesterday about my 90 year old dad who for three months has refused to see a neurologist, and how hard it was to get him to agree.	0
in that post i mentioned he was going to the ophthalmologist today, and how i had written ahead to ask that doctor if he would please see if he could get my father to agree to go.	0
after the examination and some small talk, the doctor opened the discussion, then sat back while the fireworks went off.	0
dad offered stories, reasons, denials, and so on.	0
the doctor just sat quietly and listened to all the deflection.	0
he repeated his invitation for the referral.	0
dad's objections continued.	0
the doctor again suggested what good might be done.	0
dad continued to object, but each time the objections were less, the fire less hot.	0
the doctor was doing a brilliant job.	0
"for those who might be familiar, it reminded me of muhammed ali's famous ""rope a dope"" boxing technique in which he simply leaned back on the ropes and let his opponent hit him, over and over, until the opponent grew tired, and then he went in for the knockout."	0
"my dad's objections were withering in the face of the kind doctor's repeated, ""this is the best way for you to get the help you need."""	0
"finally my dad turned to me and said, ""if i do this will you drive me?"""	0
"""of course, dad, if i had to i would carry you!"""	0
so now we have a referral to one of the very few doctors who has both neurology and ophthalmology specialties, and within a week or two they'll call us with an appointment.	0
i am so very grateful to this doctor for his kind and gentle manner and for the brilliant and patient way he dealt with my father.	0
if there is indeed a diagnosis of dementia, as we suspect, this is just the beginning of a journey into the darkness, but at least now we can begin, and i will hold his hand through it all just as he held mine sixty years ago.	0
you know how there are things that your parents do that just get to you?	0
you try to help them in their older and more infirm state but you have to duck and weave through these old things that just stick in your craw?	0
why cant we switch parents with another caregiver who will these traits are sweet and endearing because they havent had to live with them for decades?	0
i 32f i am caregiver to father 68m.	0
i dont have enough money to move out, and theres no place with the covid anyway, plus this is my home and i would feel really broken up leaving.	0
sometimes i feel like im not a good caregiver because i cant do things like puke or poop.	0
i literally cant even be in the room and somebody is sick.	0
i cant really touch or clean up poop, though i can do a little splashes of it, and cleaning the laundry that is soiled.	0
he chooses to clean it himself, which i think is fair because he refuses to wear the diapers or monitor his diet, get medication, whatever.	0
sometimes i have to call my brother or somebody to help when he has a really bad accident, and he tells me that i have to be able to do it myself, which i try to explain i literally cannot.	0
the fact that dad needs me doesnt change the fact that i literally have an inability to do this.	0
when people talk like that with me, it doesnt help me be able to do it.	0
the thing still doesnt get done, and now i just have a bunch of extra added guilt.	0
i also have some resentment toward him for making me have to put up with this stuff, because he refuses to behave responsibly enough.	0
i feel like a bad daughter and a bad caretaker because i cant do this stuff.	0
hi, i have always been very individualistic, like almost libertarian individualistic.	0
my freedom above everything and everyone else, but not to the point of yelling fire in a crowded theater, more 'live and let live'.	0
i live in a different country than my parents.	0
i emigrated due to work and i like it where i am now, even though it is expensive (rent, internet, heating...).	0
i don't have a family of my own and i don't believe i'll ever marry, so not much binds me to where i am.	0
i never though i'd grow to feel like this about my parents, but i'm starting to miss them.	0
it's not that they are in bad shape, there are no dementia, psychiatric problems or addictions in my family and they are set to live 20 years, maybe more.	0
they are not poor either.	0
but i sometimes feel like i have to go back to them, to the huge house they own, even though that would make me a child again (who moves back to his parents?)	0
and they might treat me like a teenager again, because i feel i have to be with them before they die.	0
if they die, i'll only have pictures and videos of them, not real conversations anymore... uprooting my life from my host country wouldn't be as bad, as i have a job and i work to live, not the other way round.	0
it would be a matter of time before i find a new job, although i should maybe wait till this covid ordeal is over... i always believed in individual freedom, but now i'm starting to feel that family is maybe more important?	0

hi everyone!	0
my mom has middle-stage alzheimers and its time for her to be placed in a care facility (cannot be left alone, wanders, hallucinations, combative, and so much more that is beyond our capacity to properly care for her).	0
my question is: how in the heck are we supposed to pay for her care?	0
back story: she lives in california, does not have long term care insurance, makes slightly too much in social security to qualify for medicaid without using the cost-share option.	0
if we use the cost-share option to get her approved for medicaid, we were told shed be disqualified from the assisted living waiver program - which does us no good.	0
we cannot afford $100k per year for a home (or even half of that).	0
does anyone have any advice or recommendations on services we can look into?	0
this is all new to us and we are lost.	0
thank you in advance!	0
have any of you vaccinated your loved ones with alzheimer's?	0
mainly curious since i know some people experienced mild flu symptoms after the second dose.	0
i've been putting it off for my dad because i don't know how he'd react to having to get a shot twice.	0
i'm hoping to hold out long enough that he can get the single dose.	0
im emotionally exhausted every single day.	0
its so hard to take enough time for myself and the self-care i need.	0
somehow it never feels like ive taken enough time at all.	0
im getting angry and lashing out at other family members who are doing the same to me.	0
we all need a vacation, but covid... im working hard to get my dad (caregiver #1) a vacation in a safe way, but i havent qualified for a vaccine and cant take one myself yet.	0
this all just bites.	0
im so stressed.	0
my grandfather is getting close to being bedridden.	0
i cant wait for this to all be over.	0

hello everyone.	0
my amazing momma is writing a series about using poetry as an outlet for people who have someone close to them that is suffering from alzheimer's disease or dementia.	0
if you're interested in this idea or reading poetry about this difficult topic here's the link to the article.	0
below is a little blurb from the article.	0
this wont be a practical how-to essay equipped with links to the best meal replacement shake for adults or how to prepare to change your own parents diapers.	0
though thats helpful, im hoping to give you the gift of your own writing.	0
a chance to write your way through what is inherently painful and difficult.	0
weekly, i will post a poem i wrote as an example along with a poetry prompt to get you writing your own truths.	0
thanks for reading this post and maybe reading the article, i know my mom is just hoping this puts some good into the world.	0
any suggestions for an older aunt that wants to get back on the computer but had some bad issues with hackers?	0
i wonder if i could set up a computer to go online but not have her go on to any banking sites?	0
what little money she has left has to last along time and she have fallen for computer scams repeatedly.	0
once incoming her bank calling the police to her house because her phone line was hijacked and stayed that way for years untill i got involved.	0
is there a safe way to do this?	0
any suggestions welcome!	0
hi everyone, hope everyone is keeping well and safe.	0
i'm after a simple mobile phone for my almost 93 year old nan.	0
i really want a phone with 2 buttons, answer and hang up or maybe a third to put it on to speaker phone, but i can't seem to find one with just those on.	0
my nan suffers from dementia and lots of other things and i have tried her with several different phones over the last few years, the biggest issue i have is that she can't hear us, so putting the phone on speaker is a must, unfortunatly she find this very hard to do and ends up puttung me on hold or hanging up on me.	0
she has recently moved into a new care home and trying to get through to the home is getting frustrating and isn't overaly fair on the staff asking them to take the time to help my nan answer the phone.	0
based in the uk but will happily order from abroad if it will work in the uk.	0
we have tried doro and ttfone but she really struggles with them both.	0

"see the ""blue cats"" art piece by robin mead too!"	0
sorry for the verbosity...mostly just a rant but am grateful for any thoughts/advice.	0
dad, who lives 20 minutes from me, alone, has been calling the police and reporting me for terrible things.	0
over the past 2 years, he has accused me of fraudulent use of his credit cards, stealing cash with his atm card, taking his medication, and far worse.	0
since i was often using his card to get his groceries and supplies -- which he insisted on -  and would get cash for him -- which he insisted on -- yes, there are pictures of me at the atm and on security footage in the grocery stores/pharmacies getting supplies.	0
i know this because the police have confirmed it.	0
and yes, my wife who is ill, does take some of the same medication, but she's extremely disciplined about hers.	0
after the first call, the police spoke to my sister, who lives an hour away and has a minor brain injury from her youth (we have never gotten along, she's extremely bitter and angry).	0
she told them that she was not there when the alleged medication theft took place the prior night, but it sounded like something i would do.	0
(she is married to an extremely successful lawyer with all kinds of connections, and loves to see me miserable - but i was floored to hear that.)	0
"the policeman, who believed everything he was told, angrily informed me that in my state, that is theft by deception and is in the ""domestic abuse"" category and  i could be arrested based solely on the accusation if my father decided to file a complaint."	0
spoke to lawyer who told me it was unlikely, but yes, it was absolutely possible.	0
my company was, simultaneously, letting people in my age bracket with my years of experience go.	0
if i got arrested and lost my job, how on earth would i find another job to support my family (wife and 3 kids, all with learning disabilities)?	0
i was terrified.	0
it's two against one, plus (possibly) my brother-in-law lawyer, and there is no formal diagnosis because any doctor who said anything remotely undesired was a moron and <expletives> and he would never let me take him back for a follow up.	0
there are no other relatives who speak to him much anymore (he was very difficult to get along with, even before these accusations started, and the closest is about 3 hours away).	0
the only constant has been a psychiatrist, who will not discuss anything about any of it with me.	0
there have since been a few more calls to the police (they even came to my house and questioned me in front of my children), and a few directly to me - during which horrible accusations, threats, and brutal insults were made.	0
just painful in every way.	0
the first policeman, the lawyer, and the psychiatrist i started seeing all told me the same thing - stay as far away from both of them as possible.	0
after years of running errands, getting groceries, and just sitting with him on hard days, despite having a wife and young kids at home ... that has been extremely difficult, especially during those first weeks and months.	0
i have not changed my number because i want to leave that avenue open.	0
"if he were to call me and say ""look i've been diagnosed with <whatever>"" i would 100% resume helping him in every way i could."	0
but until that happens, i still walk around feeling like i could be arrested for something i didn't do, even after the enormous efforts i made, for  years, to be helpful.	0
okay, i got most of it out, thank you for having a place here were i can do that.	0
i'm not too sure about what i'm dealing with but my grandparent has become extremely pessimistic and believes he is very sickly even when there isn't much going on.	0
he talks about how the world is doomed with politicians we have/climate change/ cost of living, anything really.	0
then he believes that he has cancer because he has slightly lower platelet levels (doc just wanted to monitor and has been for a long time).	0
he had an episode of kidney stones last year and ever since then it's as though he wants to find something that is going wrong.	0
he measures his urine output religiously, takes his blood pressure multiple times a day, refuses to eat alot of food because apparently it made it worse, constantly says he feels weak and that he actually is very sick but doesn't want to tell anyone.	0
i don't deny it has taken a toll on his health but i just feel like it's being 'played up'.	0
i sound like such an asshole but i'm growing so frustrated with someone i truly love and care for.	0
what could i do different?	0
tia!	0
i feel sorry towards myself for having to go through what i am going through.	0
well my mom and i moved out of our home (my parents are not split but because my grandmother has severe dementia and my father not keeping her in a care center our family divided into 2.)	0
as my mom is old and well a kind of entitled, narcissistic person, i have to deal with household chores (getting groceries, getting my mom's medicine)  making me the head of the house because of my dad's absence.	0
while i'm going through all this my friends are well being assholes and it's a story for another post.	0
my parents are being fucked up people and it makes me feel like why am i doing this to myself.	0
at this point i'm physically and mentally exhausted.	0
all they care is about me doing studies (mainly the reason why my mom and i moved out).	0
and the thing is i never spent time  with my dad as he was away abroad for business half of my childhood.	0
now that i'm a teen and i have a few years before i move out, my grandma has dementia.	0
i realized that what i craved for the most was to spend time with my mom and my dad together together as a family.	0
go on a vacation (never been on one with them) go to a movie, have a picnic in-short spend quality time with them.	0
but that has never happened so my resentment towards them has grown very much to say the least.	0
i don't have very fond memories of my childhood hell i don't even remember half of it cause there were too many fights and too much of yelling so i don't want to go back to those painful moments.	0
and then there are just random people speaking about a situation they don't know.	0
"i'll explain there are these ladies who live in my society they just randomly say shit like yeah ""her father lives away from her and her mom"" ""what a irresponsible person he is"" i mean what the fuck can't you just mind your own business."	0
like are you that jobless.	0
you don't even know the situation then why are you making snarly comments in a kid's face who has enough on her plate.	0
if you have nothing nice to say then don't say anything periodt.	0
overall i'm just pissed at people and need a good vacation.	0
sorry for ranting for so long.	0
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1faipqlsfm0bcnrr0sempwyilypauxtutidya_uezfcucijptfebx9sa/viewform	0
about 6 or 7 years ago, i discovered what dementia is when my aunt started asking repetitive questions about her where her daughter and granddaughter was.	0
later on i discovered that i have several uncles who had dementia and my grandfather had it.	0
so it runs in the family and i expected my father to be next in line to have it.	0
my father showed signs of dementia and later was diagnosed with it.	0
my father didn't believe he had dementia, which made his care extremely hard.	0
out of all my father's 10+ children only a half brother and myself tried to help him (not even a daughter who's a nurse practioner).	0
along with his mother, my stepmother.	0
throughout this ordeal, many mistakes was made, in my father's care and regulating his affairs.	0
however, a lot of bad decisions were made before my father showed evidence of dementia.	0
he bought a house that he couldn't afford.	0
paying almost $10k in property taxes.	0
retired before the house was paid off.	0
rarely did any renovations on the house.	0
pretty soon after he retired and was diagnosed with dementia, that's many things in the house started falling apart.	0
we did some repairs and the house is still not finished with repairs.	0
getting the ct scan and the memory tests was the easy part.	0
many mistakes were made was when my stepmother chose to get power of attorney, instead of my brother and i.  my stepmother had poa, but refused to do anything, and relied on me to the footwork.	0
however, handling my father's affairs required a poa or legal guardian, so i needed my stepmother's authorization, and if she wasn't around its slowed everything down.	0
my father refused to take his meds, because he couldn't remember to and didn't believe he had anything.	0
his primary care doctor referred us to a psychiatric nurse because of his resistance to taking his meds.	0
the psychiatric nurse wanted to place him in special care so he could get his blood pressure down and be given the right meds.	0
my half brother believed it was to place our dad in a nursing home.	0
so my half brother switched his primary care physician to another general practioner physician who lived in another county.	0
because of the distance we rarely went for check ups.	0
then when covid-19 hit, we didn't go at all.	0
this physician never referred us to a specialist like a geriatric doctor or neurologist to work on the dementia.	0
all they prescribed him was things to make him sleep which had no affect on him after awhile.	0
out of my stepmother and half brother, i have the most pacifist personality.	0
so i just go along.	0
any suggestions that i had were usually disregarded.	0
or explained why it wasn't plausible.	0
now i'm sorry that i didn't speak up earlier on.	0
now i'm sorry that i didn't speak up.	0
now i'm sorry i didn't fight for my beliefs.	0
i often advocated for medicaid years ago so we could get a home aide and other things.	0
my stepmother was against it.	0
she said he made too much.	0
even though, some of my aunts & uncles were able to receive medicaid who made more then my father.	0
everyone knows there are ways getting around it.	0
she believed that she care for him till we could sell the house and pay for an aide out of pocket.	0
my stepmother is partially deaf, bad eye sight, circulation problems, obese, pre-diabetic, waddles like penguin and in her 70's, no condition to handle a man with dementia who's extremely resistant and still strong.	0
she waited till her job's union gave her a deal were my dad would be covered in her insurance.	0
it wasn't till this year, she couldn't take it and wanted a home aide.	0
she had a representative from their health insurance come over and said they would be help, we got no help.	0
we had to get the general practioner to prescribed all these things for a hospital bed and things for toilets.	0
my half brother is very smart, definitely smarter then i am.	0
however, despite his intelligence.	0
he likes to wait let other people handle shit and then come out and say they made a mistake and that he would have never done that.	0
"i'm like ""if you know better then us, then take the lead on this issue."""	0
but then makes it sound like he is doing all the work and everyone else is incompetent.	0
my stepmother and half brother aren't the only fuck ups.	0
i been so focused on fixing up the house and getting ready for sale.	0
never thought to see another doctor besides a general practioner.	0
i been getting advice from an uninformed cousin on what he does to help, rather then speaking to his older brother who had more information.	0
such seeing a specialist, medicaid, home aide, day programs.	0
his mother (my father's younger sister) got dementia before my dad and is doing a lot better.	0
it wasn't until the last few days ago, i been able to get a appointment with a neurologist.	0
i been able to contact a medical supply to get a medical bed and other things.	0
however, today during a face time with my father's general physician.	0
he says in my father's current state (bed bound, several bed sores, emaciated, not really eating, not talking), its seem like it's only a matter of days, weeks, or months.	0
that we will be lucky to get a few more years.	0
since my father has had dementia, there have been a few scares that his days were numbered but he bounced back.	0
tomorrow, we face time neurologist.	0
hoping for better news, but i don't want to get my hopes up.	0
it's like my aunts and uncles got to live 10 to 12 years with the disease and then passed with the best care possible.	0
like i said before, one of my father's sisters had it several years before he did.	0
she is still walking and talking, lost a lot of weight, but not emaciated.	0
i'm saddened because looking back there was so many missed opportunities.	0
i want to blame my stepmother and half brother because of their egos and ignorance.	0
i want to blame myself.	0
i have made a lot of fuck ups in my life, but not getting a loved one the best essential care, is on another level.	0
but as everyone says, it's no use blaming anyone, what's done is done.	0
i knew when he got dementia, that this is the inevitable end.	0
but that there are ways to extend and make life comfortable while they are still with us.	0
i really wish that there were instruction manuals for caregivers of loved ones with dementia.	0
for anyone who has recently has a loved one with dementia this is my advice.	0
put your loved ones care first.	0
get your ego out of the way.	0
any family member who's doesn't want to pull their weight.	0
any family member who's arrogance level exceeds their intelligence levels.	0
check them, it's not about them, it's about your loved ones   get a power of attorney & healthcare proxy for someone or some people who are capable and wiling to do the work.	0
only get a legal guardianship when the dementia patient is really out of it.	0
or they aren't being cared for properly.	0
make sure they consistently see a doctor who lives a reasonable distance.	0
make sure they also see a specialist for the disease of dementia itself (neurologist, gerontologist, geriatric psychiatrists).	0
don't wait to get a home health aide when they're are urinating and defecating on themselves.	0
get one pretty early on.	0
speak to an expert about getting their affairs in order such insurance coverage, debts, housing, social security, pension, 401k, and everything else is taken care of.	0
so you just can focus on the care of your loved one.	0
don't let them live in silence and solitude.	0
give them stimulation.	0
have a tv so they can watch.	0
have family and friends over.	0
put them in a day program.	0
a dementia patient in a room alone staring at the walls will hasten their demise.	0
to anyone reading this, who just had someone diagnosed with dementia.	0
i sincerely hope and pray that you do a better job then my stepmother, half brother, and i did.	0
eta: my father passed a couple hours after i wrote this, early in the morning, a couple hours past midnight.	0
i was the one to discover him.	0
today was supposed to be an exciting day.	0
nov 1st we had a water leak from the upstairs bathroom to my moms floor.	0
the floors had to be ripped out and the walls dried.	0
sadly, all of my moms stuff including her furniture were put in storage.	0
so she ended up moving  upstairs to the toddler room, liked it, and forgot  she even lived downstairs.	0
id ask her over and over if she remembered living downstairs and she didnt get it.	0
well today was the day when all of her stuff was brought back, my husband and i after 4 months would share a room again.	0
no more mom in the kids room!	0
she was excited and we really got a lot of stuff done.	0
however by 4:00pm her attitude changed drastically and she was very angry at me because she had to move downstairs.	0
fine.	0
i get it.	0
its the dementia i told myself.	0
however she went into this catatonic state.	0
basically paralyzed on her bed.	0
she wouldnt make eye contact.	0
staring off into space.	0
she was unable to talk.	0
at first i thought she was just ignoring me but then i realized something was wrong.	0
i started shaking her gently to snap her out of it and gave her water and orange juice which she had a hard time swallowing at points.	0
this was scary.	0
she moaned very slowly that she wanted to die.	0
not the first time she has said this.	0
shes made comments like this for many years under stress and anger but the way she said it was worrisome.	0
very slow and slurred.	0
now im left reading and wondering if she had a small stroke or something?!!!!!	0
ive never head of tias.	0
im going to call the doctor tomorrow.	0
im wondering if all of todays activity, stress, and anxiety of moving to a new room did something to her?!!	0
it lasted about 10 minutes.	0
when i asked she said she felt very bad and strange like she was drowning.	0
what the heck?	0
dementia exile: part 3 - the hospital dementia exile: part 4 - it's over.	0
she's home.	0
hello, my mother is 58 and she was in a care home but because of the dementia getting worse they transferred her to the hospital.	0
shes been there for a month now and because of covid im not even allowed to visit her.	0
i just feel really bad right now because i never talk about this with anyone, none of my friends even know whats going on.	0
and recently its been hitting me pretty hard.	0
when i saw her the first time she was hospitalized last year, she said she felt bad that she was sick because i would never have a normal young adult life and she wouldnt be there to help me and give me advice.	0
and its like everyday i wake up and i remember this, im never gonna have my mom again.	0
and i feel awful that shes going through this and theres absolutely nothing i can do about it.	0
something i never told anyone, when i was in high school my grandmother on my dads side had dementia and i went to visit her with my mom, and she told me that one of her biggest fears was to get dementia and she made me promise i would never let her live like my grandmother did if she did have it.	0
and now i cant even visit her... anyways i just needed a place to talk about all this :(	0

i have always struggled with my weight.	0
now that i am locked in with my elderly parent after loosing my other parent a year ago, i just have to face it, i have ballooned.	0
i feel and look terrible.	0
eating has been my only comfort and entertainment and it shows!	0
i am furious at myself.	0
by spring i will be able to take my parent out for small trips but i will be so ashamed at how i have regressed.	0
how do i dig myself out of this?	0
my (22m) family is in desperate need of some help.	0
my dad's (69m) dementia has gotten much worse over the past few months.	0
it pains me to say this but my sister (40f), mother (67) and i are no longer able to look after him on our own.	0
every day there's a bigger upset than the last.	0
my sister and i have been trying to convince my mother to look into available support for my dad (in-home care or even looking into a home) but the same sticking point keeps coming up (finances).	0
we live in ontario, what resources can i look into to show my mom?	0
what is the best thing to do/say if a daughter is in denial about how her mothers mental state is deteriorating.	0
i want to do whats best for her mother(my aunt).	0
anyone have any specials tools for moderate stage dementia patients?	0
are stuffed animals helpful?	0
will music the patient likes calm them down or aggravate them when they are upset?	0
how to steer their mood from angry to not angry?	0
i'm a caregiver for an older man with seemingly moderate dementia.	0
somedays he is upset, when he gets angry its hard to talk him out of his angry conversational loops and aggressive repetitive topics.	0
sometimes his behavior is honestly just sinister and threatening and scares his wife and im looking for something that can pull him out of that state	0
dementia symptom perspectives: prose from myrna norman at https://truthfulkindness.com/index-persons-with-dementia-pwd/myrna-norman/not-afraid/ , re #dementia #fear .	0
<3	0
i (26f) know i just posted here recently and try to space out my posts, but i really need a safe, understanding space today.	0
today has been absolute hell.	0
it started out like most other days, with me bringing my dad (66m) his meds and cigs (which i use as motivation so he continues taking his meds, that and if i dont moderate his smoking he will relentlessly chain smoke).	0
it was a relatively normal interaction, i was trying to leave for work, as per usual he was bugging me for random things (today it was plates).	0
my fianc (27m) heard and woke up to this and it really upset him.	0
he got all worked up and impossible to de escalate and ran downstairs to yell at him.	0
i have told him so.	0
many.	0
times.	0
that reacting like that doesnt help, my father is incapable of understanding reason or responding with anything other than anger and fear due to being provoked.	0
everything would have gone smoothly had he just left us alone.	0
this has happened before, my fianc hearing my dad yelling at me and getting upset.	0
however, its never been this bad.	0
they both threatened violence against each other and sounded sincere.	0
i dont think my fianc would follow through with that, but i wouldnt put anything past my dad at this point.	0
now i am scared to leave them alone with each other but dont have much of a choice at this point, unless i bring one of them with me every time i go anywhere.	0
after he finally de escalated, i begged my fianc to work harder at managing his emotions, check out dementia resources with me, etc.	0
he said he is willing to, but i dont know how committed he really is, and there are limited resources out there that actually relate to our unique experience of caring for someone younger, relatively high functioning in a lot of ways, but incapable of managing his own life and affairs.	0
everyone always says teepa snow but something about her approach really rubs me the wrong way.	0
it seems like her advice is more tailored to older people that are further along in the disease, and more likely to work if youre older/a figure of authority.	0
if anyone has advice on how to work on a relationship so dementia caretaking doesnt totally destroy it, thatd be great.	0
i know in theory i shouldnt be in a relationship with someone whos reacting like this, i cant explain why, but us breaking up would literally kill him.	0
that and i love him, and without this additional strain on our relationship, weve grown a lot and have a lot of dreams being put on hold by this.	0
im basically stuck taking care of my fianc and my dad and im getting close to my breaking point.	0
hi all, wanted to give a quick update on my dad's first 6 days.	0
everything was going well from what the facility told us.	0
activity director said she got dad doing karaoke and dancing.	0
the facility offered that my mom could visit behind plexiglass outside.	0
boy...it did not go well.	0
my dad sobbed the whole time about how we abandoned him.	0
ugh.	0
awful.	0
my dad said some really painful things and the visit was cut short.	0
how do you come back from that?	0
i know that we did the right thing in seeing how my mom has changed in these short days but how do you deal with these types of interactions?	0
i feel awful	0
my dad, fairly early stage dementia, moved in with us about six weeks ago and we're all still adjusting.	0
the biggest challenges are: 1. trying to anticipate and prevent the things he'll do mainly while trying to help -- 'troubleshooting' our perfectly fine appliances (and breaking them), putting ice cream in the fridge to melt, moving trash to the recycling bin, constantly moving things from where they need to be (lots of things are now labeled with sharpies), etc.	0
2. worse, the socialization part.	0
i can handle breakfast, lunch, weekends and dinners but early evening is overwhelming.	0
with the pandemic, my husband and i found a way to carve out some time by switching up the routine so the kids watch tv while i cook dinner -- basically, a working/cooking cocktail hour to transition from my intense workday into the kids' also-intense dinner and bedtime routines.	0
but now, dad comes up as soon as i'm off work and just ... hovers.	0
he doesn't have a lot to talk about at that time of the day but wants to interact, so i basically have to try to make small talk  every night -- at a time when i'm at my most depleted.	0
it's hard and, frankly, i'm a little resentful of the intrusion into my husbands' and my time to connect.	0
but i don't want to tell him he can't hang out.	0
the pandemic is making everyone feel isolated and i'm sure dad needs some company, but he frustratingly won't talk to anyone on the phone so it all falls on us.	0
i'd love any creative ideas for improving either of these problems!	0

i'm the main (99%) caregiver for my parents.	0
"some of you have been following my efforts to get them to move out of their house of 55 years in my posts called ""moving my parents"" on this sub."	0
today, however, i want to share the story of my dad.	0
dad is a veteran and served honorably during the korean war.	0
in 1952, while he was serving in korea as a supply sergeant, a rack of shovels fell on his head, knocking him unconscious and cutting open much of one side of his face.	0
although he was offered a purple heart, he declined it in honor of those who were earning theirs with wounds received from combat.	0
fast forward to 2017.  he met with a va caseworker and was awarded a small disability pension and audiology services due to his time in artillery.	0
he told the caseworker that ever since the shovels incident he had sinus problems.	0
this claim was denied.	0
as dad's advocate, even though i might disagree with his claims, i still take them forward because no one else will.	0
in 2018 my dad began complaining of hallucinations of shapes moving on light backgrounds.	0
often he says it looks like chicken wire, but sometimes it's a map of the united states, but whatever it is, we can't see what he sees.	0
his ophthalmologist says he believes it's more in the brain than in the eyes, although dad does now have glaucoma.	0
so his hearing and his vision are both challenged.	0
he never had to wear glasses in his life and still only wears reading glasses, but now his vision isn't correctable because of the glaucoma.	0
dad has obviously been slipping over the course of time, and 2020 saw worse declines.	0
in an october visit to the va clinic i talked him into taking the slums with a social worker, who said dad scored one point above the level that would identify dementia.	0
the social worker recommended a neurologist.	0
dad said no.	0
in december, after spending several hours together, suddenly dad asked me who i was.	0
his primary care doctor, upon hearing this, immediately referred him to a neurologist.	0
dad said no.	0
"i made an appointment for him in hopes i could change his mind, but when he found out about it, he became angry and ""ordered"" me to cancel the appointment."	0
he also decided that any mental failure on his part is undoubtedly due to the falling shovels incident i mentioned above.	0
he asked me to call his va caseworker and appeal the decision not to award him benefits based on the falling shovel injuries.	0
again, i'm his only advocate, so i did as he asked, but i asked the caseworker to tell him that only by visiting a neurologist could the appeal have new information and go forward.	0
again dad refused.	0
i called the va clinic and told them dad had refused.	0
i called his primary and told them dad had refused.	0
they both called him and asked him please to reconsider.	0
"he got angry, and told them ""i was once the best detective in the state!"	0
"i don't need this!"""	0
what we have here is anosognosia, which happens when the brain loses its self awareness and the person cannot understand that he is losing his mental capabilities.	0
the part of the brain that would know that is already malfunctioning or not operating at all.	0
so by this point i'm very certain that dad is suffering from some sort of dementia.	0
my research leads me to believe it may be lewy body, which often presents with the hallucinations i've described, but also trembling and a shuffling gait, both of which dad has developed.	0
there actually is medication which would slow these things down, but since dad refuses care along these lines, he isn't getting any help.	0
again today i called his primary practically begging for help, and tomorrow dad goes back to the eye doctor, and i've also begged that doctor to please make a strong argument for seeing a neurologist.	0
dad refuses to give me a poa because he doesn't want to be forced to leave his house or to have me making decisions for him.	0
"by now you're probably asking, ""why in the world is he refusing so strongly to see a neurologist?"""	0
well, your guess is almost as good as mine.	0
he refuses to say.	0
"although once he did say, ""if i did that, it would be the end of my marriage."""	0
i addressed that at the time with him, but evidently i wasn't convincing.	0
i think he believes that if there were to be a diagnosis of dementia it would somehow force him to move into memory care away from my mother (also 90) and he just can't permit that to happen.	0
he doesn't understand that this is not the way it would have to be handled, that there are meds, dietary changes, etc.	0
that could really help without having to go into memory care.	0
does anyone have any advice at all about how to get the world's most stubborn man to go to see a doctor he doesn't want to see?	0
thanks!	0
edit:  see the sequel post, what a difference a day makes to find out what happened the day after i wrote this post!	0
my mom (76) had an mi yesterday.	0
the paramedics took her to the hospital where they removed the blockage and inserted a stent.	0
she will be on three new medications including a blood thinner.	0
she may be coming home tomorrow and i'm in no condition to care for her, mental health-wise.	0
i called my doctors today but it could be a while until things get better in my head.	0
the stress of taking care of her so far has been overwhelming and i haven't been taking as good care of her lately.	0
she has a somatoform disorder so there is always at least one problem going on and she complains a lot.	0
her stomach hurts, she's dizzy, nauseous, etc.	0
i ran out of patience a long time ago.	0
when the paramedics took her away i thought it was just another of her anxiety attacks.	0
she has her own beliefs about whatever symptom she is having.	0
i offer her otc meds for symptoms but she will never take them.	0
she had this idea that taking too many tums gave her chest pains.	0
she often has these kinds of theories where she is convinced and is resistant to other suggestions.	0
my feeling is that she likes to wallow in self-pity and get attention.	0
i'm out of patience and running low on empathy.	0
there is no one else to take care of her and i need to get my shit together or this is going to go very poorly when she comes home.	0
she won't let anyone in the house because of covid or i could ask my brother or nephew to come help.	0
she is due for her second vaccine on the 13th but i don't know if i can get her to go.	0
it was like pulling teeth to get her to go the first time.	0
i know this is rambling and i'm sorry.	0
i just need some advice on how to take care of her and not be bothered by all the push-pull around her symptoms that goes on all day.	0
it's wearing me down.	0
edit: thank you very much for all the replies.	0
there is some very good advice here.	0
i realized that in order to care for her, i have to learn to respond to all of her complaints with sympathy and not try to find a solution to everything.	0
they are sending her home today.	0
-- i spoke with the mental health nurse who is talking with the doctor about tweaking my meds.	0
it was good to talk to someone.	0
-- i got a crisis appointment with my therapist for next week, soonest they had.	0
-- i told my brother that i need some relief and he said he would take time off work to come stay with mom after she gets her second shot.	0
you are all right, i need to take care of myself better.	0
thank you.	0
i recently moved my family member into a independent living facility.	0
they have a diagnosis of cognitive impairment and were fully independent and living on their own before this move.	0
the move however has taken a toll with the unfamiliar surroundings etc and thing have been very challenging.	0
the problems have been augmented with the community banning family members from entering the facilities including the apartments.	0
i have some services coming to their apartment but i know that if i was able to go in and help organize and orient them to the apartment this would all go or have gone much smoother.	0
ive spoken to the community administration and leadership and to my dismay they have been less than helpful.	0
their best suggestion is that these things just take time.	0
it is very hard to just sit by and watch and wait while i can see a decline right before my eyes.	0
is anybody else in this situation or have any suggestions?	0
i think this wouldve been easier without all the covid restrictions and at this point i really regret moving during this time (but it was inevitable and i thought the earlier the better).	0
has anyone had any luck getting their parents into a continuing care retirement community after a diagnosis of alzheimers?	0
my dad is 65, in the very early stages of dementia (technically at mild cognitive impairment) but his neurologist is thinking that its alzheimers.	0
he is currently fully independent, living with my healthy mom (66), continuing to work, and doing all normal things, just with some memory lapses here and there.	0
no other health issues at all.	0
they luckily will have the money to pay for all the associated fees and are interested in moving asap to one of these if possible.	0
they are already on one waitlist and will get on a few more with a 1-2 year waitlist.	0
basically even if he stays at this level when its time to enter, im wondering if hes automatically banned because of the diagnosis.	0
thanks for any experiences!	0
[removed]	0
edit: i just want to thank everyone for their support.	0
this community is a wonderful place.	0
thank you for all that you do.	0
my mother was moved into a nursing home yesterday.	0
she has an early-onset form of dementia and shes non-verbal.	0
shes only 53. i feel so guilty and im just looking for support.	0
hi there my mum (55) has been in hospital with early onset dementia since october, and only recently have we been able to start getting things in place.	0
we are bringing her home for a few hours tomorrow for an ot evaluation to see what she will likely need support with in the house and what can be put in place.	0
i was just wondering if anyone had any advice for things we should ask or make sure is covered that might not occur to me or my dad thank you	0
my dad has early stages of parkinsons and dementia and has a problem with waking up at night and he tries to get up and it could potentially hurt him if he falls.	0
often too hell get aggressive when trying to put him back to bed.	0
he does take sleeping meds, but nothing has been helping and my family is now getting now sleep because hell wake up a couple times during the night.	0
any suggestions?	0
thank you c:	0
so my father just passed away yesterday.	0
my mother has alz and asks where is bill?	0
every few hours and she basically has to re-live the news of his passing.	0
i fear that this will completely break her.	0
is it ok to just string her along with some white lies and shift her attention to something else?	0
or do we have to continually explain that he has passed?	0
thanks in advance.	0

hi, i've technically been helping my mom take care of my younger brother since i was six years old, but she could never qualify to be his caregiver because she worked to maintain end's meet.	0
she's actually disabled herself now and just applied for her own disability as well.	0
so, technically, i take care both my mom and my brother, however my mom can do for herself i just make sure she takes her medication.	0
my brother on the other hand has autism and they diagnosed him with being mentally 4 years old forever, so i supervise him and help him wash his clothes, keep up his personal hygiene, make sure he eats, schedule his doctor appointments and etc.	0
"i was pretty much the ""mom"" when our mom was working crazy hours haha!"	0
anyway, i'm currently finishing up my pre-reqs for nursing, i take the hesi a few weeks from now, and i opt to doing all of my classes online because my mom's health got really bad while i was away at college.	0
i sent off an inquiry because i actually just remember about the caregiver thing.	0
my brother is on staywell and i was wondering if anyone can guide me through the process of applying to be my brother's caregiver?	0
i've researched online, but i haven't really had any luck of finding an application...logged onto the wellcare website via the member account i setup for my brother (had to change his pcp) and i still didn't find anything.	0
if anyone can help me out, i appreciate it!	0
it's just the three of us and i do my best to help my mom out when she needs it and make sure my brother is alright.	0
i hope this is the right subreddit since i made this account a few minutes ago just to ask this question.	0
[removed]	0
it's not that he doesn't care, he's just run ragged and really doesn't know what he's doing in regards to her care.	0
i had brought up treatment options and that we might even consider getting her at home care or if need be an assisted living apartment.	0
she now has it in her mind that i'm trying to convince dad to have her committed and that we're just going to have her locked in an institution.	0
i'm not even allowed at their house now.	0
and all dad does about that is reinforce that idea by telling me not to come around and tells her that he's told me to leave them alone.	0
she's not getting any treatment whatsoever.	0
since the diagnosis there has been zero follow up.	0
i don't know wtf to do.	0
[deleted]	0
the last two weeks have been a blood bath of anguish, fear, and trauma.	0
i'm guessing some of you might be recovering too.	0
dementia exiled: part 1 - escape dementia exiled: part 2 - shelter from the storm without.	0
no shelter from the storm within.	0
so ive been a caregiver for my mom since ive been 25, im now 30. she has lupus, has had stokes and when my dad left her she basically gave away all her money she received.	0
since then shes been homeless, ive had to take over as a conservator of finances.	0
ive helped her get housing and in 2019 she was hit by a car at her apartment complex.	0
for most of 2020 she had home aids (which was a god send because im also a nurse and you know covid).	0
the past 3 months though she hasnt had aids do to a shortage, but thankfully shes mostly independent now.	0
im trying to move her closer to where i live because shes about an hour away from me.	0
i drive down once a week to help her with cleaning and grocery shopping.	0
im just exhausted, i have a brother who lives 15-20 minutes away from her but is unreliable at best.	0
i have my own family and home to maintain; i feel like im just getting overwhelmed with everything.	0
i literally dont know any other people my age who have similar situation or that can relate.	0
ive looked into support groups before but its like people in there 50/60s caring for their elderly parents.	0
its incredibly hard for them to even try to relate to my situation when i explain it.	0
i guess im just frustrated and like i said needed a safe place to vent.	0
my mother, diagnosed with early onset, randomly decided to cancel her $500k life insurance policy that she's been paying for the last 15+ years.	0
my brother and i found out the next week, and we called the life insurance company, but they would not re-instate the policy.	0
my mother claims that my brother told her to do so... which obviously wouldn't be true.	0
any thoughts on this?	0
[removed]	0
[removed]	0
my mother is in her 70s, lives alone in her house, no other responsible children or relatives.	0
she can cook and care for herself, but she can't manage her own financial affairs or handle house maintenance even slightly.	0
she has a long history of paranoid delusions, which are getting worse and more public.	0
she's also emotionally abusive.	0
living with her is not an option.	0
but she may reach a point where she can't live in her house alone.	0
what options do we have for someone with her combination of mental issues?	0
ive read a few comments on reddit before on individuals who were misdiagnosed as dementia but really they had severe sleep apnea.	0
and after being on xpap they got better and their symptoms improved.	0
wondering if this happened to anyone before, and if yes, how long did it take before your symptoms got better?	0
i already know that i'm going to be the default caregiver.	0
of my siblings, i live the closest, have the fewest kids (1) and i'm not married.	0
they have been generous to give me financial support through the years, and i really believe the unspoken expectation is that i'll be there for them as they age.	0
my mom recently asked me (while tipsy) if i'd move in with them when they're too old to care for themselves.	0
i am a little panicked at the thought that for the next 20 years of my life, while i'm still youthful and in my prime, that i can't move out of state or do anything to change my life projectile, because of my parents.	0
i feel very stifled and controlled and almost like a child.	0
now that the serious stuff is out the way.	0
can i mention something funny/annoying af that they both do?	0
they constantly think i want their old food.	0
that rather than get fresh, convenient food of my own choosing, that i should come to their house to pick up whatever aging vegetables or leftovers they no longer want.	0
this is multiple times a week that i'm offered food.	0
a few times i've taken it and it's been rotten.	0
and they act like they're giving me pure gold lol.	0
i am dreading corn season because my dad is going to ask me every other day if i want ears of corn that he buys 20 at a time because they're so cheap.	0
yes, let me drop everything from my schedule, so i can come drive there to get a 19 cent ear of corn that may or may not get eaten in my household.	0
sorry for the rant.	0
i feel like i have a long road ahead in dealing with them and i'm feeling anxious/irritated.	0
my mom's memory has been sliding downhill for years.	0
a while ago we finally convinced her to go get tested for dementia at the muhammad ali parkinson center which is supposedly the best in our az area.	0
according to her, the doctor asked her a few questions and determined that she was fine.	0
"(i've since learned that my grandmother had also gone to that ""dementia specialist"" only to be told she was fine as well."	0
(3 months later my grandma didn't know who my grandpa was.)	0
more than a year later, my mother is finally (again) admitting that there is a problem.	0
her doctor gave her a medication that was supposed to help (slow?)	0
the dementia.	0
it made her sick and now she refuses to take it.	0
she's looking to herbal mlm supplements to help her memory now.	0
when my dad speaks to her frankly about the need to take it seriously and get real medication, she gets suicidal and refuses to see reason.	0
is there anything out there that will help?	0
or should we just let her slip happily into senility?	0
any ideas what the doc would've put her on that made her throw up?	0
does the sickness decrease?	0
are their other meds?	0
i remember seeing in the news that a new drug had been approved (the first) to treat the actual disease as opposed to the symptoms.	0
"why would a ""reputable"" neurological center be so incompetent in detecting dementia early??"	0
are there any online doctors that can treat my mother?	0
she refuses to go back to the ali center, and i don't blame her.	0
is it ethical to force my mother to get herself help?	0
are there provisions (such as with mental health crisis centers) where she can be manhandled into facing her issue while keeping her under suicide watch?	0
[removed]	0
wondering if anyone here has experience with lifeline, telus livingwell, or other similar device?	0
need to get dad something, definitely has to have fall alert, and gps would probably help as his license has now been revoked.	0
dont know how you folks go through all the craziness and stay cool, calm and collected.	0
i'm usually good but today i messed up.	0
my dad was carrying 2 x $100 bills in his wallet.	0
he never went anywhere so he put em in his smal cashbox in the dining room furniture.	0
then moved it under his chair.	0
last night he was looking through his wallet and wondered where is cash went.	0
i suggested it was in his cashbox.	0
he never listens to me.	0
i may as well not speak.	0
he can hear e, he just chooses not to.	0
today he starts out with 'now i'm not accusing anyone'...which he has always done.	0
he is accusing without sounding like the badguy and accusing.	0
he has done this several times before.	0
he misplaces or loses something or forgets what he did with it and accuses me of doing it.	0
so today i got mad and read him the riot act and spoke my mind.	0
i spoke only truth and he denied accusing me.	0
utter bs.	0
i suggested next time just ask if i know something because when you say 'im not accusing' youre accusing.	0
i also told him this was why i dont  touch his money or anything unless i tell him or he asks me to.	0
i handle his business affairs because he no longer has tat ability.	0
i keep strict records even though he has told me i dont need to.	0
and if anything i end up spending my own money for him.	0
i suppose i just found out i'm not a very good and strong person since i let this upset me.	0
but i just feel if i dont stand up and correct it he may think im doing something i shouldnt do.	0
to save from another post, we are on glasses round 8. he says sometimes tv is grainy and reading small print is hard.	0
eyedoc says his eyes are the same.	0
maybe glasses need adjusting.	0
we went thru hell with him getting new glasses last year.	0
this will be worse and he will take a week of visits to get them adjusted.	0
then with all the adjusting his eyes will no longer hit that sweet spot on the lens.	0
maybe old b and w movies look grainy cause the quality is bad.	0
maybe he needs to hold the book a bit closer.	0
i need a vacation.	0
i've been completely frustrated with trying to find a medication list with images of the pills.	0
this would have helped with my situation years back, but it's pretty crucial with my mom's failing hearth.	0
i'd rather not just tape pictures on sheets of paper, but an actual dedicated of med list with attachments of photos of the pills.	0
the lab test sign made me think to ask this.	0
we have my fil in home with us and we have an eight year old.	0
it's hard sometimes to tell which one did a thing that shouldn't be done.	0
so yesterday, my husband found a new pack of sliced cheese opened incorrectly and most of the slices were broken and partially eaten (i think).	0
we're not sure if they were broken by hand or if someone picked up the stack and bit into it.	0
it was hard to tell.	0
has anyone else had their family member scavenge like this?	0
my son seems sincere about not remembering doing it and i can usually get him to fess up about things as long as i tell him he won't be in trouble.	0
i can't say for certain it was fil, but i'm wondering now.	0
fil does get plenty to eat and has a good appetite most of the time.	0
[removed]	0
so my fil has been steadily declining in his hearing.	0
he has gone to an audiologist several times since 2010 and they have given him hearing aids 3 times.	0
"every time they give them to him he has an ""issue"" and returns them."	0
literally just takes them back and drops them off at the front desk and leaves.	0
we know that he does not want to wear them because they make him look and feel old.	0
christmas of 2019 we had him over and it was clear that he was severly deaf and was not hearing much at all.	0
he could not hear his iphone ringing when it was right next to him and was insisting that it was broken-- it wasnt.	0
we cannot communicate with him at all as he cannot hear and gets very angry when we refuse to yell or repeat ourselves 4 times.	0
we took him to the audiologist last march and he was once again prescribed and given hearing aids.	0
at that appointment the audiologist also pulled a giant rock of ear wax out of his ear with a tool.	0
upon further investigation it appears that my fil has an irrational fear of q-tips from watching dr. oz.	0
he will not clean out his ears.	0
will not do it.	0
period.	0
we have tried to show him us doing it, videos of other people doing it.	0
it doesnt matter-- he wont use q-tips.	0
two months after getting the aids the magically broke so we took them in for repair and it was discovered they were so coated with wax the speaker couldnt be heard.	0
we once again went over the importance of cleaning his ears out but still no progress.	0
i saw him yesterday and he literally cannot hear again, we have entire conversations but he hears nothing.	0
he claims that he hears background noise loudly but not voices and the background noise drowns out voices.	0
even in an empty room with no background noise he could not hear us clearly.	0
the audiologist assures me that the aids are not the issue and they are are calibrated and working properly so that only thing i can think of is that there is probably another giant wax build up.	0
he wants new hearing aids but i know that these are the best option for him.	0
any ideas of what i can do about this?	0
my 91 year old aunt has alzheimers and tells me she doesnt like her live in aide, that the aide doesnt like her and acts nice in front of other people but is nasty when theyre alone.	0
she lives in a very posh assisted living facility so there are many staff members in and out of her apartment each day, as well as visiting nurse services, and everyone reports that her aide is attentive and seems to be doing a good job.	0
physically my aunts health has improved under this aides care, and though the aide has expressed being frustrated at times, ive never seen any signs of abuse.	0
my aunts alzheimers has caused her to be delusional and in the past her paranoia and anger was sometimes directed towards me even tho i was the only one trying to help her so i know she can lash out for no reason.	0
she hasnt been happy since her husband died, and she wasnt happy with any of the other aides i hired for her either.	0
i dont want to lose a decent aide but i also dont want my aunt to have to live with someone she doesnt like, and part of me worries what if what shes saying is true.	0
how do i tell if these complaints are a real cause for concern or just part of her general unhappiness and confusion?	0

my grandmother (68) has started noticing some small memory loss issues.	0
i've been noticing this for the last two months or so.	0
she sometimes doesn't remember the word she's looking for, for example, she forgot about the name of brocolli.	0
she knew though, and tried to remember it, until she got it.	0
she forgot recently the name of a small black object.	0
"she called it ""the black thing"", struggled a bit to find the real name, and eventually got it."	0
she jokingly said about having alzheimer's.	0
i've been testing her recently in subtle ways, always asking the date and such.	0
she never responded wrong to these kind of questions, so she doesn't seem confused about time/locations.	0
it's only these memory issues that have been affecting her, nothing else.	0
should i worry about this?	0
p.d: if it helps to know, she has depression and has dealed with great amounts of stress before in her life, she also has diabetes.	0
thanks for reading!	0
in the last month, my dad (early onset) has had neighbors call the police twice because he thought my mom had gone missing.	0
my mom is his caregiver and has a routine for work that she adheres to very strictly to avoid this, but on the rare occasion she does something for herself (like going to dinner with friends tonight), my dad struggles and panics.	0
he has issues with the phone (they just got a landline with pictures of family on the buttons) and even with alexa reminders every hour of where my mom went tonight, he had the neighbors call the police.	0
any advice or similar experiences?	0
my mom is determined to avoid memory care and keep him at home, but if these instances continue im afraid shell isolate.	0
my grandfather is one of the most outstanding people i have ever met.	0
he never went to college, but was in the navy as an electrician, then built rocket parts for the apollo projects (unknowingly), then worked at a powerplant as one of their lead technicians.as a child, he worked his family's mechanic shop.	0
throughout his entire adult life, he worked roughly 50 head of cattle.	0
he's always been the person we go to when we need something repaired, be it our car, our furniture, or whatever, he was mr. fix-it.	0
all this to say, my grandpa kept busy his entire life and was used to regular projects that we would give him.	0
within the past few years, we've noticed that he's gotten a bit more confused in day-to-day conversation and activities.	0
he is already a man of few words, but we noticed he was more hesitant to talk than usual.	0
when he does talk, it takes him a lot longer to get a thought out than it used to.	0
i asked him to build a bookshelf for me last fall and realized that he can no longer do such things while i was helping him, because he couldn't remember what measurements he had taken, which pieces he had already finished, and had general issues with the spatial comprehension he should've had to do this project.	0
since then, the whole family has stopped asking him to take on projects for us, because we don't want to stress him out.	0
earlier this month, he sold off all of his cattle because he didn't trust himself to take care of them anymore.	0
he no longer allows himself to drive because he's scared he'll get confused while driving.	0
he's gone from being a man that could do anything to a man who can't do anything that he used to enjoy.	0
i'm reaching out for help because we're trying to find something to give him to keep him engaged, something he can do that makes him feel like he has a purpose.	0
it hurts so much to see him feeling like he has no purpose, and i want to help him so much.	0
context and potentially useful info: he has gotten tested for alzheimer's but has not been diagnosed.	0
his evaluation score was a few points off.	0
"the dr. has instead diagnosed him with the ""cognitive impairment"" stage, i believe."	0
he is otherwise healthy.	0
he likes sudoku, board games, and taking care of bird feeders on his property although i am not sure how much of those activities he's still able to do to his previous ability.	0
tl;dr: aging grandfather with supposed onset alzheimer's needs activities to feel useful.	0
my dad has dementia that is progressing faster than we thought with him being on medication.	0
(while i am well aware namenda and aricept are stopgap measures and not cures, its still surprising).	0
he doesnt remember he has lost it (which i love the irony of), so he gets very frustrated very quickly.	0
over the past couple of weeks angry outbursts have become more frequent towards my mother.	0
his pcp was unreceptive when i brought up a mood stabilizer, so i was wondering what experience, if any, you guys have had with giving your loved ones any type of cbd product.	0
im not planning on doing anything without informed consent, and i know each persons experience is different, but i want real world advice, not just what paid articles may tell me.	0
so anything would be helpful!	0
im having some difficulty with mom refusing to change their depends before bed.	0
she would in the past, and will if she has a bowel movement in them.	0
now she will go in the bathroom telling me she will change, and then come out saying she did when she didnt.	0
she refuses to let me in to help even though she will let me help most days in the morning, and help with showering.	0
i think this is a control situation, it is one thing she can make a decision about independently.	0
but now she is starting to get a rash and im in fear of a uti.	0
ive tried to appeal to her that she could get a uti or skin infection and that has no impact.	0
ive tried bribing saying we need to change before we can watch your favorite show, but she just goes in and pretends to change.	0
this show is the only thing she gets excited about, i dont have much elses to bribe her with.	0
anyone else have these issues and were able to turn it around?	0
since i recently moved out from her, and realizing that i will be starting a new chapter in my life, i dont want to have to worry about her.	0
i've lived with her all my life, so i know what she does the entire day and all her underlying health condition which she gets angry whenever i address.	0
i take it she doesnt want to burden me with it.	0
luckily i am still close by so she can visit anytime and vice versa.	0
she is still able, which i am so thankful for, but being at that age, i know everyday will be downhill.	0
she is starting to lose her eyesight, she doesn't exercise very much (weight gain), she looks very tired on her face, and if im being honest unrecognizable and kinda embarrassed to introduce her (i am working on that).	0
i have relayed this to her to change her for the better but she is stubborn so i have given up, but i dont want to see her unhappy so i always encourage her to get her out her comfort zone.	0
husband divorce and died from cancer, so she is all alone most days.	0
to keep it short, my family/family friends basically dropped my mom off at my apartment and said good luck when she was diagnosed.	0
so its been 6 months of taking care of her in my studio apartment trying to find somewhere affordable to live.	0
are there government programs to help with this?	0
i know the hud has section 202 housing but i can't find anywhere to get on a list and i think i'm just going to have to shell out the extra cash.	0
i'm assuming these places aren't the nicest but both her and my mental health are dwindling.	0
i always think i found something when i speak with social workers and it always goes back to square one.	0
edit: sp grmr	0
my mom has als and needs 24/7 care.	0
she has random choking fits which close her airways up, and when shes lying down she needs to be sat up and leaned forward for these to subside.	0
so that means someone needs to be awake near her at all times.	0
i supervise her until 4am, and then my dad takes over.	0
the next day, i always wake up in panic wondering if my dad fell asleep by accident while supervising her and my mom choked and is dead.	0
i can hardly even sleep through the night anymore because im so scared.	0
i hate this so much.	0
i was listening to dax shepards podcast the other day and he was interviewing viggo mortensen who happens to have had multiple family members with dementia.	0
he shared some really eye opening thoughts that i thought were worth sharing.	0
you can fast forward to that part of the conversation around 30:30 and they talk about it for about 15 minutes.	0
changed my perspective for sure.	0

throwaway account in case i get too personal... i am coming up on a year of being a caregiver - my mom was diagnosed with cancer right as the pandemic began shutting everything down.	0
i moved back to my home state in mid-march (assuming id be here a month or two...), and have been here ever since.	0
my moms condition has deteriorated throughout the year as weve seen her through her treatments and theres nothing more to be done for her at this time except to give her love and care at home.	0
i am really lucky that my two sisters also moved home and were able to do all this caregiving business together.	0
we all work full-time but mostly remotely (entirely for myself since my job is in another state), and juggle our meeting schedules and moms needs.	0
i applaud all the caregivers out there doing it alone, i absolutely dont know how id be able to do most of this alone (the physical demands alone are not something i could see being able to do by myself!).	0
i find myself resenting other people who are complaining about the pandemic changing their plans and lives and wanting to get back to normal life.	0
because of covid, we cant invite others into our house, or reach out for much help from my parents friends and community.	0
i feel terrible that my once vibrant and social mother has to spend her illness separated from the community.	0
and im thousands of miles from my friends and everyone is sick of zoom gatherings and virtual hangouts.	0
most of my friends are taking covid seriously enough, but still able to leave their houses or see other people on occasion, take measured risks etc.	0
were not completely cut off from our community, but i feel so much farther from all my old support systems (except my sisters and dad).	0
now that people are getting vaccinated and states are removing restrictions, i am fearful that i will become even more resentful of my friends who are transitioning back to a more normal life.	0
i am last on the vaccine priority list (why arent caregivers higher on the list when our patients health depends on us being able to and healthy enough to care for them?!	0
thats a rant for another day) how have you all dealt with the extra loneliness and even resentment of covid life while caregiving?	0
i have reasonable self-care practices, i exercise frequently, read for pleasure, do some arts and crafts and journaling, and spend time outside every day in the yard with our dogs, weather permitting.	0
but what i really want is to feel like a part of life in the outside world, and until i am fully vaccinated or my mother passes (which i don't want but accept the inevitability of), that just isnt happening.	0
i wouldnt trade caring for my mom at this stage in her journey for anything, and in some ways the pandemic is the only thing that made it possible (remote work was frowned upon at my work until we were forced into it), but i am still sick of this pandemic and my estrangement from the outside world.	0
maybe there is no way out of feeling like this, but i thought it might help me to hear from others going through similar experiences.	0
hi there.	0
context - my mother has recently (last 2 months) been diagnosed with early stage small vessel disease.	0
her white matter has shown some minimal signs of recession, and her blood lipid and cholesterol levels were way off the norm.	0
for context, she is a 56 year old female with a bmi slightly above average.	0
she does, however, have one copy of apoe4, and one of apoe3, so there is some genetic risk for dementia.	0
she has been prescribed blood pressure lowering medications and statins.	0
question - what can she do to minimise the risk of developing full blown vascular dementia?	0
any protocols or medications etc that can be recommended?	0
&#x200b; thank you!	0
i was reading about pseudodementia vs actual dementia and i'm not sure what the differences are.	0
looking online, there don't appear to be any noticeable differences, just slight nuances.	0
she's had depression for a long time, and there was an event that sent her into an even deeper depression, but this is way different from anything else i've seen.	0
we've gotten different diagnoses and my dad is sticking with the temporary amnesia/pseudodementia diagnosis while i've gotten used to saying it's early onset.	0
i suppose they won't truly know until she passes does anyone know more about this?	0
has anyone had experience with pseudodementia?	0
[deleted]	0
i am hoping to count long-term care expenses in the deduction section of my family member's taxes this year.	0
does anyone know how to do this?	0
i'm specifically looking for the steps.	0
i looked at pub.	0
502, which says that this is possible but it provides no steps.	0
for example, do i have to get a letter from the facility's doctor and submit the doctor's letter with the taxes?	0
what percent of the monthly memory unit fee can be placed on schedule a?	0
if anyone has done this and has any info, i would greatly appreciate it.	0
does the awareness of having dementia stop?	0
i'd say our loved one with dementia is mid stage, maybe getting into stage 6. her husband is the care giver.	0
i can't say for sure which stage, i am sure behind doors she is unfornately worse.	0
she has lewy body, seems to change rapidly.	0
lots of delusions.	0
mood swings, high anxiety, no short term memory, lost the ability to do tasks, sundowners.	0
she's aware enough to know she has dementia, avoids family members because she is embarrassed of how she behaves or can't do tasks.	0
does that awareness fade?	0
i have tried to talk to her about, say she can tell me anything, we support her, she says she is fine and changes the topic.	0
i was hoping making her feel comfortable and supported, she doesn't have to hide.	0
she wants to pretend she doesn't have dementia, i have to respect that.	0
she isolates herself, makes up excuses to why she can't visit or have visits.	0
her husband has told us about her diagnosis, we all play along as if its not noticable to keep her happy.	0
my husband misses her, she is his mother.	0
how long could this avoiding us go on for?	0
i (f26) am taking care of my boyfriend (m29).	0
he has been diagnosed with hereditary amyloidosis last year.	0
his two younger sisters dont have the gene.	0
his mother has passed away from the disease 4 years ago.	0
i dont know if it is selfish of me to wish for some appreciation from the sisters.	0
because if it wasnt for me, they would be the ones making cuts in their lives and having to sacrifice time and energy to take care of their brother/ my boyfriend.	0
i have tendinitis on both hands since october last year.	0
and it just doesnt heal.	0
probably because i dont get to rest enough, due to having to keep everything in our house running.	0
all the things you guys are probably very familiar with (errands, cooking, cleaning, etc).	0
everything i do hurts.	0
even scrolling and typing this text.	0
i would just wish his sisters would be more empathetic and offer their help to me.	0
asking me how i cope with everything.	0
(weve known each other for more then 10 years, even before me and my boyfriend got together).	0
instead they just talk to him, asking him how he feels, if they can do something.	0
he usually rejects their help because he doesnt feel the need or he is too proud or doesnt want to bother them.	0
at the beginning of the week it was my birthday.	0
and the youngest sister forgot to wish me happy birthday.	0
instead there was a random present (big plant) sent to our flat.	0
for my boyfriend.	0
and they talked on the phone because of that present.	0
but again, no question if i am fine.	0
on the other hand my boyfriend is great.	0
he is grateful for everything i do.	0
he tries to help me out as much as he can (opening cans and packages, things that just hurt too much).	0
he even reminds me to take my pain medicine and to take it slow.	0
suggesting solutions that might help me.	0
he has a big support system.	0
and i am happy for him.	0
but sometimes i am just jealous of the love he receives.	0
i just want some of it too.	0
because i need it too.	0
edit: english is not my primary language.	0
somehow i thought caretaker is the opposite of caregiver, hence the person who is in need of the care.	0
but after a google search it seems it totally isnt.	0
anyways, thank you for the support.	0
i feel much better and less alone, really appreciate this group here.	0
she's gone from only mild symptoms a couple days ago to not being able to figure out what day it is today, even while consulting a calendar and with me offering help.	0
and then got confused again an hour later and asked me for the fourth time in 2 days what time we were leaving for the hospital today.	0
and her mri is not until tomorrow.	0
this morning she was crying about how she didn't want surgery and had packed a bag for the hospital and got some books together...and there is no surgery scheduled.	0
i'm completely baffled.	0
i'm expecting her to come knock on my door shortly in a panic that we are late for her surgery.	0
is it normal to go from a 2 to an 8 virtually overnight?	0
quick update to my previous post about whether to tell my dad about moving in to memory care.	0
we decided to not talk to him about it as previous conversations about his need for care never went well.	0
we were scheduled to move my dad on thursday and on tuesday i told my mom i thought my dad seemed dehydrated.	0
wednesday morning he has more concerning symptoms but all in line with dehydration.	0
mom had the mobile nurses come by and they confirm dehydration and do an iv as well as recommending an er visit to rule out heart problems (another story but my dad has been to the er about 12 times in the past year for 'chest pain'; his dr has run the gamut of tests and assured us his heart is strong).	0
we declined as he perked up a lot after the fluids.	0
i showed up thursday morning and my dad asks me if he heard what happened to him yesterday.	0
i said no, wanting to see what he remembered.	0
he told me he had a stroke so i ran with it.	0
i let him know that mom and i'd talked about it, talked about how wonderful the nurses were and how they loved him so much they wanted to see him again!	0
(keeping things light and positive).	0
i said that we were going to take him for more testing and it would be overnight at least so they can monitor him and make sure he's ok after the stroke.	0
dad forgot about this story when we needed to leave about an  hour later.	0
i recommended he bring a book to keep himself occupied since the testing would take a while and he didn't remember why we were leaving.	0
but he was relaxed and not anxious about any of this.	0
we pulled up to the facility, they greeted us at the door (dad did not realize where he was), my dad introduced himself (he'd met the facility folks several times prior) and they welcomed him inside saying there were a lot of people they were excited to introduce him to.	0
we got a quick update about an hour later that he was doing well and that he loved the cat i got him (we had to put down his sickly cat last summer so i picked up one of those therapy cats that looked just like his old cat).	0
i asked the facility to be sure the cat was on his bed (his sickly cat never left the bed) as we were not allowed in the facility to get his room ready.	0
i'd spent the past two weeks dropping off all this stuff so they could get the room ready.	0
got a brief update from them yesterday on his first 24 hours and they still said everything was good and that my dad realized the cat is mechanical but loves it anyway.	0
phew.	0
i'm hoping his days continue to go well.	0
he is in quarantine there for 14 days which bums me out but i understand it.	0
we can visit through the window in the 14 days and then beyond that time, it's outside behind plexiglass.	0
they have not told us yet that they recommend a window visit.	0
i'm doing my best to encourage my mom that they are professionals and know exactly how to deal with all this.	0
we've both been pretty up and down emotionally.	0
it's really hard despite knowing this is what's best for him.	0
turned out to be not so quick an update...thanks for reading.	0
my grandpa literally shouting this laying in bed in the dark right now :/	0
my dad is very weak.	0
he uses a walker and has issues getting up and getting out of bed.	0
he doesnt drink enough water and has refused exercise since a stroke 3 years ago.	0
he does eat and take his meds.	0
he has a sleeping pill.	0
recently the neuro upped that to a pill and a half at night.	0
its just me taking care of him.	0
cognitively he is declining, difficulty knowing his phone from the tv remote etc, difficulty navigating the tv menu.	0
not every time but alot.	0
his short term memory is shot but he recalls old events well.	0
its hard communicating because he often uses the wrong words or phrases or a simple question will be answered with a roundabout 15 minute answer.	0
my brother lives far away and doesnt want to know.	0
that said...tonight as im helping dad get ready for bed he thanks me for doing all that i do.	0
then he tells me its getting more difficult getting up in the morning and getting ready for his day.	0
you can imagine how sad this makes me and worried.	0
as long as i can do it he will stay in his own house.	0
but i cant lift him.	0
he hasnt, doesnt, and wont exercise.	0
im trying to think of a help he can use to get out of bed.	0
he used to have a rail that the anchor slipped tween mattress and springs and he could possibly use it to help pull himself upright, then stand up.	0
does anyone know if this works.	0
he is a creature of habit but this means he does some things the hard way.	0
the side of the bed he gets up on is close to a wall of window panels, colder and no room.	0
if he would get up on the other side of the bed he coud place his walker in front of him and instead of trying to walk the length of the bed to his walker it would be right there.	0
he cant really afford much for help.	0
just feeling like maybe he doesnt have much time left and looking at ways to help.	0
i know im on here alot so thanks for putting up with me.	0
one more thing.	0
i see alot of love and compassion in here.	0
good good people, both helping each other and taking care of loved ones.	0
i know it hurts and its scary and its not fair.	0
but the good thing is that they do have you.	0
hold on, you'll make it.	0
do what you know is right.	0
take care	0
my mother has some sort of aggressive early onset alzheimers.	0
seems like before i knew it she couldn't incorporate nouns or verbs into any sort of conversation.	0
what are some easy topics or conversation methods i can stick to when i try to talk to her?	0
normal conversation is virtually impossible and i often find myself choked up at the loss of any idea of what she's trying to say.	0
my grandma recently turned 84. she has been a strong-willed, smart, and independent woman for years and still is to this day.	0
she raised seven children and went through a troublesome marriage for years.	0
its fair to say shes been through hell and back.	0
shes one of my role models and i hope i can be as good of a person as she is one day.	0
however, in recent years, especially the last few, my family and i have noticed a slip in memory and very slight personality changes.	0
most of these things are small and not significant.	0
in the past year, these things have slowly become more noticeable.	0
i do not live far away from my grandmother and am with her almost everyday for hours at a time.	0
(im still in school) im really grateful to be able to be around her often because its a blessing for any elderly person to have company.	0
when im talking with her, i never notice a large difference from how shes been for years.	0
she rarely asks me a question twice... the exception may be if she asks where our cats are.	0
i may let one outside and a few minutes later she will be unsure of where it is.	0
she has had me help with writing out bills/important forms for the past 2 years...but could still do it herself if she needed to do so.	0
i do notice that it takes her longer to think of the right words to use or to describe what shes talking about.	0
she also occasionally forgets to take her morning medication and will end up taking it around noon or 1:00. but this doesnt happen all the time.	0
she doesnt use technology besides tv.	0
ive noticed she sometimes struggles to use the same remote shes used for the past ten years.	0
not with changing the channel or anything, just turning it on and off.	0
we have to use multiple buttons to get everyone off.	0
she rarely ever calls people on the house phone unless they call her and she can easily find the missed calls.	0
i think she has slowly developed issues with organization for awhile now, she receives so much mail and can almost never sort through it all.	0
i feel like any issues she has relate to short-term memory though.	0
she is a very active lady.	0
its not an uncommon occurrence to see her outside working in flowers or the garden.	0
this was the case this past summer too.	0
she doesnt get lost or become disoriented while out in public.	0
we havent been in stores much since covid but when we do go she doesnt act any different than she did before.	0
but she rarely goes alone and hasnt for years.	0
i have no idea if she would still be able to drive and direct herself.	0
(she was never one that went out everyday anyway. )	0
when she is with me, she knows where we are in town and doesnt act confused.	0
she still does dishes, laundry, etc.	0
(she has lost an interest in cooking for a long time now.	0
i wouldnt contribute that to memory, even when i was younger and she was in her early to mid-70s she claimed i cooked for years with my kids, it isnt much fun no more and would laugh.	0
nonetheless, she still makes soup or easy to make items.)	0
i hate to write so much, but i promise i am getting to where i begin to have real concerns... in late 2019, my grandmother had a knee replacement after suffering with knee pain for years.	0
it would hurt for her to walk, and it was a relief for her to get the surgery.	0
(im so thankful she got it before covid, because she almost postponed until the spring.)	0
she recovered with no issue and walks perfectly now.	0
but before surgery, she would get her hair done once a week.	0
she used to paint her nails often.	0
and she would always try to wear pretty outfits.	0
after the surgery and since the pandemic began, ive noticed a decline.	0
she just seems sad and doesnt seem to be her old self.	0
(she has suffered from depression in the past) i know the pandemic has been hard on almost everyone, but i just have a weird feeling that my grandmother has begun to lose hope and will never be the same.	0
when talking with her recently, she expressed some concern about her memory when i asked.	0
and she even went as far to say, i know i probably have alzheimers or am developing it.	0
but i cant sit and fret about it everyday.	0
theres nothing i can do, so id rather not discuss it.	0
when i pressed further about why she has lost hope, she said that she feels like she goes backwards instead of forward and that it doesnt matter anyway because no one comes to visit.	0
she is very aware of the pandemic and has taken all precautions...but our family did visit more in the summer and fall.	0
i know the winter has been bad with covid..but we did have a few small get-togethers individually socially distanced.	0
shes always been a people person and i think seeing almost no one besides me has taken a toll.	0
she doesnt seem to struggle with personal hygiene.	0
she cant easily take baths or showers anymore because of balance and other issues.	0
she can take a bath or shower if someone is here, and i usually am.	0
but i know she fears falling otherwise.	0
so, she usually bathes at the sink.	0
i will add that she hates to wash her hair...and i dont think it has anything to do with her forgetting about it.	0
she has always had her hair styled and curled with hairspray.	0
in the past year, she hasnt had her weekly appointments and only goes maybe once every month or 2 months to get it cut.	0
the risk of covid is an issue, and she doesnt want to get out as much...i understand that.	0
but its also a depression issue i feel like too.	0
she still wears appropriate clothing and matches with the season.	0
she just lacks motivation more so now.	0
and she has had a yearly health checkup in recent months, no concerns were ever brought to anyone else.	0
i know her provider has asked about memory before and has given her small written tasks.	0
so she must be okay if no health professional has large concerns?...	0
she still gets dressed up and does everything like she used to when she has too.	0
but discretionary events never seem to interest her and she will try to get out of them if she can.	0
the most concerning thing probably happened in the past few weeks.	0
we live in a rural area so we have a field and an empty house next door and there are some vehicles left behind... a few days ago, my grandmother claimed there were people in the vehicle a woman with sunglasses and when we had snow there were people up in the field.	0
there are trees and bushes so im wondering if it is a vision issue partly.	0
(i hope) she has had cataract surgery and has a prism in her glasses so she wont see double (the issue is mostly when she drives.)	0
but she was very adamant about it and no one was actually there.	0
she understood after i explained to her but has brought it up again since.	0
every time its the same woman but even my grandma is starting to realize no one is there.	0
because she doesnt move around apparently... this issue has happened no where else.	0
when we were out in public she didnt complain once about seeing something that wasnt there.	0
so im hoping thats just a vision thing  and for further reference, my great grandmother (her mother) had alzheimers for many years and finally reached the point where she could no longer do basic functions.	0
(eat, drink, etc.)	0
she was 86. my grandmother was the primary caregiver for her so she has told me many stories.	0
i hate to write all of that and not be concise and clear about what her symptoms are...but its not one thing or another and i cant really summarize without explaining personal stories.	0
if you read this, thank you and im sorry for taking sooo long.	0
i personally feel like my grandma is probably developing mild/early alzheimers.	0
i would just like reassurance if any can be given.	0
it scares me to death that she may have this awful disease.	0
but im also still very thankful that she is still largely the same person i have always known.	0
she has lived 84 long years and i pray she has many more.	0
im so blessed that i have been able to live close to her and spend time with her more than almost anyone in the family.	0
and i find peace knowing that she will have people no matter the  outcome.	0
thank you again for reading!	0
elderly patients with dementia have different uti symptoms, than those without dementia.	0
here are just a few:  negative change in personality their dementia symptoms increase dizziness, which causes increased falls sleeping more loss of appetite   my mom has dementia and im her full time caregiver.	0
when i have noticed sudden changes in my moms behavior it has always been due to a uti.	0
a round of antibiotics and shes back to herself again.	0
several years ago my mother underwent chemotherapy for nonhodgkin lymphoma and i noticed a change in her personality after that.	0
she is obsessed with the notion that chemicals caused her cancer and wants to avoid chemicals at all cost.	0
even though she was smoking a pack a day and eating lots of junk food when she got diagnosed, she believes it was caused by the neighbors use of herbicide and went on a crusade against them.	0
she will talk about the dangers of chemicals for hours at a very fast pace not caring or not if the person listening wants to hear about it.	0
she claims she has no time or money to get the air conditioning in her home fixed after 2 years of it being out but she has plenty of money.	0
she is convinced she is poor but she isnt at all.	0
she whacks off her hair with scissors in a unattractive fashion because she claims she has no money for haircuts.	0
these are only a few examples but im a little concerned that things could get worse.	0
she does not believe in any type of mental health treatment and will never go to a doctor willingly.	0
she believes that all psych meds are poisonous and that psych diagnoses are all made up and dont exist.	0
im not sure what to do with her...does this sound like it could possible be dementia?	0
she is divorced and im an only child so im in this alone.	0
advice would be helpful.	0
thanks for reading.	0
hello again, everyone!	0
i hope you're doing okay.	0
i've got a question about bed baths.	0
i've only given one before because my dad used to have people who came in to help bathe him.	0
they don't come anymore bc he's gotten combative towards strangers.	0
its my responsibility now.	0
also our shower is so hard to get him in without assistance, i can't do it on my own.	0
so:  1) what kind of shampoo do you use?	0
dry shampoo or normal shampoo?	0
2) what do i do with the washcloths after?	0
rinse then hang to dry?	0
3) how many bed baths do you give a week?	0
4) do you have a favorite scent or like a brand where the smell lasts long?	0
i want to have him smelling good.	0
5) should i buy a hair wash basin?	0
those look convenient.	0
6) is it ok to give him only bed baths or should i try to buy a detachable shower hose that connects to the tub spout?	0
i think i can maybe give him a bath sitting in his wheelchair but idk.	0
thank you in advanced!	0
dad has come to the point where he will think his phone runs the tv and sometimes that the remote is his phone.	0
i can really tape or attach anything to the devices themselves.	0
only idea i have is to take a pic of each and make a how-to poster of what it is and how to use it.	0
i can make signs and such but he will forget to look.	0
i need to do it anyway, even if it just helps a bit.	0
all he does with a phone is make and get calls.	0
the remote is harder because he has hulu and youtube and prime.	0
although the remote is simple to use he would navigate the apps differently.	0
anyone faced this and found something to work?	0
he hasnt watched tv all day.	0
right now he's just vegging in front of an off tv.	0
no idea if hes just vegging or he forgot how to turn it on.	0
will drop in in a few and get it going.	0
thanks	0
so today i went to see my parents to take them to the grocery store.	0
i found them struggling hard to make their bed.	0
they were on opposite sides tugging the bedding back and forth and trying to smooth out the wrinkles.	0
"i didn't want to start the conversation with some controversial thing, so i refrained from saying ""if you lived in one of the places you rejected, you wouldn't have to do this anymore, wouldn't that be nice?"""	0
instead, i lent a hand and soon the bed was made.	0
my mother hadn't dressed for the day yet, so my dad and i left the room.	0
i looked at some mail that had him confused.	0
then he opened the conversation about their future.	0
"""that place you showed us the other day, (option z, assisted living at over $7400 a month), that was really nice, but we wouldn't feel comfortable around those people, they're all rich and we're not."""	0
rather than argue that yes they could afford the place for several years, i followed one of the teachings of teepa snow and just paraphrased.	0
"""you wouldn't be comfortable there."""	0
"""no, we wouldn't."""	0
again, i'm not going to argue, they just feel it's too much money, and it's their money.	0
"""ok, well if you've decided you're going to stay here in your house, i'd like to talk to you about a few things we might do to make it safer and easier on you."""	0
"i mentioned a couple things, and then dad said, ""oh, we don't intend to stay here."	0
"originally you said april 1, and we're still planning on being out of here by then."""	0
i was shocked, because they've rejected every place i showed them.	0
"""where do you plan on going?"""	0
"""oh, that first place you showed us was pretty nice."""	0
"""but dad, you yourself took that one off the table because it's independent living and you said mom needed more care than that."""	0
"""yes, but we've thought it over and maybe we could make it work."""	0
well hmm.	0
i had given up on that place because the entire family says they need to be in an assisted living facility, not independent living.	0
the record so far is that they saw this place, rejected it, called me to say they changed their minds, accepted it, then reconsidered and rejected it, and now tell me that they think it's where they want to go.	0
this level of indecision could be an indicator that they truly do need a place with more care, or, and i don't want to miss this, that they do indeed agree to move, but only to a place we don't want them to go!	0
i think maybe i need to call a family council and see if i can get agreement that even if they want to go somewhere we don't approve, we will all do our best to support them.	0
at least it will get them out of their unsafe house with the high step between the kitchen and family room and into a place just four minutes from my house instead of 20-25.  however, i believe it will be a tough sale to some of the family and there will be division, something i don't want, and who knows, tomorrow my parents might change their minds again!	0
i'll keep you posted.	0
thanks to those who are following along.	0
hi all,  i am hoping that someone from the medical community will see my post and is able to shed some light on the information i have discovered last week.	0
long story short, my husband  who was adopted as a child recently found his birth mother.	0
through her he found out that his maternal grandfather died of ftd at a rather young age.	0
ftd is a inherited disease and my husband is scared that he might have it.	0
his birth mother chose not to get tested, but he just really wants to know if he has the gene or not.	0
we both did some ancestral research a few years back and still have our dna raw data.	0
i requested a promethease report and looked for grn in his dna data.	0
this is what showed up:  rs6966915(c;c) and tmem106b genes as well as  rs9897526(g;g) grn genes and rs112039851(g;g) agrn genes.	0
i am mostly worried about rs6966915(cc) and tmem106b genes since everything i read about says it is strongly linked to ftd.	0
i do not fully understand all this information and i would greatly appreciate it if someone could explain it to me.	0
we will certainly get a professional dna evaluation in the near future, but this could still take weeks or months.	0
&#x200b; thank you so much in advance for taking your time to respond.	0

dad went into the er last week after really struggling with his balance.	0
he was admitted and after a couple days things were looking up.	0
but in the last 5 days they discovered an infection in his blood, and today told my mother it had spread into his liver and muscles, and there is nothing they can do.	0
we are meeting with palliative care on monday.	0
we are leaving to take him a soft fuzzy blanket.	0
it hasn't hit me yet, but i'm really fighting off the tears.	0
just sort of an update on our situation.	0
grandpa's been home for a couple months now but isn't making much progress with muscle development, mostly because he doesn't do anything unless you tell him to.	0
we haven't been able to put him in a nursing home before now because of a medicine he was on, but he's been weaned off that now.	0
so now, the pressure is getting him strong enough to transfer before i find a new job.	0
i gave my grandpa the come to jesus talk today- that if he doesn't start taking his health seriously and actually put in the work to drink enough water and do his exercise throughout the day, every day, whether someone is with him or not, he won't get strong enough to walk or transfer, and if he can't transfer, he can't stay here.	0
he only gets two more baths with medicare and they're starting to reduce pt and ot so the clock is ticking.	0
and honestly, no matter what, i'll be relieved.	0
hes probably not going to do his exercise so he'll probably be moving out, which would be an enormous burden off my mom's shoulders.	0
she's not that much younger than my grandpa and she's in rough shape too.	0
i really want her to be able to enjoy her retirement without destroying her body and mind trying to care for my grandpa like sisyphus pushing the boulder up that hill...	0
hi, everyone!	0
i am a fourth-year professional communication student at ryerson university and i am completing my final research assignment on women experiencing dementia in long-term care facilities in ontario.	0
more specifically, i am looking to explore how crafting can be used as an alternative enrichment therapy.	0
it shouldnt take more than 5 minutes and it is completely anonymous.	0
i would greatly appreciate your input - any response is a valuable response.	0
thanks in advance!	0

something i've noticed in my ddad and just wondering if anyone else has as well in their loved ones.	0
i can tell when my dad is having a bad cognitive day by his facial expression.	0
to sound crazy by his lips expression.	0
his upper lip juts forward prominently and is very noticable.	0
i can also tell of course by the look in his eyes and his face.	0
but the lip is a strong giveaway.	0
i dont know what to do.	0
my country isnt in quarantine and people tend to ignore the threat of covid, including my siblings.	0
they treat me like im paranoid, we had a couple of fights when they went to see our parents - often after a party or a trip to another city - and i protested.	0
last time sil lied that their family had had confirmed covid, and when i said that things dont add up (they dont) she stopped talking to me.	0
now they want to take mom to egypt for a birthday vacation.	0
she is 77, with cardiovascular, neurological and lung issues.	0
im terrified.	0
they say that they want her to have a good time and im preventing her from feeling alive.	0
i just dont want her to risk, especially since the vaccinations have already started!	0
they dont give a fuck.	0
unfortunately, my country is lagging behind in terms of vaccinations, so they are not too wrong when they say itll never be over.	0
but its such a dumb risk.	0
my sister, by the way, had a pretty bad pneumonia and now deals with postcovid syndrome.	0
doesnt give a fuck.	0
how on earth can i stop this insanity?	0
my dad's turning 73 this year and he's spoken of opening his own company for 20+years now.	0
he recently googled the average life expectancy for men and it's suddenly this is the year to start up his company.	0
he's buying supplies pretty recklessly (that he can't really afford to be reckless about), and having arguments with my mum about how he won't be giving her any money when he's got his millions.	0
he's saying he's going to have a legal department, a real estate department, he's going to make me a shareholder etc.	0
not only this, he's recently got into singing on a karaoke social app.	0
at his peak, he was singing for up to 5 hours at a time and spending every waking minute obsessively checking the comments on this app, which are clearly from bots.	0
he was raving about how everyone loves him, how he's going to reach 100 000 followers next year, he even bought a guitar, earphone, a microphone.	0
said he was going to learn how to play the guitar and compose his own music and sell it and make it big.	0
it's been half a year and he's not used anything he's bought.	0
thankfully, his health issues are not too extensive, but his raving and frankly, delusional stories -  is it better to go along with it and just let him talk away at this point?	0
how do i resist the urge to want to snap at him when he's talking about his future big hit successes day in and day out?	0
he's always been like this, but it's getting worse with age.	0

just started a week or two ago, do any caregivers recognize side effects regarding appetite, mood in their loved ones or care receivers?	0
seeing lots of contradictory info on the web, waiting for pa reply.	0
my mother (59) lost her balance yesterday and thought she pulled a muscle, a few hours later she was feeling absolutely wretched, in excruciating pain- couldnt move, felt like she was going to vomit and pass out.	0
i was trying to take her to urgent care but she couldnt get out of the house, and we ended up calling an ambulance to take her to our local er.	0
several hours later, and following an x-ray that came back negative for any fractures (which was expected since she didnt really fall, more like tripped), they diagnosed her with sciatica and gave her some narcotics.	0
she still cant get comfortable or move well and is in a lot of pain.	0
i (32 yo daughter) am calling around for physical therapists that take her insurance and trying to get her a follow up appointment with her gp, but am otherwise somewhat clueless on how to help her.	0
shes pretty stubborn and doesnt want to be a burden.	0
im also concerned of the state she was in yesterday, sweating, nauseated, faint.	0
is this just from the pain?	0
should i be looking at anything else?	0
im also concerned about her losing balance in the first place.	0
should i be looking for a neurologist?	0
dementia's my greatest fear, and i want to help my grandpa - who has it - however i can.	0
i think he's in early to mid stage 4, but i'm not sure... he has stage 5 liver failure (i'm unsure what kind), smoked for most of his life and has some type of diabetes, so he's incredibly weak.	0
he can barely walk, doesn't speak much, and he seems really distant.	0
he still lives with my grandma, and he is rejecting the procedure that cleans out your blood (i forgot what it's called and can't find the name).	0
i wanna help him feel better, so i've been comforting him and giving him some of the gemstones i tumble when i visit, but i want to help more.	0
how can i?	0
my father just called from the hospital where he was sectioned under the mental heath act.	0
he remembers to call us (or to ask the nurse to call) but he forgets where he is (he thinks he's in a cafe) and tends to refuse to take the medicine he needs to.	0
we have been told he has alzheimers and it's in the mid to late stages.	0
he and i never got on.	0
he was very neglectful of me and wanted absolutely nothing to do with me.	0
he told me everything started going wrong when i was born.	0
he never hugged me, never told me he loved me and when he had to 'care' for me when my mother was working, he would ignore me.	0
he never spoke to me.	0
he has never been a family man and always hated us for 'taking away' his singlehood.	0
we argued a lot.	0
so today he called as i said and he seems lonely.	0
he asked me how i was (never did this before), he tells us he loves us and he wants us to call him.	0
i broke down because i felt like he was all alone and helpless and thinks we don't care about him.	0
i am not a vengeful person so i don't take the attitude of 'you never cared for me so i won't feel for you' but it's very hard dealing with this new person that i feel emotionally responsible for.	0
he can't make himself happy any more because he is no longer independent.	0
he keeps forgetting he has dementia and they have to remind him in the hospital but he is very heartbroken when they tell him.	0
he thinks he is coming home but he will be going into a home because we cannot manage (again he won't take his medicine and he will keep leaving the house at all hours which is very worrying).	0
this is extremely difficult and i am terrified about when he finds this out.	0
i'm just confused by it all.	0
this is a kinder man and a lonely one and i feel so sad for him.	0
i can't process that he is this needy person.	0
how have you managed dealing with being needed by a person who never liked/wanted you?	0
the amount of frustration i have for my family right now is indescribable.	0
my grandma is having such a hard time in her day to day.	0
losing key, money and feeling like shes losing her mind.	0
recently shes been unable to control her emotions which is completely out of character.	0
my grandma has been more of a mother figure in my life, so to see her like this is hard.	0
all she wants and all she talks about is how alone she feels and how nobody comes around to visit besides me and shes scared to lose me.	0
what bothers me the most is my mom doesnt do anything to help, nothing, she doesnt have a job so shes home all day watching tv and occasionally runs errands.	0
talking to her about it is dishearteningi have mentioned whats our plan with grandma, she needs structure.	0
visits from everyone even if its just 10 mins.	0
shes been crying from loneliness and its getting scary for her.	0
my mom says shes too busy and my grandma is too crazy.	0
its unfuckingbelievable.	0
the fact that this is the response makes me look at my mother in such a horrible light.	0
why cant she take stop by and take her for a walk, why cant she run errands and bring her along.	0
i dont fucking get it!	0
at least call!	0
her excuses are so pathetic.	0
oh man i was busy today really could pick up the phone?	0
but you can scroll on social media.	0
its just frustrating.	0
i dont mind visiting my grandma, i need her as much as she needs me.	0
when we hang out we talk, have coffee and practice breathing exercises to practice meditation.	0
ive noticed when shes able to slow down she starts acting like herself again.	0
its when shes left alone she starts taking a turn.	0
shes consistently overwhelmed with stress and paranoia bc of my uncle (50m) hes a homeless & an addict.	0
my uncle fights, steals and argues with her constantly.	0
he stops by her house to wash up and he bitches for not letting him inside so he undermines her ad washes up in the backyard.	0
this is a huge trigger for her.	0
i dont understand why everyone is ignoring this its like there just waiting for her to die bc they dont know what to do or they dont care either way its sad and soo disappointing.	0
my mom specifically, she has time to help and all she says is grandma is losing it shes crazy i dont know what to do.	0
my question is where do i start on getting her on a better path?	0
how can i get her in a routine without it being too abrupt ?	0
how can i help her with her anxiety & panic attacks?	0
i have recently changed her diet, attempting to get her a bit more active and reading to her in the morning.	0
getting her out of her head has been the biggest challenge but im noticing this is helping her be more present and relaxed.	0
open to suggestions?	0
?	0
forgive me if this is me rambling but i need advice.	0
my grandmother is 89 years old.	0
she was 1 of 7 kids, but now she and her brother are the only 2 left.	0
my grandfather (her husband) died 7 years ago so she was living on her own.	0
she doesn't drive and was dependent on her brother, son (my father) and daughter (my aunt) to care for her, picking her up, go grocery shopping etc.	0
as she got older and more forgetful she was too stubborn to go into assisted living, and we couldn't afford an aid.	0
subsequently, my parents sold their house to move into hers and take care of her.	0
they've been living there for 5 months.	0
my father and mother are still working full time and do the best they can.	0
my grandmother was not happy about the situation but there was no other alternative available.	0
my parents were forced to invade her space and its cause a lot of turmoil.	0
my grandmother's short term memory is shot, she forgets what she has eaten for lunch, lies that she has eaten when she hasn't.	0
she refuses to drink water and only drinks instant coffee.	0
if it's not us forcing and fighting her to eat she is eating sweets.	0
she can't allow anyone to take care of her except my aunt and my sister (the angels in the family).	0
she fabricates and makes up stories that my father is yelling at her or hurting her, and it creates this aura that is just depressing and negative in the house.	0
living in the house she is always making sure to watch over my mother like a hawk.	0
she does not trust my mom to do laundry, to cook.	0
to clean (my mom is in her 60's).	0
mt grandmother constantly wears the same clothing, which is 4 sizes too big, it doesn't fit her so she rolls the waist up and the cuffs up on her pants to fit.	0
"she constantly says ""i'm next"" as if she is going to die next."	0
her memory loss results in her being hypersensitive to situations.	0
she cries and is depressed and doesn't really try anymore.	0
it came to a head today when we were together.	0
in the past we bought her 4 pairs of pants that fit her that would replace the jeans that are too big on her.	0
"we constantly say ""where are the pants we bought you to wear that fit why are you wearing pants that don't fit you."""	0
she was eating cookies and refusing to eat dinner.	0
i said to her that she always complains that she's tired or doesnt feel good but why do you think that is, because you don't eat right and refuse to eat things that are good for you and your not wearing clothes that fit you.	0
"she goes ""well it doesn't matter because im giving up"" and then i said why are you saying that why are you giving up, she goes because all you do is say i'm not dressing the right way and i don't eat the right things and i can't do anything and she stormed to her room and stayed there."	0
i understand that i can seem as if i am berating her and to just leaver her alone and let her do her thing but when she is left alone to do her own thing she starts fires in the house on the stove, eats melted microwaved plastic etc.	0
my parents are tired emotionally dealing with her stubbornness, we cant hire an aid and i she said she will never let an aid into her house, she wont leave her house, she wont accept help.	0
she makes me feel like shit because i feel badly that she's upset making me feel like i did something wrong because shes not taking care of herself.	0
the only happy medium is when her daughter comes or my sister comes for a visit but thats only for a few hours.	0
can anyone give me advice on what we can do because there's no logical reasoning going on for to have valid conversations anymore.	0
i just started this movie.	0
i'm only like 20 minutes in and it's got my blood boiling.	0
after begging for medicaid for a year and a half, just to get her the help she needed, her alzhimers took a nose dive two weeks ago.	0
thankfully, her insurance did cover hospice, or i would have had to handle this all alone.	0
we had hospice 24/7 care for a week and a half.	0
that is the only help ever.	0
mom passed early friday morning july 17th.	0
thank you for all your kind words and some giggles to keep us going.	0
oh!	0
and her appeal for medicaid?	0
still scheduled for july 28th.	0
i plan to use my time telling them right where they can shove their appeal.	0
i havent posted to reddit in years, literally.	0
i visit when i have an issue - i think i have two separate accounts, i have no idea.	0
sorry for my lack of involvement in such an amazing community.	0
sharing and intimacy are not my strong point.	0
i put my 82 yr mom (she has dementia, copd, and stage 4 kidney disease)and her brother in assisted living july 3, 2019.  he died from a massive heart attack two days after i moved him in.	0
this is a whole other sad, separate story.	0
i feel so terrible about that, but this post is mainly about my mom.	0
the only positive thing about my uncles passing is the money he left my mom in his life insurance.	0
without that, she wouldnt be able to afford care at all.	0
life brings gifts through loss - ive been seeing that more and more since ive gotten older.	0
she resents me for moving her there.	0
every day i get two phone calls or more.	0
one is to tell me that she no longer likes me, that ive broken her heart, abandoned her.	0
the next call is a teary apology full of self loathing - this one saddens me the most.	0
the last thing i ever wanted to do was hurt my mom - i moved her to keep her safe.	0
i live 3000 miles away from her, my brother lived 45 minutes away from her and was no help.	0
i have always handled everything - paid her bills, i set up a caretaker when she lived at her home, arranged her doctors appointments, visited 2-3 times a year, gave her money when she ran out  (social security is a joke).i dont need a pat on the back for any of this.	0
i did it because its what you do for someone you love.	0
i often did this from other countries - my work involves travel.	0
sometimes i dont even know how i managed to do all of the things.	0
i know its going to take time for her to adjust.	0
i am so anxious about her, so sad that shes unhappy.	0
the relief ive felt knowing shes taken care of has been surpassed by this tremendous sadness and guilt.	0
im grateful to find this community and have taken great comfort in reading posts.	0
i can only hope this will all get better in time.	0
im venting, this is long but i need advice and someone to tell.	0
im 20 and my grandma has had dementia for the last couple years, shes slowly deteriorating but this year has been the hardest for me.	0
mainly because of how aware i became of the issues and her situation.	0
she lives in the midwest and i live and grew up on the east coast so i didnt get to see her a lot when i was growing up.	0
i didnt love going to her house as a kid because i just always felt a homesick and there wasnt a lot going on over there and i could never sleep.	0
as i became a teenager it definitely became more manageable but i still didnt see her a lot because i was in sports and school and whatever the excuses.	0
she lives with my grandpa still who is just a old fart and used to order her around the house all the time and her son (my uncle) has lived there his whole life and hes just a lost soul who drinks, he means well.	0
the dynamic of that house is the last bit ideal for someone with dementia too.	0
its just low vibes and my uncle doesnt really get along with my grandpa and its just a mess.	0
theres not enough interaction or high energy to keep her wheels turning.	0
im also 1/2 grandchildren and the only girl in my family since my grandma had all boys, and the other grandkid is a boy.	0
anyways i feel an immense guilt and responsibility to go and help her and take care of her.	0
from never seeing her a kid and knowing she always wanted a daughter and i was the closets thing to a daughter and i never even got to see her.	0
and i didnt like calling her when i was kid and i wish i wouldve just called her.	0
i feel like i missed out on years of love and stories from her and she missed them from me.	0
i didnt even give her a chance.	0
or so it feels.	0
my only problem is that i would have to pick up my whole life and move to missouri, im in arizona.	0
and it just feels like i could be doing so much to help her and make these last years really amazing for her.	0
and if i dont go im going to live with the guilt of not being the best granddaughter i couldve been, i dont even feel like i was a good one at all.	0
it took me 20 years to realize how much i truly love and care about her, i just wish i wouldve called her more growing up and seen her more.	0
it was just because i didnt want to or feel like it or just because it was awkward sometimes.	0
i call her as much as i can now but its hard and draining.	0
i always cry and spiral and she always mentions to me that i should come visit her.	0
she deserves the world and i just wish i could give it to her.	0
i hope this all made sense, i just got off the phone with her so im emotional and all over the place and conflicted.	0
i just need some advice or a sweet message lol	0
she died in her sleep this morning around 11 am, eyes closed and arm tucked under her head fast asleep.	0
98 years old.	0
i did my duty.	0
i completed my promise.	0
i desperately wish i knew where she was now.	0
she's in the room next me, but not really.	0
i cant stop going in to her room to check on her, and hold her hand.	0
on sunday i had to make the difficult decision to remove care from my husband.	0
he has been in the hospital since 9/24 due to an initial lvad failure leading to sepsis multiple times, multiple organ failure and ecmo.	0
the hardest part of it all was he was finally improving and getting stronger, we were both able to see the light at the end of the tunnel, just didnt realize it was a train.	0
the final decision was basically made for me because he had two strokes and his lt side was paralyzed, he was barely able to speak and he would not have wanted to live that way.	0
he told us the afternoon before removing care he was going home.	0
saturday i made the decision not to escalate care hoping he would pass without me feeling like i killed my husband, however he held on all night.	0
finally at 430a on 2/21 i had them disconnect his lvad and they turned off the bp meds (gave him some atavian and morphine prior to this for comfort) and he passed within minutes.	0
im so lost and broken.	0
the doctors even told me i didnt kill him, i just got out of the way of the boulder rolling down the hill.	0
just so hard.	0
i care for an elderly relative that i have seen through two stints in rehab that were more stressful for me than for the patient.	0
their distress and pain was new and hard for me.	0
everyday i watched them struggle with the electric controls for the bed that they could not master in the over 50 days they stayed there.	0
now two years later they cannot correctly put on an oxygen tube.	0
we have to switch 6 times or more a day to portable tank and they can get it in the nose but cannot get not over the ears.	0
they twist it and put it under the ears and it is fine, oxygen gets delivered but the tubes are crossed on thier cheeks and hang in front of the mouth.	0
i correct them every time, i have showed them in a mirror and the brain cannot get this done.	0
it is amazing to me, that some one can use a smart phone ( mostly) and get this simple action down.	0
can anyone relate?	0
my father unfortunately has severe tooth decay and we found out that he needs to undergo a tooth extraction tomorrow to deal with the affected teeth.	0
he is at the point where he no longer recognizes what the dentist is for and refuses to open his mouth or follow instructions, so they ruled he would need to undergo general anesthesia to avoid him struggling or refusing to cooperate during the surgery.	0
my question is are there issues i should be worried about with him undergoing anesthetic for this surgery?	0
he would be out for a while as they will need to deal with a couple of teeth as well as putting in dental implants.	0
should i be worried or concerned?	0
hi.....new here..... my dad suffers with primary progressive multiple sclerosis for years now, and at times i suffer with him.	0
i am also very lonely(how selfish of me lol), have no friends nor someone special who truly knows or understands me(what i am going through), these feelings are severe sometimes but i manage lol.	0
i don't exactly know why i post this, because i am lonely and bored, just needed to vent.... is there anyone from israel here?	0
hello, so my mum has mid-late stage alzheimers and for the past few months ive noticed she begins violently shaking, particularly in her legs and arms when she is unsure of what to do (i.e.	0
she is asked to take her shoes off but doesnt know what that means) or when she feels shes done something wrong (like toileting accidents).	0
i cant find any mention of shaking other than in lbd and parkinsons.	0
any ideas of what it could be?	0
anxiety?	0
overloading?	0
i'm guessing there's not much to be done in this situation - i'm just venting a bit, hope that's ok.  my mom has got ftd and won't stop eating, i make all the dinners and bigger meals and try to make healthy food but she makes herself sandwhiches constantly inbetween meals.	0
i hear her in the middle of the night in the kitchen making food.	0
often she'll start making a sandwhich and tell me that's she's peckish since she hasn't eaten anything all day - in reality it's her fourth breakfast of the day.	0
she was a little chubby all her life but after she got ftd she ballooned up to 140 kilos / 308 lbs @ like 160 cm / 5 feet 2 inches i don't want to start becoming the food police that knocks the sandwhich out of her hands or lock the fridge or anything like that, i want her to have some dignity in what's probably the last few years before she moves into an institution but it's getting pretty bad.. fuck this disease, i'm so tired of worrying and thinking all the time about this situation	0
i've in texas and have been trying to move my parents to an assisted living facility for a month.	0
the first co-ordinator was great, but she was transferred and now we have the new guy.	0
every time i think we are ready to move he tosses a curve ball our way.	0
first it was the paper work.	0
we had to get a dr to sign off on the move.	0
my dad uses the va.  hospice took two weeks.	0
they faxed it,  the facility didn't get it, etc.	0
we filled out all the paperwork in the intro packet, but wait there's more.	0
they aren't taking a lot of stuff, so we were going to move them ourselves.	0
i have been talking about that for a couple of weeks 2 days before the planned me he tells me i have to use a moving company that has negative covid tests and uses proper ppe.	0
i know this makes sense.	0
but he should have mentioned it sooner.	0
the new target date for the move is monday.	0
anyway.	0
nobody is happy about the move, but mom is stage 6 alzheimers.	0
what can i do help them settle in?	0
my dad just started taking it 2 days ago and hes having bad side effects, (increased anxiety, headaches, fatigue, shakiness and its made him dizzier and unable to walk on his own at all) i know its normal for the first few weeks but worried itll be permanent or something since he has lbd.	0
i called the dr and he said to cut the pills in half and the side effects will go away in about 2 weeks.	0
i also take lexapro so i had similar symptoms when i started but they went away pretty quick for me (23 f) but im just a little worried about him taking them.	0
hi i'm andrea muraskin, a journalist.	0
around the end of last year i posted in this subreddit looking for a story about caregiving and several people generously offered to speak with me.	0
it was an honor to tell one of these stories.	0
leslie's mom's generation had a difficult relationship with their father, but leslie and her grandpa shared a special bond.	0
that's why when his alzheimer's progressed, she became his full-time caregiver.	0
leslie talked about why she quit facebook, the free labor of women and how love can heal.	0

this is part rant, and part asking for advice.	0
my 82 year old father has collected coins, stamps and plates over his lifetime.	0
i suspect 95% or more is basically worthless.	0
he keeps telling me he needs 2 full days to explain his collections and what to do with them after he passes.	0
i can barely stand 5 minute phone calls, as he rambles, repeats himself, and dives deep into the weeds of whatever topic.	0
he probably has undiagnosed brain damage or mild retardation his whole life, and despite wanting to be kind to him, i simply don't have any patience left.	0
he's like a snail - a cranky snail - and i'm like super sonic jet, and the conversations are often akin to those with an 8 year old child.	0
okay, ranting over, thanks!	0
so i avoid the 2 day torture,  i mean talk.	0
that's an easy one, i've been dodging it for years.	0
"so here's where i'd like advice:  my father is valuing his collections with very old, printed price sheets,  and sincerely believes 1989, 1995 price sheets are a valid way to estimate the value of his ""investments""."	0
he also regales me with stamp collecting profits when he sold stamps in the mail (1982?).	0
in the past, i've taken the position that letting him continue to think his things have value (i.e.	0
believe in santa claus) couldn't hurt, and why not let him have fun.	0
i guess what's changed is that my mother passed, so her influence is gone, his health is declining, and i'm just so damn tired of listening to him.	0
so do i get him new price lists, if they are even available in print.	0
he doesn't use smart phones or computers, so he'd never find anything online.	0
i guess i'm asking if i should take away what joy he has in his things.	0
"i feel like i should just let him keep believing what he wants, and continue to dodge the ""talk"", but somehow i think things have changed and i can't keep doing the same thing i have for years."	0
also, i'm resentful as i will have to clear his hoarded stuff one day.	0
edit:  the talks are in person, and i'm required to sit in a chair and listen.	0
i can't even day dream, nothing.	0
i'm required to pay full attention to his every word.	0
if he gets distracted, he starts all over.	0
most recently, i was required to sit and listen for 3 straight hours.	0
i pinched a nerve or something, and my left arm is hot/cold, throbbing in pain.	0
he knew i was in constant pain and tired and kept talking and talking.	0
for.	0
three.	0
hours.	0
i'm not the b**** some posters think i am.	0
and he's not a just cute, sad old man.	0
not to mention the decades he terrorized me when he was drinking.	0
as a science journalist, my daily mission is to make complex topics accessible to all audiences.	0
having just finished reading the problem of alzheimers, i can tell you that this book meets that mission.	0
caregivers, persons living with alzheimers, policymakers, historians, and researchers will each find a portion seemingly crafted for them and the remainder equally engaging.	0
this isn't your typical alzheimer's book, filled with fad diets and horror stories.	0
dr. karlawish, the co-director the penn memory center who talks frequently about how we need to learn to live with this disease until there is a treatment, recaps the history of alzheimer's, how politics and science worked together or against one another, the current state of clinical trials and his vision for the future.	0
it's hopeful but honest.	0
highly recommend.	0
is it not required under ada or some other equivalent for doctor offices to have at least some type of mobility/disability friendly equipment?	0
not a single chair in this clinic has arms so im having to hold my grandmother up.	0
theyve covered all the furniture with plastic and there are no backs or arms to the chairs so she cant sit up because theres nothing to hold herself up with.	0
theres also no ramps, steps everywhere, and no rails.	0
which seems unacceptable since this clinic seems to specialize in geriatric care.	0
wife is not a small woman.	0
"while she has blessed me with voluptuously ""assets"" that we/i enjoy, she also has some rolls due to being so much of her to love and adore."	0
last night, she mentioned in passing as we were treating one of here sweat/heat skin tears (which maybe happen once every couple of months), she wondered if a dab of deodorant now and again might help keeping the sweat away from these spots and prevent both of us smelling like a+d ointment.	0
usual spots are on her sides of her chest, and under her belly, so it's not near any of the juicy bits or other body openings.	0
we've already raised 3 kids (twins even) and our nostrils, while willing to smell like a+d, don't really enjoy the smell.	0
"""passion fruit"" while 100% artificial, smells so much better."	0
and i figure the reddit collective is  good place to solicit feedback and ideas from.	0
let me know, and hopefully you got a chuckle.	0
my mother is transitioning into hospice today.	0
she is returning to her home in a rural area of texas, to be cared for at home by my father, a family friend, and myself.	0
she is 63 and has private health insurance.	0
we are currently being told by her caseworker that her insurance only covers 1 hour of a home health aid's help per day.	0
she is in a wheelchair, unable to get from seated/lying to standing, unable to roll onto her side or hold herself on her side on her own, has a continent ostomy (k-pouch) she can no longer intubate on her own, a nephrostomy she is unable to care for, and despite the nephrostomy, she continues to experience both urinary incontinence and vaginal bleeding, meaning she has pads that need to be changed multiple times a day.	0
she presently has bed sores after a protracted hospital stay that need to be cleaned and dressed multiple times a day.	0
most of her strength and mobility issues have developed in the last 6 weeks, while she was in the hospital for an extended period of time.	0
my father had her home for a week after the hospital stay, while my brother and his wife were there, and while she was back in the hospital this week, he expressed to me he is physically incapable of managing her care on his own.	0
the family friend who is coming to help is also in her 60s and has significant mobility and health issues herself.	0
my mother has 6 inches and 60 lbs on me.	0
i'm not going to be able to manage all the lifting and turning.	0
i know we're going to need more professional support.	0
"there is no way the three of us can change her pads and dressings every 2-3 hours, which is what she's been receiving in the hospital, but the response from her caseworker has been a big ol' ""oh, well."""	0
i am overwhelmed by the prospect of having to manage her physical care--especially since she's mad at my dad and is threatening to have him go stay with my aunt and uncle until she dies.	0
(long story.	0
she's alienated 2 of her 3 siblings and my brother at this point.	0
even if other people wanted to help, she won't let them in the house, and i believe her when she says she wants to kick my dad out.)	0
is there anything else we can do to get more care, short of paying out of pocket for more in-home care?	0
i can't see indefinitely paying $20/hr for round-the-clock care, when it could be several weeks before she passes.	0
the caseworker has not been very helpful.	0
my dad currently wants a divorce from my mom cause he believes she's keeping all their money for herself.	0
my mom would absolutely love a divorce so everyone is in agreement there.	0
the issue for me who is my dads power of attorney is that i assume mom will have to give my dad her half of her 401k money as he doesn't have any 401k money of his own and most their assets are there.	0
this will mean a lot of money is placed in his bank account.	0
my dad cannot handle money and is highly likely to be scammed.	0
he will want direct access to all his accounts.	0
i don't think limiting his phone contacts alone is enough.	0
"his few ""friends"" are all a bunch of leeches."	0
throughout his whole life, he has always given away money to people or hires his friends to do projects for him where they grossly overcharge him.	0
he uses money to buy friends.	0
it'll probably be even worse now with dementia.	0
i can also easily see a gold digger wanting to marry him to take him for every penny he's got (he will brag about money).	0
how do i make sure he doesn't lose everything?	0
summary: after +17 years of battling parkinson's disease for many years, things have taken a turn for the worse.	0
she has been admitted to the hospital since sat and we have been informed she is not going to make it.	0
question: should we tell our mother that she is dying?	0
is that fair or unfair?	0
especially since she has dementia and is not able to retain new memories.	0
from doing my own online research, seems like it's 50 /50.	0
"1 part is that if i try to time it and tell her when she is ""present"" would that give her time to grieve and maybe accept the situation so if she needs time to resolve anything?"	0
"her ""present"" time varies from 2mins to 20 mins?"	0
(all estimating.... honestly it's getting harder to tell).	0
or second part to that is: is that mean?	0
especially since she might not even remember or when she does will just be sad and shouldn't we be trying to keep her comfortable and happy instead?	0
*additional information: she is not able to swallow or if she manages to somehow swallow a little bit, she will either throw it back up or it'll negatively effect her lungs.	0
we have tried feeding tubes and other measures, she doesn't like it and yanks everything out even with straps in place.	0
*we have tried everything...... with the many doctors at the hospital.	0
we have accepted and come to terms with what's happening to her.	0
just really really really don't know whether to let her know or just act like everything is fine and that she will be okay.	0
she's currently mostly fiesty and angry because she thinks she's being left at the hospital or a nursing home (feeling abandoned) even though our whole family is taking shifts to try to be with her as much as we can while she is here.	0
"tried to explain over and over again that we can't discharge her and leave just because she's ""over it""."	0
not sure how long she will last, but expected anything from 3 days to 3 weeks.	0
god, i hope she goes quickly....... sounds so messed up, but i don't want her to suffer more and this is such a large traumatic experience for the whole family.	0
what's sad is seeing her fight and be angry all the time.	0
i understand her condition and she is not herself, which is why i wonder if we should just be honest with her?	0
or am i wanting to tell her so she knows it's okay to let go?	0
- and why does that feel like i'm being selfish and copping out?	0
any advice, tips or recommendations are very appreciated.	0
parkinson's, dementia and everything else up and down the list just sucks.	0
i know there's allot of us out there with a loved one who is literally deteriorating in front of us, i get that we're not alone and understand that it's the disease that's affecting her, but it still sucks.	0
thank you.	0
its currently 12:47, and everyones in bed.	0
i get up to go pee, quietly, and my grandfather yells what was that??	0
i thought he thought i was an intruder so i say me, pops??	0
and he says that someone was banging on pans and asked if i was.	0
i said i was in the bathroom.	0
i heard no pans, and the cats are all asleep, same with my brothers and parents.	0
he woke up startled.	0
i dont know what happened.	0
was it a dream or hallucinations?	0
this has never happened before.	0
my (26 m) father (56 m) has early onset dementia and according to his neurologist it is progressing rapidly.	0
this has been very difficult to cope with for me and my family, as my dad started showing symptoms a couple of years ago at a rather young age.	0
none of my friends/peer can really relate so i dont really have anywhere else to go and talk about this.	0
ive been stuck for awhile now because i am working a pretty good job now and can afford to move out and think it would be beneficial for me to move out and maybe relocate to the city like ive always wanted (about an hour away from my family home).	0
however, i feel this tremendous guilt about moving out since my dad is regressing so rapidly.	0
im not sure what to do and its really eating at me.	0
i have two younger siblings who will be home for awhile and some other family comes by and helps out here and there, but leaving to move into the city and have fun while the time left with my dad is numbered makes me feel so guilty.	0
has anyone else been through anything similar?	0
on one hand i think it would be really good for my personal growth but on the other im not sure if it is the right thing to do.	0
my dad and i have always been really close and i am also afraid of upsetting him more by moving out.	0
as things currently are now i work a lot and when im not working i am trying to catch up with life with things like going to the gym and seeing friends so i was thinking maybe if i moved out the time i would be spending with my dad would be more quality time idk.	0
im sorry for the long ramblings, but like i said i feel so stuck and dont know who i can turn to and talk about this stuff.	0
hi guys.	0
im 19, and my 90 year old grandmother was recently diagnosed with dementia, and while her long-term memory is still intact for the time being, the future has been weighing heavily on the family.	0
recently, ive been thinking more critically about preventative habits and how to increase mine and my moms chances of not having it.	0
but im worried that its already too late, particularly for my mom.	0
a couple of years ago, there was an incident where my mom forgot her own phone number :( it hasnt happened again so far, but its stuck with me and knowing what i know now about dementia, its very worrying that something like that happened.	0
even though im young, ive had some concerning memory problems as well.	0
in 2019, i went through a period of forgetting how to spell and pronounce basic words and getting my words jumbled.	0
it stopped for a while, but recently the word jumbling has made a return.	0
i should note that as a kid and younger teenager, i was always verbose and very familiar with a wide range of vocabulary words.	0
so i was never someone who had trouble reading or speaking, at all.	0
ive been thinking about genetic testing, but i almost dont want to find out.	0
im so terrified for my mom.	0
more than i am for me.	0
the thought of watching her deteriorate the way my grandmother has absolutely destroys me.	0
and at such a young age (53).	0
i dont want the signs to be there, but im so worried that its already begun.	0
my aunt has some memory issues but today alarmed me as she forgot what year it was.	0
i got a card in the mail from her today and it was dated 2002. i called to thank her and questioned her about it.	0
i assumed it was just a simple mistake.	0
i asked her if she knew what year it was and she said yes its 2002. and after i told her it was 2021 she was all flustered and couldnt believe she didnt know.	0
she often misunderstands things she hears and forgets things weve just told her.	0
for example, on the news it said that the virus was coming in waves but she mistook it as, the virus is in the waves of the ocean.	0
sometimes she forgets that i call her and forgets full on conversations.	0
is there anything i can do?	0
she sometimes lies about things for seemingly no reason too but im not sure if theyre entirely lies.	0
or if she imagines things and believes what shes imagined up.	0
shes just turned 65.	0
it is hitting me very hard today about the real possibility of losing my mom to cancer since it has spread throughout her body .	0
i can't stop crying.	0
i keep thinking about how last thanksgiving was probably my last one with her and it is very depressing.	0
when i am around her i do not cry and try to stay positive but it is very hard.	0
how do you manage this emotional rollercoaster?	0
?	0
my dad passed a couple years ago and my mom has basically given up, even tho she hated him.	0
i don't even want to be in the house anymore, it's so beyond disgusting.	0
her kitchen yesterday: https://i.imgur.com/cvvjc5f.jpg  i went over to fix a plumbing issue yesterday, honestly not a big issue, but i couldn't do it.	0
the smell and dog shit everywhere, was just so overwhelming, not to mention her mentality.	0
not that she's that bad verbally, but hearing the same lies, self inflicted issues and bs over and over, it's beyond my patience.	0
a skill i never gained.	0
i want to be able to love/help her like the amazing mother she was while raising me.	0
nowadays, most any time we talk and especially when i go out there, i need a shitload of alcohol after.	0
she won't listen to me or anyone else and feel so helpless/worthless.	0
sorry, i guess more of a rant.	0
extra frustrating because i was always taught to learn, make money and be successful, which i did.	0
very little i can't do, but basically the most important thing in my life, i can't seem to do anything about.	0
hopefully anyone else dealing with this, handles it better than i can.	0
he doesn't need or want a power lift chair.	0
he can stand up from a kitchen chair or from our couch which is more upright than his recliner.	0
just can't get up from his recliner.	0
the base is circular so cannot just add risers	0
original post can be found at: https://old.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lqupp2/im_just_gonna_rant_thats_all/ well, the timing couldn't be better!	0
i just got around to today's mail, and there's a letter from my attorneys indicating things are moving forward!	0
"the local courthouse is now open for this sorta thing: ""you have our correspondence of february 9, 2021, regarding a recent order entered by the court, including relating to covid-19."	0
enclosed herewith please find a draft of a proposed correspondence john q. doe, guardian ad litem.	0
also enclosed please find a motion for examination by physician.	0
"[more legal stuff]"" i have been waiting since march, 2020 to get this letter!"	0
"""motion for examination by physician""."	0
thank you all for your support!	0
yes, i had their letter from february 9th from the courthouse (regarding it opening back up), but i had no idea it was all going to happen so fast at that point!	0
hi, im a 21 year old college student and this is kind of odd for me to be sharing i suppose but at this point i kind of feel as though i should reach out in some way.	0
i work at a jewelry store in florida and my boss whom i respect greatly, has been taking care of his wife for some years now.	0
he is the owner of the store and also the jeweler and as a result of being a small business he bears a great burden at work, home, and financially.	0
while i believe i understand that there is little that can be done with the state of his store especially during a pandemic, i have to imagine that there is at least some feasible way out of the situation he has fallen into.	0
he simply is losing all grip on his own life and this wonderful caring man is not well.	0
he has no one to turn to to help him at home with his wife and has little financial ability to afford being able to keep her in any hospice.	0
it is sad to say, but at this point in his life, he sees the only way out for his wellbeing is her passing which is unpredictable.	0
the situation is thus.	0
my boss does not have as much money as many would imagine a jeweler to have and his wife is becoming too much of a full time job for him to just live.	0
he has only just recently reached out to a lawyer specializing in elderly law and he's being pushed to pay 3000 dollars a month to have her put in a facility that he doesn't have.	0
his prospects are not bright.	0
are there absolutely any resources that this man can pull from to help himself out that an older man might not be aware of or stubborn to use?	0
i simply wish the best for him as he has been kind to me and if i can even just suggest some sort of solution to help him get his wife out of his home and into a place where she can be taken care of thats reasonable financially, that would be great.	0
but i too am skeptical due to his unique situation.	0
i just hope someone here might have some sort of experience in any matter relating to this.	0

so my loved one is currently at a snf and the plan is for him to be released after a couple of weeks but he will need oxygen.	0
this was planned while he was in the hospital and they weren't sure if he would be sent home or go to the snf so today he got a rather rude call from the medical supply company wanting to verify the address and since he had just been moved there and was still confused who they were and who had ordered the oxygen, they hung up on him.	0
i called them back after getting the caller id number and it turned out the hospital had ordered it and i gave them the correct address and supposedly they're supposed to deliver it today.	0
it's a little early but i figured we'd get it over with and have the place ready for him for when he returns.	0
i know medicare is supposed to cover 80% of this, but how much is the remaining 20% going to cost him?	0
"i've googled and googled and just see ""medicare approved amount"" without an actual number."	0
i've also read that some companies charge thousands and thousands of dollars for a machine that costs them $500 so i'm not sure whether at some point we might decide to just buy a machine out of pocket or stick with the medicare dme rental.	0
i've also read that medicare pays for 36 months and the dme provider has to let us use it for 5 years but what happens if we have issues with a particular provider and want to change companies or just buy one ourself after say 1 year?	0
do we need to pay for the other 2 years that we didn't use the way we would with an apartment lease?	0
just got called to get our shots next week.	0
were both under 65 but have blood pressure issues so were in.	0
big load of worry off my mind for sure.	0
hi, my mother is calling me over and over and when i answer she acts like i called her and says, what?	0
she just got transferred to a temporary facility looking for long-term what do i do?	0
do i have them take her cell phone?	0
it's like she's stuck in a loop?	0
she calls anywhere from 60-160 times a day.	0
i don't know if the loop she's stuck in will preoccupy her and keep her busy or if it's making things worse?	0
basically, my dad yells at me for sleeping.	0
hes 68 and doesnt take his health seriously.	0
i am literally exhausted constantly.	0
he was demanding and entitled even before he got sick and old.	0
his sister, my aunt, just called, and asked if i was sleeping or would i help him.	0
i said i was very tired, and she said something to the effect of well, you know, he needs someone to get him ready!!	0
, then added that she could come over and sponge bathe him, but that she didnt even have time to shower yet (shes literally always late).	0
she does shit like this all the time, acting like because something needs to be done, its your fault if you physically cant.	0
so when bad things happen, i guess somebody has to be at fault?	0
this is a theme in our family.	0
it just makes me feel guilty whenever something goes wrong and im even marginally involved.	0
because maybe i am being lazier that i need to be?	0
edit: for financial, and other reasons, cant move out at the moment	0
i am my mothers legal financial and health poa.	0
can i get her mail transferred to my address?	0
she is incapable of having it.	0
not losing it.	0
etc.	0
my father has finally been diagnosed with alzheimer's but appears to be in denial.	0
he is in hospital under section but it's hard work for him to accept what the hospital staff are telling him.	0
he refuses to take one of the pills.	0
he keeps saying 'i'm not crazy'.	0
his heart rate is very slow and so he can't really take the full dose of the medicine he needs as they also slow the heart rate down so he is on a micro dose.	0
on this, he is quite lucid.	0
he actually phoned us today to tell us that when he gets home he is going to have a really big meal and he is looking forward to it.	0
it broke my heart.	0
he is not coming home.	0
he doesn't seem to know.	0
we had a meeting with hospital staff last week and they said we would not be able to manage at home.	0
he won't take the pill he should, he didn't agree to home help, he refuses to shower and he keeps wandering.	0
when he was still at home, he kept trying to leave at night and got angry if we didn't let him so we had to let him then we called the police (which they told us to do).	0
it's hard because i think if it was me, i would want to be at home however i would not want to cause my family stress by having to constantly watch me because i would keep wandering off.	0
today felt like a very difficult day as he is 'alert' today.	0
he was concerned for me and my mum and wanted to know how we were coping without him there.	0
he wanted to know his bank statement amount... all 'normal' stuff.	0
how do you deny someone so lucid the chance to be in their home that they worked for all their life?	0
were you in a similar situation?	0
how did you deal with this?	0
i care for my mother my past work was caregiver, i take care of my mother just as well or better than the patients i had!	0
i have a problem and am very hurt that my mother will not say thank you after bathing her or any other help it is rare that i get a thank you!	0
i suppose it is even silly of me to cry over it just as i am doing right this minute, i have always been a very polite person it just hurts it is like she dose not appreciate what i do, i noticed when my sister had been with her all day when i go out and come back that as my sister leaves my mother says thank you for all you did today, i do not get it at all !	0
just feeling down today but i have my faith snd gods strength  he will help me through it is not only that she can be difficult and stubborn!	0
but i love her to death she is 83 and has had a rough few months herself!	0
but when someone is helping you snd being there for you, i would think two little words!	0
thank you would not be hard.	0
my mother was just moved from a hospital to a temporary nursing facility until they can find a permanent one.	0
she won't stop crying i don't know how to cheer her up.	0
we can't even visit because of covid.	0
we can talk through the window but it feels like i'm at a zoo just sitting there watching her through the window crying on her bed.	0
i don't know what to do?	0
is this normal?	0
fuck covid.	0
fuck dementia.	0
my grandmother just met my cat through video chat.	0
"upon seeing him, she said: ""the cat is so cute!"	0
"why is he so small?"""	0
(he is not small.)	0
she was delighted to watch him.	0
this is so in contrast with her habitual words and phrases (you know what it's like) and i just want to share it.	0
&#x200b; (i'm currently with grandmother not cat.	0
she has since forgotten the video chat part and is now asking where the cat is, why he isn't running around, and whether we put him in a cage.)	0
looking for inspiration about how to have a loving conversation about taking away his car, which he is not safe to drive, and i don't think it will go well.	0
what is your story of tough love and tough conversations?	0

i'm 43 and my husband is 42.  although we don't know how long he has he just received a terminal diagnosis.	0
it could be 2 years it could be 10 years.	0
either way i know that he will spend the rest of his life miserable and i will spend the rest of his life taking care of him.	0
obviously, this is a huge blow to him emotionally.but i'm finding that every time i have any time alone i'm completely breaking down because i know i feel like my life has been ruined.	0
i feel terrible for being so selfish when i know what hes going through.	0
logically i know that it's only natural that i worry about my own well being.	0
but i can't shake the sense that i'm horrible for not focusing a 100% on his well being.it doesn't help that hes gotten understandably grumpier with me and that he gives me lots of push back when i try to make sure he hasaken medication.	0
i guess i'm just not turning out to be as graceful as i would like to be in this situation.	0
i don't know what i'm looking for i guess just to hear that it's normal to worry about yourself sometimes in to be scared about how dealing with a loved one's terminal illness is going to affect me as his wife and caregiver.	0
i hope tonight you are all experiencing the peace that i can't seem to find.	0
hi all!	0
my 90 yr mom with dementia had her 1st vaccine two weeks ago.	0
since then ive noticed shes gotten more clear headed.	0
her short term memory has improved somewhat.	0
her long term memory has improved also.	0
has anyone else notice any changes in their parents ?	0
my mother in law is in the mid stages of alzheimer's- her memory is fine but she is rapidly losing her sense of logic and her emotions are becoming more and more erratic.	0
at the moment she is living with my father in law but she is focusing all her anger and hatred on him, even blaming him for things that haven't happened.	0
over the last few months mil  has started to become physically violent, punching, slapping and even hitting my fil with a shoe.	0
he doesn't think he can care for her anymore and wants to investigate a home but she has threatened suicide.	0
i was thinking  we could see if there was a retirement village available that also offered aged care, but she will probably resist that too.	0
so when should we be looking at homes?	0
and how do you convince someone to go into one if they really don't want to?	0
all of her kids work full time and we have children so we having her live with us when she is prone to violence is not a great solution.	0
so what do we do?	0
today was the day we visited option z, the nicest and most expensive assisted living facility that had rooms available in the region   the opportunity has arisen for my parents to take a nice 2 bedroom unit with a beautiful river view.	0
i had such high hopes that this would be the answer.	0
"option y, viewed last week, they deemed ""too institutional."""	0
"well, today's opportunity for a room that only comes open once every couple of years, was said to be ""too much like a hotel."""	0
"yeah, a hotel in a great place, but ""it's just not for us."""	0
i had drawn a circle and investigated every potential place within 10 minutes drive time of my house, so wherever my parents ended up, i could visit them more frequently and respond to their needs more efficiently.	0
they have rejected every single place that came even close to meeting their needs, including today's beautiful river view room.	0
"now, after having seen this and rejected it, i have no doubt that it will quickly go to someone else and anything else my parents will ever see will seem ""less"" than what they saw today."	0
aging and dementia expert teepa snow categorizes the various stages of brain failure by gemstones, emphasizing differences.	0
the diamond state is hard and inflexible, and this is where we find my father.	0
"today after the visit, he asked ""so how much would that place be?"""	0
"and when i told him, and added that he could certainly afford it for several years, he replied, ""what would happen after that?"""	0
"i said, ""well dad, you're 90.  how long do you think you're going to live?"	0
"given what you save by not living in your house (i estimate this at $1000 a month because their house is paid for, so just things like utilities, homeowners insurance, etc) and your social security, and adding in your savings, what you'd clear for selling the house, and so on, i'd say you have enough for 6 or 7 years."""	0
"""well that isn't enough."	0
"why do you want us to die so soon?"""	0
"again, i don't take offense at comments like this, because i know i'm dealing with a ""diamond/emerald"" personality."	0
(look up teepa snow's gemstones for definitions of each stone and the traits that go with it.)	0
i just quit talking about it rather than argue.	0
so we got some take-out and returned to their house for lunch.	0
and then there was one small ray of hope.	0
"my mother, who has been very quiet about our tours suddenly said, ""i kind of liked that place today."""	0
rather than get my dad fired up again, i just excused myself and withdrew, leaving the two of them to talk it over.	0
mom is the center of dad's universe.	0
two months from now they'll celebrate their 70th anniversary.	0
i'll let her do the talking and we'll see what happens next.	0
my mom has pancreatic cancer and it is spreading fast.	0
she received her test results today and her cancer marker is over 9000 and she is in pain, both physically and emotionally.	0
she lives on her own and is able to take care of herself right now but given that her cancer is spreading at an alarming rate i need to start thinking about home health assistance and even at-home hospice care.	0
here is where it gets tricky.	0
when the time comes that she is unable to take care of herself, she does not want to go to a nursing home for care.	0
i totally understand that and agreed that i would respect her wishes.	0
i suggested getting a caregiver to come in a few times a week to help with cleaning, laundry, errands, etc.. i have also suggested at-home hospice care when/if needed.	0
well, here is the problem.	0
she does not want any stranger to come into her home.	0
she is fighting me on it.	0
instead, she wants me to move  in with her, work from home, and take care of her.	0
i don't think this is a realistic solution long term.	0
i won't be able to handle all of this on my own, emotionally, physically, and financially.	0
i have no one else to help me so all of this falls on me.	0
i also support my mom financially like buying all of her groceries and household needs.	0
right now i am wfh but by this spring/summer i will have to go back to the office so there is no way i will be able to wfh permanently and i can't afford to take an extended leave of absence especially since i financially support her and myself.	0
from a physical standpoint, i just can't do this on my own.	0
i will need help.	0
also, emotionally this will be incredibly draining.	0
i am already mentally exhausted from the dr appointments, treatments, and just trying to be here for her, etc.. lastly, and this may sound selfish, i do not want to move in with her.	0
i will be so unhappy.	0
what do i do?	0
has anyone been in this position before?	0
what do you recommend?	0
my moms...mid stage?	0
she knows who everyone is and remembers some things.	0
long term is decent.	0
but short term is shot ans its made her paranoid and beyond terrified.	0
she cant be alone anymore.	0
she cant follow a conversation, grasp time or numbers.	0
a simple conversation is almost impossible anymore.	0
shes losing everything.	0
taking and moving and losing my things in my house cuz shes here 24/7.	0
its a tiny house so i have nowhere to hide them.	0
no privacy.	0
this cant last past summer since im moving in with boyfriend and having a child.	0
i wanna say im doing my best.	0
im trying to do my best.	0
but i lose my patience almost every day.	0
she gets so mean when im right or dont say the tight thing (which is nothing).	0
she almost took and lost important tax documents of mine today cuz shes obsessed with mail and wont throw anything out including junk mail.	0
im just so overwhelmed and tired and irritated.	0
i love her more than anything on the planet.	0
but i cant do this forever.	0
its been a year.	0
shes going to have to have in home care or go to a facility sooner than later.	0
its her worst nightmare and shell disown me.	0
i dont know what the alternative is.	0
i couldnt possibly have an infant and her at the same time.	0
and i cant afford a big enough house for her to have her own space with a caretaker.	0
this is the actual worst situation i can imagine.	0
i just want my mom back.	0
my grandmother used to be sharp, and now can't remember things i tell her seconds ago - usually numbers, most of all.	0
what day it is, what time it is, solving a simple math problem- etc.	0
"she says it's ""old age""."	0
she can't remember names of things, and sometimes tells me things that never happened, but were closely related to an event.	0
other than that, she's fully functional.	0
she's on so many different medications for cholesterol, blood pressure, heart issues, lung issues and now liver issues because of them.	0
i'm starting to believe that it's the medications she's on that are causing her memory problems, because she has less of them when she doesn't take them.	0
i don't know how to deal with this.	0
has anybody else experienced this, and what else happens?	0
does anyone have any experience with agitated and delirious parents?	0
my father screams at the top of his lungs whenever he falls down.	0
he seems to be falling down more and more but when he does, he screams so much it is disturbing.	0
it's over the top, it makes him seem insane.	0
he literally screams as if he is being attacked by an axe murder.	0
our house feels as if it is turning into an insane asylum.	0
he has heart failure and his kidneys are operating around 21 i believe so he's not on dialysis yet.	0
he is also starting to twitch, convulse constantly and talk to himself in his sleep.	0
he also hallucinates at times.	0
it comes and goes so were not sure if he is making this behavior for attention or if it's real.	0
he has a history of being a pathological liar and drama queen for most of his life before becoming elderly so we doubt him at times.	0
for example, he may claim that he doesn't feel well enough to do something and i notice when no one is looking, he is doing that very thing.	0
we constantly weigh whether his complaints are true or not.	0
he has no diagnosis of dementia or alzheimers at all.	0
in fact, he is extremely manipulative at the doctors when i have gone with him.	0
he lies to his doctors constantly and tries to sweet talk the nurses - its pathetic.	0
my point is, is he is with-it enough mentally to be manipulative.	0
but this screaming and falling and twitching for hours on end is alarmingly.	0
my mother: update (from just one day later) can be found here:  https://old.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lrq86e/update_to_im_just_gonna_rant_thats_all/?	0
"i saw the signs of dementia two (2) years ago in january, 2019, and my sister told me she was going to the ""right"" kind of doctor (e.g."	0
geriatric specialist or a gerontologist); she wasn't; my sister lied.	0
i can't make an doctor's appointment for her, 'cuz sister has a stranglehold on all medical info   my sister has attached herself to our mother's bank accounts, but it's not to help her pay her bills.	0
she's just waiting for the inevitable.	0
i can't keep food in the house - it gets thrown away - no explanation.	0
she puts a raw hamburger patty between two slices of bread as a sandwich.	0
she doesn't use utensils, dinnerware, or glassware unless it's pointed out to her.	0
drink out of the milk carton, drink out of the soda, eat out of the food container, no explanation.	0
she has this habit of retrieving a few pieces of toilet paper or a single paper towel, folding that in half, then stashing those all over the place (e.g.	0
kitchen cupboards, back of the couch, etc.)	0
i've tried every county, state, and private agency the internet offered me to no avail.	0
"apparently, if she has ""full legal control"" -my words- over herself, they can't do anything."	0
i'm trying to figure out what the hell they're good for!	0
"the website says you can report ""self-neglect"", but they can't do anything."	0
she throws the cat's food and water out daily.	0
no explanation.	0
she goes through episodes nightly where she's constantly getting up to look out the window or open the front door, despite it being below freezing.	0
she seems to have lost most of her nouns, 'cuz she can't describe things, wants, or needs.	0
i've spent thousands on an attorney to get guardianship, but the quarantine/pandemic has brought such legal proceedings to a standstill.	0
she can't dial a phone (to call for help, call for food, call for a taxi, etc.)	0
there's so much more, but i just don't wanna type anymore.	0
this post is my way of screaming.	0
thanks for listening.	0
edit:  i got downvoted to 0 fairly quickly, but that's ok.  typing that out was cathartic.	0
sorry if i upset anyone.	0
hi, my mom is 73 yo.	0
she's independant, she cooks, she buys foods, go to the grocery, she drives, she's organized, she takes care of my father who is handicapped and doesn't forget their medical appointments  but i notice some memory loss and don't know if it's normal considering her age or if it could be early stage alzheimer's  symptoms.	0
i know only a neurologist could give me a diagnosis but she'll never agree to see one at this stage and i wonder if i should ask her and insist or don't worry her since she's an anxious person by nature.	0
she forgets names which is i think very comon at her age but i also noticed that she can forgets words and having difficulties finding a word  and employ another word not very appropriate instead but she has no problems to communicate and to be understood.	0
she sometimes forget minor things that occured several weeks ago.	0
but what scared me today is that she totally forgot that she saw a movie 30-40 days ago.	0
the movie was american beauty, she saw it on tv and i remember her being absorbed  by the movie.	0
today the same movie was broadcasted on tv and she showed interest to it so i asked her if she wanted to see it again and she didn't remember that she saw it last month.	0
she told me the last time she saw it was several years ago.	0
we watched the begining of the movie and i asked her if the characters looked familiar to her and she said they were a bit but because it was memories of when she saw it at the movie theater around 20 years ago or on tv at least 5 years ago and she had absolutely no memories of watching it lately.	0
she was convinced that i was wrong.	0
since i insisted  and asked her to try to remember she got nervous so i stopped.	0
should i be worried about that and try to see a neurologist with her or are these kind of things not unusual at her age without having alzheimer's ?	0
working on getting my father on medicaid because he has no assets left at all and just need to blow off steam, delete this if it breaks the rules, sorry.	0
obviously this isn't directed at anyone in particular.	0
if i have to make 1 more god damned statement about where 100 dollars went 2 years ago, or why an account was closed, or why he's over the 2k limit when ssa is over 2k a month i'm gonna scream.	0
here's the fucking statement, he paid taxes all his life and served in the military so how about you just start sending the fucking money?!	0
what're we gonna do, let him go to the street while he racks up 50k+ in nursing home debt?	0
send the fucking money you useless department.	0
rant over.	0
[deleted]	0
dad, 94yo, alzh/dementia/parkinsons, stroke and cancer survivor and a narcissist.	0
that last one means that he is always right and can never admit to being wrong or sick etc.	0
that makes it very difficult to keep him safe and in good health.	0
this isnt a bitching just trying to see the pieces.	0
seems like theres always got to be something wrong.	0
we just went thru the diet issues again.	0
he goes thru a couple days of malady and he always blames diet, we change it, it seems fixed.	0
then a few weeks later here we go again.	0
now its back to his eyesight and glasses.	0
it goes back and forth and he has never really explained whats wrong.	0
he had an exam last year and his eyesight hadnt changed since his previous glasses.	0
but he got new ones anyway.	0
then we went thru a long series of which glasses worked and didnt work, neither worked etc.	0
then he occasionally wants new glasses cause the old ones dont work.	0
yet he cant say why he thinks they dont work.	0
so he will have another exam and get a pair of glasses and like last time have 5 or 6 fittings for the frames cause they never fit right.	0
and it will be the exact same script again.	0
if he was rich i guess it wouldnt matter at all, but hes not.	0
he would be wasting a good amount of, yes, his money.	0
i do also consider that he creates issues so they can be solved.	0
partly so he feels some control over his life, some importance and so he can deal with people.	0
the narcissism, and its interesting to learn, but he is fed by attention.	0
by attention and by being an authority.	0
so when he goes in for glasses to be fitted over and over he is being in authority.	0
the guy didnt do it right so it has to be redone.	0
people will tell me this isnt correct but to me it's a mild insanity.	0
not the same as being mistaken but in certain ways creating a fallacy to live through.	0
i wonder if this is the dementia blended with the narcissism.	0
my next step will be to just try and understand what his perceived issue is and why he thinks it will be corrected this time.	0
yes i know pd can affect the eyes but i am thinking i see where this is going.	0
does anyone else get these issues?	0
i had to quit an 80k/yr job and start early ss so i could care for my mom, who needs constant watching.	0
why will her medicare advantage pay for home health to come in, but wont pay me?	0
im in texas.	0
hi im looking for a caregiver job where i can go to peoples houses and help them with bathing, toileting, etc.	0
can yall please recommend me your favorite ones?	0
maybe an agency, website, or apps?	0
thanks!	0
my mom is 64, 62 when sort of diagnosed.	0
she was living with her boyfriend/unofficial husband of 17+ years when counsel on aging was called, warned him to stop leaving her alone, get her to doctor's appt etc.	0
in july 2018. they checked in again november 2018 and she was left alone so they got her removed from the home and put into a memory unit at a nursing home.	0
i visited in december 2018 (i live 360 miles away).	0
she was vibrant and seemed better than she had been.	0
she is still sharp and was helping all the aides taking care of the elderly residents.	0
i was upset and i really didn't feel like this level of care was needed but at the same time i was getting wandering reports, her hair was dredded, and she was being left home alone for hours possibly sometimes days prior to this placement.	0
her doctor also approved her removal and placement.	0
shortly after they moved her to a different facility.	0
right off the bat i heard she had an incident with another male resident and both of them got sent to the hospital for evaluation for a bit.	0
i visited her at this new facility in september 2018. i was appalled at how different this facility was from the first.	0
patients were really disabled and deranged.	0
i definitely met the guy she had a problem with and i understand why because he cusses, threatens, goes through everyone's stuff... just a menace and scary.	0
she looked completely different and hardly spoke.	0
i'm wondering if they put her on meds or something after that incident.	0
it just broke my heart completely.	0
i don't know what to think.	0
is it that's she emotionally broken and on meds or is it the disease?	0
i visited again yesterday may 10, 2019 and things at the facility seemed better this time but she spoke even less this time though she still spoke some to me.	0
"she said ""when are you leaving"" and ""how long are you staying in pennsylvania""... so she can speak, make sense, and knows what's going on."	0
i just feel so horrible about all this.	0
i don't know if this placement broke her and that's why she shut down, if it's unnecessary medication, or the disease.	0
this is so hard.	0
im my moms full time caregiver now.	0
stage one kidney failure, bone on knees and incontinent.	0
i spend the day caring for her and im getting through that but i cant muster any energy for myself.	0
i renovated the garage into a bungalow for myself so we both could have a private area.	0
my space is a disaster zone and i just cant find my old mojo of getting things tidy.	0
i think im falling into a bit of care to caregiver fatigue and depression.	0
i started caring for him about two months ago.	0
he does not remember i am his grandson anymore but knows i am there to help.	0
during his very brief moments of lucidity, he does thank me for being there and asks me about my brother or my dad, but that is about it.	0
for a while we had a daily routine of waking up, showering every-other day, eating breakfast and playing dominoes in the morning/early afternoon.	0
he starts to decline rapidly about 1:00pm.	0
that is when the obsessive behavior really starts to set in.	0
he used to be a handy man and loved sports.	0
so he is either obsessing about something outside that needs to be fixed or he thinks that we are playing some sort of game where everything in the house is worth points.	0
this goes on for a few hours, we eat lunch, and then he takes a nap.	0
about 6:00pm sundowning usually starts.	0
the usual obsessions begin and he gets angry.	0
sometimes he says he doesn't need his clothes and takes them off.	0
i found just staying calm, not raising my voice, riding it out and making sure he is safe; shortens the durations of his sundowning.	0
then we usually eat dinner around 7:30. afterwards, i give him his evening meds and put to bed between 9-10pm.	0
we have nanny cams throughout the house that sent alerts if he gets up in the middle of the night.	0
over the last week or so, he has been sleeping later and later.	0
when he gets up to use the restroom in the morning, i will go check on him to see if he wants to get the day started and he just wants to sleep more.	0
so i let him and check on him about every 30 min to see if he wants to get up.	0
"the answer is always ""i want to sleep more."""	0
yesterday he got up a 4pm, wanted to take a nap at 5:30, slept until 7, ate dinner, went to bed at 9:30pm and slept through the night.	0
is this normal?	0
does anyone else experience this?	0
any pointers?	0
2014-2015 (73/74 years old): father's alzheimer was starting to be more prominent.	0
it starts when he's talking to people, he'd keep repeating what he's saying.	0
2016 (75 years): he starts forgetting where is he going when driving.	0
like, he would leave from point a to point b, and while on the road, he'd forget where is he going for point b is, and eventually ends up going back to point a. one time, he was going somewhere that's only a 30-minute drive from our house.	0
while on the road, he forgot, he went into circles, and six hours later, he thankfully made it back home.	0
2018 (77 years): he started to forget how to go back to the house from our yard/garden.	0
you'd have to guide him.	0
he used to water the whole yard, but around this time, unless you guide him, he'd only water one area.	0
2019 (78 years): he started to forget how to go from one place in the house to another.	0
let's say how to go to the bathroom from the living, or going to his bedroom.	0
also, this is around the time that you have to give his medicine to him, as he cannot take it by himself.	0
2020 (79 years), you had start guiding him with personal hygiene, and when taking a shower.	0
you have to make sure he actually gets in the shower, that he actually uses the soap and shampoo, and you have to pick out the clothes he's gonna wear, and set it on the counter.	0
though, he still knows how to put clothes on.	0
he also started losing his perception of time.	0
when he wakes up from an afternoon nap, he thinks it's morning.	0
or he'd wake up my mom in the middle of the night, as he thinks it's already morning.	0
he would wonder out of his air conditioned room, to go some other part of the house, would sit down, and complain that it's hot.	0
i would bring him back to the room.	0
a couple minutes later, he'd do this again.	0
he would also ask where my mother is, i give him an answer.	0
then 30 seconds later, he'd ask the same question again.	0
2021: about a month or two ago, he's having trouble when you give him a command.	0
let's say if you want him to flick a light switch.	0
based on the timeline above, what stage is my father at?	0
and how long is this going to last before advancing to the next?	0
also, i've read that people with alzheimer's would live about 8-10 years, or if they're lucky, up to 20 years.	0
how long do you think my father is going to live?	0
i would like to apologize for the dumb questions.	0
i am just curious.	0
especially, when dealing with this everyday.	0
thanks.	0

52f in a fwb relationship with 52m.	0
he is a caregiver for his ailing mom.	0
he sleeps about 3 hours a night.	0
always tired.	0
says he has no energy.	0
he feels overwhelmed.	0
hes a poor communicator.	0
doesnt manage his life well.	0
always late for appointments.	0
his day is derailed and he runs behind depending on the level of difficulty in taking care of his mom each morning.	0
i try to hook up with him once a week and its a chase.	0
im not into chasing a man.	0
hot sex the rare times we have it.	0
i figure it would be a relief, an escape for him.	0
he seems to be overwhelmed regarding this also.	0
does being a caregiver lower your interest in sex and intimacy ?	0
after following this subreddit for a few months i feel lucky that my grandma is one of the more cheerful dementia patients than i've read about here.	0
in fact, living with her has improved my life aside from when cleaning up bathroom accidents.	0
but dealing with the other family members who come to visit has been a huge source of frustration and anxiety.	0
my grandma had 7 kids, and most still live nearby so i get regular visitors about 4 times a week.	0
i wish they'd just come to talk with grandma, have lunch with us, and it'd be great if they came with their own activity to do with her.	0
but most of the time they just come to nitpick how i'm taking care of her or the house.	0
no matter how hard i prepare i can never win, some comment will always be said to insinuate how i'm not doing something right.	0
it reminds me of when teachers say they love dealing with the kids but can't stand the parents.	0
i really do my best to put on a friendly face and be there to answer any questions about how she's been doing, because i want to keep them updated and my grandma isn't able to communicate that stuff herself.	0
some visits are short, but some go on for hours or overnight, and they can really mess my schedule up.	0
after doing this for a year, i'm just not able to deal with all the sudden visits and especially so much judgement of my life.	0
my grandmother hasnt been eating for about a week and half.	0
maybe 1 bite here and there and maybe some days nothing at all.	0
she says shes not hungry or  shell eat it later and never does.	0
at this point im worried for the worst.	0
shes dehydrated as well but wont hardly drink anything either.	0
it seems the more you push her to eat the more she doesnt want it.	0
is this typical?	0
i dont believe its a dental issue.	0
shes been living with my mother for 2 months now and was eating just fine and it has slowly started to decline.	0
my dad is 70 and mom is 68. im 25f and an only child.	0
my husband, 16 month old daughter, and i moved in with them last october for various reasons.	0
(i was struggling greatly with postpartum and they were struggling to maintain their home.)	0
my mom has been through hell in the last 10 years.	0
a heart attack, defibrillator put in, diabetes, breast cancer, double mastectomy, debilitating migraines, a (possible) brain stem stroke, and various other cognitive issues stemming from....a little bit of all of that.	0
god love her, she only has probably 1-3 good days a week.	0
but were on week 2 of her not getting out of bed except to eat right now.	0
she takes so many medicines and gets very confused when she has her migraines, so i have to constantly make sure shes taking her meds right and not skipping meds or double taking them.	0
my dad is in much better shape all things considered.	0
he has copd and deteriorating vertebrae in his back that causes him a lot of pain.	0
other than that though, hes surprisingly healthy considering how poorly he takes care of himself.	0
my husband works full time, doesnt get home until 10 or 11pm.	0
i am a full time stay at home mom with our daughter.	0
the original arrangement was to be a mutually beneficial living situation.	0
i would help them with maintaining their (way too large for just them) house, and they would help me with my baby while i continued my mental health recovery.	0
(you can see my post history for how serious my postpartum battle was.)	0
what has happened, is i have been thrown into caring for both my parents and my child, while severely neglecting myself and my husband.	0
my mother really cant do much.	0
any time that she feels ike being out of bed is a good day.	0
and when she has good days, she spends all her time with my daughter.	0
for that, im thankful.	0
my dad though, is going to make me lose it.	0
in my 25 years of life i have never seen him wash a single dish, he couldnt even make ice if he tried, and he has straight up told me that he has no interest in learning how to do anything.	0
if i dont make him food, he will not eat.	0
i buy sandwich stuff, microwave meals, and i always make enough food that theres always left overs for him to warm up.	0
but nope.	0
if i dont physically make him a plate and bring it to him he wont eat.	0
most of that is kind of petty, but still another nail in my coffin.	0
the biggest issue is the man smokes like a chimney.	0
both of my parents do.	0
when we were talking about my family moving in with them, i told them that we would only move in if they completely stopped smoking inside.	0
(side note: they were the ones that wanted us to move in with them.	0
they begged for months before we finally did.)	0
they agreed and said they didnt want to smoke in the house my daughter was in.	0
they even had my aunt come and deep clean everything before we moved in.	0
every night when we go to bed (my family lives on the 2nd floor) my dad sits there and chain smokes in the living room.	0
i can smell it when i walk out of our room.	0
ive caught him doing it many times.	0
ive talked to him about it 100s of times.	0
he just wont stop.	0
nevermind the fact that he has copd, im trying to protect my daughter from second hand smoke!	0
ugh.	0
im just so at a loss.	0
i dont know how to get through to them.	0
i need them to want to be better.	0
im scared about what will happen when we move out because i dont think theyll be able to manage this house by themselves but theyre way too prideful to try to hire help.	0
when we move, i worry my dad will go days without eating or only eating chips and snacks when mom has bad days and cant cook for him.	0
that also means no one will be there to make sure my mom has something to eat when she has her bad days and is bedridden.	0
their house was a wreck when we moved in and ive finally gotten it back to normal but it took a long time and im sure it will take no time at all for it to get back the way it was.	0
theyll also eat food way past its expiration date or eat like, week old leftovers.	0
it makes me gag and they get mad when i throw away rotten food.	0
im seriously worried about what theyll eat when we leave.	0
im not sure if i had a point to this post, but im almost positive i got way off track from it.	0
im just so worried and stressed and needed to get it out.	0
any kind words, ideas, or just support is greatly appreciated.	0

issues are:    soft diet for dental reasons   slow digestion (bm every other day, does take senocot-s), i think this makes for a sense of fullness    lives independently, support workers come in the morning and evening to warm up meals ive pre-cooked.	0
i think they do the bare minimum (which im not blaming them for, it is a free service, but they dont sit with him and talk, they heat things up and set the food at the table for him to eat alone).	0
loneliness is a factor    he doesnt want to be fat.	0
weight is good but im concerned he might lose the ability to digest proper food and obviously is missing nutrition.	0
i sit with him 3 times a week for a hot lunch, he eats about half of it or sometimes doesnt (not sure if thats down to bm timing or what).	0
i have tried to blend soups and stews, he finds these visually unappealing.	0
he does seem to get a bowl of oatmeal every morning (2 packets and ive asked the psws to add cream) and sometimes has dinner with friends, they say he eats half and only with a lot of encouragement.	0
did call ambulance.	0
he let the firemen and emt check him out.	0
minor fall 5 minutes before.	0
what possessed him to say  hey let me take a shower...right now?	0
60+ years old  happened a couple of days ago.	0
super scary to see him laying on the bathroom floor.	0
ms. anger issues.	0
this is only going to get worse.	0
he refuses to pick up part b medicare (doctor office visits) vent	0
hello!	0
i am a 21 year old female and my family and i have just found out this last weekend that my mother who 56 has from early temporal dementia.	0
i never expected this to happen so soon and im terrified.	0
im also going to school 40 minutes away and am moving over there in the next few weeks.	0
does anyone have any advice or words of wisdom?	0
im just really scared.	0
being 23 and the sole caregiver to my step grandmother k have learned a lot.	0
shes full of drama but she has arthritis and a massive hernia in her stomach.. drs wont operate on the hernia.	0
and she wont take any pain meds.	0
she doesnt know what meds she takes because i do all of them so even of the dr prescribes them i could give them to her.. but my thing is her son, my stepdad, is convinced shes full of drama and faking her pain.. shes 87.. shes skin and bones, wont eat anything but toddler servings and i have to cut her food.	0
she eats a bowl of fruit in the morning.	0
maybe one bottle of water a day, im lucky if she gets out of bed for dinner.	0
im happy she comes out for breakfast.	0
im just worried about her.	0

my mother was diagnosed with dementia in december 2019 after a car accident.	0
weve been navigating this but have been having a hard time due to covid restrictions.	0
the issues were experiencing is that my mom refuses to do anything.	0
we tried to get her into activities when she retired.	0
things like water fit etc.	0
she went with my sister a few times but she refuses to go on her own.	0
she complains about being bored, complains that no one calls her (she never calls them), and just wanders around the house doing absolutely nothing.	0
she wont clean, she barely reads, wont watch tv during the day.	0
however, shes been like this for a long time (my lifetime).	0
she hates cleaning and will use the excuse of arthritis not to clean, she likes to read but maybe cant any more (she struggles reading things and speaking).	0
she has zero hobbies and zero interest in the things we suggest.	0
she will go out for walks, but she basically goes out so she can smoke cigarettes and check the mailbox (she walks to community box and back about 20 times a day).	0
shes not able to drive any more but refuses to sell her car.	0
she literally has no interest in anything.	0
she is definitely depressed and has been since my dad died in 2009. she also wont ask for help.	0
when she runs out of something she wont ask for it, shell just make passive aggressive comments or tell my cats shes out of something (im usually in the room but she wont say it to me).	0
she fell when i was at work and cut her head open pretty badly where she was bleeding down her arm for hours (she fell around 1-2 and my sister called around 6 and found her to be strange so drove over and found her sitting in the driveway with blood all over) and still wouldnt call for us.	0
she drove to st. thomas (we live in hamilton) and refused to let anyone know she was lost.	0
we had to drive and get her and luckily she was near a restaurant that was unique as she was low on gas and refused to call for help.	0
that was the final straw for letting her drive.	0
i guess what im asking is what do i do?	0
she refuses to listen to me, but her short term memory is completely gone so even if i ask her to do something she forgets it.	0
im at my wits end and in over my head and i dont know what to do.	0
my doctor doesnt really help and the only confirmation we have is what we see and that he did a quick test to initially diagnose her.	0
what are my next steps?	0
how to i do this?	0
tl;dr: my grandmother is almost in her 80s.	0
she is completely broke and hasnt saved a dime for herself to live off of in her old age.	0
shes getting to the point where she needs to live in an assisted living facility, but she doesnt have any money to afford it.	0
what options do my family have to deal with this situation?	0
im new to this sub, so apologies if this isnt an appropriate place to ask this.	0
my grandmother has lived an extravagant lifestyle off the money my grandfather left her when he passed.	0
she has spent all of this money on vacations, clothes, cars, living far beyond her means.	0
my grandfather bought her a house before he died, but she sold it after already taking a reverse mortgage out on it, so she doesnt own any assets either.	0
she is getting to the point health wise where she needs to have round the clock care, but she blew through every last dollar she had and the rest of my family doesnt have money to afford this.	0
no one in my family is in a place to take her in.	0
are there any options through medicare or medicaid to help us in this situation?	0
this is completely new territory for me.	0
appreciate any and all advice.	0
i am new to caregiving - my husband recently had a brain tumor removed.	0
he is deaf in one ear and half his face is paralyzed after the surgery.	0
i am finding it incredibly tough to take care of him.	0
we have a two year old and he really can't do much to help with her - he can't pick her up and he can't handle the stress when she is screaming/crying.	0
i guess what's hard for me is that he has totally shut down emotionally - he just plays videogames all day and prefers to be left alone.	0
it's very lonely to care for our kid by myself while i also work full time.	0
this is going to be a long recovery for him and i worry that he is not getting mental health support as he physically recovers.	0
its also tough because i have no one i can honestly talk to about it.	0
i find i'm angry a lot of the time i'm home with him.	0
our relationship tended to be unequal before the surgery, with me doing most of the emotional labor, and now it's even worse.	0
it just feels like this will never end and i'll effectively be a single parent forever.	0
i do see a therapist and that is helpful, but i struggle with my anger and frustration at my sad and lonely life.	0
hi there, i'm not one to usually post things like this online but our situation is getting somewhat desperate and i don't really know how to get any more help in the short-term future.	0
i'll try to keep this as short as i can.	0
my father and i are the sole caregivers for my mother who is in mid-stage dementia.	0
pre-covid she would attend a day program 4 days a week.	0
and she loved it.	0
it really made her happy and subsequently, she was very easy for us to care for here at home.	0
the day program has been closed due to covid for almost a year now.	0
it has never even tried to open again.	0
all programs have been moved to online 30-40 minute sessions.	0
we have tried them but it just doesn't work anywhere near as well for my mom.	0
given the right time, program and person, she can enjoy it for what it is.	0
but 1) my father or i always need to sit with her during it and 2) it doesn't really help with her mood for the rest of the day.	0
this brings me to her deterioration.	0
this once, previously happy woman, now sobs every day asking for her dead mother.	0
she is anxious.	0
she has had numerous temper tantrums.	0
she demands to leave the house and go to her childhood home.	0
she screams at us about things that don't make sense.	0
she won't leave my father or i alone for one minute.	0
it's not all terrible.	0
there are better days than others but overall... to put it bluntly... after almost a full year of this, life is getting unbearable here.	0
to explain the avenues of assistance we are currently getting: - we regularly talk to her doctor's office.	0
they have been helpful in prescribing medication to us.	0
she now takes lots of trazodone everyday.	0
i'm pretty sure it is working and that, without it, she would be even worse.	0
- we get a psw that comes to our home.	0
we have been getting some extra hours of late because of cancellations.	0
but i find 1) they generally don't know how to engage my mother.	0
they can't even take her our for walks because of liability.	0
they constantly turn to us when mom is antsy.	0
it's sort of a break but not really... 2) i'm more and more worried about covid.	0
we have already had to isolate once because we had a psw who had it while she was here... and 3) we just don't enjoy having a stranger in our home.	0
we're desperate so we'll do it but it's a small place and it doesn't really help us relax truly.	0
- the virtual programs.	0
pretty much useless to us if i'm being honest.	0
i only keep it so there's a chance she can keep recognizing some of the faces if, by some miracle, she can ever go back.	0
- we are on waiting lists for several long term care homes.	0
but, from what i understand, there's 100% no way we will move up the list for a long time.	0
before, we have wanted to keep her at home as long as possible so she can enjoy seeing her friends, being in the day program, taking advantage of short-term respite care when needed.	0
but now, i think we are just at that point where if we get a call tomorrow, we will take it.	0
and that's it.	0
we have no other family to turn to.	0
we're exhausted, burnt out, and desperate for some relief from her.	0
i'm worried for my father.	0
he's not a young man and i fear what this is doing to his health.	0
i have been lucky to be able to work from home but the assistance i can provide them is not enough.	0
and i am getting depressed at the inability to have my own life (even if it is a covid one in lockdown).	0
anyways, i will stop rambling here.	0
i just can't believe the position we're in and that there really is nothing out there that can help us right now.	0
is there anyone else out there in a similar situation?	0
thank you to anyone reading this.	0
is this something that other people have experienced.	0
i no longer care about him or want to be around him but i'm basically forced to watch him.	0
i'm getting to the point that i'm trying to figure out how to get myself a home so that i can just get started on my own life.	0
he has taken so many resources that i haven't been able to get stuff to be able to work and i constantly have to go to his apartment to watch him.	0
i am starting to hate him as a person and i no longer even see him as my father anymore.	0
dementia has changed him from someone i looked up to, to a person that feels like a burden and is a main reason i haven't been able to start my life after i graduated.	0
i've had to deal with this for almost 3 years now and i do not want to help take care of him anymore.	0
i do not see him as being worth wasting my life.	0
my mother refuses to do anything with him.	0
i am close to just leaving without anything to take care of myself with just to stop having to be a babysitter.	0

my husband and i take care of my family member full time.	0
we all live together.	0
husband and i are fairly introverted.	0
we have always prioritized alone time within our marriage.	0
its important we both get time by ourselves to decompress each day.	0
im a stay at home mom and the main caregiver.	0
my husband works full time and goes to school full time at night.	0
needless to say down time is a must.	0
my family member is an extrovert.	0
we knew he was chatty before this arrangement but we thought it was because we were visitors.	0
now that we live together we see thats hes goes all day long.	0
i cant walk past without him wanting to start a long conversation.	0
i have to plan certain chores for when hes busy so i can get them done without him trying to sit me down and talk.	0
sometimes i even hide in the garage just to get a moment to myself.	0
we do make time to chat but he requires so much.	0
its definitely created tension.	0
he has friends and a sibling he calls on the phone often.	0
my parents visit him multiple times a week.	0
we also have a cat and dog that he loves spending time with.	0
i dont believe hes lonely.	0
he hates leaving the house.	0
we wont let us take him anywhere besides the doctor.	0
its been that way since i was a kid.	0
ive explained that im a quiet person and that i need moments of peace throughout the day.	0
its not that im being bitchy.	0
he disagrees.	0
hell often come find me if he thinks im not being productive.	0
he says if im just sitting around then i should have more time spend with him.	0
but that sitting around is me making time for my hobbies or playing with our daughter... what the heck do i do with this?	0

my fil is 82 and has been caring for my mil (who has severe cardiac issues) for the last five years.	0
he is well-off and covid vaccinated.	0
they live 2000 miles away.	0
we have repeatedly suggested live-in care or assisted living, because he is unable to handle all of the care responsibilities.	0
he refuses to hear about it or have a conversation about it.	0
at the same time, he is suicidal due to the intensity of the caregiving responsibilities.	0
he is making suicidal threats and becoming increasingly erratic.	0
we have offered to arrange for respite care/in-home help and again, he refuses to talk about it.	0
it seems all he wants at the moment is to speak to us on the phone daily and offer us his suicidal ideations with a dose of verbal abuse.	0
what can we do?	0
how do we get somebody like this to accept help?	0
my spouse is high-risk so we cannot travel there until we are vaccinated.	0
missing that lady and hope shes pooping wherever she is.	0
my folks are getting older mid 70s, my mother has been having a bit of memory issues lately though my father still works as a surgeon and is doing great.	0
the issue which has been magnified during covid is their house has become more and more cluttered.	0
most rooms now function as something of storage areas, papers and clothes in piles in various rooms.	0
i have 3 other siblings though they live around the world, so i am the one who is taking on this responsibility.	0
its gotten to the point where my fiance hates coming over due to the immense clutter (which i can see her point).	0
i can help a little here and there when i visit, but i think this needs a professional touch.	0
essentially get rid of many things that have been kept for decades, go through each room, drawers, closets and just donate/throw it out.	0
how have you guys dealt with this issue with your aging parents?	0
should they hire an organizer?	0
professional cleaner?	0
is there a profession that specializes in this?	0
he is 78 and has never been a daytime or everyday drinker.	0
( just social events usually) now he starts drinking in the day and has started doing this everyday and gets agitated and sometimes passes out.	0
there is alcoholism in his family but he has never even been close to having a drinking problem.	0
when asked about it he either says we are exaggerating or says he is old and can do whatever he wants.	0
any advice?	0
my 68-year-old father has infected leg wounds and refuses to go to hospital, alienated his home nurses, and wont go with ambulance when we call (hes of sound mind).	0
any way to get them into hospital or doctor?	0
home visits even, or telehealth?	0
for the last 4yrs, my mum has suffered from high blood pressure.	0
the medication that she takes works one minute and then it doesn't the next.	0
she has collapsed a couple of times and has had a few hours stay at the hospital.	0
managing her blood pressure has heen challenging.	0
last year when she collapsed, her blood pressure went from high to extremely low.	0
luckily i was home at the time as i heard a thump and saw her lifeless body on the bathroom floor.	0
seeing that i went into full blown panic mode and probably made no sense to paramedics.	0
since then everytime she's unwell, i feel really lost and constantly worry about her when she's on her own as she's the only family i have here in australia ( /everyone is is overseas).	0
we have friends but don't feel like i could learn on them for this.	0
she has friends but they too are hours drive from where are and she just feels like a burden to them.	0
most days i put on a brave face for her sake so that she doesn't stress but it's hard.	0
i don't know where to start in terms of asking for help.	0
i can't really afford to quit work and be a full-time career.	0
i not only worry for her but for myself as all my energy has been to solely take care of her and my life has taken a backseat for many years now.	0
i have no desire to date as who would want to date a woman taking care of a relative?	0
i have recently tried to get help for myself by seeking a councilor to help me work through my own anxieties but i feel often wonder when will i get the time to see one, as it's all focused on her.	0
i love my mum would really like for her to become a bit more independent in taking care of her own needs but a part of me knows she herself doesn't know how to and heavily relys on me for pretty much everything.	0
today i just feel lost and overwhelmed and have no one to really talk to about it.	0
i don't even know if i'm making any sense, i guess i just needed to get it out in the open, even if it is to complete strangers.	0
thank you for taking the time to read my post, if you made it this far.	0

i could really use some advice about obsessive behaviors.	0
one of my dads behaviors is constantly checking the boiler.	0
hell go add water to it up to 6 times a day & empty it just as many times or more.	0
he does this all day, every day.	0
i understand its one of the few things he can still recall to do somewhat but its a huge problem.	0
ive taken that responsibility on so he doesnt have to but he does it anyways.	0
sometimes he forgets hes adding water or emptying water from the boiler resulting in him flooding our basement.	0
this has to be the 5th time in 2 years.	0
he was obsessing over the boiler not working correctly tonight (even though it was fine) & proceeded to empty the boiler & refill it but left the basement because he forget what he was doing, flooding it once again.	0
he had been told the boiler was fine multiple times tonight.	0
i had been trying to stay awake to avoid just this but i dozed off for not even 30 minutes & he managed that.	0
how do i manage this?	0
is there anyway to detract him from being so focused on the boiler?	0
important to note: hes 56, was diagnosed with dementia in his late 40s.	0
im a only child no father and a ill mother,  she was diagnosed with having a brain hemorrhage and i really need help to pay for the surgery, lapsed bills, medications, hospitalization bills, necessities of cleaning body.	0
im 24 and i don't possess that amount of money please help.	0
email at shericetwinklebear@gmail.com for more information... thank you	0

i have been caring for my elderly uncle, who is suffering from worsening dementia symptoms since a slip and fall about two years ago.	0
his short term memory is slipping away fast, but amazingly he can still tell me in great detail about hustling in the pool hall and playing with his band over 50 years ago.	0
anyway he has one persistent hallucination that is causing him a lot of anxiety.	0
it might be a bit hard to explain but here it goes:  he believes there are multiple copies of his house, like exact copies, just blocks away from one another.	0
"after i leave for the night to go home he'll say ""well aren't you going to take me back to my house?"""	0
"and i'll always say ""this is your house, uncle john"", and try to reassure him."	0
but he insists its not his house, and claims although its exactly the same as the other house, its not his house, and he'll stay there if he has to but he would really like to go home.	0
"i'm worried he might wander outside in the cold one night trying to walk ""home""."	0
he still comes into the family business everyday, (which he founded 53 years ago) which i think is good for him.	0
me and two other co workers rotate picking him up in the morning.	0
and he is often kept up all night with anxiety about whether or not he is where he is supposed to be, and if everyone knows which house to pick him up from etc.	0
i'll often get calls at 3:00am, with him asking me where he supposed to be, and if everyone knows when/where to pick him up.	0
i know this is a bit of a rant, but i'm hoping someone could shed some light on what's going one and how i might be able to help.	0
has anyone else experienced similar symptoms with loved ones?	0
i feel a bit helpless right now, thanks.	0
i usually don't post stuffs that have heft but i really need to get this out.	0
it seemed that mom's dementia was getting worse, i feared worse.	0
after two strokes the damn brain gets super weird.	0
went to the doctor (who is wonderful, btw) to see what we could do, if anything could be done.	0
maybe med probs, dawg.	0
aaah, long story short, i figured it out...lack of real sleep, got her some melatonin,  and gtg.	0
three days ago she undid her seatbelt for the first time in years.	0

i'm only 18 but i feel like i might have dementia of some sorts?	0
im not sure what it really could be but very frequently ive been having what i call intrusive thoughts that take up my whole conciousness.	0
"for example, ill get up and out of bed and think ""i need to take micheal to the gate"" and ill get dressed and spend time thinking about how and where to take micheal and then ill snap out of it and realise i dont know a micheal or why i would be taking him to a gate."	0
"all i remember from that instance is the phrase ""i need to take micheal to the gate"" ."	0
im sure there was more than that while i was thinking about it but thats all i can remember.	0
i thought it was nothing at first but its starting to happen more often and for longer periods of time.	0
i had a brief panic attack today after snapping out of one of these thoughts because i couldnt remember who i was for a small amount of time.	0
this time it lasted for an hour and i cant even remember what i was thinking but i know there was something.	0
sorry if im being ignorant and this isnt related to dementia but i have no idea what it is and its very scary.	0
my (49f) mom (75f) has dementia, probably alzheimers, stage 4ish, which she knows but will not talk about.	0
she'll say that she has memory problems because she's had some strokes (she hasn't).	0
she's struggling with loss of freedom, both because of the dementia and covid.	0
there's been ongoing difficulties with her and the pets when she won't listen to me or follow the guidelines i set down.	0
one dog has kidney damage, so she can't have too much protein or salt, and should be on a special diet, but that's impossible because mom has spoiled her by rewarding begging anytime we eat.	0
the second dog has had at least one bout of pancreatitis caused by mom's indulging and shouldn't have fatty foods.	0
the cat's diet is (was?)	0
fine, but she was not to be let out after dark because there are a lot of predators in the neighborhood.	0
i used to have two cats, but last june, mom opened the back door to let the dogs out and left it open, and the first cat escaped and never came home.	0
we ended up having a huge fight about it, because i was trying so hard not to be angry while my mom decided i was angry at her, so she got mad at me and bugged me until i did get angry.	0
very late last wednesday night, my mom deliberately put the second cat out, thinking the cat would run up to my bedroom window and meow to be let in.	0
well, she didn't.	0
she disappeared into the night hasn't been seen since, and both my mom and i are devastated.	0
trouble is, i'm dealing with my feelings by working on any chance to get my cat back if she's not dead, and my mom is putting away the cat stuff and talking about how we should get another one.	0
i've told her that i cannot bear the thought of getting another cat, but she's forgotten already.	0
it just breaks my heart.	0
my mom used to be the smartest, most responsible person i knew, and her emotional age has regressed to something like a 12 year old, which is not fun.	0
on top of that, i can't grieve openly for my cat, because then my mom feels terrible, and that's not the point.	0
i'm not interested in making her feel bad.	0
i just want to keep the animals safe and healthy.	0
hi all, so sorry about the extremely long post.	0
not sure where to start with this post but its about my father with lewey body dementia, covid and financial questions.	0
he is extremely vulnerable to predators.	0
backstory: my father has been dealing with frequent hallucinations for few years.	0
it was a once in a blue moon thing starting around 2015/2016, that was typically dismissed.	0
then with time, it progressed into a more frequent occurrence.	0
by 2020 50% of our phone calls would be about the spirits in his house and what they had done and how he would use the power of god to dispel them.	0
he comes from a culture that is not big on mental health and a country/continent with comparatively low dementia rates.	0
he was proud of his visions as he said god had chosen him as one of the prophesying elders mentioned in the bible.	0
he would insult and act aggressively towards any one who would suggest seeing a doctor.	0
he also developed an obsession with international lottery mail scams which he believed with his whole being would be the key to making him a multimillionaire.	0
he would wire money to them.	0
with what frequency or how much i dont know, most likely 1000s+.	0
his only asset is the home he lives in and he would allegedly rent out the basement and a couple rooms for extra income to supplement his social security payments.	0
i was comforted that he was not lonely as he sometimes rents to his friends or people he knows from his church.	0
other than that he seemed pretty lucid to me but i didnt know the severity of his cognitive problems; he seemed more quirky than anything else.	0
he has been seperated from my mother for maybe ten years but they have been on friendly terms with once a month contact and live in the same town.	0
i have lived 100-1000 miles away from both parents for about 15 years so contact is less frequent on my end.	0
the quality of his tenants started to get sketchier.	0
a year ago he had a man move in, described as homeless who had gone through a recent operation and needed medical care.	0
i asked why he would take someone in like that.	0
how would he pay?	0
he mentioned this man had relatives in the church he goes to and they pressured him because god is caring.	0
he said this man could pay rent.	0
that was the end of that.	0
he allegedly kicked out that man a few months later and took in another questionable man in the summer of 2020. he kept on mentioning how this man was his true friend because he would listen to him about the spirits and his secrets.	0
then it turned sour because this man didnt want to hear about the secrets or the lottery anymore.	0
this man contracted covid in december and was sent home from the hospital to recover.	0
my father then contracts covid from him and is sent to the hospital.	0
my father had changed his number a couple weeks earlier and hadnt placed any of his families numbers in there.	0
my father never learned how to use a computer and has trouble with smart phones so any chance of remembering our numbers from memory was nilch.	0
since he was not able to give out our contact numbers, this tenant he contracted covid from was made the point of contact.	0
my mother goes to the house for her monthly visit and is met aggressively by this tenant.	0
he was asking who she was and why she was there.	0
he tells her that my father has been in the hospital for a month and he doesnt know if he died or got lost because of the dementia.	0
the lack of tact and blatant misinformation was appalling.	0
turns out this man was just a couple days away from being given guardianship over my father, whether this meant power over finances idk im still ignorant over what types of guardianships have what rights.	0
the hospital social worker said that don(not the mans real name) had already decided that my father was going to be sent to a nursing home permanently after the hospital because the hospital and don both agreed that my father was incapable of dealing with his personal affairs.	0
we showed up just in time to stop this motion.	0
im surprised and relieved my father survived.	0
he had a hole in his lungs and was on oxygen.	0
he lost the ability to walk and his leg muscles atrophied.	0
his body was/is recovering but his mind seems to have gotten worse.	0
his convos now make no sense.	0
for a week straight he was talking about how obama was trying to steal his land and how trump would come through.	0
we have to remind him who is talking to him on the phone.	0
and sometimes he asks my mother about their son(she has no sons).	0
he is now in rehab and has regained some movement in his legs.	0
he sounded a bit more lucid on the phone yesterday.	0
honestly i do agree with the hospitals record of mental incapacity.	0
i recently came across his bank statements from all the way back to 2017. turns out he has never charged rent to any of the people living/passing through in his house for years.	0
his basement is alway occupied by a family right now its a family of 5. the two bedrooms upstairs, occupied by randoms.	0
another room is empty reserved for this pastor that comes from his country every summer.	0
his home is essential serving as a shelter/halfway house as he gathers people pushed on to him by the church he frequents or people he meets along the way.	0
now it makes sense that don was offended when we called to give him a heads up about rent.	0
he simply just said i dont have the money!.	0
apparently hes broke because he spent so much money getting movers!	0
this house still has a mortgage and is filthy.	0
cockroaches are also very visible tenants.	0
another concerning piece is that my father spends $1000-2000 a month on counter checks.	0
this basically eats up the majority of his social security check.	0
where these go to i dont know but now i suspect he was wiring this money to the international lotto scams or maybe just giving it out to people?	0
a year ago he was flagged and banned from wiring money at his local supermarket because what he was doing was considered gambling.	0
at this point, i would believe you if you told me he was paying rent to the people living there rentfree because they told him to.	0
apparently don felt so comfortable he is using the garage as a hoarding space and got married during these few months he has been living in my fathers home.	0
is his new wife going to move in?	0
all of this has been so overwhelming for me, especially when thinking about my fathers future.	0
how do you remove these people, essentially squatters?	0
none have leases.	0
my father needs financial supervision.	0
would the hospital backing me up be enough to get a conservatorship(or poa?).	0
when the time comes for long term memory care, i can see that maybe his social security + if the house is rented correctly would be enough to pay the exorbitant prices of a home but right now his finances and spending situation is a mess.	0
he has always been very independent but now i don't think that is an option for him anymore.	0
im a freshmen college student.	0
whenever my grandmother calls, i always let it go to voicemail.	0
its hard and awkward for me to talk on the phone especially when she repeats a lot of long stories.	0
i love hearing them.	0
instead i though of trying maybe to send her a care package.	0
shes french and grew up in morocco.	0
i went ahead and bought an eiffel tower 1000 piece puzzle for her, a little lion stuffed animal, and a dominos  set, cuz she loves that game.	0
i got a card saying i love you on the front.	0
and then it says happy  anniversary on the inside, but i crossed out the anniversary and wrote belated valentines day.	0
i thought it would be cute.	0
im not worried about by efforts being vain or a waste of money.	0
i just dont want to patronize her.	0
how should i help her?	0
i live about 1.5 hours away from her.	0
and cant really visit cuz of covid too.	0
any feedback is well appreciated.!	0
:)	0
hi reddit,  so my father has alzheimer's over 3 years now and it's gotten quite bad lately.	0
i've family trying get him care but it's taking along time to get anything done.	0
i've 3 brothers, 2 of which live away from us with there own families.	0
i'm working full time as a retail manager and my other brother works nights and weekends as a bar man.	0
i seem to be the only one that gives a crap about this as i'm the youngest in the family and live with my father and older brother.	0
i have to move out soon due to work so will no longer be at home but i'm worried constantly about my father that something might happen if i'm at work and no one is at home.	0
i've been trying to get care for him and it seems to be taking forever to get any form of help.	0
he goes to a day care house 2 times a week for a few hours but it's not enough.	0
we have a tracker for him in case he goes missing which has been happening a lot lately.	0
i have a car so i'm always the one who has to get him if he goes missing.	0
i'm from ireland and i was wondering has anyone here got any advice on what to do?	0
i'm constantly stressed, i'm having panic attacks and anxiety.	0
i'm just lost and i can't stop worrying.	0
can anyone tell me what i can do to try speed up the process of getting some form of help as my brothers don't seem to care and i'm going to end up in hospital at this rate.	0
thanks for any advice	0
i have taken over the care of an aunt who i am not close to and infact know very little and i am a bit afraid of her lurking and undiagnosed mental health issues.	0
this is all remotely as i care full-time for a parent.	0
bottom line the aunt needs to move from her high cost rental with treacherous stairs to an assisted living with what money she has left.	0
when i bring it up she says she will kill herself but she has to move.	0
so i have dragged my feet all summer and all fall and now almost to spring.	0
but i have to get her to move, i know she will hate moving, but it's for her safety.	0
"a few months ago the power went out in her neighborhood and she uses the treacherous stairs to go to ""ask people"" on the street what was going on."	0
with no flashlight, in the dark and she tripped.	0
she's lucky it was not worse.	0
but she a time bomb that is gonna go off if i do not get this done.	0
how am i summon the strength to get this done?	0
i think everyone has one person in their life that they could go to with anything to share.	0
for me, that was my mom and over the last almost 2 years, i've been her caregiver.	0
over the last year, her cognition and speech have declined to the point that she's a different person.	0
i'm 30 years old and dammit i want my mom.	0
i have a wonderful sister, amazing friends some caring aunts, but none of them are my mom.	0
my mom was the person i would talk to about our days and we would make plans and i helped her with the house and met her for lunches and dinners.	0
i could get home at 2 am on a tuesday and chat with her in her room for 20 minutes if it had been a few days since we had talked.	0
i've lost that, and that's the hardest part of this for me.	0
my sister and mom were not quite as close, and she has her boyfriend who has been her support.	0
my aunts have each other or their spouse to talk to about this, same as before.	0
i feel like in addition to the normal struggles of caregiving, i lost even more than they did because i don't have my usual emotional support.	0
how has anyone else dealt with this?	0
is there a group of supportive moms who i can hire just to give me a hug and make me feel like i'm someone's child again?	0
if not there's your million dollar idea, someone.	0
rent-a-mom.	0
thanks for reading.	0
it's been a bad weekend and the week ahead is going to be rough, and i just needed a minute.	0
my grandmother is in the process of getting a diagnosis.	0
theyre leaning towards alzheimers i think.	0
before they were saying cognitive impairment syndrome or something.	0
i honestly dont even really know what all of it means, but i know its not good.	0
over the past like 3-4 years shes been declining.	0
more quickly recently.	0
we dont let her drive anymore because shes forgotten how to go to the grocery store and forgotten how to get to her hairdresser and was lost and refused to carry a cellphone.	0
she cant remember what happened literally, im not even kidding, what happened about 30-60 seconds ago.	0
shes refusing to eat and drink.	0
shes extremely thin and only eats a few nibbles of the food we force her to eat a day.	0
we started to try to get her to drink ensure, only gets through about half a bottle a day.	0
shes also aggressive.	0
shes never been mean like that before.	0
she misplaces a lot of things and then comes to me screaming and yelling and banging on my bedroom door asking me where is _____, i know you have it and if i say i dont have or dont know where whatever shes looking for is she accuses me of lying and calls me a horrible person and tells me im the reason she wants to commit suicide.	0
sometimes she even throws things at me or hits me for doing mundane things like washing the dishes or doing laundry.	0
i just dont know how to cope with it.	0
today, shes accused me of stealing something as soon as i got home a little while later.	0
and i guess she decided to cook dinner and i walked in the kitchen just in time before the pot of water overflowed and spilled everywhere because she had walked away and forgotten about it.	0
i had turned to stove off, but she turned it back on without me noticing and then put her hand flat on it and was surprised it was hot even though the burner was red, and the little on light was on.	0
dear all, both on the side of the affected person and on the caregivers` side there is a lot of anxiety and uncertainty in dementia care once the symptoms get more severe.	0
"still, i want to ask you, what would you have wished to do with your relatives when they were still in ""good enough"" shape?"	0
which happy memories did you actively create to keep your relative in your memory?	0
which advice or regrets do you have?	0
hello again, everyone.	0
you've helped me before greatly with aiding my mother who has dementia.	0
we are now progressing through her tests and getting me assigned as her legal caregiver.	0
night time is hard for her.	0
she presents classic sundowners and will even cry if she gets too anxious (this tends to happen if her abusive ex tries to call her).	0
lately she keeps saying she is sorry she's such a burden (nothing i have ever saud bit any family members) and that her life is over, she has nothing left, so on.	0
last night i was able to calm her by laying in bed with her and reminding her i'm not going anywhere.	0
does anyone else face this?	0
is there anyway to try and gently curb this?	0
it breaks my heart to hear her say such things and i don't want her to be sad if i can do something about it.	0
her physiologist mentioned he might put her on anti-depressants to help with her sundowners because of the severity.	0
random thing i've noticed as well: door locking.	0
my goodness!	0
she mocks and unlocks abd relocks every door she can at least 20 times at night.	0
this seems to help keep her calmer, so i allow it but she got a good chuckle when she realized she'd locked me out of the house once.	0
my mil is in the last stages of colon rectal cancer.	0
it has spread over her entire body.	0
she like most colon cancer patients puts off a distinct smell and can not hold her bowels.	0
ive learned a few tricks that i thought might help someone else.	0
a little bit of vicks under your nose and it will block out almost any smell.	0
tooth paste will get the poop smell off your hands.	0
no one talks about these things not even the doctors.	0
it wasnt until i brought it up to them did they tell me it was normal.	0
they offered no tips on how to get us both through this stressful, awkward situation.	0
so i thought id share hoping to help someone else in the same position have an easier day.	0
hi all, i'm trying to understand loss of mental capacity in order to help a family member (sorry if i keep things vague).	0
say an elderly mother has handed over financial and care power of attorney to a mix of siblings, as they are unable to manage them themslefs.	0
they are posing a risk to themslefs at night when they wander out of the house, call 999 for no reason, don't know where they are, who's house they're in or insist on coming back home with anyone who visits them.	0
a doctor has been out and said they have lost capacity at the time of their visit, however some days she regains it back, how does this work?	0
before anyone is alarmed, i'm taking to my grandpa to the hospital today because this is the third day he refuses to eat anything.	0
i've tried everything: protein shakes, little snacks instead of big meals, trying to offer his meal every 30 min, cutting up the portions very small, getting my little brother to try and feed him because that worked last time but nope.	0
i was going to try making soup instead but i think i should just call 911 and have the hospital check him out.	0
i've talked to his doctor last week because thats when his appetite started to decrease and it had me worried.	0
"she was like ""it could be his depression"" and i was like ah okay so i tried cheering him up."	0
then i thought maybe it has smth to do with his blood sugar (decreased appetite, extreme thirst).	0
but now i can't make him eat anything at all.	0
on day one i thought he just didnt feel like it, day two and he still doesn't want to, and now we're in the morning of day three.	0
i'm really anxious because.....could it be a sign he's dying?	0
i also feel a lot of guilt because it's only been a year of me caring for him yet he's already going down.	0
i know that if he does pass away, my family will blame me and.....it just won't be good.	0
idk.	0
idk if i was ever cut out for personal caregiving but at least i tried my best.	0
hi.	0
me again.	0
my 68-year-old father has an infection in his legs, because he hasnt showered even once in the maybe three weeks hes been home from the nursing home.	0
he complains of leg pain, but will not take a shower, and even swears and screams sometimes when somebody suggests it, even in a polite tone of voice.	0
is this an elderly thing?	0
is it an illness/handicapped thing?	0
is it a boomer thing??	0
lol.	0
whatever it is, its driving me insane.	0
he also wont go to doctors or hospital even tho last week a nurse said the leg infection warrants er.	0

my parents are, thankfully, in good mental health... no signs of mental faculties slipping, besides occasionally struggling to find a word.	0
my dad is in decent physical health and very mobile, and my mom is... well, she's extremely sedentary, and won't take care of herself beyond the bare minimum.	0
after a recent major medical incident (which became minor because she refused to see a doctor and hid symptoms until it almost killed her), we discovered my mother is diabetic.	0
my dad has taken over 80% of her care, while my husband and i pick up the remaining 20% slack.	0
mom constantly bemoans her situation, complains about constantly being stuck with needles and how her fingers and stomach hurt all the time, but refuses to actively participate in her own care and has even made veiled threats that if she did have control over her diabetic testing, she'd stop doing it entirely.	0
"every private chat i have with her, especially concerning what she wants to eat, devolves into her complaining about how she ""can't eat anything she wants"" and ""misses real food""."	0
every time i try to explain to her she can still have the vast majority of the things she complains about missing, she then complains about serving sizes (even though she usually has a very small appetite).	0
she also has dental issues because of a cheap dentist who caused her a lot of trauma (ignored the fact painkillers weren't working while doing major dental surgery).	0
her response to everything is to move the goal post.	0
"""i just miss real food!"""	0
"""you can still eat most things."""	0
"""i'm already so limited in what i can eat!"""	0
"""so find a new dentist."""	0
"""i can't even imagine going to a dentist, i still have nightmares over the last one."""	0
"""so talk to a therapist."""	0
"""i can't do therapy!"	0
you know how poorly group therapy went for me.	0
"plus we're in a pandemic."""	0
"""so talk to an individual therapist."	0
"you can do it online."""	0
"""i don't need therapy!"	0
"i just need someone to talk to."""	0
"""have you considered finding a social group online?"""	0
"""i type too slow to do that."""	0
"""i can set you up with my tablet so you can do voice or video."""	0
"""every time i talk to you, you get upset with me!"""	0
you're damn right i get upset.	0
dad and i are both at the end of our ropes.	0
it feels like we're constantly struggling to keep someone from drowning, and they keep shoving away every life preserver or rope we throw them, then complain about the water rising.	0
my dad should be enjoying his retirement but instead he's stuck caring for a chain-smoking, excuse-making wife who has stopped performing any chores and bitterly complains about the way other people try to do things for her.	0
i know my mom's life is difficult.	0
she feels like a shut-in (she doesn't drive, she can't visit the small amount of extended family she has because they're careless about the pandemic, etc), but she also does nothing at all to try to improve her own life and relies on us to cater to her vices and demands.	0
i came very close to losing my mom a few months ago, and i feel like if the same situation were to happen over again, she'll have learned nothing, and will do her best to avoid going to a doctor even at the risk of her own life.	0
hi, we are a group of two people working on a university project to help alzheimer/dementia patients, and also their family members that care for them.	0
we have some personal experience from our families, but of course, our experience is probably not enough to really come up with useful and helpful ideas or solutions.	0
as we would like to know more about alzheimer patient's/caretakers' experiences, we designed a small survey, which can be done anonymously, and focuses on the pain points of this journey, as this is our starting point.	0
if you want, you can help us.	0
almost all questions are optional.	0
so if you ever think that you can't or don't want to answer one, just don't answer it.	0
survey: https://forms.gle/7gcjszklyb37bgwe7 this is the very first version, and if you have any feedback we are really happy to know what we can improve with the survey :-) thank you very much.	0

i post this a lot but it still irks me.	0
hes had maybe 200 calories today.	0
when i get home from work hes finally starting on the bagel and mocha i bought him 8 hours ago.	0
made dinner a little late but he said he couldnt chew it.	0
i cut it into morsels and he gave up.	0
he drank wine instead.	0
i offered to watch a movie and he seemed enthusiastic and then as it took me a while to start it he says just turn everything off.	0
so i cancel the lights and tv and hes up immediately on his ipad.	0
now its 4:30 am and this will cycle again tomorrow.	0
what is wrong with old people?	0
hes been doing this for months but wont acknowledge the fact that hes dying.	0
this pattern will kill him sooner but hed rather mope around and ask me for booze to numb it than to try at all.	0
in january, i got a place with my grandmother (65), ive noticed some behaviors that are alarming to me, but i cant seem to tell if its her getting older or something more serious.	0
i didnt spend much time with my grandmother before moving in together, so i cant tell if what i have noticed has become progressively worse or not.	0
1 she will tell the same story within a few hours or the next day of already telling it.	0
2 she bought an outfit for my baby and then a few weeks later rebought the same outfit and completely forgot when she bought it originally.	0
3 she grocery shops 4 times a week and buys multiples of things.	0
she will specifically buy items in multiples of 3. and will also buy a bunch of different types of the same item.	0
(i.e.	0
we have 5 brand new bags of chips) 4 she has had a cough since prior to moving in, but she will only cough when im not in the room.	0
in the mornings i listen to her cough about every 3 minutes from my bedroom.	0
5 she has a very hard time changing her normal routine and has to plan anything outside of work 3 weeks in advance.	0
6 she will hear noises that arent there.	0
(i.e.	0
has claimed the car behind her was honking when it wasnt, that the upstairs neighbors are making a specific noise when they arent, etc) she is a very passive aggressive lady.	0
so im having a hard time distinguishing her behaviors, because i just dont know her very well.	0
my mom has been concerned since i have brought up these examples to her and has been noticing the odd behavior.	0
she also has hypertension and asthma.	0
im not looking for a diagnosis just some guidance as to whether or not im going crazy or if these are signs of something as serious as dementia or even ocd!	0
anything will help really.	0
this is me thinking out loud.	0
i live in texas.	0
this week has been hellish for a lot of people here, with arctic air and extreme cold compared to our usual.	0
my husband and i were lucky to maintain power (thus have heat) and our frozen faucets thawed out without damage.	0
my mother, 86, who lives alone in an apartment, was not so lucky.	0
she has dementia and between hired caregivers 3x weekly and myself, has been managing, although over the last year or so it seems shes been deteriorating.	0
cell phone service was spotty or non-existent too, and with an ice storm it wasnt safe to drive, plus im no spring chicken myself (66, spouse 70).	0
i had left warm clothing, blankets, ready to eat food and lighting in case the power was out for a few hours.	0
i tried calling her the first day, and after 24 hours of not being able to reach her i called the local constable for a wellness check.	0
they got back to me in 45 min.	0
saying she had no power but said she was fine.	0
overnight it got very cold.	0
ice and snow in a place that sees snow every ten years and goes for years without a hard freeze.	0
the next day the caretakers called meshe was cold, hungry, wet, and not using any of the stuff id left except a sleeping bag to wrap up in.	0
so we (carefully) went and collected her and brought her to my house.	0
shes fine and as good as it gets now, but i realized shes much more frail, and much less cognitively functional, than i thought.	0
she has no resources except me and is medicaid eligible.	0
she really needs some kind of facility; memory care might do it, but the only ones i can find are private pay and very expensivei cant really afford her current caretakers, much less another $3000-4000/month beyond that, which is what they cost in my area.	0
the rates appear to have gone down from covid; but i also am wary of facilities during covid, and i havent been able to schedule a vaccination for her yet.	0
i had been planning on moving to a more medicaid-friendly state and finding a place with an in-law suite or adu, but im now concerned that even that level of removal from constant contact would be a problem, not to mention the real estate craziness that puts another home out of reach.	0
in my current home, it would be very difficult to accommodate her on a longer term basis, and my husband has extremely limited tolerance for another person, plus her level of needespecially where incontinence is an issue.	0
the smell alone, even when dealing with it as well as possible, makes it tough.	0
i am really nonplussed by her level of physical and cognitive deterioration.	0
i had no idea she was this bad off.	0
she wants to go back to her apartment, and i want her to go back to her apartment, but im really concerned about her functional level at this point and hesitant about taking her home.	0
there just dont seem to be any half-decent options, and im worried about her, worried about living my own life, worried about my spouse, worried about money, just worried about everything.	0
[removed]	0
my grandmom turned 92 and lives alone.	0
she has no money and has been on medicaid.	0
soc security pretty much pays for rent.	0
she has been having anxiety episode at night and calls an ambulance.	0
its starting to get really bad at night and i dont think she can live alone.	0
where do we even start.	0
she cant live with her kids because she is a bit of a tough bird.	0
hi ive been taking care of my husband for a month.	0
hes been having health problems and doctors cant figure out the root problem.	0
hes been sick for a few months but he started to decline in january and its been bad since then.	0
im always tired.	0
i try to drink coffee or yerba mate but it doesnt always help.	0
any tips on how i can get more energy?	0
i need energy and i have to be able to think of new ways to help my husband.	0
he can barely sleep or eat anything its scary.	0
sometimes we only sleep 3-4 hours.	0
his quality of life isnt good rn.	0
hes 28 years old.	0
he was fine and was able to eat anything and work a few months ago before everything started.	0
i also go back to work next week and im nervous about how hes going to do when im at work.	0
hes going to be alone.	0
i work 12 hours shifts.	0
thanks in advance	0
my dad was rx'd hydromorphone around dec 19th 2019 for the pain in his left hip.	0
on jan 18th this year, he finally had the replacement done.	0
he has been in the hospital since, due to many factors.	0
he is now in the rehab ward, and i am.able to visit him approx 1x/week.	0
"for days now he hs been complaining that ""they"" are only giving him 0.5mg of hydromorphone at night, and he wants 1mg (he was taking 2 every 6 hours since 1st rx'd.)"	0
on friday night they cut him off completely.	0
he has been asking me for days to being him more from what he has at home (i will be returning these to the pharmacy this week), and i keep telling him that i cannot.	0
i tell him he has to tell the staff if he is in pain, and he says he has, but i'm not sure.	0
he also claims that they have decreased his trazodone to a quarter of a 25mg tablet, when his rx is for 1-2 whole, as needed.	0
i am not impressed with the staff in this ward, but i obviously need to speak to someone about this.	0
right now, all i can do is talk to the nurse on duty.	0
how do i escalate things, though?	0
and what do i ask for in terms of his obvious addiction to the hydromorphone?	0
any help appreciated.	0
i used to work in the kitchen at the nursing home, but ive switched to caregiving.	0
so, luckily i know the residents pretty well, but im getting slightly overwhelmed with how many things i need to do in a day.	0
take everyones temps daily, answer calls when they need something, showers, get them to and from the dining room, do laundry.	0
im terrified that im going to forget about something and one of the residents suffer from it.	0
my 82 year old father (not overweight, still has his mental abilities, not many other issues besides his heart) has been in the hospital for just over two weeks.	0
he was admitted because he was recently diagnosed with congestive heart failure and had fluid build up in his lungs and legs and he couldn't breathe.	0
all of this happened in the last 3 months - he got an angiogram, they didn't find any significant blockages (he had a stent put in a few years earlier) but they noticed valve leakage which an echo confirmed.	0
after that, the doctor put him on water pills but no supplemental oxygen and he was a little better until he started coughing a lot (he always had a bit of a bronchitis) but the fluid buildup got out of hand.	0
pretty much after his second day in the hospital where he took even more diuretics and given oxygen, the fluid build-up in his legs disappeared but he still needed the oxygen while moving and his coughing is still there and they were trying to dry out his lungs.	0
he was almost ready to be discharged and be given home oxygen since he had limited but adequate mobility with the oxygen on, but he also got a kidney infection a blood clot in his lungs.	0
also, last week the entire city was shut down due to the texas power outages and freezing cold, etc.	0
so i'm thankful he was under care.	0
after over two weeks in the hospital though he was getting really sad and wanted to go home but he lives alone and while i or my siblings check in on him and run his errands and such, the doctor didn't feel comfortable discharging him at home at this time because he is still very weak and would require someone to be there in case he is in trouble.	0
we also don't have oxygen set up at his place yet.	0
if he lived with someone else, he would consider it.	0
because of that, he is recommending a skilled care facility for 2 weeks.	0
"this is all new to me and ""nursing home"" is a scary word both because of the reputation, but also because of the costs."	0
he has part a and b and i know that part a only covers the first 20 days of a nursing home before being $180 a day for the next 80 days and nothing after that.	0
the case worker at the hospital is insisting this is a temporary facility and is considered in-patient.	0
so...are snfs that are ordered prior to discharge considered in patient and is there a distinction between them and longterm facilities or is this going to take 20 days away from his 100 days of medicare nursing home coverage?	0
are those 20 days recovered if he is discharged and can be used again in the future?	0
let's say he's well enough to be discharged after 2 weeks with oxygen this time, will they tell us where to go and what to get?	0
let's say that he would need skilled nursing care at home when he's discharged.	0
does medicare pay for that longterm?	0
does the snf help set that up?	0
what if he doesn't get well enough and can't afford to stay in a nursing home longterm...does the snf center help with medicaid applications or are we on our own there?	0
all of this is super scary to me.	0
hi everyone!	0
i thought id come to this subreddit once more to ask for advice on parental controls i can use for my moms facebook.	0
shes on facebook and instagram all the time, usually she just likes random posts but recently shes been inviting myself (and i worry others) to completely random facebook groups.	0
shes at the point where she doesnt really know what shes doing or reading, and i was wondering if anyone knows of a good parental controls app (or anything really!)	0
that we can use to keep her from sending weird things to people.	0
thanks in advance :d	0
my husband has been dealing with health problems for 6 months and has lost about 70-80lbs.	0
doctors havent been able to find out whats going on to cause all that weight loss and food intolerances.	0
all his test have come back normal except some blood test.	0
his doctor ordered a lot of blood work that they never done so im being positive and hopeful that we find out whats going on.	0
hes barely able to tolerate food, feels uncomfortable all the time, barely sleeps, he feels like hes always dying and weve gone to the er over 20 times ive lost count.	0
sometimes we are in the er parking lot all day long.	0
i took 5 weeks off work to take care of him.	0
hes 27 years old before all of this he was working, going to the gym and was fine.	0
i get exhausted at times and i tell him that hes fine that hes not dying.	0
i hurt him when i saw that because he feels im being like all the doctors who tell him its anxiety.	0
i try my best to be supportive.	0
im a little burnt out.	0
its been bad lately, he feels alone and i really try to be there for him.	0
he tells me that im selfish for thinking about myself and i dont mean to be.	0
im just so exhausted that i need to drink coffee or energy drinks so that i can focus.	0
i put him before me but im starting to feel like im getting sick because i havent been sleeping much, barely eating and under a lot of stress and losing hair.	0
i go back to work soon.	0
idk how hes going to be home alone.	0
im so scared that we arent going to find out what going on with him & that hes going to die.	0
im also scared that hes never going to be the same he has a lot of anger and has been mean to me and verbally abusive.	0
i just cry all the time.	0
i know hes taking out his frustrations out on me thats the only thing he feels control over.	0
i just dont know how to help and be better.	0
anybody got any tips on keeping very old people warm?	0
they are so bad at generating their own body heat.	0
it's so frustrating trying to keep my mother warm in the winter.	0
she has a thick sheet, an electric blanket, and 2 more layers of blankets on top of her.	0
all the electric blankets are unreliable and they are manufactured to fail or work poorly after a few weeks to a few months.	0
i have bought 3 of them so far.	0
i can't find one electric blanket that will be consistent and reliable for even one year.	0
i hate that so much.	0
they are screwing over my mom just so they can sell a lot more electric blankets.	0
it makes me want to learn how to fix them or make my own electric blanket that won't fail!!!	0
she almost always says her arms are cold, but they feel warm to me.	0
her body feels warm too, but she often says her body is cold.	0
today, i researched what kind of foods will help keep her warm, but most of those are foods she doesn't like to eat.	0
she likes to eat quickly digested, high glycemic foods which don't help her be warm.	0
i need to give her low glycemic foods and put much more fat in her diet, because she eats almost no fat.	0
i'm also trying to give her food with plenty of vitamin c to help her blood vessels & circulation.	0
hi all, i'm at my wits end searching the internet for the right answer.	0
hoping you all can give some insight.	0
thanks in advanced!	0
my mom is in ny, disabled, can't bathe or use the bathroom by herself, and can't live by herself at all.	0
her boyfriend is her caretaker but he's in the hospital indefinitely as of today.	0
i'm out of state which means i will have to quarantine for 2 weeks as soon as i get there.	0
what options do we have immediately?	0
she can't be alone over night.	0
is there an emergency line to call for immediate assistance?	0
what options do we have in the medium term?	0
(2 weeks until i can help) for the longer term, i've left some messages with nursing homes but from friends and family i've talked to it can take months to find placement.	0
my dad was just prescribed rivastigmine.	0
does anyone have any experience with this?	0
did you see any noticeable difference in your parent?	0

first, i'd like to say that, although my mom does not have alzheimer's, i hope this has some value for some of you.	0
i was the sole caregiver for my mom's sister, my aunt, who had alzheimer's for more than six years.	0
i'm a teacher and i came across this tool that is helping my mother, who is experiencing cognitive decline.	0
it's a simple crossword puzzle generator.	0
in the last two days i have been making her customized/personalized puzzles with this tool.	0
these puzzles are easy and relate to her life.	0
i limit them to ten words for her.	0
as a matter of fact, she is now giving me word lists or we create them together.	0
here is the link along with instructions (i've already told the creator that he need to add instructions.)	0
https://easytools.es/en/crossword/ to create a new puzzle: 1)  delete the existing puzzle.	0
2)  type your first word followed by a space (note  if the word will not work it will change color and no number will appear), then type the clue directly following the word.	0
3)  hit enter and type your next word.	0
4)  keep going until you are finished.	0
5)  print the puzzle with the solution for an answer key, then print it without the solution for those who will be working the puzzle.	0
grid size: pick your size.	0
max computation time: how much time to you want to give the computer to figure out your puzzle?	0
my 73 yr old mother has dementia.	0
she lives with me.	0
i work full-time and am her only caretaker.	0
mist of the times, things are fine.	0
she doesnt need a lot of care.	0
but .	0
. . she has a habit of picking at her skin, when theres any kind of blemish, dry skin, scab/etc.	0
to be picked at.	0
band-aids dont last five minutes.	0
she takes them off and keeps picking.	0
ive tried gauze pads with different kinds of medical tape, paper tape, etc.	0
ive tried liquid band-aid applied several times daily.	0
most of the time shes not aware that shes doing it.	0
when i point it out as shes doing it she denies shes doing it.	0
then later she asks me why there is blood under her fingernails .	0
. . does anyone have any ideas for helping me help her with this?	0
i am my boyfriends caregiver, i have been with him since 2006. he has gone downhill ever since.	0
he was able to walk a little when we got together but now he is confined to a bed.	0
i am responsable for doing everything for him from feeding, bathing, catheter changes, etc.	0
he does not want anyone else to help.	0
i have no support, my family lives a long way away.	0
i am really tired of it all.	0
i really just want to leave but am conflicted on what would happen if i do.	0
so i just stay, but i am really not feeling anything for him anymore, just feeling like i can't continue like this.	0
"how many of you caregivers are in an environment that is ""toasty"" to say the least?"	0
"my mom with dementia likes the heat in her house to be at a level that i refer to as: ""hot enough to bake cookies on the counter""."	0
it was easier for me to handle the heat back when i would only go to her house every day.	0
at this point, her dementia has progressed to the point where i'm having to stay with her 24/7.	0
"now i get to ""enjoy"" the heat all the time!"	0
gotta love it!	0
im not sure if this is the right sub to post this on so please feel free to direct me elsewhere.	0
im just looking for some first-hand advice/support on this.	0
i have two medically fragile parents and an a adult brother with asd who all live together.	0
i dont live with them but im their medical caregiver and i also deliver groceries and other necessities.	0
my father has dementia and is starting to go downhill and im worried about him ruining them financially.	0
ive reached out to some lawyers and from what ive been told i need to get a conservatorship over my father, whereas my mom just needs a durable power of attorney.	0
everything ive read online is pretty intimidating in regards to obtaining the conservatorship so im looking for some first hand accounts on the process and how it played out.	0
i know that my father is going to be against the conservatorship, mostly because of his arrogance and ego.	0
im mostly just nervous and worried about how this will affect their home situation because he can get pretty verbally aggressive and neither my mom nor brother deserve that.	0
i know that at some point (soon) i will need to start looking for a nursing home or assisted living facility for my father, its just getting my mother to understand that and get over her guilt thats holding up the process.	0
for those interested in previous editions, you can get the whole story as it has unfolded from the beginning.	0
"the first post was most prematurely called ""celebration!"	0
"i hope some find this encouraging!"""	0
"this was followed by ""celebration!"	0
"continued, this is part 2"", and after that, ""update: moving my parents"" then ""moving my parents, update february 16"" and the most recent post until today was ""moving my parents, update february 17."""	0
be forewarned, they're long and detailed, but put all together they sort of form a journal of what it has been like to deal with this very serious and real challenge of dealing with aging parents.	0
yesterday (friday the 19th) was the day of my parents' first visit to the assisted living facility we had selected for them after weeks of research and a visit of our own that took place this past saturday.	0
the visit, due to a combination of factors, couldn't have gone much worse.	0
first, the main salesperson for the building is employed not by the facility, but by the company that owns several others in the region, and he has been called away for a number of weeks to work in a place that needs him, so he has turned sales over to the executive director.	0
she is an amazing person, warm, caring, compassionate, highly professional, and if i could pick someone to run my assisted living facility she would be the clear choice.	0
salesmanship, however, is not a strong point.	0
i had done what i could to help her before the meeting, letting her know that although my dad would do all the talking, it was my mother who would make the decision.	0
i also told her that my parents were a bit confused about the differences between services offered by a retirement community and services offered in an assisted living community.	0
"i thought she might open with ""so, let's begin by talking about what our community has to offer you, and how that's different from the place you've been considering."""	0
instead, when we entered the office area, my mom chose a seat not at the main table, sitting in a corner behind the presenter and making it awkward for the presenter ever to make eye contact with her.	0
i suggested to mom that she sit at the main table, but she declined.	0
"in the light of that, the administrator chose not to press the issue, (""oh, please, do come sit at the table so we can be sure we're all hearing each other"" might have worked) so for the meeting, my mom, (the decider) sat behind the presenters who were wearing masks and face shields."	0
i doubt mom heard a word they said.	0
after an awkward silence when asked for questions, i spoke up and attempted to direct the conversation.	0
"""my parents have been looking at a retirement community."	0
maybe you could tell them the difference between the services offered, and it's important that they understand why assisted living is more expensive.	0
"what do they get for the difference in cost?"""	0
given that prompt, she brightened right up and did an excellent job detailing the differences and justifying the extra expense.	0
at that point we were joined by the activities coordinator, who without reading the room and seeing she was dealing with two frail 90 year olds, began describing, and no kidding, all the different crafts that could be done using toilet paper roll cores.	0
"""every month has a theme, and every month we do a project with toilet paper rolls."	0
"we make valentines, easter bunnies, fireworks, turkeys, you name it, it can be made with toilet paper rolls!"""	0
this went on for way too long, and although my parents listened politely, the presenters had totally lost their interest.	0
what they like to do is see family members, socialize with friends over coffee (pre-covid) and watch television.	0
they already toured europe and almost all 50 states, had all kinds of fun, and making things out of toilet paper rolls is nowhere near going to match those experiences.	0
just as she finished her presentation, in came a lady rolling a cart of alcoholic beverages.	0
"""would anyone care for beer or wine?"""	0
she asked.	0
again, tone-deaf.	0
my parents have never been day drinkers.	0
they don't judge others, but this was not a great move.	0
the time came to see the available room just as a massive rainstorm hit.	0
the sky turned dark, the rain poured down, and of course any unfurnished room looks darker and less attractive in a rainstorm, with no sun shining in.	0
my parents took one look and no.	0
because of covid protocols still in place in oregon, my parents weren't permitted to tour the rest of the facility.	0
they didn't get to see the dining room, the bistro, the movie theater, or any of the other amenities that might have been attractive.	0
i cannot blame them for rejecting this choice.	0
"in the ensuing discussion back home, not only did we end up back at square one, ""we aren't moving,"" but we actually went into the negative numbers for a moment when my mother said, ""here's an idea."	0
"why don't you sell your house and move closer to us?"""	0
they just don't get it.	0
they're 90, they're losing their way, they're not safe, they need to be somewhere safer and preferably closer to us.	0
even if we did sell our house and move closer to them, they still wouldn't have around the clock security.	0
they'd still have yards that are deteriorating into the shame of the neighborhood, they'd still fall once or twice a month and have no guarantee of immediate assistance, they'd still cook and clean.	0
unless, of course, they hired people for all these services, and that will cost more than they can afford, because in order to afford them, they'd have to sell their house, which is all part of the plan to finance their late-in-life care.	0
if something happened to me, i explained, that required my wife to care for me, there would be no one to do anything for them, and they'd suddenly be in a very bad way.	0
they've never owned a computer, they have no idea of how to buy supplies or do anything on one.	0
their whole lives pivot on my ability to serve them.	0
i did it quite willingly all of last year to keep them safe in their own home from exposure to covid, and now they have come to rely on my services, but they are unsafe at home and need to move.	0
so that's where it stands right now.	0
"dad even said, ""i know we're being selfish."""	0
ok, so he knows, but he doesn't care to do anything about it.	0
this story will continue, so for those who are interested, look for the next update when something else happens.	0
sorry if this isnt the correct place to ask/post, its the only sub ive found which i think could help?	0
i work in an emi home and almost all our (nearly 40) residents have dementia.	0
im currently doing my nvq2 which im only a few months into.	0
this is my first care job and i think im doing pretty well.. apart from being slow.	0
i mean, making myself and other colleagues a bit late due to them having to come help me.	0
i seem to find getting them washed and dressed (either in the morning or for bed) the longest task?!	0
i want to make sure theyre clean and have no moist spots (especially our bed patients!)	0
but i seem to take farrrr too long ): they say we are given 15 minutes per resident, which i run over a little, while my coworkers dont even need 10 minutes.	0
they can do like 2 maybe 3 residents while i finish one ): i understand theyve been doing this for years but how can someone fuck up/majorly slow down a very simple process?	0
i set everything up near me, i forget something every now and then which slows me down, i try to encourage the resident to let me wash and dress them nice and quickly so theyre ready, for bed or for the day, but it seems like nothing i do speeds up the process.	0
we are really strapped for time in that house so everything has to go as fast and as smoothly as possible but i feel like ive just come in and completely messed that up.. any tips for a speedy morning/night routine that also keeps the resident feeling happy and dignified?	0
any little tips you've found that work with a particular acting resident?	0
anything helps honestly, i just want to make my residents happy and keep the house routine going as smooth as possible	0

this sounds like a duh obvious question from what little ive read on reddit, but i still have to ask because ive had people tell me that its easy to get up once in a while, that he needs my help and hes sleepy too, etc.	0
my 68-year-old father has wounds on his legs, that he insisted on unwrapping himself last night around 7, that are infected because he refuses to shower and screams when we ask him to.	0
i went up for bed at 11 oclock or so, he didnt ask me to wrap his legs then, and i was super tired so i went up.	0
suddenly i hear him screaming in the middle of the night to get down here, that he needs his legs wrapped, and dont i know where his bandages are, do i pay attention when the nurses come?	0
no, frankly, i dont know where they are, though i suspect they are in the big bag in the living room.	0
why isnt he paying attention when the nurses come?	0
i am in another room doing laundry, dishes, cooking, etc.	0
i was so tired i was dreaming when he called me, both times.	0
im tired of breaking up my sleep schedule, its messing with my health.	0
the nurses dont come anymore, by the way, because he refused to go to the hospital when they told him to, so that makes him noncompliant and they dont take noncompliant patients.	0
the reason this is not obvious to me is because caregiving is a tough job, and the person you are giving care to is this crippled, ill person whose needs take precedence because they will experience more harm if they dont get their needs met, supposedly.	0
maybe its not selfish to sleep literally, and thats obviously not what the post is about, but am i really supposed to just sacrifice my health and do things i physically cannot do, i get downstairs without falling asleep standing up?	0
especially if its the individuals fault his legs are this bad in the first place?	0
(diabetic and wont change diet or take proper medication or cooperate with doctors).	0
ill pay for an app i dont care but ive read reviews where the recording doesnt show up.	0
anyone know of a good app to record our last calls :( ?	0

i've been helping my parents take care of my grandfather with alzheimer's for roughly two years now and things haven't been too difficult until about a month ago.	0
it was then that my grandma was diagnosed with pancreatitis and sent on the long road to recovery.	0
that recovery has been marred with countless setbacks and the latest development is looking pretty grim.	0
the immediate problem i have is how were going to have to constantly remind him that she's not coming back from the hospital.	0
the next issue i have to figure out is how my parents can find relief.	0
they're both on antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds, but even that can't do everything to fight that negativity.	0
my final problem is how can i get help for myself.	0
at my weakest, its been bad enough for me to consider suicide, though i can talk myself off that ledge after enough time.	0
i realize that there are things worth living for, and i don't want to leave my fiance, i don't want to leave my parents or my brother, or my grandparents.	0
"but i'm afraid the rational ""me"" is losing out to this feeling of helplessness, as well as the emotional and mental unrest, and it scares me."	0

"hey everybody, it's me again. this was my last post in case anybody is wondering. it was really nice feeling supported from everyone, this sub has really become a source of comfort, advice, and knowledge for me.  i wanted to give a bit of an update. incontinence started earlier than my predictions, with the first recorded instance happening last night. i don't know if it was a full-blown accident, as it seems more like she didn't follow bathroom hygiene for a while and maybe it built up to the point of being visible? i don't know, and it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things.  mil was walking around and had a large spot on the back of her pants that i pointed out to bf. he tried to talk to her about it, but it ended up with her denying and him losing his patience. she eventually took a bath and we swapped out the pants. bf was exhausted and he's been in shock pretty much all night. he doesn't want to believe that this is happening and wants to believe this is a one-off and that she still has another 6+ months before having to worry about continence issues.  bf is poa, and is feeling overwhelmed, saying he didn't realize that poa meant doing so much. i think last night was a huge eye-opener as even he realizes that fighting with his mom every day to change her underwear is a lot. he's been really sad about this latest step, understandably so. i've tried bringing him to the sub, but he says he's not ready for all that, although he appreciates it when i read some of your posts and helpful responses out loud for him. we talked it over for a while, and he messaged his sister and we're having a small family meeting tonight after work. according to him, she hasn't been telling him all the awful details that have been happening when she takes mil out once a week. i'm not sure about this, because sil and i have talked about it multiple times. he says he was doubting both of our stories because he didn't see it, it hasn't happened to him, and that we were alone when it was happening. i pointed out that he's the one in the family that's famous for having a temper and also that he is a man and his mother has been getting increasingly sexist in the last year or so and that may be affecting the way she addresses him. we also talked about our approaches to care. he admitted that he had been feeling like i was being a wicked witch and a bit of a dictator with trying to establish care. he also said i was being mean to his mom. i asked for clarification and explained that i keep my tone neutral and use easy to understand words when i'm asking her to do something because any other tone elicits an outburst from her as she really doesn't like authority, or me for that matter. he did acknowledge that i've never yelled at her, or sworn at her, or anything like that and that he didn't know that was why i was keeping voice low and that maybe he had misinterpreted what i was doing.  bf apologized to me for being mean to me when he's realizing that me being  'cold & clinical ' is simply trying to talk to him about where we are in the process and how to make his mother's quality of life better. he has been a bit frazzled and has never really had a routine, so it's been a constant struggle establishing one. for instance, last night, dinner wasn't even on the table until 11pm! granted, the accident was a huge factor, but we're just all over the place schedule-wise. i sat down with him last night and wrote out a schedule of care that she would be expected to get if she was in a hospital, or a nursing home. i told him i was willing to help as long as we could argue that the quality of her life with us would be higher than she would be getting in a home. i also wrote down a list of symptoms to bring up on their next dr visit in february.  i'm hoping that after tonight's meeting, we can really start in earnest to find placement for mil, or at least some sort of respite.",updates to my last post,"table until 11pm! granted, the accident was a huge factor, but we're just all over the",daily care
"hey all. to make a long story short, after a string of traumatic events (a car wreck involving head-trauma, great grandmother's death, and my aunt's death) my nana has been showing signs of alzheimer's. my great grand-mother was also affected by alzheimer's; however, she was older than my nana is now. my nana has been divorced and my papaw is remarried to my mamaw (all these familial terms, lol). she has never hated my mamaw, maybe not liked, but never hated, though she now is certain that my mamaw and papaw got married immediately after my nana and papaw got a divorce and it burns her up. she genuinely believes it with her whole heart. to make matters worse, my nana was the one cheating on my papaw! so there's that. i would argue that my nana is still in touch with our reality to whatever extent, but our timelines and belief of how events played out is so different. how the hell do you deal with something like this? do you play into it, knowing it's not the truth? just ignore it? arguing only upsets her.",when the timeline becomes jumbled.,"traumatic events (a car wreck involving head-trauma, great grandmother's death, and my aunt's death) my nana has been showing signs of",daily care

"hi, i am a caregiver professionally, not for a family member. am i still able to ask a question here? i care and tutor for a sweet and special 12 year old boy with down syndrome. since i started, i have not been treated very nicely by his mother, but i have brushed it off really well. except for this last week. she seems to always assume the worst in me, and only point out what i do wrong, whether it's actually wrong or not. i have compassion for her though, because i believe she's had some bad experience with other caregivers, so she may be hyper vigilant. i understand and i am patient with her. but there have been times when she was straight up unkind towards me and sarcastic in a demeaning way towards me. when i first started the job, i was told i would be paid by her (for tutoring only) and by the man who runs the caregiving company who hired me for her. she has had a few times where she has asked me ""what am i paying you for?"" when she wanted to know what exactly i was tutoring the boy that day, instead of just asking me what  i was doing with him that day. she speaks to me as if i begged her to pay me before i started the job or something, but she had made the deal to pay me before she even met me. she treats me as if i am below her, and like i do not deserve to be paid or be treated nicely. i am ready to quit, but i love this boy and his sister so much. i told her today i wanted to talk to her about a problem i'm having with the job, because i don't want to quit. she does not know what it is i want to talk about. how do i do this without her feeling that i am attacking her?",am i still able to ask a question here?,"down syndrome. since i started, i have not been treated very nicely by his mother, but i have brushed it off really well. except for this last week. she seems to always assume the worst in me,",daily care
"(long post is long cause i really dont know what to do and theres a long history) so, ive been living with my mom my entire life, minus 2 years in college, and im 33 now. shes never been married, my father left when i was an infant, and i have a half sibling, but hes in a different state and we share a dad, not mom, so its only ever just been us. when i was around 20 she had been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, and after that i went back home to do community college to take help her out and to help take care of my grandpa who had been starting to get sick. ff to 2012 and she loses her job cause she was so sick, in and out of the hospital. in 2013 i lost the my job, the only job bringing in money, and right after that my grandpa died.  during the time i didnt have a job, (and before) we were borrowing $ from family, not paying bills, eating out a lot, and turning into hoarders. i would manage to get part time jobs in between, but they wouldnt last long, and lots of other stuff, but i was essentially her caretaker starting around that time. she got social security disability benefits in 2014. at the end of 2016, she had to have a leg amputated before she stepped on a sewing needle that went into her leg and turned the bottom half gangrene.  we lost our house in 2017 while she was recovering, and we moved, and i took over the finances, (which everything gets paid on time now), i kept the new apartment clean (because of a marathon of watching the show hoarders for almost 6 months), and i was her full time caretaker while working 2 jobs. i took care of all her dr appts and pills because she couldnt process the fact she had lost a limb, and then would go on to get an ostomy bag because the colitis was so bad and there was a cancer scare. she let the fear control her life, and then became too dependent on me.  i found us a better apartment, bigger for her wheelchair and have watched her go in and out of the hospital a half dozen, dozen times a year, watched her go to rehabs, been told at least a dozen times by drs they dont know how shes alive with how many health problems she has and how she refuses to take care of herself. ive been told 4 times in my life that if i had waited even one night longer she would have died. one rehab said they thought shed never get out of bed again, and 5 months later shes walking on a prosthetic leg.  only to watch her throw it all away as soon as she gets home because she wants normal back. she doesnt listen to me or take me seriously because she still sees me as her little girl, and were both stubborn as heck. we have more fights than good moments and im physically and emotionally exhausted. i now work from home, but have a part time job, and have a hobby i recently turned into a side hustle thats starting to make money, cause we live in an expensive place, and ive recently been using my health insurance to try and take care of my own mental conditions. she has family but they refuse to help, after so many times that ive asked for help. they tell me i need my own life, but wont offer even advice on how to make it happen.  recently, a friend helped push me to make some realizations that my mom is actually rather manipulative and shes not going to change because she has me waiting on her hand and foot. she honestly cant live by herself, but she refuses to think about even going to an assisted independent living place, and wont even let anyone but me take her to drs appointments, which is affecting my job by needing so much time off.  ive decided we need to live apart. im searching for a place for me, and im going to have to work almost 2 jobs and my side hustle to afford it, but feel it should be worth it. we found her some senior apartments and got her on a waitlist, but need to find a back up place for her while the waitlist goes on, because i cant do this anymore. i cry more often than not now, and we fight all the time because i just cant get her to take care of herself, even when im there doing everything for her. i know shes capable of it, and i hope that by moving it forces her to do it. i told her that id still be over at least a couple times a week to help prep meals and fill pills, but i havent lived on my own, and i need the freedom.  am i doing the right thing? im just..... so exhausted and im starting to resent her, and i dont want to, shes my mom, i love her.",am i doing the right thing?,"need to live apart. im searching for a place for me, and im going to have to work almost 2 jobs and my side hustle to afford it, but feel it should be worth it. we found her some",daily care

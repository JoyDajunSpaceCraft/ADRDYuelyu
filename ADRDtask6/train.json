without taking every other shift off and leaving early on almost all of the others (+other things). i have no clue where to start about this.  i could honestly put this in r/caregiversupport as well but i'm just not sure.  let me preface my post really quick with some information: my wife and i were married 3 years ago on may 5th 2018.  she has bipolar disorder as well as ptsd from watching her mother decline in health and finally pass away from metastasized breast cancer early 2017.  i knew all of this proceeding with marrying her.  now, i have an anxiety disorder myself and for quite some time have been dealing with a great deal of existential depression.  as dumb as that might sound to some, it's really done a number on me emotionally. now, when we were married, my wife was just about to graduate college while i was slightly behind her due to having spent two years abroad as a missionary for the mormon church (we have since left the mormon church).  long story short, my wife graduated, worked full time for 2 months in the summer at an entry level job in her field, said she didn't like it, promptly quit and proceeded to take a part time job at a call center that pays less hourly than i am without a degree.  this was mid 2019 by the way.  all this time my goal was simply to be supportive of her.  i know she struggles and i simply wanted to make sure she knew she had my support.  i figured she would soon enough be back to a different full time job in her field.  our plan had been for my wife to graduate school, begin working full time so i could switch to part time work while finishing up school and move back to full time once i graduated.  once my wife started working part time, however,  college kind of got put on the back burner for me and i ended up taking a break and taking one or two classes at a time because honestly working full time while going to school full time is something i simply cannot do.  i've tried it and it did not turn out well. anyway, back to the story.  time went on and things got more weird.  i could be wrong about this, but i am convinced that my wife became or already was a hypochondriac.  this first started to become clear to me when for her birthday in 2019 we went to an olive garden to use a gift card.  while we sat waiting for our food, i shit you not, one of the small floodlights above us popped and the lining of the light fell on her head.  of course we received the meal for free, but my wife began to complain of concussion symptoms.  then followed a string of expensive doctor appointments as well as a couple of mris for her.  keep in mind this was just a month or so after she quit her full time job for her part time job.  we ended up with a personal injury attorney and they started working on my wife's case to simply get the medical bills paid for.  i come to find out that the lining she was hit in the head with was no more than a couple of ounces in weight, something that had occurred to me at the time of the event but that i had ignored because i wanted to simply support my wife.  the case didn't end up ever going anywhere.  my wife eventually just stopped following up on the things she had to do for it despite me urging her to do so.  luckily the attorney takes their charges if and only if the case is resolved and there is a settlement, but we still had to pay the medical bills.   at this point, my wife had begun taking off practically every other shift and leaving early on most every other day (it's not too busy of a call center so they usually offer for people to go home early) citing nausea, aches, and pains as the reason why she couldn't go to work.  as time went on she started having more medical issues (examples being: appendicitis pain, blood clot pains, lung pains, what she thought was a broken rib from sneezing, etc, etc).   because of this a string of ultrasounds, x rays, urgent care visits, and even er visits happened.  none, i repeat, none of these ended up having any real underlying issue and we were always sent home with a large medical bill without any actual health issue to cite for it.  with each occurrence i have become more and more frustrated about this whole situation, though i suggest we take her to the doctor whenever she feels like she needs to go.  i'm not just going to let her die if she really has something wrong. i was then hit with my own health issues aside from my mental health.  i began having rapid heart movement episodes and had to go get an echocardiogram and some other checkups.  as it turns out i have two congenital heart conditions: wolffe parkinson white syndrome and bicuspid aortic valve.  when we got married i was on my parent's insurance and she was on her dad's and step mother's.  by the time i found out about these heart conditions in summer of 2020 we were both on my insurance from my job and have no hope in the world of affording any kind of operation for either heart defect as our deductible being met is a laughable thought.  i could really use an operation for the wpws and it is relatively non invasive and has a very very high success rate, but that is just not going to happen anytime in the foreseeable future. to this day nothing has changed.  it's been a very long time since my wife's \"concussion\" incident, and a very long time since my wife started working part time.  i've discussed these things and how i feel like i'm the only one really supporting us financially with her gently many times and she always gets super depressed and extremely self critical afterwards. she'll then find shift swaps to get extra hours to \"make up\" for it.  the problem is then as soon as she has some extra hours planned for later in the week she will take another day off and say \"it's okay because i have extra hours on the 15th\" or whatever.  i've tried reminding her that this does not give her \"more hours\" and that it just ends up shifting her schedule around.  she always says she knows this and promises that she'll get even more hours.  spoiler: she doesn't.  she'll do some extra cleaning around our apartment, again acting like it solves the issue.  i don't know how to be appreciative of this but at the same time let her know that what i really need right now is her help with the income, not dishes, so that we can stop living paycheck to paycheck, draining my account to pay rent every month, and using half of my other paycheck to pay the rest of our bills.  i mean, what's the point of being essentially a stay at home mom when you don't have kids and never plan on having kids?  i don't need a stay at home wife that solely i provide for, i need a wife that will help us mutually get to a better place financially.  i can clean things up after work in less than half an hour.  not to mention, i feel like if she can be up and cleaning and making all this food like she does to make up for not working, she would much more easily be able to go sit at a desk and take customer service calls for 4 hours.  i have the same job for eight hours a day in a second language.  i don't know how much longer i can do this alone for. i am a patient, introverted, and very quiet fellow.  i just want to be supportive and i want there to be peace.  that's all i have ever wanted, but this situation i find myself in is changing me into someone completely different and fast. i can't live like this.  i feel like a caregiver instead of a husband.  as time goes by i am also less and less attracted to my wife sexually because i feel like i'm just supporting us by myself and i'm beginning to see her as immature and selfish and i can't help but feel a bit resentful.    i know we promised \"through sickness and health\" but jeez, this feels like torture for me emotionally and mentally. my wife has a tendency of s ideation and has attempted it in the past and honestly if i even mentioned divorce ever i am worried she might do something drastic.  i've noticed is that she's very dependent on me emotionally as well.  she doesn't like it when she has to be alone in a room of our small apartment without me, for example.  seeing this mental state of hers over these past three years really makes me worried in that sense, but i'm not sure if i can keep doing this.  even if i did bring up the topic of splitting up, the problem is that i do not have hardly any family or friends at this point aside from her.  the main reason for which being that i recently left the mormon church and all of my friends and family are mormon.  my parents have cut me off and want nothing do do with me, unfortunately, and my extended family are all on the same page with them.  i've no clue who i would ask for advice from or what i would do. i'll probably post this to am i the asshole as well because i genuinely feel so guilty for feeling the way i do.  i feel like maybe i should simply continue to support her by getting a second job and working 60 hrs a week instead of 40.  all in all, i just feel stuck and would love some advice.  if you have any advice, how would you suggest i proceed? i am currently aware of the divorce rates when bipolar is a factor. should i continue to attempt fixing the situation? thank you in advance!"

    "context": "my (28m) wife (26f) cant work even a part time job without skipping at least two shifts per week.(+ other things) my(28m) wife (26f) cannot bring herself to work even a part time job without taking every other shift off and leaving early on almost all of the others (+other things). i have no clue where to start about this.  i could honestly put this in r/caregiversupport as well but i'm just not sure.  let me preface my post really quick with some information: my wife and i were married 3 years ago on may 5th 2018.  she has bipolar disorder as well as ptsd from watching her mother decline in health and finally pass away from metastasized breast cancer early 2017.  i knew all of this proceeding with marrying her.  now, i have an anxiety disorder myself and for quite some time have been dealing with a great deal of existential depression.  as dumb as that might sound to some, it's really done a number on me emotionally. now, when we were married, my wife was just about to graduate college while i was slightly behind her due to having spent two years abroad as a missionary for the mormon church (we have since left the mormon church).  long story short, my wife graduated, worked full time for 2 months in the summer at an entry level job in her field, said she didn't like it, promptly quit and proceeded to take a part time job at a call center that pays less hourly than i am without a degree.  this was mid 2019 by the way.  all this time my goal was simply to be supportive of her.  i know she struggles and i simply wanted to make sure she knew she had my support.  i figured she would soon enough be back to a different full time job in her field.  our plan had been for my wife to graduate school, begin working full time so i could switch to part time work while finishing up school and move back to full time once i graduated.  once my wife started working part time, however,  college kind of got put on the back burner for me and i ended up taking a break and taking one or two classes at a time because honestly working full time while going to school full time is something i simply cannot do.  i've tried it and it did not turn out well. anyway, back to the story.  time went on and things got more weird.  i could be wrong about this, but i am convinced that my wife became or already was a hypochondriac.  this first started to become clear to me when for her birthday in 2019 we went to an olive garden to use a gift card.  while we sat waiting for our food, i shit you not, one of the small floodlights above us popped and the lining of the light fell on her head.  of course we received the meal for free, but my wife began to complain of concussion symptoms.  then followed a string of expensive doctor appointments as well as a couple of mris for her.  keep in mind this was just a month or so after she quit her full time job for her part time job.  we ended up with a personal injury attorney and they started working on my wife's case to simply get the medical bills paid for.  i come to find out that the lining she was hit in the head with was no more than a couple of ounces in weight, something that had occurred to me at the time of the event but that i had ignored because i wanted to simply support my wife.  the case didn't end up ever going anywhere.  my wife eventually just stopped following up on the things she had to do for it despite me urging her to do so.  luckily the attorney takes their charges if and only if the case is resolved and there is a settlement, but we still had to pay the medical bills.   at this point, my wife had begun taking off practically every other shift and leaving early on most every other day (it's not too busy of a call center so they usually offer for people to go home early) citing nausea, aches, and pains as the reason why she couldn't go to work.  as time went on she started having more medical issues (examples being: appendicitis pain, blood clot pains, lung pains, what she thought was a broken rib from sneezing, etc, etc).   because of this a string of ultrasounds, x rays, urgent care visits, and even er visits happened.  none, i repeat, none of these ended up having any real underlying issue and we were always sent home with a large medical bill without any actual health issue to cite for it.  with each occurrence i have become more and more frustrated about this whole situation, though i suggest we take her to the doctor whenever she feels like she needs to go.  i'm not just going to let her die if she really has something wrong. i was then hit with my own health issues aside from my mental health.  i began having rapid heart movement episodes and had to go get an echocardiogram and some other checkups.  as it turns out i have two congenital heart conditions: wolffe parkinson white syndrome and bicuspid aortic valve.  when we got married i was on my parent's insurance and she was on her dad's and step mother's.  by the time i found out about these heart conditions in summer of 2020 we were both on my insurance from my job and have no hope in the world of affording any kind of operation for either heart defect as our deductible being met is a laughable thought.  i could really use an operation for the wpws and it is relatively non invasive and has a very very high success rate, but that is just not going to happen anytime in the foreseeable future. to this day nothing has changed.  it's been a very long time since my wife's \"concussion\" incident, and a very long time since my wife started working part time.  i've discussed these things and how i feel like i'm the only one really supporting us financially with her gently many times and she always gets super depressed and extremely self critical afterwards. she'll then find shift swaps to get extra hours to \"make up\" for it.  the problem is then as soon as she has some extra hours planned for later in the week she will take another day off and say \"it's okay because i have extra hours on the 15th\" or whatever.  i've tried reminding her that this does not give her \"more hours\" and that it just ends up shifting her schedule around.  she always says she knows this and promises that she'll get even more hours.  spoiler: she doesn't.  she'll do some extra cleaning around our apartment, again acting like it solves the issue.  i don't know how to be appreciative of this but at the same time let her know that what i really need right now is her help with the income, not dishes, so that we can stop living paycheck to paycheck, draining my account to pay rent every month, and using half of my other paycheck to pay the rest of our bills.  i mean, what's the point of being essentially a stay at home mom when you don't have kids and never plan on having kids?  i don't need a stay at home wife that solely i provide for, i need a wife that will help us mutually get to a better place financially.  i can clean things up after work in less than half an hour.  not to mention, i feel like if she can be up and cleaning and making all this food like she does to make up for not working, she would much more easily be able to go sit at a desk and take customer service calls for 4 hours.  i have the same job for eight hours a day in a second language.  i don't know how much longer i can do this alone for. i am a patient, introverted, and very quiet fellow.  i just want to be supportive and i want there to be peace.  that's all i have ever wanted, but this situation i find myself in is changing me into someone completely different and fast. i can't live like this.  i feel like a caregiver instead of a husband.  as time goes by i am also less and less attracted to my wife sexually because i feel like i'm just supporting us by myself and i'm beginning to see her as immature and selfish and i can't help but feel a bit resentful.    i know we promised \"through sickness and health\" but jeez, this feels like torture for me emotionally and mentally. my wife has a tendency of s ideation and has attempted it in the past and honestly if i even mentioned divorce ever i am worried she might do something drastic.  i've noticed is that she's very dependent on me emotionally as well.  she doesn't like it when she has to be alone in a room of our small apartment without me, for example.  seeing this mental state of hers over these past three years really makes me worried in that sense, but i'm not sure if i can keep doing this.  even if i did bring up the topic of splitting up, the problem is that i do not have hardly any family or friends at this point aside from her.  the main reason for which being that i recently left the mormon church and all of my friends and family are mormon.  my parents have cut me off and want nothing do do with me, unfortunately, and my extended family are all on the same page with them.  i've no clue who i would ask for advice from or what i would do. i'll probably post this to am i the asshole as well because i genuinely feel so guilty for feeling the way i do.  i feel like maybe i should simply continue to support her by getting a second job and working 60 hrs a week instead of 40.  all in all, i just feel stuck and would love some advice.  if you have any advice, how would you suggest i proceed? i am currently aware of the divorce rates when bipolar is a factor. should i continue to attempt fixing the situation? thank you in advance!"

(to put her money in a trust for her disabled son). so i can't tell her off just yet."

(i am not complaining, i just feel this is important to note). my mother has had pt/ot come into the house, and show us how exercises for her level are done, and they basically gave us tools/info to now complete it ourselves. pt/ot have come to our house a few times over the years. the exercises they've given her are arm and leg exercises that she can do while sitting. my mother is fully aware that she needs to exercise. between admitting it herself, all doctors she has (primary care, neurologist, oncologist, nutritionist) telling her its in her best interest, and myself asking her to take some time to do it a few days a week. i myself suffer from depression and anxiety, and my plate often feels as if it is overflowing with no end in sight. some days its hard for me to continuously show up, even for my own wellbeing honestly, but as a caregiver and parent, thats what i must do. my mother doesn't do much other than watch tv and play computer games unless we're doing a movie night or board game night which we try to do every couple of weeks. i have been honest with her with how much it will not only help herself, but it will help me out greatly because i can't always find time to be in her room while shes doing the exercises. she doesn't require assistance with the exercises because again, they're to be done while she is sitting. she does have some that do require help, for example, walking back and forth through the house with her walker, and those ones i am not talking about when i ask her to do them herself. when i do ask her to do the ones she can complete herself, she will only do them for a day or two but then she'll stop. this happens a lot. if i don't find the time (somedays i do find the time, but somedays i don't) i start to feel guilty as if its my fault shes becoming weaker. it seems like nothing anyone says that will get her to take it seriously. when i talked to pt they said they do a couple of sessions per week, for 6 weeks, and then they leave when they're confident we have the knowledge to do it ourselves. is there a specific profession or some company that i could have come in to exercise with her, but not pt? i am willing to pay out of pocket if theres not something offered through insurance. would it be a personal trainer i'd hire? is there someone in between a personal trainer and physical therapy that i don't know exists? she knows the exercises, but seems to need someone with her like the buddy system. does anyone have any experience in this sort of thing? she doesn't fight me on doing them - its never an argument, she just severely lacks motivation to go at it alone. any advice/help is greatly appreciated!!  -j"

    "context": "hello all, something happened today that i found to be a bit weird and i'm looking for some opinions. first let me give some details. my grandma is the only close family member i have left. she is 92 and in pretty good shape (for her age). she has mild dementia, (not alz.) and needs daily help but not 0-24 supervision. i used to live at hers for a while but now i live at a rental. i call almost every day and visit her 3-4 days a week. i buy her food and stuff from the store.  she has caregivers that are free for her because of a kind of support she has. mon-fri someone is here 10am-12, then then usually the lady in my story comes from 4pm-8pm and on weekends it's only the lady, like 2pm-8pm. she wears a button on her wrist that is connected to a box and on that she can could call for help any time. this level of supervision has always been enough so far luckily. let me say i don't know about the laws of caregiving for old people around the world, i'm from middle-europe and i'm not even sure how they work here. but i never fully trusted these people doing the caregiving and especially this lady seems to be egoistic and a bit shady sometimes. you know, the kind of people you talk to and seem kind but give a feeling that they aren't completely trustworthy. her bosses are in the same category.  they are from a company hired by a foundation that deals with the type of support my grandma gets. they seem ok dealing with the daily works but i always had a feeling about this woman that she seemed a bit shady along with the entire company she works for... and i heard stories about caregivers trying to get what old people have... i don't know how and what, the flat is under my ownership (couldn't sell it in her life even if i wanted to, just own it) so it's her money that could people want somehow but the whole thing might just be my paranoia.... or just wanting to get her under guardianship since they have already tried this before but didn't succeed.  she also made a fuss recently about not liking me getting into the arranging of grandma's medical stuff whenever i feel like it and either she deals with it 100% or gives it up and i have to deal with it 100%. i'm a bit short tempered and she got upset and we fought about this for like 2 hours (she didn't seem to understand that i didn't want to offend her and i had no intention of taking over grandma's medical stuff, just decided to call the doctor for the prescriptipons on an impulse) and after this i decided to avoid her from now on and only talk to her on the phone since i don't really like her personality. so grandma had to go to a new doctor today since her old neurologist resigned and the memory-psychiatrist she belongs to haven't seen her before due to the pandemic. but now she got both shots and the doctor refused to prescribe her meds any more without seeing her at least once. caregiver also said she should definetly go and today they went. the time wasn't good to me so i didn't go despite that i would have loved to be there in person.  i called her after and they said everything was ok, her condition is ok still, took one of her pills away and she might not need to go again in the lack of a new problem.  the caregiver then told me she came earlier today and so will leave earlier too, so i decided to also visit grandma today and got on a bus. when i got here i wanted to sit on a bench and smoke a cigarette still before i came up and that's when i noticed the caregiver lady across the street a few meters from the house holding a piece of paper and talking to the phone to someone (her boss, i assume). i think she didn't notice me so i tried to hear some of what she was talking about since i was pretty sure she was holding grandma's results from today and telling her boss about it. but of course when i crossed the street a bit further up and stood in the cover of a pillar, before i could have heared anything, she started to head home (i still think she didn't see me).  i didn't want to follow her so i came up and was sure her result wasn't going to be here. she took one already before and said that was so she could call them for the meds (and got the appiontment then). but now all her meds are prescribed and still she took the paper. i called her to be sure and she acted like she left it in her bag and took it by accident and will return it next day. but i'm 99% sure she was acting and took it on purpose and i'm also pretty sure that's what she was holding and talking about to someome when i saw her by accident. regardless i said \"ok, i'll read it another day then\".  is this normal or am i rightfully afraid that there is something shady going on? is there anyone she's allowed to tell the results to? don't know what's their agenda could be but something about this unsettles me. maybe it's nothing but these people weren't the most trustworthy people anyways and i know there is a lots of shady stuff in the caregiver-business so i'm not sure what to think. sorry for long text and thank you for your replies!"

    "context": "so my mother in law is (aprx.) 47 and can't care for herself. my fiance, the good man that he is, wants so badly to take care of her and help her but we just mentally and financially are not able to. his mom has been diagnosed with ptsd,depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, some kind of heart problem,and fibro...along with other various problems such as chronic stomach ulcers and vision issues. she continues to work despite her doctors telling her not to because shes convinced she cant quit because theyre low staff and she needs to make money. she lives with her abusive mother,this woman literally sold her as a child and continues to verbally attack her every second of the day. she cooks,cleans,takes her to the doctors, and lets the woman control her life despite it only making her worse. she makes her use all her food stamps to buy only the food she wants. like literally she has to get the exact same thing everytime or she freaks out. all of her other siblings have straight told her its on her to take care of her mom because they hate her... her own brother, the fucking scum bag, scammed her out of $500 and refuses to pay her back to get her hair done but then told her he was gonna help her with her bills.which she had already paid,leaving her with 161 dollars for savings and to live off of for two weeks...also hes told my fiance hes recently sold a house and got them monster jam tickets. to top this all off, shes been hallucinating for months and took herself off her anti-depressants cold turkey a few weeks ago. shes drinking again,or somthing of that lines,despite swearing shes been sober for months. she literally admitted to us to taking \"some kind of liquid\" that fucked her up so bad she forgot she was on the phone with us.shes going down a slipperly slope that were pretty sure will lead to her killing herself over the phone with us or her getting raped for easily the 5th time in her life. i literally have a panic attack everytime she calls now. when she does anything, other than sit in my room, i worry because shes so so so self distructive and socially incappable of keeping herself safe. she also suspects her abusive ex boyfriend(who she picked up after being cheated on by her mentally abusive husband) is now stalking her and picking the locks to her car. & for once, i dont think shes just paranoid.  i've been smart about this, as smart as i can be with having no clue as to what i'm doing. i've recorded phone calls of her telling us all these things and plan to take it to aps. however, i dont want to start a fuss if they have nothing to go on. i'm going to call them tomorrow, and see how much of a case i have built or what i'd need to build one. i have no clue what they do really, and that scares the shit out of me, however i dont know who else to call. she is an impulsive liar so this could just be for attention, however i've seen enough as a by standard to believe just about all of it. has anyone else had to do something similar? peferably specifically in indiana however just in the usa will be helpful! thanks so much in advance, hopefullly youll see more of me & better things ahead!"

(lol) hussy/damned fool/idiot girl/etc etc etc (i do appreciate feeling like im in a noir film but still. it starts to sting a bit.) you cant do anything right, i have to order you around. youre good for nothing. nobody loves you. nobody wants you here. i wish someone would kill you. i will burn your house down with you in it. etc etc etc etc  you get the gist. anyway. thats the verbal stuff and my main responses are to distract, agree when possible, and be silent when those wont work. like, seriously, how do you even respond to a disoriented dementia patient saying i wish someone would kill you. ???? so i say things like, ill be careful, im just putting away laundry! and ........you have six kids, right? that must have been quite a houseful! what was it like?  and for the physical, i mainly follow her around while shes on a rampage to make sure she doesnt fall while she looks for pictures to throw off the walls and such, but i do need to keep her from her husband because she will be violent towards him if they are in the same room while shes upset, and i also feel like i ought to sometimes say something when shes violent towards me if just for the sake of my own sanity. i say things like i really need you to stay sitting on the couch with me right now because im worried youre going to fall! and [name] you may not hit me/throw things at me/spit at me/etc. but both do very little.  she is on as much xanax and mood stabilizers and antipsychotics and stuff as the doctors will give her because shes a fall risk patient and the family doesnt want to medicate further due to what the doctor recommends or put her in a nursing home due to covid, which is understandable. im on the verge of quitting, honestly.  i just am out of things to say that remind me (and ideally her too) that im a person, not a well trained dog, and her emotions and such do not come above mine as long as she is physically safe and has the minimum of emotional support that i can manage without burning out. i feel like i need to put affirmations up or something. idk. any suggestions???? screaming to the void here   (also for the record the family is extremely supportive and pays well, and do what they can, but these situations are always difficult, of course.)"

    "context": "whats yalls living situation?what kind of precautions are yall taking at this point in the pandemic?  i moved to a new state to be a caregiver 5 months before the pandemic, therefore i dont know many people im 22 living with my dad (52, pretty bad ms who i care for), and his parents (73 and 75, they see relatively healthy). now my grandparents are both fully vaccinated and i will be in a couple weeks. my dad has had to postpone his due to doctors orders but should get his first one started next month hopefully.  in march 2020 when everything shut down i stopped doing everything. i kept working my part time job up until september 2020 when i realized covid wasnt going away, and i felt guilty putting my household at risk. since then i have had literally no social interaction with anyone my age and the only ones i do have with people outside of my family are medical related for caregiving.  without going into it too much, september up to now has been sooooo rough, i just typed out a whole page to try to explain what im going through and cant even get through the half of it lol. thats what kind of pandemic its been, im sure yall can relate. my main question is what is the middle ground at this point? its bothering way more than i can explain that i havent had any social interaction in over a year and i wanna get back out and just do a couple things at some point. frankly im tired of going to the park alone to do push ups alone.  i want to get a relative safe job and go back to the gym. those are the two things that used to keep my sane.  when will yall / when did yall step out and take the risk?  do yall think i should start to wear a mask in my home? my grandparents still run errands and do some things on occasion, im the only one who stays in the house all the time.  i just want to hear yalls situations and realize im not alone. maybe some things yall have found to relieve stress?"

    "context": "hi all, i feel like my brain is about to explode so i just need to get his out. sorry about typos, i'm on mobile. i'm new to this community, so i'll give y'all some brief background. my (31f) partner (tom,34m) has a fracture in his lower spine that occasionally gives him issue, but on march 25th of this year, it completely debilitated him. he could barely walk, and even the barest movement, bend or twist was excruciating. that same day, i started a new job, and my dad told the family that he has lung cancer. cue the start of my midlife crisis.  as the weeks passed, toms back was getting increasingly worse and i suddenly found myself his full time caregiver when i wasn't at work. our house, the animals (2cats and a dog), cooking, cleaning, gardening, helping him shower or go to the bathroom, picking up prescriptions, helping with his therapy, doing so much laundry, sobbing by myself outside then handwashing 3 days worth of dishes because our dishwasher broke, it's like i woke up in someone else's life. and i didn't like the pieces of me that i was left with. i didn't even have a chance to deal with my father's cancer, and tom rarely asked. i've struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life, but any form of mental health care has disappeared. i'm pretty sure i'm going to get fired at this new job because of poor work performance. i tried to explain my situation, and it only made things worse.  10 days ago, we took tom to the er. thank god we are both vaccinated, i can't imagine the anxiety otherwise. he had a high fever for about 5 days and we were worried about an infection, although he had already seen several doctors and they did not share our concern, which was incredibly frustrating. we waited for nearly 22 hours to be admitted, with him in excruciating pain the entire time. we went through so many shift changes, and so much was lost or forgotten because of this. we were told we were waiting for an mri, and 6 hours of badgering later, discovered that the previous shift doctor who said he had ordered it hadn't put it in the system. eventually, around hour16, they moved him to a back hallway by the trauma er entrance. i wasn't able to go with him, and was able to go home and finally rest for a bit. he was in this hallway for 6 hours, i'm pretty sure they forgot him. anyway, once he's admitted, over the course of the next few days, we find out he has a strep infection in his spine (i didn't know this was a thing?!?) that took up residence in the spine defect. so even though it sucked sitting through all the er stuff, i am glad i pushed and advocated for him because this could have easily been so so much worse. and i know y'all know how tough hospital stays can be. i felt like i was pulled 1000 directions, making sure he was fed, had clean clothes, taking care of whatever house stuff i could to try and get it ready for him to remove home.  he is home now, with a picc line for the next 6 weeks. he is still in a lot of pain, using a walker to get around, can't bend over or do much of anything independently. still a lot of work and not fun for either of us, but a much needed relief from the hospital balancing act.  anyway, i am struggling with with feeling like i am constantly disappointmenting tom as a caregiver, even though i know how hard i am working and that i am quite literally doing my best. i am proud of myself for how hard i have worked to make tom happy and healthy, especially given that my depression has a history of making even basic self care impossible. but somehow in the past month it's like i've gained superhuman strength to help tom fight this, i'm able to care for tom and take care of myself better than i usually do. yes, there is cat hair on the floor, our garden is dying, the dog needs a long walk, i need to plant this tree, clean out the fridge, take the trash to the street, shave your back, water the plants, schedule a maid, mow the grass, and a million other things, but we are clean and fed, and i am working my ass off to complete the growing list of shit i have to do. so i feel proud even if it's not perfect. but tom has consistently made me feel as though im falling short. complaints about the food, the cleanliness of the house, what i should be doing... i know he is frustrated and in a lot of pain, but i just want to scream at him to open his eyes and have some fucking empathy for me as well throughout all this. it's like he sees me as this endless waterfall of kindness, energy and empathy that never needs to be replinished. this is also hard for me. i also need support and care.  for example. when he was still in the hospital, i had gone home during the day to rest, clean, and restock toms supplies. my brother dropped me off for the night so i wouldnt have to pay for parking or walk through the city alone late at night (#6 highest murder rate in the us ftw). i have to pee when i get there and find the nearest public only to find that i've started my period early, thanks stress, and bled through my pants badly. don't know how i didn't notice, i guess i just thought it was normal vagina things since it was a full 2 weeks early. so i wrap myself up, start my hunt for tampons, and am shit out of luck. i walk 3 blocks across sky bridges looking for a tampon vending machine that information pointed me towards, no luck. can't get an uber, no pharmacy in walking distance or open at this hour. eventually i find a nurse who gives me one tampon and a pad, so i am able to go up to his room and finally change clothes. the pajamas i had grabbed we're some weird ratty old ones, all the rest were in the wash. and of course, the next morning, i have completely bled through the pad, the sheet, probably the floors below us. it was a mess. but whatever, i call an uber to come grab me awhen tom starts begging me to get him something from starbucks. i do not have a change of clothes, because they are also covered in blood, and the only shoes i have are from my outfit last night, and are these chunky clogs with a slight heel. so,i am wearing blood soaked, lime green and blue striped leggings that are covered in holes and these absurd heeled clogs. i smell, i'm embarrassed, i look completely deranged, and i just want to go home and find a super plus 6x tampon and sit in the bathtub. but he wants starbucks, which is 2 skybridges away inside the hospital. i tell him no, explain why, show him my ruined pants, and yet he's persistent and keeps whining that he doesn't know why  i can't just do it, he hates the hospital coffee. i just felt so unheard, unseen, unappreciated, unloved, uncared for. i cried my entire way out of the hospital and in the uber, i don't know why this particular instance just stung me so so bad. i felt so broken and alone.  i couldn't stop crying for hours. not because i still felt those emotions but my eyes just turned in to faucets and wouldn't turn off.  so that's a brief summary. sorry i can't seem to stop writing, i don't feel like i can talk about this with anyone, and it's felt good to just get it out.  on to the main event, or why i feel bad that i don't feel bad. yesterday was our anniversary. we've only been together 2 years, we're not married, so it's not like this is some big hoorah or anything. but it's been a tough year, it would be nice to reconnect with each other. so i get him a cool hanging plant, nothing fancy, but he loves his houseplants so it fit well. he got me nothing. didnt do anything besides say happy anniversary before i left for work. i know this sounds so nitpicky, because he has been sick, but for the past week since he came home from the hospital he's done nothing but sit on the sofa on his phone, the least he could have done is order a card or plan on ordering dinner. and it's not like this is some one time thing, he didn't get me anything last year, and has never gotten me anything for valentine's day. i've gotten him a small thing each time. he makes more than 3x as much as me, thanks to me being a full time grad student for the past 4 years, so money's not the issue. last night i asked if he could order our dinner for the night and he pouted and whinged about having to download the apps and buy it, when i have been the one to order food our entire relationship despite the fact that i make less than $20,000 a year.  something broke inside me when i was practically begging this man who is supposed to love me to just download a god damn app to order us food, so that in my mind i could pretend he cared enough to get me something for our anniversary. we ordered bbq, not some 5 course meal. fucking hell.  so when we sat down to eat, he asked what was wrong and i told him that i've been feeling unappreciated, and that i wouldn't be upset if this was the exception not the rule.  and i told him the following: of course i know he can't go out and shop right now, but i'd be just as happy with a small handwritten note or a cool rock he found outside. its not about getting a gift, it's about being considered. and he wasn't sick for our anniversary last year or the past two valentine's days. but he hemmed and hawed, claiming he did get me something in the past, and that he couldn't believe that i was so hurt over \"just a gift\". he said \"we've had this talk before\", which we have, i've asked for more empathy and nothing changed other than now he actually says \"thank you\" when i do something for him, a skill he should have mastered 30 years ago. so i said \"exactly, weve talked about this several times\". he just turned away from me and turned on the tv. we haven't spoken since, i slept downstairs, other than what's necessary, because i'm still his primary fucking caregiver.  am i losing my mind, because i feel like i am. why the fuck am i breaking myself to pieces for you, who cant even be bothered to talk to me, care for me, or say \"i love and appreciate you\" when i'm literally begging for it? i'm not your wife, i clean your ass and cook your food and bend over backwards because i care about you. yet when i had surgery last year you wouldn't even drive me to the hopsital prior and didn't come visit me that night. can't even do the bare minimum when the roles are reversed. does he just not care? would that make this easier? am i just asking for  too much and putting my expectations on to him? am i blowing things out of proportion because i am just too tired and emotional? am i being too hard on him while he's sick? should i have waited to say something?  sorry guys, i clearly needed to rant. my brain feels like it's been put in a blender. i'm just so so so exhausted. maybe this would have been a better fit for relationship advice, so i'm sorry if this is the wrong place. i just feel like caregiving has shown a glaring spotlight on our relationship and i don't like what i'm seeing.  to clarify, we have been fortunate to have a lot of help from both of our parents and his friends, i could not have gotten through this past month alone and i don't want to pretend like that's the case. we are incredibly lucky to have them. and i know i'm not perfect and this is only my side of the story, i've made mistakes too but i just feel so lost right now.  to anyone who makes it this far, thanks for reading."

    "context": "hi all, i feel like my brain is about to explode so i just need to get his out. sorry about typos, i'm on mobile. i'm new to this community, so i'll give y'all some brief background. my (31f) partner (tom,34m) has a fracture in his lower spine that occasionally gives him issue, but on march 25th of this year, it completely debilitated him. he could barely walk, and even the barest movement, bend or twist was excruciating. that same day, i started a new job, and my dad told the family that he has lung cancer. cue the start of my midlife crisis.  as the weeks passed, toms back was getting increasingly worse and i suddenly found myself his full time caregiver when i wasn't at work. our house, the animals (2cats and a dog), cooking, cleaning, gardening, helping him shower or go to the bathroom, picking up prescriptions, helping with his therapy, doing so much laundry, sobbing by myself outside then handwashing 3 days worth of dishes because our dishwasher broke, it's like i woke up in someone else's life. and i didn't like the pieces of me that i was left with. i didn't even have a chance to deal with my father's cancer, and tom rarely asked. i've struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life, but any form of mental health care has disappeared. i'm pretty sure i'm going to get fired at this new job because of poor work performance. i tried to explain my situation, and it only made things worse.  10 days ago, we took tom to the er. thank god we are both vaccinated, i can't imagine the anxiety otherwise. he had a high fever for about 5 days and we were worried about an infection, although he had already seen several doctors and they did not share our concern, which was incredibly frustrating. we waited for nearly 22 hours to be admitted, with him in excruciating pain the entire time. we went through so many shift changes, and so much was lost or forgotten because of this. we were told we were waiting for an mri, and 6 hours of badgering later, discovered that the previous shift doctor who said he had ordered it hadn't put it in the system. eventually, around hour16, they moved him to a back hallway by the trauma er entrance. i wasn't able to go with him, and was able to go home and finally rest for a bit. he was in this hallway for 6 hours, i'm pretty sure they forgot him. anyway, once he's admitted, over the course of the next few days, we find out he has a strep infection in his spine (i didn't know this was a thing?!?) that took up residence in the spine defect. so even though it sucked sitting through all the er stuff, i am glad i pushed and advocated for him because this could have easily been so so much worse. and i know y'all know how tough hospital stays can be. i felt like i was pulled 1000 directions, making sure he was fed, had clean clothes, taking care of whatever house stuff i could to try and get it ready for him to remove home.  he is home now, with a picc line for the next 6 weeks. he is still in a lot of pain, using a walker to get around, can't bend over or do much of anything independently. still a lot of work and not fun for either of us, but a much needed relief from the hospital balancing act.  anyway, i am struggling with with feeling like i am constantly disappointmenting tom as a caregiver, even though i know how hard i am working and that i am quite literally doing my best. i am proud of myself for how hard i have worked to make tom happy and healthy, especially given that my depression has a history of making even basic self care impossible. but somehow in the past month it's like i've gained superhuman strength to help tom fight this, i'm able to care for tom and take care of myself better than i usually do. yes, there is cat hair on the floor, our garden is dying, the dog needs a long walk, i need to plant this tree, clean out the fridge, take the trash to the street, shave your back, water the plants, schedule a maid, mow the grass, and a million other things, but we are clean and fed, and i am working my ass off to complete the growing list of shit i have to do. so i feel proud even if it's not perfect. but tom has consistently made me feel as though im falling short. complaints about the food, the cleanliness of the house, what i should be doing... i know he is frustrated and in a lot of pain, but i just want to scream at him to open his eyes and have some fucking empathy for me as well throughout all this. it's like he sees me as this endless waterfall of kindness, energy and empathy that never needs to be replinished. this is also hard for me. i also need support and care.  for example. when he was still in the hospital, i had gone home during the day to rest, clean, and restock toms supplies. my brother dropped me off for the night so i wouldnt have to pay for parking or walk through the city alone late at night (#6 highest murder rate in the us ftw). i have to pee when i get there and find the nearest public only to find that i've started my period early, thanks stress, and bled through my pants badly. don't know how i didn't notice, i guess i just thought it was normal vagina things since it was a full 2 weeks early. so i wrap myself up, start my hunt for tampons, and am shit out of luck. i walk 3 blocks across sky bridges looking for a tampon vending machine that information pointed me towards, no luck. can't get an uber, no pharmacy in walking distance or open at this hour. eventually i find a nurse who gives me one tampon and a pad, so i am able to go up to his room and finally change clothes. the pajamas i had grabbed we're some weird ratty old ones, all the rest were in the wash. and of course, the next morning, i have completely bled through the pad, the sheet, probably the floors below us. it was a mess. but whatever, i call an uber to come grab me awhen tom starts begging me to get him something from starbucks. i do not have a change of clothes, because they are also covered in blood, and the only shoes i have are from my outfit last night, and are these chunky clogs with a slight heel. so,i am wearing blood soaked, lime green and blue striped leggings that are covered in holes and these absurd heeled clogs. i smell, i'm embarrassed, i look completely deranged, and i just want to go home and find a super plus 6x tampon and sit in the bathtub. but he wants starbucks, which is 2 skybridges away inside the hospital. i tell him no, explain why, show him my ruined pants, and yet he's persistent and keeps whining that he doesn't know why  i can't just do it, he hates the hospital coffee. i just felt so unheard, unseen, unappreciated, unloved, uncared for. i cried my entire way out of the hospital and in the uber, i don't know why this particular instance just stung me so so bad. i felt so broken and alone.  i couldn't stop crying for hours. not because i still felt those emotions but my eyes just turned in to faucets and wouldn't turn off.  so that's a brief summary. sorry i can't seem to stop writing, i don't feel like i can talk about this with anyone, and it's felt good to just get it out.  on to the main event, or why i feel bad that i don't feel bad. yesterday was our anniversary. we've only been together 2 years, we're not married, so it's not like this is some big hoorah or anything. but it's been a tough year, it would be nice to reconnect with each other. so i get him a cool hanging plant, nothing fancy, but he loves his houseplants so it fit well. he got me nothing. didnt do anything besides say happy anniversary before i left for work. i know this sounds so nitpicky, because he has been sick, but for the past week since he came home from the hospital he's done nothing but sit on the sofa on his phone, the least he could have done is order a card or plan on ordering dinner. and it's not like this is some one time thing, he didn't get me anything last year, and has never gotten me anything for valentine's day. i've gotten him a small thing each time. he makes more than 3x as much as me, thanks to me being a full time grad student for the past 4 years, so money's not the issue. last night i asked if he could order our dinner for the night and he pouted and whinged about having to download the apps and buy it, when i have been the one to order food our entire relationship despite the fact that i make less than $20,000 a year.  something broke inside me when i was practically begging this man who is supposed to love me to just download a god damn app to order us food, so that in my mind i could pretend he cared enough to get me something for our anniversary. we ordered bbq, not some 5 course meal. fucking hell.  so when we sat down to eat, he asked what was wrong and i told him that i've been feeling unappreciated, and that i wouldn't be upset if this was the exception not the rule.  and i told him the following: of course i know he can't go out and shop right now, but i'd be just as happy with a small handwritten note or a cool rock he found outside. its not about getting a gift, it's about being considered. and he wasn't sick for our anniversary last year or the past two valentine's days. but he hemmed and hawed, claiming he did get me something in the past, and that he couldn't believe that i was so hurt over \"just a gift\". he said \"we've had this talk before\", which we have, i've asked for more empathy and nothing changed other than now he actually says \"thank you\" when i do something for him, a skill he should have mastered 30 years ago. so i said \"exactly, weve talked about this several times\". he just turned away from me and turned on the tv. we haven't spoken since, i slept downstairs, other than what's necessary, because i'm still his primary fucking caregiver.  am i losing my mind, because i feel like i am. why the fuck am i breaking myself to pieces for you, who cant even be bothered to talk to me, care for me, or say \"i love and appreciate you\" when i'm literally begging for it? i'm not your wife, i clean your ass and cook your food and bend over backwards because i care about you. yet when i had surgery last year you wouldn't even drive me to the hopsital prior and didn't come visit me that night. can't even do the bare minimum when the roles are reversed. does he just not care? would that make this easier? am i just asking for  too much and putting my expectations on to him? am i blowing things out of proportion because i am just too tired and emotional? am i being too hard on him while he's sick? should i have waited to say something?  sorry guys, i clearly needed to rant. my brain feels like it's been put in a blender. i'm just so so so exhausted. maybe this would have been a better fit for relationship advice, so i'm sorry if this is the wrong place. i just feel like caregiving has shown a glaring spotlight on our relationship and i don't like what i'm seeing.  to clarify, we have been fortunate to have a lot of help from both of our parents and his friends, i could not have gotten through this past month alone and i don't want to pretend like that's the case. we are incredibly lucky to have them. and i know i'm not perfect and this is only my side of the story, i've made mistakes too but i just feel so lost right now.  to anyone who makes it this far, thanks for reading."

    "context": "hi all, i feel like my brain is about to explode so i just need to get his out. sorry about typos, i'm on mobile. i'm new to this community, so i'll give y'all some brief background. my (31f) partner (tom,34m) has a fracture in his lower spine that occasionally gives him issue, but on march 25th of this year, it completely debilitated him. he could barely walk, and even the barest movement, bend or twist was excruciating. that same day, i started a new job, and my dad told the family that he has lung cancer. cue the start of my midlife crisis.  as the weeks passed, toms back was getting increasingly worse and i suddenly found myself his full time caregiver when i wasn't at work. our house, the animals (2cats and a dog), cooking, cleaning, gardening, helping him shower or go to the bathroom, picking up prescriptions, helping with his therapy, doing so much laundry, sobbing by myself outside then handwashing 3 days worth of dishes because our dishwasher broke, it's like i woke up in someone else's life. and i didn't like the pieces of me that i was left with. i didn't even have a chance to deal with my father's cancer, and tom rarely asked. i've struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life, but any form of mental health care has disappeared. i'm pretty sure i'm going to get fired at this new job because of poor work performance. i tried to explain my situation, and it only made things worse.  10 days ago, we took tom to the er. thank god we are both vaccinated, i can't imagine the anxiety otherwise. he had a high fever for about 5 days and we were worried about an infection, although he had already seen several doctors and they did not share our concern, which was incredibly frustrating. we waited for nearly 22 hours to be admitted, with him in excruciating pain the entire time. we went through so many shift changes, and so much was lost or forgotten because of this. we were told we were waiting for an mri, and 6 hours of badgering later, discovered that the previous shift doctor who said he had ordered it hadn't put it in the system. eventually, around hour16, they moved him to a back hallway by the trauma er entrance. i wasn't able to go with him, and was able to go home and finally rest for a bit. he was in this hallway for 6 hours, i'm pretty sure they forgot him. anyway, once he's admitted, over the course of the next few days, we find out he has a strep infection in his spine (i didn't know this was a thing?!?) that took up residence in the spine defect. so even though it sucked sitting through all the er stuff, i am glad i pushed and advocated for him because this could have easily been so so much worse. and i know y'all know how tough hospital stays can be. i felt like i was pulled 1000 directions, making sure he was fed, had clean clothes, taking care of whatever house stuff i could to try and get it ready for him to remove home.  he is home now, with a picc line for the next 6 weeks. he is still in a lot of pain, using a walker to get around, can't bend over or do much of anything independently. still a lot of work and not fun for either of us, but a much needed relief from the hospital balancing act.  anyway, i am struggling with with feeling like i am constantly disappointmenting tom as a caregiver, even though i know how hard i am working and that i am quite literally doing my best. i am proud of myself for how hard i have worked to make tom happy and healthy, especially given that my depression has a history of making even basic self care impossible. but somehow in the past month it's like i've gained superhuman strength to help tom fight this, i'm able to care for tom and take care of myself better than i usually do. yes, there is cat hair on the floor, our garden is dying, the dog needs a long walk, i need to plant this tree, clean out the fridge, take the trash to the street, shave your back, water the plants, schedule a maid, mow the grass, and a million other things, but we are clean and fed, and i am working my ass off to complete the growing list of shit i have to do. so i feel proud even if it's not perfect. but tom has consistently made me feel as though im falling short. complaints about the food, the cleanliness of the house, what i should be doing... i know he is frustrated and in a lot of pain, but i just want to scream at him to open his eyes and have some fucking empathy for me as well throughout all this. it's like he sees me as this endless waterfall of kindness, energy and empathy that never needs to be replinished. this is also hard for me. i also need support and care.  for example. when he was still in the hospital, i had gone home during the day to rest, clean, and restock toms supplies. my brother dropped me off for the night so i wouldnt have to pay for parking or walk through the city alone late at night (#6 highest murder rate in the us ftw). i have to pee when i get there and find the nearest public only to find that i've started my period early, thanks stress, and bled through my pants badly. don't know how i didn't notice, i guess i just thought it was normal vagina things since it was a full 2 weeks early. so i wrap myself up, start my hunt for tampons, and am shit out of luck. i walk 3 blocks across sky bridges looking for a tampon vending machine that information pointed me towards, no luck. can't get an uber, no pharmacy in walking distance or open at this hour. eventually i find a nurse who gives me one tampon and a pad, so i am able to go up to his room and finally change clothes. the pajamas i had grabbed we're some weird ratty old ones, all the rest were in the wash. and of course, the next morning, i have completely bled through the pad, the sheet, probably the floors below us. it was a mess. but whatever, i call an uber to come grab me awhen tom starts begging me to get him something from starbucks. i do not have a change of clothes, because they are also covered in blood, and the only shoes i have are from my outfit last night, and are these chunky clogs with a slight heel. so,i am wearing blood soaked, lime green and blue striped leggings that are covered in holes and these absurd heeled clogs. i smell, i'm embarrassed, i look completely deranged, and i just want to go home and find a super plus 6x tampon and sit in the bathtub. but he wants starbucks, which is 2 skybridges away inside the hospital. i tell him no, explain why, show him my ruined pants, and yet he's persistent and keeps whining that he doesn't know why  i can't just do it, he hates the hospital coffee. i just felt so unheard, unseen, unappreciated, unloved, uncared for. i cried my entire way out of the hospital and in the uber, i don't know why this particular instance just stung me so so bad. i felt so broken and alone.  i couldn't stop crying for hours. not because i still felt those emotions but my eyes just turned in to faucets and wouldn't turn off.  so that's a brief summary. sorry i can't seem to stop writing, i don't feel like i can talk about this with anyone, and it's felt good to just get it out.  on to the main event, or why i feel bad that i don't feel bad. yesterday was our anniversary. we've only been together 2 years, we're not married, so it's not like this is some big hoorah or anything. but it's been a tough year, it would be nice to reconnect with each other. so i get him a cool hanging plant, nothing fancy, but he loves his houseplants so it fit well. he got me nothing. didnt do anything besides say happy anniversary before i left for work. i know this sounds so nitpicky, because he has been sick, but for the past week since he came home from the hospital he's done nothing but sit on the sofa on his phone, the least he could have done is order a card or plan on ordering dinner. and it's not like this is some one time thing, he didn't get me anything last year, and has never gotten me anything for valentine's day. i've gotten him a small thing each time. he makes more than 3x as much as me, thanks to me being a full time grad student for the past 4 years, so money's not the issue. last night i asked if he could order our dinner for the night and he pouted and whinged about having to download the apps and buy it, when i have been the one to order food our entire relationship despite the fact that i make less than $20,000 a year.  something broke inside me when i was practically begging this man who is supposed to love me to just download a god damn app to order us food, so that in my mind i could pretend he cared enough to get me something for our anniversary. we ordered bbq, not some 5 course meal. fucking hell.  so when we sat down to eat, he asked what was wrong and i told him that i've been feeling unappreciated, and that i wouldn't be upset if this was the exception not the rule.  and i told him the following: of course i know he can't go out and shop right now, but i'd be just as happy with a small handwritten note or a cool rock he found outside. its not about getting a gift, it's about being considered. and he wasn't sick for our anniversary last year or the past two valentine's days. but he hemmed and hawed, claiming he did get me something in the past, and that he couldn't believe that i was so hurt over \"just a gift\". he said \"we've had this talk before\", which we have, i've asked for more empathy and nothing changed other than now he actually says \"thank you\" when i do something for him, a skill he should have mastered 30 years ago. so i said \"exactly, weve talked about this several times\". he just turned away from me and turned on the tv. we haven't spoken since, i slept downstairs, other than what's necessary, because i'm still his primary fucking caregiver.  am i losing my mind, because i feel like i am. why the fuck am i breaking myself to pieces for you, who cant even be bothered to talk to me, care for me, or say \"i love and appreciate you\" when i'm literally begging for it? i'm not your wife, i clean your ass and cook your food and bend over backwards because i care about you. yet when i had surgery last year you wouldn't even drive me to the hopsital prior and didn't come visit me that night. can't even do the bare minimum when the roles are reversed. does he just not care? would that make this easier? am i just asking for  too much and putting my expectations on to him? am i blowing things out of proportion because i am just too tired and emotional? am i being too hard on him while he's sick? should i have waited to say something?  sorry guys, i clearly needed to rant. my brain feels like it's been put in a blender. i'm just so so so exhausted. maybe this would have been a better fit for relationship advice, so i'm sorry if this is the wrong place. i just feel like caregiving has shown a glaring spotlight on our relationship and i don't like what i'm seeing.  to clarify, we have been fortunate to have a lot of help from both of our parents and his friends, i could not have gotten through this past month alone and i don't want to pretend like that's the case. we are incredibly lucky to have them. and i know i'm not perfect and this is only my side of the story, i've made mistakes too but i just feel so lost right now.  to anyone who makes it this far, thanks for reading."

    "context": "be warned now, due to my reservations about posting here for some time, this story is long. to avoid as much confusion & inaccurate judgments as possible, i'll try to provide as much background info as i can as the past 10 years of my life have been a hell of a roller coaster to say the least for which i've had minimal outside support. with my husband's blessing, i think it's time i finally vent about this.   some history: i'm a 28f & have been a caregiver for my husband, j(35m) for 9 years, we'll have been together 10 years in a matter of months. i met him shortly after an accident with an ambulance where he was driving that caused ptsd & hyper nerve sensitivity(hns); he also deals with general anxiety & some depression on top of all this. let me also clarify by saying he wasn't the one at fault in the accident and the one who hit him literally fled the scene! he deals with a fair bit of anger because of this & from being misunderstood by many doctors he's seen over the years misdiagnosing his ptsd & trying to treat him for bipolar instead which he doesn't have. but i also need to clarify that to me, he's one of the most kind, generous, understanding people i know who's supported & taken care of me when i'm unwell. he encourages me to pursue my own interests alongside taking care of him & has even expressed understanding if i ever wished to vent to reddit as he knows he's not the easiest person to deal with at times because of the frustration he deals with so i needn't feel guilty for talking about him behind his back. he's also been self medicating with cannabis for the past 9 years & only recently got an official prescription from a pain clinic for it in 2020, but it's not meant to be a long term solution because it's expensive af. there's also been concerns from doctors over the years that the cannabis could result in psychotic episodes.  he's been in & out of hospitals over the years infrequently due to these episodes, the last one(4 years ago) getting so bad that he could no longer recognize me & he lashed out. while i sustained no actual injuries, i called 911 in a panic & he was arrested for assault for which the charges were later dropped due to mental illness but was let off with a warning that if it happened again, he may have to go to jail. when i was finally able to see him again, he'd completely cleared up from the psychosis, he was back to his kind, loving self & told me that if he ever started showing signs again, i should do what i can to get him help & that i have that permission as his spouse/caregiver.   fast forward: so for the past 4 years, j had been stable, while he was back on cannabis to help mitigate the pain from his hns, he was also on some mood stabilizing medication that's normally for bipolar. problem is this medication would make his joints lock up to the point he could barely move. approx 9 months ago he decided to ween off it since he got an actual cannabis prescription from a pain clinic & in time, his mobility improved. he still dealt with pain spikes, but he could now actually use his hands again to some degree. both me & his parents were reluctant about him going off the medication at first, but j's really smart, like abnormally high iq smart & is a very logical person who advocated his reasons for doing so well so we agreed that if it felt right to come off it after so much time on it, then maybe it's time. for the past 7 months he seemed fine with the exception of some anger toward one of his doctors, the one that prescribed him the medication that made his joints lock up, because he's been asking how his 2 kids are for the past couple years every time he sees him. we don't have nor want kids so it's been frustrating for him trying to get a new doctor when the hospital apparently sees nothing wrong with this guy not having his files straight & declined his request.  seemingly small matters at times started meriting larger bursts of anger than necessary & while it wasn't directed at me & he doesn't damage anything, the loudness still triggers some trauma from what i experienced 4 years ago. he knows the impact his anger can have on me & often tells me to go to another room in the house when he's like that so it doesn't impact me as much, but it still worries me.   this month: now at the start of april, the signs of psychosis started showing themselves again. dramatic changes in behavioral patterns, paranoia, skewed perception of elapsed time, talking to things that weren't there, almost like he was having discussions with these delusions where they'd answer back, stopping normal social contact with his friends online & spending majority of his time either in the bedroom hiding under the covers, or in the shower talking to someone/something. this time, it seemed like one of the things he was talking to was an imaginary version of me at times. by day 2 of the strange behavior i informed his parents. by day 3 j was getting so riled up by these delusions he told me to \"get the f out of my house!\" to which his parents came & got me & i've been staying at their place ever since. over the next 2 days, his dad stayed at the house to do renovation work & keep an eye on j's behavior & make sure he didn't hurt himself or damage the property. after 2 days, j requested his dad take him to the hospital. for the first time in 10 years, he went willingly, but then thought his dad lied to the doctors about what he witnessed. he was there for a little over a week & was in denial about the psychosis. after only 2 days of receiving treatment, he released himself against medical advice & returned home. i was informed a crisis unit may reach out to check on him for updates & that they'd have my number if he couldn't be reached. the doctor also advised i don't move back home right away for my safety. the day after returning home, j started back up on the cannabis. i went to visit him to check on him & verify the integrity of my belongings that were still there as well as make sure he had something to eat. he was back into the affectionate, child-like state of day 1 psychosis where he hyper focused just wanting to be near me with some minor out of place discussions with things that weren't there which he dismissed.   the incident: by day 2, he showing the signs of irritability again, he wouldn't answer his phone, & the discussions/behavior patterns were picking up. he didn't acknowledge me as much & was getting really upset about someone who hadn't been in our lives for years, insisting they killed our cat. to clarify, this guy lost our cat while he was suppose to take care of him, and made no effort to find him, but i don't believe he killed him. i made him something to eat & tried to convince him to come off the cannabis to which he agreed to surprisingly fast, kinda passive aggressively, and allowed me to remove the stuff from the house when it was time for me to leave. i also tried to convince him to take the medication the doctor at the hospital prescribed, but he wouldn't take it. i left feeling really worried about him. a couple hours later, i decided to call the crisis unit & express my concerns about his behavior & told them he wasn't going to return the call like they wanted him to. i described the behavior patterns i saw & how i couldn't convince him to take the medication that was suppose to mitigate the rage/psychosis/anxiety & they suggested i request a wellness check which would send non-emergency officers to check on him & determine if he needs to go back to the hospital. following those instructions, i did just that, but felt really guilty & worried about him. me & his father rushed across the city to meet with the officers once they were on site to describe in more detail everything i saw over the past 2 days & how it resembled the first instance before he told me to get out. shortly after another car rolled up saying it was time to take him & that they had a bed ready for him at the hospital; they determined he needed help & force may have to be used to get him back to the hospital. mortified as i knew what was about to ensue, i ran for my in-law's car & we parked further up the street so he wouldn't see us when he was brought out so i wouldn't be blamed because i was the only person he still trusted even in this state.    tldr: for the first time in a few years now, i had to watch the person i love most be carried out of our home by multiple officers & forced into a car as he screamed at the top of his lungs...again. he was readmitted to the hospital despite his incessant protests that he was fine & could look after himself. the sight made me sob uncontrollably & i'm overwhelmed with guilt as i feel it's my fault i couldn't do more to help or stop the psychosis from taking hold again.  i feel like i betrayed his trust because he doesn't know i'm the one who requested the wellness check even tho his parents tell me it was inevitable because he wouldn't answer his phone when they crisis unit called to check on him, & j's the one who told me to do what i could to get him help if he started showing signs of psychosis again tho i'm not sure he remembers..not to mention he's currently in denial about the psychosis. i miss my sane husband so much, i miss all the things we'd do together & the way he'd always go out of his way to make me smile or laugh at least once a day. i miss all our fun/logical conversations & inside jokes. i miss our bed, & living in our house, i just want our lives to go back to normal so we can keep working towards the future we'd talk about together, but it feels like that reality will never come if he doesn't get the proper help he needs & i'm scared of that uncertainty. it's painful watching the person you love slowly descend into madness & not know how to stop it or snap them out of it & i feel incredibly alone & guilty in my experience regarding this. i feel like any shred of happiness or calmness i have rn while he's in the hospital in a rage without my help makes me an awful person. it's made my struggle with suicidal ideation more difficult than usual & i'm just curious if there's any advice, encouragement, or similar experiences anyone has to share regarding a spouse with psychosis because no one in my daily life can relate to this horror..?   once again, i'm surry for the novel, but i felt it better to be thorough as possible rather than skew details & be misunderstood as it's a very complicated situation."

    "context": "i feel like myself and my family are in a rock and a hard place. my mom has been bed bound for the past few years due to a deteriorating left hip. she last saw the doctor for it in 2018 and hasnt been back since due to her mobility declining. this is due to after she had her left hip replaced, she decided after 6 physical therapy sessions that she didnt need it anymore as well as exercises at hone and stopped everything. this has caused her left hip to compensate and speed up the wear and tear on it and ultimately has now taken her mobility. she has had several sessions of home care and physical therapy come out and treat her but to keep her motivated to do what she needs to do to get better doesnt last long. shes also diabetic on top of everything else. she cant pivot to get out of bed and when she sits up, she complains thats shes lightheaded and dizzy, probably because shes been sitting in a certain position for so long. i think she may have congested heart failure and shes lost a considerable amount of muscle tone. i dont know what to do to help her and to see her like this, its so frustrating to just accept it and do nothing. my dad is retired from his job and he saw them traveling together as well as moving to fl. all of it is on hold until she gets better. some days i dont think she wants to.  my dad has, naturally, a considerable amount of weight on him being her caregiver but it would be easier on him too if she did some things to help herself. she just doesnt. if any of you reading this have been in a similar boat, how did you motivate your loved one to get better? we all want to see her walking and be mobile again. she has said she wants it as well but then also talks about being fine if shes destined to be in a motorized wheelchair. i am worried that maybe her left hip is to far gone and theres nothing they can do being its been 3 years since its been looked at-but thats something you dont know until it comes to that and im not thinking that way right now. any help or advice is appreciated more than you know. thanks in advance."

    "context": "i've seen countless posts of folks who have unclear boundaries or who are burnt out after a time of caregiving.  i'm [34f] about a week out from starting to care for my fil [60 m], and would love advice on how to set expectations early on so we'll have a great relationship in the future.  a few details:  he is going through a spinal fusion, with an 8+ week recovery time.  i'll be driving in from out of state and living in his basement.  my husband is not coming because my work can be remote and his cannot. fil is single, lives alone in a small rural town that is not walkable.   i shared that i'm happy to take leave from work, starting with 3 weeks, to care for him full time and will extend as needed. after i'll  plan to work remote and stay at the house while splitting care once he seems on his feet. i still get my full pay and benefits for up to 5 months so this just makes sense.  we talked about me cleaning, cooking, laundry, driving him to appts, but i drew the line at wound dressing and bathing.  i don't think he'll need that help, but am nervous because he said he will not pay or take any professional care (part of why i offered to come out).  he's started hinting at bigger projects without yet asking: \"oh, i wish your husband were coming i've really been meaning to finish the hardwood floors.\" \"i'm putting together a list of sewing projects you can get done while you're here.\" \"i'm hoping you can plant all my garden beds since it's april.\" \"the basement storage could really use organizing / a purge.\"  my fil is great, but i already have years of him expecting me to cook and clean when we're together, having high expectations and generally not thanking me.  in normal times he is picky and demanding and critical, and doesn't acknowledge the work put in to please him.  i want this time to be one where he gets his needs met to recover, and his house taken care of, while i can feel good on the other side and not taken advantage of.  ultimately i love him and i am the best suited to come out and help him, so advice like don't do it is not what i'm after.   ideally this is also an opportunity for us to get closer.  any advice or lessons learned on setting clear expectations before diving into a short term care scenario?"

    "context": "i'm a 28f living at home with both my parents (78m, 74f) and my sister 32f. about three years ago my mom was diagnosed with fronto-temporal dementia and right now seems to be in pretty advanced stages. she needs help with almost every task and cannot be left alone but it seems that putting her in a facility seems kind of far down the line.  i moved home a couple months before covid hit, thinking that it was going to be temporary. then i quickly saw how much help my mom needed which has increased in the \\~15 months that have since passed.  in my household, i am the only one working. my sister is unemployed (and not looking for a job) and my parents are both retired. i'm a teacher and have been in the classroom with students in person this whole school year and it has been a lot weighing on me to have this stressful job (also my first year as a teacher) and then come home to my family. i feel guilty for feeling this way but i just wish my life were different and that i could move out without feeling guilty. i love my mom so much and i love caring for her in the ways that i can because she has done so much for me and i feel like its all coming full circle now. but i feel stuck at home. i want to live with my friends and have my own space and have my own schedule and eat what i want for dinner and basically just have the independence back that i had before. i know things are obviously different now and i don't want to abandon my family. i know if i left it would be a lot harder on my dad but sometimes it feels like i just can't take any of it anymore. things with my mom are certainly extremely difficult but the hardest part of all of this is that its a package deal living with my dad and sister.  has anyone else had to face this decision? a friend just asked me if i wanted to move in with her and i already said no last year in order to stay home. i just don't know how i feel about this and i want to make the right decision. i would still live close to home (prob no further than 20min by car) and could visit and come to help often. but i wouldn't be around for when she needs things in the middle of the night etc."

    "context": "do you have any advice for a new caregiver? i have to get all of this off my chest.  a couple weeks ago, grandma, who was living in an assisted living place, decided she was going to quit dialysis (which would cause a painless death within 14 days). she said her life wasnt worth living in a care facility, but she didnt want to burden her family with caring for her. we had a meeting, in which her 4 children and i (her grandchild), told her how much she meant to us, and that wed like to try making her life better. so instead of quitting dialysis, it was decided she would move in with me. why me? well i live the closest to where all her doctors are. she has 4 retired children, and somehow making grandmas life worth living, became my burden.  i naively thought this would be easy. i just had to cook for her, help her shower, and drive her to and from dialysis three times a week. im a freelancer, so ive been working while she naps. but i hate my new life so much.  its so draining. my complaints are so petty. but this woman who used to be the dependable matriarch of our family now calls me over ever time she needs a tiny little thing. shell ask for a tissue, which is just barely out of arms reach for her. so i stand up, walk over to her, move the tissue box a little closer, and shell say, i just needed one. ok.... then i sit back down, and shell say, i need my chapstick too. so i get up and go find that for her. as im handing it to her, she says, while youre up, could you dump this tea and make me a latte? of course i can, thats easy but why do i feel so bitter as i walk to the sink. i make her a latte (more peppermint than white chocolate, she explains). i hand it to her, and without fail she asks me, did you stir this? oh my god. why does she ask me that every time?? yes grandma, i stirred it. cooking is a whole other hassle because she has so many dietary restrictions, and she turns up her nose at anything with spices. no cumin, basil, paprika, and definitely no pepper. no onions, garlic, or bell peppers. ive basically been rotating through macaroni, pizza, and pasta for dinner.  at night, its the worst. for example yesterday she told me, after you finish working, come help me shower and then ill go to bed. good deal. but after i finished working, i went to her and she said, i didnt know youd be done so quickly. ill shower in half an hour. its 9pm at this point, but ok, i guess i can wait half an hour.... half and hour later, i come back and help her shower. instead of coming straight to bed like i expected, she said, im going to the couch to let me hair dry. ....... fine..... so she turns on ncis. i come back half an hour later. its past 10:30 now. i tell her im getting ready for bed, and she says, wheres my dessert? she wants a cinnamon roll, a whole one. i bring her one and she says, i want you to cut this into pieces for me. im pulling my hair at this point. i cut it up into little bite sized pieces and go downstairs to brush my teeth. i come back up and shes in the middle of a new episode of ncis. i tell her i need to go to bed. and she sighs and says, after this episode. so i come back as soon as the episode is over, and she has finally taken a bite of her cinnamon roll. she says, if i knew you were coming back, i would have eaten this faster. i ask her, does that mean you dont need my help getting to bed? and she sounds frustrated and says, i might fall, but i dont know when i will. so i need you nearby.  i ask her if shes done with her dessert and she says, fine, take it. its midnight at this point. then for some inexplicable reason, she opens her laptop up! gah! i tell her im going to bed and i leave. 15 minutes later i hear her calling me from her bed. i get out of bed and go to her and she says, turn off the bedroom light for me. and bring me my cell phone in case i need to call you. but dont turn the hallway light off this time! i go back to bed, its past midnight, but my head is so full of negative thoughts and emotions, i cant even fall asleep.  is this my new life? i hate it so much. i hate it. i resent my grandma. i used to respect her, and now i borderline despise her. but what choice do i have? if i tell her that im feeling burdened, shell quit dialysis and die. for what?? because i was tired of making her lattes and cutting up her food?  i keep telling myself that im just going through and adjustment period and the strong negative emotions will fade with time. but so far they seem to be getting worse.  i heard her talking on the phone yesterday with her friend. grandma told her friend that i was one of her favorites, and that i spoil her, and that shes really happy that she left the care facility. so at least my sacrifice isnt in vain.... but does she realize how difficult shes being?"

    "context": "do you have any advice for a new caregiver? i have to get all of this off my chest.  a couple weeks ago, grandma, who was living in an assisted living place, decided she was going to quit dialysis (which would cause a painless death within 14 days). she said her life wasnt worth living in a care facility, but she didnt want to burden her family with caring for her. we had a meeting, in which her 4 children and i (her grandchild), told her how much she meant to us, and that wed like to try making her life better. so instead of quitting dialysis, it was decided she would move in with me. why me? well i live the closest to where all her doctors are. she has 4 retired children, and somehow making grandmas life worth living, became my burden.  i naively thought this would be easy. i just had to cook for her, help her shower, and drive her to and from dialysis three times a week. im a freelancer, so ive been working while she naps. but i hate my new life so much.  its so draining. my complaints are so petty. but this woman who used to be the dependable matriarch of our family now calls me over ever time she needs a tiny little thing. shell ask for a tissue, which is just barely out of arms reach for her. so i stand up, walk over to her, move the tissue box a little closer, and shell say, i just needed one. ok.... then i sit back down, and shell say, i need my chapstick too. so i get up and go find that for her. as im handing it to her, she says, while youre up, could you dump this tea and make me a latte? of course i can, thats easy but why do i feel so bitter as i walk to the sink. i make her a latte (more peppermint than white chocolate, she explains). i hand it to her, and without fail she asks me, did you stir this? oh my god. why does she ask me that every time?? yes grandma, i stirred it. cooking is a whole other hassle because she has so many dietary restrictions, and she turns up her nose at anything with spices. no cumin, basil, paprika, and definitely no pepper. no onions, garlic, or bell peppers. ive basically been rotating through macaroni, pizza, and pasta for dinner.  at night, its the worst. for example yesterday she told me, after you finish working, come help me shower and then ill go to bed. good deal. but after i finished working, i went to her and she said, i didnt know youd be done so quickly. ill shower in half an hour. its 9pm at this point, but ok, i guess i can wait half an hour.... half and hour later, i come back and help her shower. instead of coming straight to bed like i expected, she said, im going to the couch to let me hair dry. ....... fine..... so she turns on ncis. i come back half an hour later. its past 10:30 now. i tell her im getting ready for bed, and she says, wheres my dessert? she wants a cinnamon roll, a whole one. i bring her one and she says, i want you to cut this into pieces for me. im pulling my hair at this point. i cut it up into little bite sized pieces and go downstairs to brush my teeth. i come back up and shes in the middle of a new episode of ncis. i tell her i need to go to bed. and she sighs and says, after this episode. so i come back as soon as the episode is over, and she has finally taken a bite of her cinnamon roll. she says, if i knew you were coming back, i would have eaten this faster. i ask her, does that mean you dont need my help getting to bed? and she sounds frustrated and says, i might fall, but i dont know when i will. so i need you nearby.  i ask her if shes done with her dessert and she says, fine, take it. its midnight at this point. then for some inexplicable reason, she opens her laptop up! gah! i tell her im going to bed and i leave. 15 minutes later i hear her calling me from her bed. i get out of bed and go to her and she says, turn off the bedroom light for me. and bring me my cell phone in case i need to call you. but dont turn the hallway light off this time! i go back to bed, its past midnight, but my head is so full of negative thoughts and emotions, i cant even fall asleep.  is this my new life? i hate it so much. i hate it. i resent my grandma. i used to respect her, and now i borderline despise her. but what choice do i have? if i tell her that im feeling burdened, shell quit dialysis and die. for what?? because i was tired of making her lattes and cutting up her food?  i keep telling myself that im just going through and adjustment period and the strong negative emotions will fade with time. but so far they seem to be getting worse.  i heard her talking on the phone yesterday with her friend. grandma told her friend that i was one of her favorites, and that i spoil her, and that shes really happy that she left the care facility. so at least my sacrifice isnt in vain.... but does she realize how difficult shes being?"

    "context": "do you have any advice for a new caregiver? i have to get all of this off my chest.  a couple weeks ago, grandma, who was living in an assisted living place, decided she was going to quit dialysis (which would cause a painless death within 14 days). she said her life wasnt worth living in a care facility, but she didnt want to burden her family with caring for her. we had a meeting, in which her 4 children and i (her grandchild), told her how much she meant to us, and that wed like to try making her life better. so instead of quitting dialysis, it was decided she would move in with me. why me? well i live the closest to where all her doctors are. she has 4 retired children, and somehow making grandmas life worth living, became my burden.  i naively thought this would be easy. i just had to cook for her, help her shower, and drive her to and from dialysis three times a week. im a freelancer, so ive been working while she naps. but i hate my new life so much.  its so draining. my complaints are so petty. but this woman who used to be the dependable matriarch of our family now calls me over ever time she needs a tiny little thing. shell ask for a tissue, which is just barely out of arms reach for her. so i stand up, walk over to her, move the tissue box a little closer, and shell say, i just needed one. ok.... then i sit back down, and shell say, i need my chapstick too. so i get up and go find that for her. as im handing it to her, she says, while youre up, could you dump this tea and make me a latte? of course i can, thats easy but why do i feel so bitter as i walk to the sink. i make her a latte (more peppermint than white chocolate, she explains). i hand it to her, and without fail she asks me, did you stir this? oh my god. why does she ask me that every time?? yes grandma, i stirred it. cooking is a whole other hassle because she has so many dietary restrictions, and she turns up her nose at anything with spices. no cumin, basil, paprika, and definitely no pepper. no onions, garlic, or bell peppers. ive basically been rotating through macaroni, pizza, and pasta for dinner.  at night, its the worst. for example yesterday she told me, after you finish working, come help me shower and then ill go to bed. good deal. but after i finished working, i went to her and she said, i didnt know youd be done so quickly. ill shower in half an hour. its 9pm at this point, but ok, i guess i can wait half an hour.... half and hour later, i come back and help her shower. instead of coming straight to bed like i expected, she said, im going to the couch to let me hair dry. ....... fine..... so she turns on ncis. i come back half an hour later. its past 10:30 now. i tell her im getting ready for bed, and she says, wheres my dessert? she wants a cinnamon roll, a whole one. i bring her one and she says, i want you to cut this into pieces for me. im pulling my hair at this point. i cut it up into little bite sized pieces and go downstairs to brush my teeth. i come back up and shes in the middle of a new episode of ncis. i tell her i need to go to bed. and she sighs and says, after this episode. so i come back as soon as the episode is over, and she has finally taken a bite of her cinnamon roll. she says, if i knew you were coming back, i would have eaten this faster. i ask her, does that mean you dont need my help getting to bed? and she sounds frustrated and says, i might fall, but i dont know when i will. so i need you nearby.  i ask her if shes done with her dessert and she says, fine, take it. its midnight at this point. then for some inexplicable reason, she opens her laptop up! gah! i tell her im going to bed and i leave. 15 minutes later i hear her calling me from her bed. i get out of bed and go to her and she says, turn off the bedroom light for me. and bring me my cell phone in case i need to call you. but dont turn the hallway light off this time! i go back to bed, its past midnight, but my head is so full of negative thoughts and emotions, i cant even fall asleep.  is this my new life? i hate it so much. i hate it. i resent my grandma. i used to respect her, and now i borderline despise her. but what choice do i have? if i tell her that im feeling burdened, shell quit dialysis and die. for what?? because i was tired of making her lattes and cutting up her food?  i keep telling myself that im just going through and adjustment period and the strong negative emotions will fade with time. but so far they seem to be getting worse.  i heard her talking on the phone yesterday with her friend. grandma told her friend that i was one of her favorites, and that i spoil her, and that shes really happy that she left the care facility. so at least my sacrifice isnt in vain.... but does she realize how difficult shes being?"

    "context": "do you have any advice for a new caregiver? i have to get all of this off my chest.  a couple weeks ago, grandma, who was living in an assisted living place, decided she was going to quit dialysis (which would cause a painless death within 14 days). she said her life wasnt worth living in a care facility, but she didnt want to burden her family with caring for her. we had a meeting, in which her 4 children and i (her grandchild), told her how much she meant to us, and that wed like to try making her life better. so instead of quitting dialysis, it was decided she would move in with me. why me? well i live the closest to where all her doctors are. she has 4 retired children, and somehow making grandmas life worth living, became my burden.  i naively thought this would be easy. i just had to cook for her, help her shower, and drive her to and from dialysis three times a week. im a freelancer, so ive been working while she naps. but i hate my new life so much.  its so draining. my complaints are so petty. but this woman who used to be the dependable matriarch of our family now calls me over ever time she needs a tiny little thing. shell ask for a tissue, which is just barely out of arms reach for her. so i stand up, walk over to her, move the tissue box a little closer, and shell say, i just needed one. ok.... then i sit back down, and shell say, i need my chapstick too. so i get up and go find that for her. as im handing it to her, she says, while youre up, could you dump this tea and make me a latte? of course i can, thats easy but why do i feel so bitter as i walk to the sink. i make her a latte (more peppermint than white chocolate, she explains). i hand it to her, and without fail she asks me, did you stir this? oh my god. why does she ask me that every time?? yes grandma, i stirred it. cooking is a whole other hassle because she has so many dietary restrictions, and she turns up her nose at anything with spices. no cumin, basil, paprika, and definitely no pepper. no onions, garlic, or bell peppers. ive basically been rotating through macaroni, pizza, and pasta for dinner.  at night, its the worst. for example yesterday she told me, after you finish working, come help me shower and then ill go to bed. good deal. but after i finished working, i went to her and she said, i didnt know youd be done so quickly. ill shower in half an hour. its 9pm at this point, but ok, i guess i can wait half an hour.... half and hour later, i come back and help her shower. instead of coming straight to bed like i expected, she said, im going to the couch to let me hair dry. ....... fine..... so she turns on ncis. i come back half an hour later. its past 10:30 now. i tell her im getting ready for bed, and she says, wheres my dessert? she wants a cinnamon roll, a whole one. i bring her one and she says, i want you to cut this into pieces for me. im pulling my hair at this point. i cut it up into little bite sized pieces and go downstairs to brush my teeth. i come back up and shes in the middle of a new episode of ncis. i tell her i need to go to bed. and she sighs and says, after this episode. so i come back as soon as the episode is over, and she has finally taken a bite of her cinnamon roll. she says, if i knew you were coming back, i would have eaten this faster. i ask her, does that mean you dont need my help getting to bed? and she sounds frustrated and says, i might fall, but i dont know when i will. so i need you nearby.  i ask her if shes done with her dessert and she says, fine, take it. its midnight at this point. then for some inexplicable reason, she opens her laptop up! gah! i tell her im going to bed and i leave. 15 minutes later i hear her calling me from her bed. i get out of bed and go to her and she says, turn off the bedroom light for me. and bring me my cell phone in case i need to call you. but dont turn the hallway light off this time! i go back to bed, its past midnight, but my head is so full of negative thoughts and emotions, i cant even fall asleep.  is this my new life? i hate it so much. i hate it. i resent my grandma. i used to respect her, and now i borderline despise her. but what choice do i have? if i tell her that im feeling burdened, shell quit dialysis and die. for what?? because i was tired of making her lattes and cutting up her food?  i keep telling myself that im just going through and adjustment period and the strong negative emotions will fade with time. but so far they seem to be getting worse.  i heard her talking on the phone yesterday with her friend. grandma told her friend that i was one of her favorites, and that i spoil her, and that shes really happy that she left the care facility. so at least my sacrifice isnt in vain.... but does she realize how difficult shes being?"

(and i do know every person is different... i guess i just feel that it seems this is going rather quickly and couldnt imagine her losing more of herself just as fast as we have this year.)"

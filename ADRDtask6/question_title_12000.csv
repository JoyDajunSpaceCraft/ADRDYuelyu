starting the transplant process,finally my dad's heart doctor is beginning the process of getting my dad a consult for being on the heart transplant list.

starting the transplant process,in the meantime i'm just kind of afraid that he may kick the bucket at any moment.

why was the caregiver reading my grandma's results to someone on her phone?,"i'm a bit short tempered and she got upset and we fought about this for like 2 hours (she didn't seem to understand that i didn't want to offend her and i had no intention of taking over grandma's medical stuff, just decided to call the doctor for the prescriptipons on an impulse) and after this i decided to avoid her from now on and only talk to her on the phone since i don't really like her personality."

"essays for late 20s caregiver (significant other, cancer)",there are some resource pages but i have not managed to find anything substantial from working-age caregivers talking about their experience taking care of a significant other.
"essays for late 20s caregiver (significant other, cancer)",thank you in advance!
"essays for late 20s caregiver (significant other, cancer)",specific materials of interest though would be curious to read works from a range of mediums:  essays columns books blogs  bonus points if the writer is...  gay no children working  ... or discusses...  self-care (while upholding the quality of care for the sick family member) trying to succeed at work despite sometimes-crippling anxiety (and depression?)

i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,cue the start of my midlife crisis.
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,"our house, the animals (2cats and a dog), cooking, cleaning, gardening, helping him shower or go to the bathroom, picking up prescriptions, helping with his therapy, doing so much laundry, sobbing by myself outside then handwashing 3 days worth of dishes because our dishwasher broke, it's like i woke up in someone else's life."
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,i'm pretty sure i'm going to get fired at this new job because of poor work performance.
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,"we went through so many shift changes, and so much was lost or forgotten because of this."
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,"we were told we were waiting for an mri, and 6 hours of badgering later, discovered that the previous shift doctor who said he had ordered it hadn't put it in the system."
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,i also need support and care.
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,"i walk 3 blocks across sky bridges looking for a tampon vending machine that information pointed me towards, no luck."
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,"but whatever, i call an uber to come grab me awhen tom starts begging me to get him something from starbucks."
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,"so i get him a cool hanging plant, nothing fancy, but he loves his houseplants so it fit well."
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,he got me nothing.
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,"its not about getting a gift, it's about being considered."
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,"am i losing my mind, because i feel like i am."
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,should i have waited to say something?
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,i just feel like caregiving has shown a glaring spotlight on our relationship and i don't like what i'm seeing.
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,"hi all, i feel like my brain is about to explode so i just need to get his out."
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,"sorry about typos, i'm on mobile."
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,"he could barely walk, and even the barest movement, bend or twist was excruciating."
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,"that same day, i started a new job, and my dad told the family that he has lung cancer."
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,"we went through so many shift changes, and so much was lost or forgotten because of this."
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,"eventually, around hour16, they moved him to a back hallway by the trauma er entrance."
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,"i wasn't able to go with him, and was able to go home and finally rest for a bit."
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,"he is still in a lot of pain, using a walker to get around, can't bend over or do much of anything independently."
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,"still a lot of work and not fun for either of us, but a much needed relief from the hospital balancing act."
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,"i am proud of myself for how hard i have worked to make tom happy and healthy, especially given that my depression has a history of making even basic self care impossible."
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,"it's like he sees me as this endless waterfall of kindness, energy and empathy that never needs to be replinished."
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,i also need support and care.
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,"sorry i can't seem to stop writing, i don't feel like i can talk about this with anyone, and it's felt good to just get it out."
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,"i know this sounds so nitpicky, because he has been sick, but for the past week since he came home from the hospital he's done nothing but sit on the sofa on his phone, the least he could have done is order a card or plan on ordering dinner."
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,i've gotten him a small thing each time.
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,"last night i asked if he could order our dinner for the night and he pouted and whinged about having to download the apps and buy it, when i have been the one to order food our entire relationship despite the fact that i make less than $20,000 a year."
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,he just turned away from me and turned on the tv.
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,"we haven't spoken since, i slept downstairs, other than what's necessary, because i'm still his primary fucking caregiver."
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,"why the fuck am i breaking myself to pieces for you, who cant even be bothered to talk to me, care for me, or say ""i love and appreciate you"" when i'm literally begging for it?"
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,yet when i had surgery last year you wouldn't even drive me to the hopsital prior and didn't come visit me that night.
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,can't even do the bare minimum when the roles are reversed.
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,am i being too hard on him while he's sick?
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,should i have waited to say something?
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,my brain feels like it's been put in a blender.
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,i'm just so so so exhausted.
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,i just feel like caregiving has shown a glaring spotlight on our relationship and i don't like what i'm seeing.
i snapped and i feel bad that i don't feel bad,we are incredibly lucky to have them.

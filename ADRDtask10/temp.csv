"Mom is being admitted to the hospital for the 3rd time in 6 months for severe hypothyroidism leading to hyponatremia (too much water compared to too little sodium). 

Is this her life now? 3-5 weeks in the hospital, followed by 4-6 weeks in assisted living finding out how much more cognitive capacity she lost, stabilizing long enough to start not taking all her medications, then getting readmitted? 

We are in a constant merry-go-round of hospitalizing, stabilizing, trying to get a handle on underlying issues that all interact with each other, destabilizing, and back to the hospital. 

It just sucks."
"My mom is getting (past) that age where every medical decision seems to be a quality of life decision.  she has a POLST that indicates  ""Comfort-Focused Treatment"".   She is 88 and has advanced alzheimers and can not longer make her own choices.  A few months ago, she contracted pneumonia and I sent her to the hospital where they pretty easily treated her with IV Antibiotics.   Now I am questioning this decision and want to be better prepared the next time a medical choice like this comes up.   And I want to make sure my siblings and i are on the same page.   does anyone here have rules of thumb for deciding what when not to initiate treatment, especially for things that are pretty easily treatable?  I mean -- do i interpret this as ""no really, i am ready to pass and don't you dare prolong this longer than necessary?""     This comes up now because she has COVID (asymptomatic currently).  No ventilator seems easy...what else am i missing?

Old age aint for sissys"
"Hi everyone, I was wondering if anyone knew of some good websites/facilities anything that offers affordable housing for Disabled Seniors? I'm looking for Southern California specifically North County San Diego. Any help would be appreciated, Thanks!"
"I've been touring facilities, trying to get a feel for the level of care and right combination of programs that will suit my mom. She's cognitively all there, but physically is very feeble, and very much a hermit. She doesn't want to participate in all those activities, and is quite happy living independently... it's just that her current home isn't safe to do so in. 

I am desperate to find somewhere she can ""age in place."" I will be going back home - overseas - and need to trust that as she advances in care, she remains in the same system. 

So I've started looking into these facilities and holy hell. You have to pay a 6-figure entrance fee just to get in?? Come on now. Who has that kind of cash sitting around. I assume the idea is when you've retired you've also paid off a house and can use that equity...

Has anyone dealt with this before? Can a bridging loan work? Or are we just SOL for that route."
"As I sit in the urgent orthopedic office with my mother (65) trying to keep it together, I know I'm not alone and I appreciate it. This year I finally convinced her to move to be closer to me, 45 minutes south from where she was. Her moving date was a week ago and her back went out right before. So I took off work and got her moved (thank the gods I own my own business and can just push clients back for their jobs.) I begged her for a week to go to the urgent care and get a shot or something and she was just convinced it'll get better. well 6am this morning I get a panicked phone call ""we gotta go, I can't move."" So here we are. I have a major surgery tomorrow, which is pushing my work another week behind, and have nothing ready. My kitchen is a mess, there's no clean laundry, and I will be spending all day with my mother again. My husband is as much of a help as he can be with his brain injury and I can't put a lot of pressure on him, plus he doesn't deserve the stress that my mother brings to any situation. 

I am thinking of hiring a nurse to go in and help her but I know she will be so against it. I also think I'm at the point that I don't care what she wants. I can't bend over backwards and run a business and attend to my dogs (I never had kids because she's been sick my whole life and I knew I'd need to take care of her because my brother certainly won't) and keep any sort of sanity without help. And I'm also not totally poor like we were growing up so I'm going to hire someone and she's going to deal with it. Ugh....

Thanks for letting me get this off my chest. All of my friends still have healthy parents and no one understands.

ETA THANKS everyone for chiming in. I felt the love today which is what I needed. They gave her a steroid and surprise! She thinks she already feels it getting better but ""just a little"" because we Pennsylvania Dutch women don't let our hopes get too high. :)"
"Dad has moderate dementia, mum is an undiagnosed horder with OCD/ADHD. Mum hates dad, but views him as a responsibility and burden. Treats him with no love and feeds him low quality instant food. Causes him anxiety that worsens the dementia. She is overbearing and controlling. 

I am in my 40s, 20 yr married and essentially homeless due to the housing crisis and high rents. Living with my parents this summer to try and help. Figured I could work, but thier demands made me lose my job. 

House is a mess, cat hair everywhere, 3/4 of groceries expired in the kitchen, full of clutter making cleaning impossible. Mother refuses to unload anything worth more than $3 as she wants to get that money back. 

Currently at the end of my rope, feel trapped and getting very depressed. It's bad enough living with my parents after being independent in a clean environment for so long but coming back to this toxicity is draining the life out of my wife and I.

Everything I fix or do uncovers 3 more issues..... it's a nightmare.

I wish I had options, wish I knew what to do, wish I had a support network.....

Edit: What makes it worse is that I should be thankful when I see the much worse issues that many here have to deal with.  In comparison the situation could be much worse. That said, healthwise; this situation is deteriorating."
"Will try to keep this short. I moved back with my parents (now 72 and 70) during the pandemic. My mom has been a ""drinker"" for a long time. I have a Day Mom (sober) and a Night Mom (drunk, beginning at 4 or 5), and it's sort of like the show Severance. Day Mom doesn't know what Night Mom gets up to. Night Mom remembers nothing about the day. (I once had huge, amazing life news and made the poor decision of telling Night Mom first who completely shat on my news. Day Mom was over the moon when I told her!)

Tonight Night Mom was up late watching a few episodes of Better Call Saul and baking a peach cobbler. All of this is unusual for a few reasons: 1) up way past her bedtime of 7 or 8, 2) she hates dessert, 3) she hasn't been the main cook of the house for 20 years. 

I could hear her come up to bed around 10 but I still heard the oven fan on so I went downstairs. Oven was on, one of the burners was on, dishes were everywhere (less of a concern) and the peach cobbler was half eaten (binge eating is not a thing I've ever seen my mom do in my 38 years, she eats very very little).

Having a ""you need help"" talk re her drinking never goes well. Day Mom truly doesn't think there even is a Night Mom. But I need to confront her about what a dangerous situation she put the household in last night. Any talk track suggestions? I'm really afraid that this is only going to get worse as my parents get older, and I eventually move back out and can't monitor them every single day. They don't have any other independence issues currently and are otherwise healthy, sharp, responsible, etc."
"Hi all. I’m just venting, but if anyone has any advice, I’m happy to take it!

My father just turned 69, but his health problems age him a good 20 years. He’s had chronic conditions (CHF, diabetes) for around 15 years, doesn’t take care of himself, and it’s caught up to him. He had a stroke in 2020. He was fine overall with some minor physical deficits (mostly fine motor), held a part time job, and lived on his own. 

Now we’re here. I don’t know how often he’s fallen previously, but the last month he had 2 falls that landed him in the hospital in the same week. He made some very impulsive decisions, but was competent so we couldn’t do anything about it. Now we’re dealing with a newly bought condo that he can’t return to, along with very limited assets. 

His hospital stay(s) sent him to short term rehab. But, alas, he has Medicare advantage and they discharged him after 2 weeks. He came home with us temporarily while we determined next steps (he wanted to go back to independent living; we didn’t think it would happen but supported it if it would help his PT/OT/etc motivation). He fell 4 times in 3 days with us. He had a blood sugar crisis and is back in the hospital. ER doc determines it’s not safe to return to our home now. He’s going to be moved to another short term rehab (not nearly as nice as his first bc ugh Advantage) to buy us some time. 

He still wants to go back to independent, but is willing to move to assisted living at this point. However, we’re not sure he can. He’s impulsive and won’t wait for assistance getting up and down (PT says he needs minimal assistance; really supervision, but he refused to call for us even at our house and can’t imagine he’ll patiently wait for rounds at ALF). 

I’ve spoken to more lawyers, social services, property managers, realtors, everyone under the sun over the past 3 weeks than I have ever in my entire life. His assets are *extremely* limited. We’ve been given the advice to keep him in a nursing home to get Medicaid faster, but we’re not sure he will (and I’m not sure I’ll be able to not take him home out of guilt). One of the attorneys (likely who we’d go with for the process) said it’s not worth his fees if Dad won’t. 

We know we’ll supplement him in ALF if he can go there. But $2000 vs like $500 a month for a long time is a very different animal. I feel exceptional guilt thinking of him in a nursing home (especially the choices we currently have) indefinitely if he can’t do ALF because of his age and depression that is coming along with these discussions. It’s obvious we’re not equipped to have him at our house from the short time he was there. I’m told that it can be hard to find longterm care facilities to move to because they don’t want to give up beds for this long on Medicaid. 

I’m the only one who can care for or make these decisions for him. And I’m lost. I am at the point where I feel I have gotten too much information to make heads or tails of it. And we have to make these decisions very quickly if we want Medicaid (which is essential for anything at all at this point). 

I’m also sad/mad/resentful that I’m now in this position because of his (and his ex-wife’s) irresponsibility financially and health-wise. 

And Florida is a mess in general from what I’m being told. 

I’m just lost and feel helpless. 

Thanks for reading my vent."
"I posted here about a year ago: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/jo5jby/bipolar_disorder_and_early_cognitive_decline_i/)  

Quick background if you don't want to read all of that: I am 26 and an only child, my mom is 62. She has bipolar disorder and has been pretty unstable most of my life. She had custody of me for two years when I was a kid, but ended up giving up custody to my dad. I saw her every month for a while, but that tapered off in my teen years because she was often in and out of the psychiatric hospital. I see her now every 1-3 years. She wants to move closer to me but I'm moving to a new state next month and we aren't staying there long term (SO is in the military). She had lived in supportive house, an adult family home, or assisted living for all of my adulthood.  

A lot has changed in that time. I don't have power of attorney, but I am on her advanced directive as her decision-maker if she is incapacitated and have access to all of her medical records. She got COVID and was very sick, but made a full recovery. [more info here](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/qadwjk/anyone_have_experiences_with_vaccinated_loved/) The physical therapists were able to get her up and walking again in the hospital, which was amazing. She hadn't been walking for over a year at that point. I convinced her to go to a skilled nursing facility for physical therapy because the fact that she was wheelchair-bound is why she got so sick. I also really did not want her to go back to the last assisted living, because they were happy to just let her sit in the wheelchair all day and were even using catheters to prevent accidents, which is awful because she is prone to UTIs. She ended up moving to a new assisted living that I found and that she hates.   

The reason I feel so helpless is that she is just an anxious wreck, 99.99% of the time. I have tried to get involved with her mental health team but it is hit or miss if they actually include me. I managed to get in on a Zoom meeting once with them but it wasn't very productive. Every time I call her she is sobbing and hyperventilating. I can barely understand her half of the time. It makes me not want to call her which makes me feel even more guilty, but there is no talking her down or reasoning with her when she is worked up like this. I know she is driving the CNAs there crazy because she is always crying and wandering up the halls asking for medication for her anxiety or screaming and asking for help with things she can do herself, like her television. This isn't her and I know it is likely dementia progressing, even though her entire family is in denial because her memory is still sharp. I feel like she might need to be in a memory care facility but it would make her feel even more awful because she is still more with it than other residents would be. 

I feel like even if I got more involved, there is nothing I can do. I feel like an absolutely horrifically terrible daughter. I am about to graduate nursing school and I'm letting my mom rot in some assisted living facility she hates. I know mentally that I could not care for her at home and it would severely jeopardize my mental health and marriage. Just trying to help her from out of state has been really really hard on me mentally. Her sister has said it is an absolutely terrible idea to try to move her in with us. I just don't know what to do. I know this comes across more like just a vent but I could really use some advice from others who have been in a similar situation."
"My parents raised my brother and me in the Northeast US. They retired and moved to Arizona about 20 years ago. It’s been great for them in terms of financial stability, socially, and with a network of healthcare that has served them well. My brother and his wife are raising their kids in our home area. My husband and I haven’t had kids and therefore seem to have taken on the majority of parent care and attention. Up until now there have been a few health scares but nothing severe or permanent. But things are changing. Now both in their 80s, my mom is doing well but my dad is declining. While still living in the Northeast at the start of the pandemic, I realized how isolated and vulnerable my parents were, in that no one could get to them quickly if needed. Fast forward 2 years and my husband and I now live on the West coast a few hours’ drive to my parents (where I could find work in my industry). Primarily to be around for my parents but also for my husband and I to try something new. Well, we’ve tried and we don’t like it. We are the ones who now feel isolated. I see the needs from my parents only getting greater, my dad says he feels so relieved that we’re now nearby for my mom after he goes. It’s not their fault we’re here and unhappy, but I also feel an obligation to stick this out for their benefit. Is it worth my own happiness, my husband’s, our marriage to stay?"
"Hi everyone.

I'm not really sure why I'm writing this, I guess just to vent ... somewhere. I'm not sure this info will help anyone. I just feel like I need someone to talk to who is in the same boat. If that's you, thank you in advance for reading.

Mom is 98, has great health internally, good heart, lungs, all that stuff. The problem is with her skeleton, specifically her knees, which don't want to support her anymore. She is essentially wheelchair bound, but is still able to transfer herself from chair to chair.

She has an apartment in an Independent Living community that is HUD subsidized, so her rent for the last 10 years has been approx. $150 a month. This place is perfect and I wish she could stay there forever, BUT, every day I wonder if this is the day she stops being able to transfer herself. I have 2 girls who come in each week, one who cleans the apartment, the other comes to give Mom a bath and does her laundry for the week.

Mom is so miserable, and worn out, from just trying to dress and transfer herself that she has no quality of life right now. I am 61, and have my own aches and pains and problems to deal with. Taking her to the doc and lifting her out of the car is just too much, but she doesn't seem to think so!!!

I want her to go to AL, which in our area averages about $5k a month. She has enough money in the bank to live in AL for 4-5 years. What happens after that? I have no clue, but no one thought she would live this long and it really wouldn't surprise me if she lived another 5 years, at least. She doesn't want to go to AL because ""it's too expensive.""

Mom feels like if she's having a decent day today, then everything is ok and nothing should change. She's really good at laying the guilt trip on me for not wanting to spend my every moment dealing with her stuff. Luckily, I'm at a point where I am technically retired. There is no way that I would be able to hold down a full or even part-time job with all of her needs. I have one brother, age 73, who lives 1200 miles away and is absolutely no help. The only good thing about his involvement is that he's happy for me to make all the decisions and doesn't fight me at all on any decisions about Mom.

And, I hate writing stuff like this to the great unknown, because everyone keeps telling me how ""lucky I am"" to still have my mother around, as their's passed ages ago.

I feel so trapped in this situation. No help from anyone and constantly surprised with some new malady or tragedy for the day. I'm a nervous wreck. I haven't been on anything like a vacation since 2011, because I don't have anyone to deal with her while I'm away.

I have tried several of the agencies who supply in-home caregivers, but they can't even find anyone to come and look after her because they are all so poorly-staffed. The few times they have been able to send someone, that person usually just wants to sit and ""provide companionship"" for her, but really don't think that they should be assisting her in transferring or giving her a bath, etc. None of the gross or hard stuff.

If you have made it this far, I feel I should apologize because I must sound like I am wallowing in self-pity. I'm just feeling like I can't keep going on like this and, I don't see any end in sight. And, as you may have surmised by now, she and I don't really get along all that well! We constantly butt heads and it just feels like her choices are always the most difficult ones for me to execute. We go to at least 4 doctors a month in hopes of her ""getting back to normal."" She refuses to accept that she's stuck in a wheelchair for the rest of her life.

If you're in a similar situation, I'm so sorry for you. I hope you get a break soon.

If you have a sibling in my situation, and you are the one far away who can't help, then at least send your sibling some flowers and tell them how much you appreciate what they do for Mom!

And, if you happen to know the magic answer to my dilemma, by all means, please feel free to share! I'm all ears!

Here's to hoping you are in a happier place with your aging parent."
"My very sharp parents (both with graduate degrees and a lot of intelligence) started falling for scams in their 70s.

My mother gave tens of thousands of dollars to some online scammers who claimed to be orphans abroad.  She never investigated them and when I suggested giving funds to a verifiable nonprofit that would distribute them, I was told that, of course, I was “wrong”.

My father will click on any link in a phishing email and will give his info to anyone who calls and asks.  A caller claiming to be from Amazon Prime will call, or an email claiming to be from Amazon Prime, but sent from a Gmail account, will easily get info from my father.

Anyone with any sense would it fall for these idiotic scams, but my parents would.  Why do seniors fall for scams that younger people wouldn’t?  I don’t get it.  My father’s short term memory is gone, but otherwise my parents were still sharp and showed no mental decline when they started falling for scammers."
"Hi all. My dad is back from the hospital on hospice home care. He literally has been murmuring and talking to himself for hours starting at 8pm now it’s 3:30am. Anything I can do besides checking on him every hour? Definitely can’t sleep because his voice is loud generally, I’ve just been making sure his oxygen and other things are good every hour."
"Hi everyone. Last monday my grandmom (90) fell and broke two bones. She got surgery and now is fine, the doctor says so. I know she can't walk for the moment, but she is not trying at all, not trying to do her exercises at all and making excuses, even faking the pain sometimes. She is extremely afraid after the traumatic situation we all lived (we waited for the paramedics during 2 hours with my grandmom on the ground screaming because of the pain). It was horrible. She is a heavy woman and it's been hard for all of us to care 24/7 and see she is acting selfishly. We  love her, but we need to change her mindset or it's going to destroy us.

Sorry if I am being harsh. It's not been a easy week for us. And for the grammar, not a native speaker.

Hi guys. Little update: she walked about 15 steps today. She was in pain but she is facing it so great. I congratulated her and she was very proud, smiled at me and that's just awesome."
"I’m posting on behalf of my Dad for advice with his parents, as he liked and appreciated this sub a lot but didn’t want to make an account since he can’t have social media on his phone because of his job. Anyhow— my grandfather, who I’ll call T, has been taking care of my grandmother, D, for upwards of 4 years now. There’s a lot of issues with that in and of itself, but we are primarily worried about her mobility (well, her lack thereof).

D has a combination of health issues and stubbornness that led to her sitting around all day and basically losing her mobility. She can’t wear socks at all, even with a cane or walker, without fear of falling; she has to use a lift chair in order to get up; she can’t go up/down the stairs or any incline (T has to use a golf cart to get her down the hill if she wants to sit outside), and the most she walks is to and from the kitchen, or a doctor’s appointment—where she always needs a mobility aid or to brace on T. She has pretty significant swelling in her feet that she blames on fluid retention from her medication, as well as general joint/arthritic pain since she was a teacher and always on her feet.  However, these problems have been significantly worsened by how crappy her shoes are— a fact all of her doctors agree with, and have tried to get her to change to allow for improvement. 

With that in mind, the most easy to fix offense (in our heads) is the fact that the shoes she wears are awful. They are cheap flats with no support that don’t fit her from Walmart— she will wear these despite having the money for new ones, and despite my Dad buying her gift cards and setting her up appointments to get more supportive ones to cause her less pain/discomfort. He has even bought her new ones with T’s supervision, but she will not wear them. Are there any methods to help convince her that we haven’t tried? 

My siblings and I have chalked it up as impossible (which feels awful to say but it is based on how she reacts with other, bigger changes for her benefit too), but since it’s his mother, my Dad really wants to see if he’s explored everything to get her to try he can before giving up, which I totally understand because it probably feels like “giving up” on the people who raised you to let them be in pain in some way"
"I'm posting this for a friend who is not on Reddit and looking for some advice.

Friend, 68F- Naomi has a sister, 72, Jean.

Jean has never married, has always exhibited signs of mental illness. She is probably un-diagnosed as bi-polar.

About 6 or 7 months ago, Jean was diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer. She lived in Kansas, Naomi lives in Oklahoma.  Jean is a hoarder, and also a ""crazy cat lady.""

It got to the point that Jean was no longer able to live alone. After the last hospitalization,  she was discharged into the extended care in Oklahoma. Then when she was well enough to be discharged from there, that facility discharged her to Naomi & her husbands care.  They moved her in, brought 4 out of 6 or more cats (that have to stay in the garage, due to Naomi being allergic.)  One of the 4 cats escaped and they've not been able to catch it. Jean is livid about this. I mean \*L\*I\*V\*I\*D.\*

To say the least, Jean is **NOT** mentally stable. She sleeps all day, gets up around 3 pm, and then proceeds to eat everything she can get her hands on. Naomi & her husband have literally had to hide food in their bedroom to keep Jean from eating everything. Then Jean accuses them of trying to ""starve her to death."" She's gained about 40 pounds since she moved in with them.  Because she sleeps all day, she stays up all night and watches TV loudly, or pretty much makes all kinds of noise that inhibits Naomi & her husband from sleep.  They had to put a lock on their bedroom door to keep her out. (Doesn't keep her from attempting to gain access though.) She screams at them tells them she hates them and they're trying to kill her and her cats.  BTW-- the cats are in the garage, w/a cat house and well cared for, Jean has ventured out to the garage maybe 3 or 4 times in the last month to see them. She doesn't feed or take care of them in any sense of the word.

She refuses to follow the instructions the cancer doctor here has given her. She won't take the chemo he's prescribed, claims her other doctor says she doesn't need it.  She has a pacemaker, and it set off the defibrillator 9xs times during the night trying to get her heart shocked back into normal rhythm. Apparently it didn't work, so they put in a new pacemaker.

Now the hospital is about to discharge her. Jean told the social worker and anyone else who'd listen to her that she ""hates"" her sister, her sister is ""abusing"" her and ""starving"" her.

Naomi nor her husband can no longer handle her. Naomi is not in the best of health herself, and taking on the responsibility of caring for her mentally ill sister is taking a horrible toll on Naomi's health and well being.

I told Naomi to tell the social worker that they absolutely cannot take care of Jean any longer, and to refuse to take her back to their home.  Jean mustered up the courage and called the SW and told her this. She told the SW they do not feel safe with Naomi in their home.

I think the SW is trying to put a guilt trip on Naomi, as she told her that Jean would have to go to a homeless shelter.

Naomi is unable to take care of herself, she is on Medicaid and needs to be in nursing home. What does Jean have to do to get her OUT of her house?"
"My mother is only 46 but with her mental state may as well be 86. She has a severe mental illness from doing drugs, drinking, mixing alcohol with pills throughout adulthood. For the past few years she’s done nothing but blister in the sun, chainsmoke, and talk to herself. She hasn’t and will not get any better at home. She’s been living with my grandparents since 2018, I’m 20 years old living on my own with low income at the moment and can’t afford to take care of her plus I’m always at work. My grandparents are getting old and can’t have her living with them forever. So I need to get power of attorney over her ASAP, haven’t done too much research yet and just thought I could maybe find some tips here. Hopefully it doesn’t have to involve a lawyer because I definitely wouldn’t be able to pay for that.."
"Multi-generational Brazilian household (me, my husband, his mother/my MIL). Mother/MIL is noncompliant diabetic, 76 years. We took over her medications recently, and dole them out, so at least now she’s medicated per doctors orders. But her diet is another thing altogether (a diabetic who eats a loaf of bread a day, she just ate 25 large bananas in four days, etc. etc. Yes, we cook for all of us every day, but she’ll ignore the nutritious food if she has her bread/banana/milk stash). She watches tv all day in her room. She has a lot of family, but none of them ever call her. She has no friends whatsoever (she’s not pleasant). We do virtually everything for her, so we’re not inclined to try to entertain her otherwise (every interaction is an argument anyway). 

We had tried to get her into adult day care programs and/or an activity program (it’s a long process in Brazil), but that’s not going to happen (the coordinators said she doesn’t have the right mindset/personality/I.e., they don’t want her). She’s increasingly mobility challenged, the diabetes has ruined her hands. She never NEVER leaves the house, unless it’s a doctors appt (accompanied by son). We have recently stopped running to the store for her to buy her her “fix” (bananas/bread/milk), so she will walk the five minutes to the store when she’s desperate for that sugar fix. Cognitive problems continue (every day she can’t remember the one button to push on the microwave). 

It seems like a lousy life for her (let alone us, with her). She’s only going to deteriorate. We’re kinda at the “whatever….we’ve tried everything” point. Is that normal to feel this way? (Assisted living is not an option, plus we ARE the assisted living)"
"I have elderly relatives who are not pc savvy and have some dementia. They are between 75-80 and are very independent. So I am the IT guy. Recently got one a laptop that to me is future-proof for 5 years at least (fast amd cpu, 16 gb of ram).

How can I make it so the laptop autoupdate?

How to reduce nag screens?

How can I deactivate the initial login to Windows 11?

I want to make the laptops as easy to use as possible. Your advice is much appreciated."
"As someone who has 24/7 caregivers who look after an aging parent, I want to ensure that the caregivers are happy.  So, caregivers:

1.  What do you like most about your jobs?
2.  What do you dislike most about your jobs?
3.  If you could ask your care receivers or care receivers’ families for one thing that would make your jobs better, what would that be?

Thanks."
"I live in my father’s house most of the time, to keep and eye on things, as he’s old and infirm.  We hired 24/7 caregivers for him, who are wonderful.

The caregivers mostly sit and watch TV in the breakfast room, not far from my father’s study.  That’s fine, although I think I have misophonia, an aversion to noise.  The caregivers turn up the volume on the TV and it’s pretty loud (to me), and I can still hear it even though I stay in a room on another floor, with the door closed, to get away from the noise.

Would it be appropriate if I bought a set of headphones to go with the TV and encouraged the caregivers to wear them, or if I closed the door to the breakfast room?  (They could still hear my father through the kitchen, which connects to his study.)

The caregivers are there for him- I’m simply a near-permanent houseguest- so ensuring that they can hear my father and help him comes first.

And I’m not sure if the caregivers are given instructions from their agency about how they must act while on the job, and wearing headphones all day might conflict with that.

But living in a house that I can’t use because of the TV noise (partially my problem, being noise-sensitive) is getting old.  And I work from home, and the you can definitely hear the TV noise in the background when I’m trying to have a work meeting.

Thanks.

EDITED TO ADD: I have Bose noise-cancelling headphones for me, which are great.

FURTHER ADDED: The blaring TV is an Insignia one with DirectTV and I can’t figure out a way to cap the volume. Of course home would have the exact same TV setup as the impossible to use setup at the gym. :("
"TL;DR: Any suggestions for finding someone to come in and clean (especially dust) for my grandmother who is always worried about people breaking her fragile collectibles?

I hope this is ok to post here as it concerns my grandmother and not a parent. I am about to go visit my grandmother in WA who I love dearly. She is in her 80s and a bit of a hoarder (well maybe hoarder isn’t the right word, she has many things from family members who have passed on that she isn’t ready to let go of), which you would think would be the issue but not so much. The biggest problem is dust and many collectibles. Everything she has holds special memories for her and on top of that we lost my grandfather last year. We don’t want to force her to let go of things and cause her more pain. However she is allergic to dust but isn’t able to dust so whenever I visit she is always sneezing. She is worried about people not being careful enough of her fragile items so is hesitant to hire anyone to come clean. I am really hoping someone can give me some advice for a way to find someone she would be comfortable with coming over maybe once or twice a month…if I am being honest now that she is living alone I would also feel a lot better if I knew someone would be there at a scheduled time a couple times a month. She is active in her church (I’m not Christian myself but I respect and feel good about all of the church goers I have met) so I was wondering if maybe someone from there but I don’t have any contact info on them and it seems all the people I’ve met that she is involved with at church are also elderly…
Unfortunately I will only have 4 days up there with her (because I’m driving it will take two days to get there and two to get back). I’m not sure if it would be long enough to truly find someone but I would really like to try. The most important thing with them is that my grandmother feels comfortable with them moving her things. Having her move out is not a option, she is sound in mind and would not even consider it, the closest family is a good 3-4 hours away and having them drive up to clean for her wouldn’t work. She does have the money to spend on it though sometimes she can be a bit frugal I think I can make her believe that this is worth it. I will try to clean as much as I can while I’m up there but I don’t know much I will be able to do since we will also be laying my grandfather’s ashes to rest as well and there will be a fair amount of family there visiting for the event. 
Bonus question: do you have any suggestions for helping her get to a point were she is ready to let go of some of the excess things she has? I know it won’t happen this trip but anything that could set her on that path?"
"My mom and stepdad are trying to buy a trailer home in a place for the elderly.

They cover their bills with their disability oncome and then I give mom 200$ (roughly 800-900 a month) weekly to cover food, daily expenses, gas, medicine.. etc. She always refers to it as an 'allowance' but the bank won't accept that, they said because there's nothing binding I could just decide tomorrow to stop sending the money and so the income can't be counted.

We were suggested to instead claim the 200$/weekly income as some kind of service that I'm paying mom for which will help it to appear as a stable source of income.

Our first thought was childcare, but I don't have kids. We can't really think of anything that we could reasonably claim I am paying her this money for.

Any suggestions on what we could say this money is for?

&#x200B;

Edit: Commenter raises a great point... Could claiming this income affect her disability income/food stamps etc? If we codify this money through this loan, will the Gov smack her for it?"
"Hi, all. My dad has been hospitalized for quite some time. I’ve been working on home health care. he does not want hospice and wants medical attention. he has medicare (part a and b) plus supplemental insurance. we're in the state of Florida. 

i have a ton of issues with the hospitalist assigned to his case, and i am finding errors in his summary. As an aside, he has scary reviews online regarding discharging and has been sued for malpractice.

do i have to go through medicare if I find errors. it is also a poorly written document. i was thinking of first contacting the patient services at the hospital, but i cannot really find a lot of information online with regards to what to do as a patient if there are errors in the summary. 

I apologize for my own errors here—standard disclaimer-on mobile"
"Once again, the subject says it all! If you look through my post history here, you can see I'm having a hard time with my mother, who moved into AL in Jan after 3 months recovery from a 1 month stay in the ICU (not covid).

The hospitalization hastened some already present issues with executive function and it's challenging to deal with to say the least.

I posted on Sunday that she was trying to get kicked out of AL. I no longer think that's quite accurate. I think that as she has EF issues, she has a hard time with emotional regulation, which makes it difficult to take a step back, breathe, and calibrate appropriate responses to things that might be genuinely annoying or frustrating.

She is also responding to being in AL with a combination of lying, manipulation, prevarication, etc.

Anytime we meet with any sort of health professional, she tries to use them as leverage: ""Tell my daughter I'm cogent and I don't need to be there,"" is a sentence I've heard a million times.

She simply does not grasp, or does not want to grasp, that the issue is not her cogency, but rather, her judgment, which is what has led her to fall 8+ times in the past 8 months.

Last night, when she had her visiting nurse call me and tell me my mom wasn't happy there and could she please go  home to her condo, I realized the extent to which my mom is trying to manipulate me and those around her. I found myself explaining to the nurse why it's best for my mom's safety to be there -- explanations that the nurse agreed with, btw, given that the nurse was like yeah, if she moves home she'll need a full time caregiver, it's just not safe, but she really wants to go home. What should we do?

And then when I got off the phone I was like ""what am I  *doing*? Why did I owe this woman an explanation? And also was *she* born yesterday to be manipulated like this? Is this appropriate? Wtf?""

So anyway, this is very new behavior from my mom. Any books you could recommend would be helpful. I am also looking for a therapist that deals with aging parents, so if you know one that's good and does telehealth in CA, i'm all ears!

ETA: the nurse who called me to tell me that my mom wanted to go back to her condo does not work for the facility. She is a visiting nurse from a third party nursing agency. The fact that her doctor has ordered that she see a nurse once a week perhaps gives some insight into her health status and why she is there. "
"Has anyone on here dealt with obese parents aging?

My mom, 66 is prob over 400lbs and my dad 69 is prob around 350. My mom has always had a sedentary life and her mobility is getting more limited rapidly. She currently is on oxygen with a lot of other health issues and doesn’t leave the house much. I know she will eventually be immobile and that’s heartbreaking and also an entirely separate subject…

But my real concern is my dad- I see him grimacing as he walks—- he needs knee replacement surgery but thinks he’s too “old and fat”. Which the doctor said if he lost some weight he could have the surgery and his quality of life would improve. He doesn’t have many other issues besides that (thankfully).How do I motivate him? I seriously think he thinks it’s too late. However his mom lived till 90. I know my mom might not be around for that long but I really think my dad has a chance and improving his quality of life for his remaining years. He’s always been a large but mobile and active guy. I know at some point he might be living alone and I worry if he is not in better shape how depressing and isolating it may become without good mobility. How do I motivate him? 

Also PSA- all this has really made me realize that being at a healthy weight isn’t necessarily so you can live longer—- it’s so when you age you can actually still LIVE life."
"I am currently living with my elderly parents. Dad still works just to keep entertainment. He got good genetics and is still strong as an ox. Mom is totally the opposite. She's been struggling with an aggressive RA for years triggering other conditions such as diabetes, high cholesterol, and lately dementia as side effects of the ton of medicines she takes along with the age. I've been all for the holistic way in an effort to give a bit back of what she used to be, especially for dementia. The protocol is kind of working but her dementia is aggravating to the point she doesn't remember if she ate or not. I've been working from home since two years ago only for her, lost a full scholarship only for taking care of her foot surgery, but it seems she doesn't appreciate it, nor my entire family.

My brother is also working from home and decided he would do the cooking part (the fun part, He didn't ask for it), and I do the cleaning stuff. However, my brother is taking care of the expenses at the moment. I do help with some groceries since my wage is three or four times less than his. The problem starts when there are no real rules about who does who. Everything silently changed since Dad suddenly stopped paying for anything. No one discusses anything. It's just like ""assumed"" or ""hinted"". So the annoying part is when my older brother conveniently started going out freely on weekdays doing the gym and visiting his fiancee, and on weekdays he never stays, and always left me trapped with mom inside the house at her beck and call when we had been discussed someone should have taken care of her.

My sister leaves 3 hs out of our town and she just comes to visit every time and on. When she comes she acts as the golden child with mom. Pay for her beauty needs, new haircut, nails, and buy her some dress, take her out for dinner, stay the night then the next morning she leaves, and ends up as a queen.

She demands constantly minor things but still annoying such as switching her Tv news. getting help with the PC. cooking etc. We have had minor discussions about not interrupting me while working. I work from home to an unemployment office and 99% of ppl are angry callers the stress is really high not to mention you are monitored constantly. Mom doesn't care and on top she got dementia. Someone would say, ""oh, it's your mom. That's how elderly ppl behave"". And I can agree at a certain point buy mom is particularly stubborn. She cries when she can't do anything but she always does it only with me. When my brother is or dad she doesn't. I feel manipulated at some point, but it's hard to discern since she is clearly disabled but she still uses this type of emotional manipulation because she knows it works for her, especially with me, and I can't stress enough that I really hate that.  And I know this is just the beginning. I don't even eat at night for my GERD situation, yet they were supposed to take care of their own food, but it's like ""implied' that's my obligation anyway since my older brother never stays with the exception of a couple of days on weekdays, and Dad it's always outside.

So because I am the only person available all the burden remains on me, and I am starting to feel frustrated, and exhausted by this situation since I don't have a life. No friends, and worst, I don't have any plan or alibi to leave the house. The times I have left I have found her laying down on the floor for her mobility issues with the kitchen on fire. My family takes these things slightly and my Dad is acting like a fool.

We can't afford a nurse. she only got medicare part B. I wonder if there is any type of assistance for her. I am feeling depressed with burnout symptoms due to also underlying immune diseases such as thyroid, GERD, and I guess liver issues. I myself also suffer from GERD and high cholesterol.

I was working with a psychologist and she constantly remind me that ""it's not your fault your mom is sick"". We together came to the conclusion I stem from a subtle abusive family. This is why I feel charged with these unexpressed feelings of anger when having to deal with my mom. It's been no few times that I have felt tempted to leave this house for good despite all the shit I have had to eat with my family all these years, yet I still don't have the heart to leave mom.

All I want is to hear some comforting words from ppl in the same boat as me. or Should I leave. Should I stay? What options do I have in the medical part?"
"My uncle is using a Blink camera to monitor my grandmother, age 97, while she sleeps. She tries to get up in the middle of the night, and this leads to injuries (unless someone gets to her before she tries to stand up). The problem is, he gets 5-8 alarms from Blink each night, but grandmum only actually tries to get out of bed twice per night. So he asked me to ask you folks if you know a better way to monitor her during the night, so that he doesn't have to wake up so often.

The Blink alarm goes off anytime she waves her hands around. However, when she tries to get out of bed, she always grabs the rail that is bolted to the floor next to the bed. So I was hoping maybe there was a touch sensor we could attach to the railing. 

I should also mention that we have asked her to call out or ring a bell when she wants to stand up but, because of dementia or sleepiness or stubbornness, she will not do that.

Any thoughts would be appreciated."
Good or bad experiences with the tech or service?
"I just had a conversation with my 70+ yr old Mom. It was a mixed bag, but the first time she admitted her and my stepfather’s behavior before I basically cut off most contact over a decade ago. We talked about what she wants for the next 10 years- and she’s made it clear that she’s not expecting me to be there for her in her old age, and she’s making plans to be buried in x location, x way. It’s civil. She and my stepfather have changed for the better, but its hard to think how things could have been- though I know having them in my life at earlier stages would have destroyed my marriage- not an acceptable timeline. 

I’d like to lighten their remaining years, but they seem in some ways determined to have things play out in this way. I’m just sad and disquieted today I guess. Advice?"
"My mom is almost 60 and has rheumatoid arthritis. Sometimes it is so bad that she is afraid to move in bed because of the pain. Last September she got into a car accident that messed up both her knees and a shoulder. 

She recently got surgery on her right shoulder and I (20 F) being the only daughter have to help her get dressed. I love my mom to death but I just can't stand seeing her breast. I just feel so uncomfortable and guilty at the same time because I feel like this shouldn't matter and helping my mom is what is most important. 

I think my helping my mom get dressed will become a regular thing because her arthritis is worsening. How do I get over this? Am I being immature?"
"Hi folks. New here. My parents are quite old, and live around 1000 miles from me and my brother. My mom isn’t doing super well health wise or cognitively. My father is doing quite well, but I worry because being a care taker is quite taxing on him. 

Im writing this because I want to hire someone to help. I have no idea what to Google. Are there nurses or healthcare workers that work privately that can visit my parents daily? And if so what would I Google to find them, and what does such a service cost (ball park). I’m aware it’s probably expensive. I feel like in my mid 40s I should know who to call here but I don’t. So here I am on the internet. Every phone call is varying degrees of frustrating and terrifying."
"My father (early 70s) has moved in with us part time and it is not going well. I need advice on how to be less reactive. In the moment, I can’t seem to stop myself from reacting to things he does that cause me stress. He is challenging to live with, and I know objectively it’s not always easy to have a parent move in, but I also know I could be better. I’ve been to therapy to try to find a strategy but I haven’t implemented well. I can’t find the empathy and patience I need to sustain this and I am self aware enough to wonder if I’m just a bad daughter. Has anybody come from a similar place and found more patience?"
"Both my husband and I are kids of older parents (had us in their 40s). My dad passed away a few years ago, and my mom has a terminal illness with uncertain but little amount of time left. My husband’s dad is in poor health with chronic conditions as well. At 30 I feel like we are in such a different place from our peers. We don’t have kids, and honestly now just doesn’t feel like the right time given the support we have to provide to our parents and the emotional toll it takes. Lately it seems like every week I fear one of them might pass away, and thinking about going through that (possibly a few times in the short term) sounds so hard. I’m having trouble not comparing our lives to others, who are raising cute kiddos and their parents, even grandparents are all alive. If we do have kids, they likely won’t even have grandparents. So how do you stay positive, avoid emotional exhaustion, continue making plans, and keep living when you have aging/sick parents?"
"Hi there. I was hoping to gain some insight and dealing with my father. My mom died a few years ago of cancer and that’s a whole other story but he exhibited some pretty awful behavior while she was sick that I up until only recently just made peace with and forgive him for. His new thing the past several months is constant complaining and hypochondriac type behavior. I am a nurse and it seems that every time I have a stretch of work for several days in a row he finds a reason to text or call while I am at work with a “crisis“. He will go to the ER for every little thing and I’m talking even a sinus infection or his eye is red. He is healthy and has no major health problems, all his preventative tests come out with a clean bill of health. 

My dad sees a counselor and also has services through the VA for counseling and psychiatry. His doctor started him on an anti-depressant which he threw away within a week. He claims he calls me to get my advice yet he will not follow any of it and acts very dramatic over the phone even defensive if I tell him that having allergies is not a reason to go to the ER. I’m not sure if there’s some greater issue here that is psychological or even cognitive. 

I get very mixed responses that range from oh your dad is just sad and seeking attention to perhaps your dad is a narcissist. All I know is his behavior is definitely driving me away and I’m not sure what else to do about it. I have no siblings and all our relatives live across the country so I am it. Today is Mother’s Day and my phone rang and it was him again and I thought maybe  he remembered it was Mother’s Day but nope he called up crying about allergies stating that he was going to go to the ER. I told him he really shouldn’t go to the ER for that but ultimately it’s his choice and I can’t control what he’s going to do. Luckily he decided against it. I have also come to realize that my mom coddled his every mood and behavior over the 50 years they were together and somehow it seems he thinks that’s what I’m here for now and I’m not having it."
"My mother has just been diagnosed with dementia, but we all knew it was coming. Before dementia, my mom had no filter and was incapable of talking quietly. That has just gotten much worse. 
I took her to the neighborhood pool the other day. She was trying to find the word for prissy, but was loudly saying “pussy” around a lot of people. 
I just have to laugh during those times."
"Well, the title of the post says it all!

My mom was hospitalized in Oct (not covid) and the experience accelerated her already declining executive function.

In January, I convinced her to move into an AL facility 15 minutes away from me. She is not happy there and is demanding to move back to her condo 2 hours away from where I live.

This is problematic for a few reasons.

1. half the contents of the condo are in boxes because she repeatedly indicated an interest in selling it, so I've spent the past five or so weekends there packing.
2. she has fallen 8 times - that I know of -  since her hospital discharge in October.
3. she is doing better every day, but I am skeptical of her ability to plan meals and grocery shop as she struggles to complete tasks that require long term planning.
4. even before this all happened, she was having issues with housekeeping. I'd come over and discover newspapers stacked on the stove, for example.

So moving back there alone, even with a CNA 3x a week, seems like a recipe for disaster.

I have repeatedly offered to move her into another AL, or even into a 55 and over community in my city and then hire CNAs to come 3x a week and drive her to the store and run errands. That way, I could still come over and help out when she needs help (which is frequent) and take her to doctor appointments (also frequent.) 

She refuses both and insists that in July, she's going back to her condo. I said fine, but I'm not helping you move. I can't organize such a thing, I can't unpack your condo after having spent the past five weekends going down there to pack it, and I can't go to your doctor appointments all the way down there - you'll be on your own. I have two jobs and I simply don't have the bandwidth to do this.

After I said that, she started acting out at her AL. She is refusing to clean her room. She is ordering OTC meds from Amazon even though she is on medication management, which would be fine if she could consistently keep them hidden from staff but she forgets to hide them and then they get confiscated and then she throws a fit.

My concern is that in July, she'll give her 30 days notice. Or alternatively, that she will just get herself kicked out...and then what?

Any advice her would be appreciated, not sure what to do....

Thanks and happy mother's day!"
"I think my mom (76, memory and cognitive issues) has been wetting her hair with diluted household cleaners. 

I’m visiting for the weekend and went into her bathroom to find her spritzing water bottle so I could tame my hair. I found one but it had a funny smell, like shower/tile cleaner. I asked her if she used it on her hair and she said yes. Putting all the clues together, I think this was the bottle they kept in their shower in their old house, and when they moved she thought it was her water sprayer. That was a year ago. 

I mean, she’s normal and still has her hair but YIKES."
"So I just found out that my dad is still communicating with my ex husband.  My ex husband was a narcissistic, manipulative liar (to put it nicely) and my dad has been texting him and him and my mom have been seeing my ex inviting him into my childhood home all behind my back, unbeknownst to me until today.  Nor has my ex ever mentioned it either.

Beyond that my dad was complaining about me to my ex husband in text messages. 

My parents are both elderly with health problems, but am I wrong - I feel totally betrayed and completely sold out by all three of them.  

I have not told them I know, but I’m beyond furious.  My parents have no relationship with my married sisters husband, so how is it justified they are sneaking around behind my back with my ex-husband?

Beyond feeling betrayed I am absolutely disgusted by all three of them.  My dad is giving his meals on wheels frozen dinners to my ex husband (which is a riot because my ex‘s dad has money and a country club membership and he gets nice country club meals from his family).

I don’t know if anyone can relate to this, and I’m trying to keep in perspective that my parents are not in great health condition but quite honestly I’m fed up with this.  In the past my dad was texting behind my back and I told him it bothered me and that I was uncomfortable sharing any personal information about me with my ex, abut it’s now escalated with them having in person visits and them welcoming my ex into their home.

Am I overreacting?  I would never do this to my kids, my loyalty is to my children but honestly I’m beyond angry, hurt and upset.  And also sick and tired of parents that no matter what you do for them it’s never enough and they’d pull you down into their hole if you’d just let them. 

I guess this is a rant, but do I have any right to be upset? How do I deal with parents I don’t trust at all to have my back or best interests at hand?  How would you handle this situation?"
"Thanks to those who replied to my previous post about moving my mom into assisted living.  I think things are getting better for her, but i'm not doing any better.  Im back at work now but i can barely function.  I have to spend an hour or two during the day to do stuff for her. For example yesterday she broke one of her back molars and she wanted me to find her a new dentist ( because her previous dentist was price gouging and saying she needed 15,000 worth of dental work).  So i found her a new dentist, did all the paper work, got her an appointment on Monday and scheduled the transport van from the AL community.  Today she told me she was up all night worrying because shes too scared to go to the dentist alone and afraid she'll mess up and also be stranded if she doesnt know how to call for the van to come get her. So i called her elder care companion to see if she could take her later in the week. 

 Every day is like this.  I am so tired.  And i feel like I've been through some kind of trauma getting her into AL.  Im not sleeping, my TMJ flaired up and im in constant pain. I cant focus at work. I cant think straight and ive developed all sorts of nervous mannerisms and weird facial movements.  Things are so bad that ive had passive thoughts of suicide.  You know like: it would be really wonderful if when i went to sleep tonight i just wouldnt wake up. But I cant do that because i am responsible for her affairs now. I'm considering going into a partial hospitalization program for mental healtth treatment and i have an assessment later this week to see if they will let me in the program. Because i just am not coping with all of this stress.  

I just dont know how to cope with  the responsibility of it all.  Is it this hard for everyone?  Why is this stressing me out so much? Maybe part of it is that i am the only family member left.  I have no  siblings, cousins aunts our uncles to help. How am i supposed to work and take care of everything.

I hate to take more medical leave for the partial hospitalization program, and i really need to take vacation and go down to see her and if they keep me off work for six more weeks, i will miss her birthday.

I just feel so trapped right now.

Has anyone else had this much mental trouble or stress when putting a parent in assisted living?  I really dont know what to do.  Its not like i can shut off my phone for two weeks because of things like this broken tooth.  Things will need tending to, but i dont know how to cope. My therapist thinks i need to go to partial hospitalization program.  Its like a step down from inpatient mental health and is only from 9 to three everyday so i could still get physical thetapy for my jaw pain.  

This would be so much easier if she would move here but i promised her she could stay in her home town of 60 years. 

I really dont undetstand why this is impacting me so hard. And I really dont know what to do next.

Sorry for rambling.   I would really appreciate some advice from someone who has done this."
"Admins, as grief and loss are part of caregiving too, I hope you will permit me to post this update as many people followed my story last year and I would like to offer some thoughts and experiences following the deaths of my parents. 

Hello, everyone, you used to know me as the guy who moved his parents, both of whom passed away last year.

I so very much appreciated everyone's kindness and I thought maybe some would be interested in knowing what has happened since then, so here goes:

We had my mom's service in February when my brother could come from out of state. Things went fine; as we did with our father's service, we ""tag-teamed"" the eulogy together and it was very well received and was a good tribute to our mom. She and Dad are now side by side at Willamette National Cemetery in Portland. I haven't been there but I'm not much of a cemetery person.

In the first few months of this year a lot of time was spent settling the estate and getting everything done. My health seemed not to be that great. Nothing major, just a very bad (non-COVID) cold, a foot injury (somehow I pulled a ligament in my heel and it was painful to walk; I had to use a cane!) and then some eruptions of gout on top of that. Additionally, like so many, I had gained weight during the COVID lockdown(s) and now clear of parent-related responsibilities I decided it was time to lose 15 to 20 pounds, which I did. 

I was cruising along. And then a couple of weeks ago something both wonderful and terrible happened. One night, in a dream so realistic I still don't really understand how it could not have been real, everything was as it was years ago. My grandson, now 20, was with me and in the dream he was three years old, so that gave me a date context, it was 2004, and I was with him back in my parents' house. I dreamed I woke up in my old bedroom, got out of bed, went down the hall to the living room, and there were my parents, looking just as they had looked then. They would have been 74 that year. I couldn't believe my eyes and was very confused to see them alive. I said, ""Is it really you? How can this be??"" I threw my arms around them, first my dad, and then my mom. They appeared amused by my reaction to seeing them. The dream was so real that I could feel what it used to feel like to hug them, that I could hear their voices, even smell the same scents that I had always smelled before. I checked again; this was definitely real, and certainly not a dream, I thought. That meant the other set of memories was the real dream! I was elated!

So, still dreaming, I told my parents about my very bad dream. ""You wouldn't believe the horrible dream I had. You were very old, and you kept falling, and we had to move you to assisted living, and I had to sell this house, and you died! Oh, I'm so glad that didn't really happen!"" 

And then I woke up, and for a few seconds, I was in a fog as I tried to piece together which reality was real and which was the dream. Then the reality struck and it was just like losing them freshly, all over again, and that's why I say it was wonderful, because for a little while I had them back, and it was terrible, because again they were gone. It has left me shaken, and while I cherished ""hugging"" and ""speaking to"" them one more time, the wounds of loss have been re-opened and the new and fresh grief is almost as intense as the original. I hope and pray nothing like that ever happens again. It's time for the dead to stay dead and for life to go on.

Tomorrow will be my first Mother's Day without my mom. My wife's mom still survives, and yesterday we went to a gathering at the memory care unit where she lives. It was very nice, with lunch and a talented fellow playing old songs on the piano. I was doing fine until one of the activities directors stood up and did a reading about mothers. Slowly a tear found its way down my cheek as I reflected about my own mother and losing her. And then several more, but I discretely hid that from my table mates.

Yes, this Mother's Day is going to be tough on me. Oh sure, I have memories and photos and the like, but I'm still at the stage where all of that just makes me sad. Time passes and heals, but that amazing but cruel dream really set me back in my healing. 

For all of you who are caring for your moms right now, I know some have it really hard, but if you can find it in your hearts and through your exhaustion to be glad they're still with you I hope you can do that. 

As for me, I always thought, ""How I wish I could have one more day, one more hug."" Well, that was granted to me, in a way, and it was both immensely joyful and emotionally shattering. Honestly, I hope it never happens again. 

To those to whom it applies, Happy Mother's Day."
"My father had a heart attack a year ago and 2 strokes 3 months ago. He kept himself in shape so he was recovering fairly quickly. Unfortunately, things took a turn for the worse this last week and he has become extremely paranoid, hearing voices, gets confused easily and now has started accusing my mother of cheating on him ( they have been married 50 yrs).  He told her he hears the other man's voice in the house even though nobody is there... My mother also being a senior, is already taking care of him full time due to the heart attack and the two strokes and now this. Are there any senior resources she or our family can contact in or around Largo fl for help."
"My dad would hate me forever if I did this. He's a proud man, but his body is failing and I'm afraid of what's next. He can't keep living like this for the short time he has left.

My (31F) dad (69M) and I are not close. He thinks we are, and he's always wanted us to be, but he was emotionally abusive throughout most of my childhood and teenage years. He's an alcoholic of more than 40 years. He's in heart and liver failure and can barely breathe (literally is almost physically incapable of going to a grocery store) due to ascites. He lays on the couch, which is also his bed, all day every day watching Nexflix with my 14yo dog whom is his only companion. He has 4 children and 1 grandchild, none of which visit him really except on holidays. Even then we don't stay but a few hours. It's a pretty sad situation, but he refuses to change his behaviors or his drinking, so I also don't visit often because boundaries. 

He's hard to tolerate. He hardly ever has anything positive to say and every conversation is basically the same (encephalopathy). Calling my mother names and how terrible she is, his bad health and being in pain (doesn't take anything for that but Tylenol), how dirty his house it, his grown up yard, etc. etc. Sometimes he's in a better mood but it isn't that often. 

He will not even entertain the thought of me hiring help to clean his house.  He will not go to the doctor often (to be fair he has kind of a shitty doctor anyway and will not see a different one). He will not follow a low sodium diet and tbh I don't know that he regularly takes his meds. He will not wear adult diapers (prostrate issues). He will not use a walker (severe fall risk, he could have died several times). On more than one occasion I've gone to visit him (I live 2.5hrs away) and his house... y'all. It's the worst it's ever been I think. He wants to blame it on falling down the basement steps recently and he can hardly move, but this has been going on for waaaaay longer than a week.

The first time was his bathroom. He didn't make it to the toilet in time on several occasions and just never cleaned it up and the smell absolutely permeated the rest of the house. He FINALLY let me do it without getting upset but with constant badgering. He had fallen and broken the glass shower door (1st hospital stay) so there was also blood everywhere (blood thinners). There's also blood all over the carpet from multiple falls. I've given up on cleaning that. I won't even get to the small mountains of dog hair.

The second time was the piss couch. He'd brought home some portable urinals from one of his hospital stays, but he wouldn't empty them and eventually threw them out. He would urinate or drip urine in his sleep on his couch with no more cover than a bath towel, which he would hardly ever change. I came to visit and the house smelled like an Alabama port-a-potty in July. I could hardly breathe and he had the nerve to ask me if I knew why my brother never brought his 3yo son to visit his grandpa. He finally let me drag it to the road and replace it, this time with a waterproof cover. 2 of them.

The third time was two days ago. I went to visit him. When I walked into his house, the smell... rotten garbage this time. It was bad but not as bad as the couch. The kitchen was an absolute dumpster. Moldy rotten food in pots and pans, I think every dish he had was dirty including the dog's water bowl. Leftovers of 3 roasted chickens covered in paper towels. Fruit flies EVERYWHERE and fly strips hund above the sink full of dirty dishes. 4 bags of garbage tied up just sitting in the pantry and I stuffed 3 more in the outside trashcan. Month-old open cans of dog food on the counter covered in foil (on top of all the mail and newspapers). Food spilled on the floor. It was horrific. The dishes alone took me over 2 hours. 

I don't know what to do besides bite the bullet and use some PTO to clean his house over the course of several days. He won't let me help him and he won't help himself. To separate him from that dog would take an act of God and I don't want to do that to him, but I'm afraid of him and the dog living like this. I know he's embarrassed because his whole life he's been a pretty clean man, but doesn't something have to give at some point? I've tried communicating these worries but he won't hear me.

Any advice or empathy would be appreciated. I know I'll be planning a funeral service soon and I just want to try and keep him in his own home until that happens without doing more damage to my mental health by spending too much time there.

Thanks in advance for any replies <3 

EDIT: parents are long divorced. My dad lives alone with the dog. We cannot afford assisted living. I don't know how much Medicare will cover because he won't give me his Medicare details for me to check on it."
"So I was wondering it anyone on this reddit had any advice that could help with this,  my father 62 underwent chemotherapy for throat cancer 2 years ago and it was much worse than either of us thought it would be,  he lost over 50 pounds had severe brain fog at one point could only eat potato salad once a day for months.   he did eventually recover but I am worried about the after effects long term with him mentally and physically, along with myself as caregiver the rest of the family has been very unsupportive to the point of my sister making 0 effort to even visit him or bring his grandchild over.  Now back to the concern about why I am afraid he is secretly dying and not telling me,  he was never forward with me about the cancer to the point of where I wasn't told until right before chemotherapy treatment began and even then it was told it would be ""minor chemo"" nothing serious and didn't realize how foolish I was to believe that until he had dropped 40 pounds in just a few months and could only watch TV and look up at me and try to force a smile.....  he has recovered well since then we made sure to really focus on proper nutrition and physical therapy but in the last few months I've noticed a certain decline like slurring his words lack of balance  his eyes are becoming very red with strange blinking patterns at first just 2 of his teeth fell out but I'm worried it has been several more since then and he won't admit it or seek dental care,  our family business is pet boarding/cremation and sometimes can be exposed to extremely unsanitary conditions and he claims repeatedly to be perfectly fine but made mention today he is concerned he may have been exposed to turbculosis I know the best thing is to urge him to seek medical care but I am very unsure what to do when he is hiding symptoms and swearing that he is fine and that I am not actually seeing these symptoms what if he lies to the doctor too?  I know he is trying to avoid upsetting me if he feels his health is declining but i find it even more upsetting if I am not able to prepare properly for his potential death I was wondering if anyone on this thread has any had any similar experiences and how it ended ?"
"What made you realize the roles in your parent, child relationship flipped?"
"My mom has been struggling for awhile now both financially and cognitively and I've been trying my best to help her these past two years.I moved in with her,  became her secretary, renovated her home both hands on and with a contractor. I found a specialist for the PVM white matter disease and traveled to appointments with her etc. etc. etc.

 Recently an aunt offered to take her in and give her a nice retirement in a spare room in her home down south. After a trial run my aunt decided my mom's disabilities are too much for her, and decided it would be best for both herself and my mother to part ways. The only issue is the fallout from how she decided to handle it.

Rather than owning up to a change of heart and helping my mom network with other family members for assistance she has launched a vendetta against me for suggesting that they pair up in her home in the first place. She has convinced my mother that she has already overcome her disabilities and is good to go back on her own (this is not a possibility with cognitive impairment caused by severe white matter disease as it is progressive and irreversible) She has convinced my mom that I'm angling for her to go into a low rent nursing home, and I'm not to be trusted (entirely not the case) She has convinced my mom to go low contact with me and only communicate one way via text and only for completely unavoidable communications, like how to log into her tax transcripts. She has convinced my mom to try to rent an apartment, something she can not afford till after her home is sold, and would be financially devestating on her fixed income (juggling a mortgage and rent on $585.00 a month social security) How? Predatory loans? 

Into the vaccuum of communication between my mother and myself, steps my deadbeat brother, who is now re-enforcing my aunt's advice for mom to take on an apartment. He tells me it's so he can move into her house to help fix it to be sold. Funny thing is, I have been doing that  myself the past two years and he has completely refused to come help out. Oh, and the kicker is, he tells me, mom wants me gone, out of the picture, back to the west coast, and ""all communication with mom should take place through him from now on.""

WTAF..."
"I feel that my parents have stopped living. They're not yet 70. My parents have never been very passionate about living and ever since the pandemic struck, they've pretty much locked themselves in the house. That's two full years that they haven't stepped out of the house - seriously. I'm almost 30 and I still live with them. I run essential errands for them and that's about all my parents (my mother, mainly) allow in terms of engaging with the outside world. They're afraid that I'll bring home the virus and kill them. Both are unvaccinated and don't want to get vaccinated. I have to wear a mask every time I go out no matter where I go even though 99% of the people around me are unmasked. My few friends have stopped calling on me. Understandably, they've drifted away seeing how ""unavailable"" I am. Luckily my boyfriend has stuck with me and has been a good source of support. We aren't able to move in together yet, for many reasons. I have a job but don't make enough to get a place of my own and probably won't be able to for another 2-3 years. My work allows me to work from home and these last two years spending 24/7 with my parents has driven and is continuing to drive me crazy. There's never anything fun happening at home. My parents just pass their days sitting around, doing nothing, other than my mom just doing basic cooking and cleaning. A little of me dies with each passing day. I feel that I'm too young to live this kind of life."
Mom is 96. Frail but doing pretty well.
"My mother, who is single, on disability, and in her 60's called me last night with ""something very important"" to diacuss. She has been catfished and scammed out of money more than once in her past, and now has really gotten herself in trouble. She has amassed a sizeable debt from being scammed, and her solution was to sell her mobile home she has in a senior community. Apparently the deal has begun to go through, and the sizeable down payment money has exchanged hands and is now spent on the person who scammed her, and the rest went to pay down her debt. My mom is now homeless and flat broke. 
It is obvious she cannot take care of herself, and needs to be in a supervised setting like an assisted living home. She doesn't want to go, she will just find a ""safe space"" and live in her car. 
Nobody in our family can take her in as a permanent solution. 
Has anybody ever had to get guardianship of their parent and had to put them somewhere for their own wellbeing?
I feel guilty for not allowing her to live with me, but it would really hurt my marriage. Before anybody has something negative to say, my mom was a contributing factor of my first marriage failing, as she is a user of people, and I am not willing to allow the same thing to happen again.
How hard is it to get her in somewhere that is state assisted as she now has nothing?"
"My Dad is  strange character.  Has gone through life yelling and bullying, but otherwise generally trying to do the right thing.   He's always looked out for those around him.        At this point though he's mostly abandoned, as he's hard to be around.   

He's also  totally not self aware, and sees himself as a do gooder who has been taken advantage of.

Growing up as his son was hard, as I was always in the line of fire of his aggression, but he was also always supportive and created opportunities for me.

In time I came to uncover that he likely suffered sexual abuse as a young teen, at a teacher's hands.    I have a lot of compassion for this.    I don't think he's a bad guy, just an angry guy.

He doesn't have much interest in talking to me, as I don't have much patience for his yelling.

Mom is dead, as are most other family members.   He's basically alone, and sick, and probably not much time left.      

I'm considering sending him a message thanking him for the good times (there were some), his support (there was lots).     I honestly want the old guy to go out feeling a appreciated.   I also don't want the guilt of not sending such a message.     But it also feels strange, as he's completely not in touch with his feelings, and we've never really connected emotionally.

Just processing here.  Would like to hear from others."
"My parents are old. One of the parent recently  had an incident  and we are tracking his Blood pressure,  Temperature, Sugar, What he ate during meals and time of BP, Sugar test, Meal. He also needs insulin if sugar is high. I want to track the time of these events. 

Should I make separate sheets(excel or Pdf) ? or 1 big sheet. I am not good at data representation.  I tried making in excel and getting a print of that but unable to understand  how many rows and columns can I make. I would love if anyone has done the same and can share some templates. Thanks."
"My dad just turned 75, and his body is started to fail him. He is not as mobile as he once was and his eyesight is slowly getting worse. He can't really drive and can only read for short spurts at a time. His mind is still sharp, but I think he's losing motivation for living in general. He listens to audiobooks and watches some TV.

I think he struggles with depression and has said he has no more goals in life to reach. He's already on antidepressants, and he is fairly resistant to more help.

 Does anyone have any ideas that I can introduce him to? I want him to enjoy his life and stop living like he's waiting to die. 

A little background... my mom is still alive but has serious mobility issues. They live on the other side of the country, but we're trying to get them to move near us. My husband and I have a 2 month old baby. 

Thanks for any help."
"I’ve (45f) been trying to help my Dad (72m) with his finances and kept seeing what looked like a payday loan. After repeated denials, found out it is a loan. Originally was for $675 at 556.68% interest.  OMFG. After 10 months of payments, he’ll pay over $3,000. For a $675 loan. How is that legal? He’s going to call legal services but he signed the agreement, I don’t think there’s a way out of it. Also, fuck Max Lend and predatory lenders in general."
"Hello. I am not sure where to post this situation, but hoping for some guidance.

My Mom (71) passed away suddenly 3 weeks ago leaving my father (72) behind. He is retired and was taking care of her. My disabled brother (50) lived iwth them and passed away a few months back. I managed their household bills, and my mother managed the medical.

After my brother's passing I bought a small home near by and moved my folks into it to take home bills out of the equation for them and I cover all living expenses, but she managed their healthcare. After her death I discovered that she let her supplemental insurance (medicare D coverage I believe) expire (aetna), as well as my father's (Hummana).

Hummana (my father's) sent a bill for $900 for back dues from 2021. It ended coverage on 3/31/22. They say that due to circumstances, I I pay the 900 past due, I can get my father back under coverage and resume current payments at like $75 a month. I asked how much they covered last year and it was to the tune of $200.

Do I need to get this for my father? Or can I leave it lapsed, not waste giving up the backpay and use something like GoodRX moving forward for him? He takes 6 prescriptions, but nothing seems too insanely expensive.

Sorry, I'm so unfamiliar with all of this and just lost."
"Long story short (ish,) my very outdoorsy father had a heart attack and was found to be in heart failure 2 weeks ago. He got discharged to my house as he has hoarded himself out of his own. Its only been a week and I'm exhausted, anxious, guilty...I don't even know. He's a hoarder who is bored so always wants to be buying stuff. I do my best to prevent about 90% of what he wants to buy but there's still stuff starting to accumulate to the point I can't use the back seat of my car. I'm a very introverted person who needs to spend at least some time at home to decompress. He constantly needs to be moving, talking, doing and as long as he's awake he wants to be entertained. My house is a mess, my yard is a mess, my mind is a mess. He doesn't have insurance so will probably lose everything. I've tried to get financial aid/Medicaid but he won't give me any tax or bank information.
 &nbsp; 

Sorry for the rant/trauma dump I just need to share. I have contacted my own doctor because I'm now having chest pain and palpitations due to the anxiety but they couldn't see me for 4 weeks.    
&nbsp;

*Edit: I did tell him today that I needed to just stay home for a day. He went to hang out with a friend mushroom hunting and just called me that he wasn't sure where the car was or his ""friend."" bleh"
"I think my sister is financially abusing my mom. She did this to my parents years ago too. I'm trying to find ways of protecting her, but the whole process is so stressful.

If anyone's willing to share their stories of similar happening to them, please help me feel not so alone."
"Apologies for the long post. (And any formatting issues as I am on mobile.)

My father has been in inpatient rehab for approximately 10 days. We received notice of Medicare noncoverage today. This is a surprise, as last Thursday we had a care plan meeting with PT and social services and they noted that he has functionally improved but once we received notice, I asked about the record and PT noted in the patient record that he has “plateaued.”
I am obviously appealing. He went from nonambulatory whatsoever (not even able to lift himself) to walking 125 ft unassisted as of 6 days in rehab (as of our meeting date). From what I can determine as a layperson, this is almost independent-level mobility (FIM states 150ft I believe). 
I am considering the following points in my appeal:

-mobility improvement (as noted above)

-the need for additional therapy for mobility “independence”; trying to get to 150ft

-the discrepancy between what they verbally told me and the written record

-the fact that he had a catheter until Thursday (4/28) which I would guess would limit his ability to fully participate in PT

-the lack of discharge planning/assistance for next stages (he was not even involved in the meeting we had)

-I’m not sure if this is relevant or an issue, but they did not provide us a copy of the notice. They just had him sign it (without me present) so I haven’t even seen it 

Any other areas I should pursue in the appeal? I am calling his PCP and Neuro first thing in the morning, but I am not sure they’ll be able to provide support in time with the tight timeline (due tomorrow as his therapy ends on Thursday, 5/5 with a discharge Friday, 5/6). Can these be amended once received?

Additional advice needed: They are concerned with his cognitive abilities for independent living. 
We’ve toured several assisted living facilities, looking at (hopefully) a Medicaid waiver but he has extremely limited assets and we can only supplement so much. 
They haven’t provided a care plan for home discharge other than stating he needs full-time care (my husband and I both work full-time outside of the home during the day so that is impossible and private pay home care will be just as expensive - if not more than - AL). 

I feel stuck. Any advice from those who may have been there?
We’re in Florida (so it feels even more dire with how the state runs it seems from my limited experience). 

Thanks to anyone who has some insight!

A few notes: we have an elder law attorney (used for POA etc) but he doesn’t handle Medicaid filing (or at least, he prices way too high and recommended *not* using himself for that); I have a couple of additional consults upcoming related to Medicaid help but this short deadline has kind of torpedoed everything we had in the works.

(Edit: added a bullet point I forgot initially)"
"My dad has a revocable trust set up. He is the trustee and I am the POA. Since September my dad has been scammed out of around $300,000 in a “business deal” with some overseas people because he believes he will soon come into $7-8 million of gold. He got roped into this from a fake lady on a dating profile, who is now his “business partner”. All he has to do now is just give a 30k insurance payment, a $50k customs payment, and on and on….. and then soon he will get the millions. 🙄 

These leeches are bleeding him dry. He’s draining his 401k, and his home equity is probably next. I’ve already filed FBI, FTC and local county police reports. I spoke with a lawyer and the lawyer said it is pretty much a crapshoot- in order for me to manage his financial affairs and put a stop to this as the POA, I will have to file a lawsuit and my dad will have to be declared incapacitated, because my dad is not willing to voluntary relinquish control at this time. the lawyer said he just had a very similar case that did not go the family’s way (the lady was sending hundreds of thousands to someone she met on Words with Friends and was deemed to have full capacity)

Im not sure my dad is incapacitated, I think he is making bad choices but although for all I know it could be dementia or a brain tumor or something….

I want him to go to an elder law attorney with me. How would everyone recommend I approach the conversation? My dad is the most stubborn man alive. 

I’m worried it’s going to come down to some sort of ultimatum, like either we go together to visit an attorney to discuss a way forward, or I cannot help you moving forward and I wont be making social visits and calls, and if you need medical care you can just dial 911 and they will come for you.  (Kind of like intervention style, me setting my boundaries and clear choices/consequences). Does anyone have other suggestions? What else can I do?

I don’t want or plan to inherit anything. This is not about me. Dad is NOT in good physical health and his future freedom is rapidly declining,  from a future where he could age in place in his home with private in-home care, to a future in a shared room in a nursing home due to lack of funds. I don’t want that for him. His dad ended up in a nursing home and I’m sure he does not want to go that route."
"Hi there I will try and make make this Brief, my 75 year old father continues to try and do things that mentally he can no longer do, as well as physically.  It ranges from yard work, trying to fix things on the car, house hold appliances etc.  when I try to talk to him about it he get infuriated, but the after math many times is worse.  He set off the car alarm somehow repeatedly for over 30 mins while trying to fix something.  Anyways does any have any recommendations to get him to ease away from tasks he no longer is mentally capable of doing?"
"My mom has moderate-to-advanced dementia and moved to a private, for-profit retirement home after a fall landed her in hospital. Fortunately she saved a lot over her life so we could choose any home but the great places all have waiting lists. So we ended up in an expensive home that's not well run, with too little staff. Little by little, the place is eating my soul.

I see so much that sucks, like they wheel all the helpless/non-verbal people out to the nurse's station and just leave them there all day in their wheelchairs, no music or activities. They are not able to talk to each other. No matter how much I ask, they always have a reason they need to put my mom there. I pay for hourly checks in her room, where she could be watching a movie with the cat on her lap. But I don't have a lot of confidence they are being done. We also pay $1k a month for continence care but they don't have her on a bathroom schedule and let her sit in wet diapers. Some have suggested we install a camera but I don't know. Also, the staff always asks me to do things that I don't think they would ask of a man. Things we pay for. I know they have it hard but I'm starting to get resentful.

Any advice or commiseration would be appreciated!"
"I'm sorry for leaning on y'all so heavily... I simply don't have anyone in my life who has gone through this yet. 

I mentioned before that my parents hid the severity of moms health problems, specifically COPD. So when I arrived a few weeks ago to deal with my dad's death, I was shocked. As I've read and spoken with her, I'm a bit appalled at the lack of care and support she's been given. 

She has two different inhalers she uses twice a day, plus a rescue inhaler. She's on oxygen 24/7 and can barely walk across a room before needing to sit. She barely eats, doesn't exercise in any way, and hasn't seen her pulmonologist in person since Feb 2020... 

I've gotten her on board with the idea of assisted living. In fact, I think she finds the idea a bit of a relief. But my fear is that we move her into one and then her condition deteriorates and she has to move again... I know a move like that can trigger a spiral, even if they're on board.

Everything I'm reading about COPD is saying the next steps for someone in her condition is basically end of life care. So I've pushed for a pulmonary appointment next week, but no one can really give me the knowledge of what is the better choice if she really is on the cusp of different levels of care. Anything you can share would be so very welcomed."
"She's on 12-13L of oxygen and highly unlikely to be weaned. 
She has pneumonia and a thoracic compression fracture that's causing further restrictions with her breathing.
I spoke to the lady who called to schedule the appt and I asked is this for hospice as well. She said not necessarily but it does depend on what my mom chooses- if she chooses LTAC, then I suppose it's palliative.. idk what I'm asking- maybe others experience with this might help."
"TW: Biohazards

We moved in with my FIL late last year, a few months after MIL died. We  needed temporary housing while we look for a house and my FIL needed  company.

In lieu of rent, we're helping clean up, de-clutter, maintain, and repair the place.

We hired a cleaning service, and they recently revolted a little bit and I had to smooth some feathers. Their biggest complaint was FIL's bathroom (we don't use the same ones). They used the word ""horrendous"" during the initial deep clean. FIL's the kind of person who wonders why you're vacuuming the floors on Thursday, after all the Cleaning People Will Be Here Monday. To say he's a bit of a slob is an understatement. I have to wipe down the counters and vac the kitchen floor daily, especially where he eats. Wiping down the refrigerator handles, cabinets (no hardware) happens multiple times per week. He has seemingly zero mindfulness of what's on  his hands while he's eating.

However,  his bathroom...today we discovered that their complaints from last week are right - it is next level filthy. There is a literal trail of spatter - looks like blood mixed with feces between the toilet, the  sink, and the door. We used a blacklight on the carpet and yes, he's tracking it into his bedroom!

The blood is reddish, not tarry/black.

I replaced his toilet seat a few months ago and while there was some urine to clean up, it was *not* like this.

So I have two problems, at the very least, and need some advice.

1. How do I breach the fact that this is completely unacceptable from a cleanliness perspective?
2. We strongly suspect he's hiding a health problem. He's demonstrated some selective hearing when it came to MIL's condition - he painted a rosier picture than it was, especially when it came to ""what the doctors said."" He's had kidney cancer and prostate cancer runs in the family.

I'm at a loss."
"A family wedding has come up that has presented my dad with another “probably the last time” opportunity to visit his sister. My mom can’t travel anymore so I offered to take care of her so he could go. 

Dad’s in good shape, needs to lose weight but is regularly exercising, t2 diabetic, on several blood pressure controllers. Mentally, he can handle traveling, but he tends to power through discomfort (like not drinking water so he doesn’t have to use the bathroom, or not paying for airplane/airport food) which worked when he was younger, but lately this approach has caused more problems  than fixes. 

Anyway, I am a bit worried about the physical effects of a flight, and I will ask my cousins to keep an eye on him, but does anyone have good, gentle exercises for mid- and post-flight health, or something else we should do in case he does experience clotting, etc.?"
Has anyone filled this out when you have guardianship? It's clearly written as if the person is apply themselves. I want to get all the mail sent to this service to be scanned.
"My great-grandmother is 87 now, only mobile with a walker, and potentially has dementia(my family won’t get her tested). I go over a few times a week, making dinner and doing chores best I can, but I can’t be there all the time.

It’s hard for her to focus on things like TV or puzzles, she doesn’t pay attention for that long. She has always been obsessive, but it has been much worse in the last few months. Recently she has been obsessing over her hygiene, constantly convinced her pants are wet or that she smells, causing her to go through far too many pads and hygiene wipes than she should, with other medical repercussions from alcohol wipes or constant over-attention than I can’t imagine.

What might you do to give her something better to occupy her brain? She used to feed the dog excessively, and before that when she was more mobile she over-watered all of her plants. Is there something she can do in short but frequent intervals to stop her from giving too much attention to the wrong things?"
"Around ten years ago my dad suffered a series of heart attacks and strokes. His strokes completely changed him from the whip-smart, highly successful man he was to someone who struggled with aphasia and his emotions and could no longer work. Following that he developed a kidney disease that put him in the hospital a few times and decimated his health even more. 

Thankfully he has managed the last few years without any more stays in hospital, but he continues to decline cognitively. My brother, sister and I all believe he should not be driving and will not allow him to drive with us or our kids in the car. We think he is a danger on the road but he disagrees and so does my mother. Even his doctor disagrees, but his doctor sees him maybe 5 minutes every few months and is an old dinosaur who throws prescription pain killers like candy at a children's party.

Anytime my mom goes away to visit family my dad makes the stupidest decisions. He decides to change the pot light lightbulbs in the kitchen and ends up falling off of a chair. He takes their 60 lb dog for a walk when it's icy out and ends up falling. The neighbour had to rescue him twice -- once he fell and struck his head on a brick and bled everywhere and another time he fell hard onto his knees on the ice and could not get up again. 

Now he is getting more confused than usual. My mom went to visit my sister for two weeks and told him when she would be back and was in contact with him every few days and he was still confused thinking she should have been back days before she was. Also he can't remember the names for places and got mad at me because I made plans to visit him on a Saturday and he thought it was a Sunday.

I talked with my brother about this and then I talked to my mom about it. She just laughed and brushed it off. Is there anything I can do? I worry about what could happen and I hate the thought of my dad driving and hurting someone else."
"Are the following ok?  I think so, but wanted to check.

First, dropping by an elderly person’s home, unannounced, often to drop off a gift or say hello. 

I am middle-aged and would never drop by a friend’s home without scheduling it in advance, but people drop by my father’s house (he is an elderly, frail widower) without notice, often to drop off a gift or say hi.  

That seems fine, right- so I can drop by other elderly people’s homes without notice, as long as it’s a quick visit and I don’t expect to be invited in?

Second, when expressing sympathy, I thought that you weren’t supposed to raise your own feelings in a similar situation.  

My mother died, and people tell me, “It’s hard to lose a mom.”  Well, it’s part of life and we have to deal with it, but saying, “it’s hard to lose a” mom/dad/sister/brother/etc is  ok?

Finally, lots of people drop by to check on my elderly, widower father.  

Is it appropriate for me to send them thank-you notes on his behalf, and for me to thank them? I am very grateful for them, although he may not care.

Thanks."
"It’s a long story. But, my dad has been back and forth between the hospital and rehab/nursing home (for months now). I feel like my mom is living in denial and jumping through hoops to keep him alive. At one point, a doctor told her they could put him in a room and let him peacefully pass and she said “no”. I could go into more details, but she’s not honest with him about his condition (he has dementia among other things) because she doesn’t want him to stop fighting or give up hope. She completely admitted it to me. There’s not much I can do - I’m basically powerless. I’ve told her gently a couple of times to think about his quality of life (which is very poor right now). Has anyone gone through this at all? His current hospital stay has been extended twice now, so I’m hoping he will pass, but there are no guarantees."
"LSS, mom has went downhill over the last few years. She's been wanting to get her will redone(getting bad people out) and while she was competent for the initial writeup, she hasn't been since for the final signing. 

Do you believe any amount of interaction can help?

I'm in another state trying to tie up her affairs. Do you think spending a week+ visiting her in the nursing home every day could make her have a pattern to remember enough?

I feel horrible asking because it feels selfish, I honestly don't care about the money, but the 2 out of the 3 listed don't deserve it (understatement) and she's felt the same for many years. Both are because their parents are gone, 1 stole a bunch from my parents, the other well, nobody knows about him anymore.

Some days she thinks her parents are alive or she's spent too much time in the kitchen and is exhausted. She has to be legally competent when she signs and I wonder if there is anything I can do to help."
"My mother is 64 years old and is in reasonably good health and pretty independent, although she does have mental health challenges that require her to live in assisted living (primarily for medication administration). She is lonely and wants a dog. I want to help her, but I don’t think a puppy is a good idea because of the need to house train it. We visited a shelter today but it seemed like some of them had varying levels of abuse, background. 

I think she would do well with a dog that is older, laid back, and house trained. She could take care of one that is a good fit and sort of a known quantity. Do you know of any groups to contact that could facilitate dog adoption for older people or with mental health challenges?"
"Hi there. So my siblings and I have been using Dad's savings, pension and social security to pay for extra care in the home. I was unable to find any long term care (LTC) policy in his papers, so here we are. No problem.

Then a cousin called and swears that our late mother (Dad's wife) had told her that they had a LTC Policy. Somewhere. From some company or program.

Well. Does anyone here have a clue how to find out if they have such a policy? I sure didn't see any evidence at the house. I would hate to find it after he passes. 

Thank you!"
"My parents are currently in the process of writing their wills. They do not have any significant assets other than their house which they have completely paid off. Their lawyer recommended them put the deed into a trust so that when one of them passes away it won’t end up in probate. 

I will be the only one to inherit their estate when both of them passes away. 

My question is would it be better for them to just transfer the deed into my name? Our worries are that one of them might catastrophically end up in a nursing home, hospital, etc and then end up losing the house because of medical debt. Any advice would be appreciated."
I see people get frustrated and I went through it as well...with a parent with memory or cognitive issues. maybe they keep asking the same questions or get mad at you for something you explained 20 minutes ago. But thats not their fault. they are doing what they can with the abilities they have. We cant really expect them to behave what we consider a normal when they have limiting issues. It is extremely upsetting to point these things out to them. just relax and play along. Answer or explain again.  All you're going to do is make them mad and/or hurt their feelings. For many elderly its very scary to realize they have issues like this. So please dont be cruel. be compassionate to this person you love. one day they will be gone. What do you want your last memories to be? Dont build regrets.
"Anyone else come to a point where they wish their parents would quit aging, just so you can catch up to them? I feel like I’m at that point where we can relate on so many things and I want it to last.."
"So I will try to make this quick. I need help and feel massively guilty for even considering this. My husband(37) and I (35) are about to go through a divorce. It means selling our house. My mother (65) lives with us now and so I have to decide whether I'll move her into my new apartment with me or help subsidize her living on her own.

I feel so guilty for even thinking of this... As many may have guessed I am the oldest child of an immigrant family and 1st generation American...so I feel obligated to take care of my mother plus when I moved her in with my husband I told her I would make sure she was good and had a place to stay always. And even though me considering moving her to an apartment on her own, is not breaking my promise, I still feel horrible and selfish.

Now, the reason I want to live alone post-divorce is that I'm getting a divorce because I've realized that I spent my whole life trying to be the ""perfect"" immigrant child-- doing eveything as you're told regardless of how you feel or what you want... I realized that I did it also in my marriage by being with someone who never valued me or what I brought to the relationship and was happy to have me do all the hard work and make all the money and he just chill and hang on for the ride. Never knew I deserved better or could choose what I actually wanted in a partner until now... So I want to live alone to find myself and I'm afraid that living with my mom I won't be able to find me outside of her opinions of what I should or should not being doing with my life...

Now, my mom is pretty healthy for her age other than the typical bad knees, etc of older age. She doesn't need any type of nursing care or anything. She doesn't drive anymore so my sister and I take her to her appts. She was just living with us more so that I could subsidize her expenses and a little bit for company since she has a habit of kinda hermiting herself away from the world. If I do this, I would keep doing eveything for/with her but live together. 

Am I wrong to ask her to live separately?"
"Mom has been declining over the past two years and she fell and broke her hip.  She had surgery and was then sent to rehab.  It seemed like the time for assisted living. I was home recovering fron surgery and I live 1200 miles away.  Mom has an elder companion she relies on for shopping and errands.  But mom is not eating right, she sleeps 20 hours a day and never bothers to get dressed most days. Shescalso messing up her finances.  I wanted her to be someplace safe.  I found wonderful place for her and worked non stop for two and a half weeks, with her permission of course. I moved heaven and earth to make this happen. My husband drove 1200 miles to help her get settled since I could not travel.  

So, my husband and her elder care companion arranged the room and brought flowers to make it special.

My mom complains to anyone who will listen, that she hates her room, she refuses to go to dining room for meals which is costing 15 dollars a day extra, she rebuffs every effort by heer ""peer ambasador"" to join fir dinner or activities, and will not cooperate with the staff who are trying to help her.  I am at my wits end, i am exhausted from the non stop work of arranging all this, and  i have not one shred of a coping skill left. 

She hates me for not letting her live in her house. But thete is no way she can navigate a wheel chair in her tiny house, even if we could manage to get her up the stairs.since she cannot put weight on the leg yet.

I just feel so rejected. I worked my ass off whike recovering from surgery to arrange this for her in a crisis situation, because i wanted the best for her.  

I get that this is probably the most difficuly transition of her life, and Im heartbroken that i couldnt be there in person to help her but I did the absolute best I could. And its not good enough and she's not grateful in the least.  

Should I try home care instead? Idk what that even is.  
Honestly im so upset that i want to resign my PoA and let her become a ward of the state, because she has no other family.  Because I am so emotionally drained right now there is no way i have the wherewithal to arrange something else for her.

What would happen if I resigned as PoA.  
Should i get home care and just let her continue to stew in her miserable isolated life that she evidently prefers.

Idk, i cant do any more. And now i dont want to.  I dont even think i csn visit her now because im so upset. 

Tl;dr Mom hates assisted living doesnt appreciate what i went through to help her. And im in nervous break down territory.

Anyone else have a parent who failed at assisted living?

EDIT:  Thank you kind strangers for your words of wisdom and kindness.  Today i told her what I was arranging (checking on meds, getting her on a waiting list for a 1 bedroom apartment instead of a studio, and arranging electronic payment of rent). Then i said Im turning off my phone today to rest, and told her if she needed anything, to ask the staff).  
Im not really turning phone off- Im just not going to answer her texts for a day or two.  

She's in good hands, in a safe comfortable place, and she'll  have to be responsible for her own happiness or lack of it.  

Thanks to everyone who replied"
"I am at the end of my rope with my mom who has developed a fear of showering after falling a couple times.  The situation is really difficult, I can't find a solution no matter how hard I try.  Her house is in a terrible state of disrepair and the bathroom is no exception, she really needs to move into AL but won't even consider it, she said she'd kill herself first.   Plus she smokes and won't quit so no AL would take her.   The shower/tub combo has no safety features and probably wouldn't hold up if we tried to attach anything to the walls. She refuses to let us put a seat in the shower, saying she'll trip over it and fall again.  When she had her last shower in December,  it was in a nearby hotel with a walk-in shower, where I helped her get washed but she refused to let me wash her hair for fear of getting shampoo in her eyes.  Multiple attempts since then to get her to a hotel for another shower have failed, she's always too sick or tired or anxious to leave the house.  We have had 2 estimates so far to remodel the bathroom and install a walk-in shower but she won't agree because their prices are too high.  She has 400k in the bank which she refused to spend and lives in squalor instead.  She can't go to the doctor or have home health come in because ""I'm so dirty I stink, I can't let anyone see me like this"" and her doctor doesn't do telehealth.  She's horribly depressed and spends her time lying in bed and crying about her situation, but whatever I or my brother suggest she finds some reason not to do it.  I live an hour away and my brother lives 6 hours away, we both do as much as we can but my husband is disabled and I can't care for him and her too. I guess this is just a vent but I'm open to any suggestions on how to deal with this."
"TLDR: MIL has lower back pain 10/10 for 2days. Only after the 3rd attack did she agree to go be seen but doesn't actually get seen. No diagnosis yet but will be seeing Dr tomorrow.

I feel like this will never end and I'm so angry and frustrated.

A quick recap; on Monday night MIL started to have 10/10 pain radiating from her lower back on the left side. It was so bad that I thought she would wake our kids. Husband urged her to go be seen but she refused. The pain lasted 5hrs and then went away.

On Tuesday and most of Wednesday she would only have twinges of pain. She lied about calling her doctor.

Wednesday afternoon around 3pm the pain came back but was gradually rising in intensity. I texted my husband to make him aware.

I get my 5f off the bus at 3:45, my 19mo is napping upstairs and 3f was sitting watching a movie with MIL. By the time 5 and I get back inside I could tell another attack was coming on. The girls were concerned but I convinced them to go out to the porch converted to a playroom and turned the TV on in the family room to drown out any noise. If I had to I would have locked them out on the porch.

I texted H that it was back and this can't be ignored anymore. He tells me he's on his way. MIL has gone to the master bedroom to conceal her cries of pain. I wanted to call a squad but H said he would convince her.

When he got home he went to talk to her in the bedroom. I had a good feeling it wasn't going to work. A few minutes later I was right. A white hot anger came over me. This was bullshit!

He did convince her to call her Dr and he listened at the door to make sure. She left word with the nurse. 

H decides to get the girls and grab dinner while we wait for the call back.

I can't tell you how angry I felt. I wanted to scream. I told him that if this continues without her going to be seen I'm leaving. The kids don't deserve this. I'm exhausted.

I took the baby when H left. Ten minutes later I hear her start chanting her pain chant. This one was as bad as Monday. O decided that was it. I'm calling. I call the non emergency line and talk to a medic at the station. I told him what was going on and he told me with what you are saying I'm going to send out my medic to check on her.

I go down to tell her. She's outside, coat on and purse ready. I think she was going to drive herself. I told her the medic was coming and you are not driving.

The station is 2mins down the road so they arrived quickly and the guys talked to her. They tried to convince her to go with them but she declined because of the cost. But she did tell them that H was going to take her as soon as he got back.

They left H got back and off they went. I'm thinking finally! I feed the kids and get the trash out and take them down to the road with the cans.

As I was coming back up the drive H is pulling in. They talked to a nurse at the ER and said it was most likely a kidney stone (opinion) MIL doesn't want to stay and be examined so they came home. She did call her Dr who will see her Friday. 

Will this ever end?!"
"Maybe this can help some people wrap their brain around the flow chart of things.

MIL was of sound mind, but decrepit body and had undesirable finances.  Retired before she had to.  Income was some SS and a reverse mortage.  Had some blah investments.

She went into a decent AL knowing full well there was a hard expiration date tied to money directly.  She hoped to die there, but of course she did not.  Finally, they had to transfer to medicaid place to inhale the last of her money and run out the clock.  Then came cancer and then hospice in one of those places which wasnt exactly a hell-hole *for that purpose*, just not super desirable.

My mom currently has much better finances between the house (to sell), savings, and pension incomes from her career and her late husband.

After breaking a leg, she is getting out of rehab (medicare paid) and going to private AL.  Apartment rental month to month. No large buy-in payment.

If her care level remains low, she can pay from her income indefinitely.

At discharge from rehab, she will be paying 2k in excess of her fixed income due to initial higher level of care.

Obviously that has a hard expiration date because math.

So if she does not achieve a lower level of care in the next few months, I need a gaurantee that she will have somewhere to go for all phases of senior life.

Medicaid places will charge high monthly fees way higher than private) and suck out all savings *by design*, because they figure you will be paying nothing eventually and still be living with the biggest amount of care.  Pro: no huge early payment.  Con: not the greatest accommodations.  But could be ok.

Non-medicaid buy-in AL.  You ""buy-in"" with a large upfront payment ""200k+"".  She has a house to sell which could accommodate that. That should keep her somewhere through all phases of care to death, and it is ""nice"".  Con: mom could die the day after checking in and you just spent 200k on a nice place to live for a day.  Although there could be places where some of it is refundable.

 If she did not, we would have to let a medicaid place divest her of savings in monthly payments and then they just deal with her having zero $ and being on the govt's mercy.

So that's that.  AMA."
"“Look everyone is so worried about this lady ain’t one person has come to spend quality time with her they buy her a meal and then dump her off she needs attention a perm a manicure a pedicure and so forth  women 
Stuff stuff I can’t help with her clothes are all stained and no one see that she has a rash on her leg and she won’t take care of it because I bring it up I can’t keep up with the house and not one person will offer to vacuum or anything I think she wiped every butt in this family and there is no reciprocal overture on anyones part if your plate is full so is mine no one has anything positive about about me especially her
She needs quality time with you girls but no one wants to commit to anything”

Backstory: My cousin Alicia, my Uncle Jerry , my cousin Rita and my brother Ben and I all agreed to take turns spending time with my Grandma (she has dementia) I go once a week. Alicia goes once a week. Uncle goes once a week etc. We all work full time and have kids. (There are 16 cousins total. 4 live out of state. The rest are doing their own thing and usually visit once in awhile) We usually take her to eat and to the mall. Grandparents are hoarders. The whole family (cousins, two uncles, two aunts ) all went to clean the house 6 months ago and my grandma got pissed and Grandpa said we were throwing away too many things so we backed off. I’ve offered to hire someone and he rebuffs. I get he’s frustrated but he just pushes us away. As far as her hygiene she refuses to let us help her with showers or clean clothes. I think we need to get a home health nurse to come help. I try not to be upset with my Grandpa but he expects too much. We do what we can. Also side note he has plenty of money and retirement. They both have Tricare for life and Medicare. Grandpa In decent health. It’s hard to convince him she needs additional help.

Grandpa is 80. Grandma is 82"
"My father(78) is notorious for his extreme stubbornness. He will lie to get people to shut up and will yell and get loud if you tell him he needs to change if he wants to be healthy. 

Today my mother (68) called me and told me my father is not well. The last time I saw him, he was wobbly, but able to walk. I found out that he was incontinent and wearing diapers, messing himself, he smelled bc he isn’t bathing properly, is moving SUPER slowly and is using the walker my mom got him, had ulcers on his legs, feet were bleeding, and he sleeps all day long. 

On Friday, my mother called me, but I was very busy that day and said I would call her back. Well that day my dad was in the bathroom for 6 hours. My mother was at work when it happened and when she came home my brother (34 and on the autistic spectrum) thought he fell asleep in there, but he actually fell and couldn’t get up and my brother had to push the door aggressively to push my dad who was in front of it to open the door and squeeze through to pull up his pants and drag him out. My brother gave him some water and something sweet for his blood sugar. Same thing happened in a bedroom upstairs. He was going through things in my old bedroom and he fell and did not want anyone to lift him up. He just laid there for hours. 

Today my mother called an ambulance and the police said the house smelled really bad and my father told them to go away and didn’t want to be seen by an EMT. 

I called him (bc I live out of state) and asked him what he was doing. He said he was watching tv and I said “no…what are you doing declining help from doctors?!?” I was crying but very mad. You cannot tell this man anything and he’s just existing with his illness not taking medicine. My mother ended up going to the hospital instead to ask questions and nothing else was done. I told him he needs to see a doctor and he said he will but that is a bold lie. 

I don’t understand why he doesn’t want help. I want to understand how he thinks what he’s doing is sane and healthy. My mom, and brother do not want to see my almost 79 year old father go out pathetic like this. This is no way to live and my brother is freaking out bc he doesn’t want the neighbors to know what is going on. What can I do to encourage him to seek medical advice?"
"My dad has dementia and is bedridden. He thinks he can walk and is healthy but he is not. My dad can't sit still and try to get out of the bed about ten times a day. When he gets out of the bed, he falls on the floor and I have to pick him up.  When I ask him ""where is he going?"" and he said he is going home. The thing is that we are at home.  If I say  that we are at home, he asks more questions or gets aggressive. He does not listen to what I am telling him. The only thing I can say is that my mom is going to take him home later. He calms down and then tries to get out of bed 15 minutes later.I am burnt out when dealing with him.  I need tips on how to talk to him."
"Long story short, for the last three-ish years I have been the care taker for my MIL as my partner works out of state for 6-10 weeks at a time, and then home for one week (we are NOT legally married). I also work a demanding 55-60 hour work week, both in office and WFH.

She had a stroke this weekend and Ive been navigating the hospital, now skilled nursing facility, and home care stuff. She is still mentally competent at the moment but partner does have POA.

I would love ideas of what needs to be done and safety tips that have helped you.

Although they are still in her name, most expenses have been set up to auto-pay. We added him to some of her bank accounts and track her spending. We plan on putting cameras inside the house. She has a fall detection necklace. I have put our numbers on the back of her cell and house phones in case of an emergency. I am going to work on getting her full medical history, make an appointment with an attorney (she has a trust already), and will likely take away her mailbox key so that she doesnt get scammed again.

Im working so hard to make this process as easy as possible. Please offer any and all help that you have used. Thanks!"
"My 77 yr old mother was admitted into the hospital on Monday after her oxygen levels dropped to dangerous levels at an appt with her PCP.
She had a COPD exacerbation last month and was in the hospital for around 2-3 days where they treated her with a whole slew of anti biotics, steroids, nebulizers, ect. She has developed some extreme anxiety in her older years, which causes her to panic, which makes her COPD worse. We thought the panic from her anxiety was part of the cause of her worsening breathing at home (she's been on oxygen 24/7 since her hospital stay, even at rest she has it cranked up fairly high). Turns out from a recent chest x-ray performed this morning at 4:30am- she is developing either pneumonia or a pulmonary edema, which wasn't the case yesterday according to tests they ran. Waiting on a call from the Drs.
She has stage 3 COPD using the Gold Standard (I think that's what it's called)
I live about 3 hrs away from her, my older sister has been by her side through this and I'm grateful she's there, but I'll be heading that way later today or early tomorrow.
I don't know why I'm posting here, but I'm scared.  I don't know with her degree of COPD and a possible diagnosis of pneumonia (or even PE, though I do not know much about that diagnosis) I worry she'll ever pull through."
"Hi, I’m wondering if anyone has figured out a way to set up a smart TV to play a set schedule of broadcast shows. Such as price is right channel 4 at 10am, jeopardy on channel 11 at 4:30 pm, mon - fri. Etc. My mom just moved into long term care and we got her a new Samsung smart TV in her room. She’s not able to use a remote, and the aids aren’t changing the channel reliably. Wondering if anyone has suggestions? Like is there an app I can use to set a schedule so the channel will change at the desired times if the tv is on?

"Hello, fellow subredditors.  My mom (70) suffered a stroke while having a brain tumor removed about 30 years ago.  It affected her cognitive ability quite a bit - especially her ability to concentrate. Over the last 12-18 months or so, her short term memory has started showing marked decline.  I notice now that, in conversations, she forgets some things after just a few moments, yet other pieces of information she seems to retain well enough.

I really want to get her to a neurologist. The issue is: my mom and I live on separate continents. And the country she lives in does not have the types of facilities that she would need to undergo a thorough neurological screening.  COVID is still making travel tricky and it will be several months before I can arrange to travel home, pick her up and travel again, to go abroad to have her seen to.  

I'd love to hear if anyone on this forum has experience of using nootropics / cognitive enhancers with ageing relatives. I am looking for a 'bridging' solution - something that can slow/stop the decline while I get my financial ducks in a row and we do the visa applications etc, to get her to a neurologist.

I'm looking for something scientifically reviewed as being effective in slowing cognitive decline.  Have seen bits and pieces about nootropics and other cognitive enhancers, but would really rather go off of the experience of real people, rather than what might just be sneakily positioned advertising.

Thank you for any feedback you can share."
"I need to vent and get this out. 

My husband, kids and I live with my MIL.

Last night my husband and I (36/37) were laying in bed watching TV around 10/10:30 when we heard MIL (68) crying in pain.

H jumped out of bed and went down to ask her what was going on.

She said she had stabbing pain in her back radiating around her left side. The pain was so great that she couldn't sit or lay down and she felt like she was going to throw up. 

H asked her if she wanted him to take her in and she refused all the while crying, almost screaming in pain and repeating it hurts. She ended up throwing up every time she tried to drink water.

I stayed upstairs in  case the kids woke up. It was scaring me so I'm sure the kids would have been terrified. I feel bad that I prayed she would pass out like she said she felt like she would.

This went on for awhile. I didn't want to get involved. I don't do well in these situations where someone refuses help.

Around 11:30 she said it still hurt but wasn't stabbing. I told H I thought she still needed to be seen. She convinced H to go to bed.

This morning she came out and was fine for a few minutes but then the pain started again.

She took her vitamins about 8:30 but soon after said she needed to lay down. I told her she should at least call her doctor. I don't think she will.

I feel useless at the moment. Been texting H updates. I know she needs to be seen but I can't take her and she is not listening to our advice.

Update: 

MIL went to get a cat scan today. The doctor called a bit ago and said it was a kidney stone and its location was detrimental to her kidney if not removed soon. 

So H and MIL just left so he could drop her off at the hospital to get it taken care of."
"Thank you all for your advice and support in my last post. I genuinely don't know what I'd do without this place...

So, I worked with my dad's attorney to create a will for my mom, along with a POA. As far as that panic is concerned, we're okay. But like most things with this process, it seems like when you put one fire out, another just pops up in another place. Or maybe I can only concentrate on one fire at a time. 

Right now, I'm focusing on my mom's health and future care. She was diagnosed with end-stage COPD before the pandemic. They hid the severity of this diagnosis from me, and from themselves. Aside from getting an x-ray to ensure the dark spots on her lungs haven't spread, and using inhalers twice a day, she's done nothing. Nothing. Not a google search. Not a question to her doctor about life expectancy. Nothing. She even hid the severity of how it impacts her daily life from her own doctor. 

As I'm reading things on my own, I'm realizing that with her symptoms, I'm probably going to be dealing with her death in the next couple years... We had a telehealth session with her doctor yesterday and he's requested an in-home evaluation for skilled nursing. But I'm suddenly looking at all these choices... so we look into assisted living? A nursing home? Is it more practical to get in-home care? 

Anyway. I'm desperate for help and guidance, especially after reading how Pennsylvania can royally screw the children in these situations. Is this what an elder care attorney is for? What was your experience? I'm just trying to set my expectations here."
"
I didn't expect to have an update so soon on my situation I posted about on Sunday regarding moving my 66-year-old father out of my home. As it happens the anxiety I've been feeling was *extremely* well-founded, as he fell again yesterday (Monday) while my husband was at work. He didn't have his phone on him and we have no idea how long he was down for. He's in the ER now, but they're admitting him to the hospital soon. 

Apparently he had a stroke recently - maybe a few days ago, they said. Which kind of coincides with the increase in his falling. I don't know what's scarier:  seeing him in his present state or knowing that this happened days ago and we had *no* idea. He's also got a badly infected toe on his good foot which they're saying won't heal unless we can restore blood flow to his foot, which they can't do at our local hospital but all the big hospitals in the region, including the VA hospital, are jam-packed. As if that wasn't enough, he's also got diabetic ketoacidosis going on. 

So, the plan right now is for them to treat what they can here and eventually transfer him to a bigger hospital when a bed opens up for him (he's 4th in line right now, so it could be a while).

I feel awful for not noticing any signs of a stroke or even how bad his toe is before now. I also feel kind of guilty for being almost relieved to have this situation come to a head? Like, there's still a lot of hard shit ahead, but for the first time in years I have an ounce of hope for *my* future. Just wish it didn't come at such a cost. 

My plan from here is to take the advice I've been given and say no to him coming back to live with us until I'm blue in the face if I have to. I can't take care of him and I *cannot* permit something like this to happen again."
"My (almost 70 y/o) mom clearly is struggling. She's not taking care of herself, not caring for her living space well, has invited a former abuser back into her life, and has reduced contact with me and several other people who used to be important to her. Does anyone know of some services to help? What can I do?

Right now I'm planning on trying to get her into therapy and some home aids to assist. I don't know what else to do...?"
"My mother is only 61 years old and has more issues than Vogue.  

Including, but not limited to:

-	Depression – never leaves the bed, barely cares for herself

-	Anxiety – irritable and constantly paranoid that someone is judging her, thus has no social connections
 
-	Compulsive spending and massive debt

-	Arrest warrants due to ignoring said massive debt

-	Recovering alcoholic 

-	Painkiller addiction

-	Hoarding; does not clean her house anymore, including indoor pet excrements
 
-	Missing front teeth, which has crushed her self-esteem

-	Overweight; had gastric bypass surgery 10 years ago but regained all of the weight and digestive issues

My brother and I fell out of touch with her several years ago after she blew off too many invitations to visit or accept help.  I think my dad is finally leaving her now to reclaim his sanity, so she asked to stay with my husband and I for several weeks until she figures out what to do.  I am not emotionally or financially equipped for her baggage.  To see my own mother wither so far away from her former self has been incredibly sad and unnerving.  

I have a 5-year old son and my own mental health challenges to manage.  We cannot afford the care she needs, and she is unwilling to put forth the required effort anyway.  

Am I a horrible person for leaving her to sink or swim?  It feels wrong, yet necessary.  What a predicament.

EDIT:  Thank you everyone for the encouragement and for sharing your perspectives, this has been a huge help!"
"Another helpful redditor posted a video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwXQmp\_w1pM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwXQmp_w1pM) at around 15:13) about estate planning and I got one very interesting take away from it about POA. 

Sometimes banks will not accept a regular notarized POA from a lawyer. Examples: Vanguard, Fidelity, other investing companies. Get your own POA with the Bank to avoid future issues. 

Thanks to whomever posted that video!"
"I'm sorry if this is a bit scattered. I'm trying to get *something* up before I lose my nerve and I don't have time to sit down and edit/revise because I have to get ready for work. 

My husband and I are unable (and unwilling) to provide the level of support my dad (66m) needs to continue living in our home and having him here is a massive drain on our health. I can tell we're moving into another falling period and I *cannot* deal with it again. Last time he started falling frequently, I told him he needs to find a different living arrangement he instead did nothing until I got tired of checking in with him. I don't think he's going to leave unless I force him out. 

I never wanted him living with us to begin with, but he lost his trailer the same time my aunts washed their hands of him, and I knew letting him become homeless would result in him dying and, as much as I can'tstand to be around him, I couldn't have tgat on my conscience,  so in he moved.

 He leaves a trail of garbage and filth in his wake at all times; his TV room has a path to and from his chair; the rest of the floor is hidden under a 2-foot-deep pile of literal trash - food packaging, mostly. He fell in there the other day and it was a huge pain to get him upright again; moreover, by the time I found him he'd already half wedged himself under a table attempting to get up on his own. He doesn't bathe. He barely does laundry. He doesn't keep up on his pills. He smokes in his bathroom even though we've caught him and told him to stop multiple times. He wastes his foodstamps on junk food he, as a diabetic, shouldn't be eating and then steals our food when he's out of money.  I've told him time and time again not to give my elderly dog biscuits or leftovers from his meals (because the dog is Fat fat and needs to lose weight before his bad knee gives out and we end up having to put him down because we can't afford to *fix* that)  and he just completely ignores me. He says he's afraid of my husband but he doesn't listen to *him* either and I don't know if he's aware that I wouldn't think twice picking my husband over him (a fate my dad earned through his abusive parenting when I was growing up)

The rest of our house is *better* but still in a very sorry state. I work full time on top of being disabled myself and I get no help with the housework, so I am unable to keep up with the mess even on good weeks.

Does anyone have any advice for what I can do to get this man out of my house? Thanks!"
"Hey guys, just wanted to ask if any of you worry about your aging parents. They immigrated from India in the late '90s.  I'm 21F (will be 22 in July) and my brother is 19 (will be 20 in August), and our mom just turned 50 and our dad will be 59 in September. Mom is in pretty good health generally; her dad (my grandpa) passed at 77 (due to disease resulting from an eye related condition IIRC) and her mom died at 70 due to a heart attack. Both of them never really exercised (my grandma was visibly overweight) and of course dealt with the pollution/heat and other lower quality of life obstacles back in India. I'm hoping my mom will make it past 75 at least given she has no other major health conditions/issues and eats right and exercises daily and is used to higher quality of living standards in the US. Both of my dad's parents died months within each other in the late 80s at 51 and 60 due to a heart attack and liver conditions - my dad was only 25 at the time. My dad had me and my brother later in life (he was 37 when I was born and 39 when my brother was born), and also struggles with an autoimmune disease. I have a feeling I'm going to lose him before I'm 30 due to the complications arising from the autoimmune disease. I feel so fucking lost at the thought of losing them - I have no other immediate family here in the US; everyone else is back home in India. For those of you who have lost your parents -  How did you cope with losing them?"
"UPDATE : found a place for my mom 32 mins away that is 5200/mo. which has LPNs 24/7. Thanks for the guidance everyone!


My mother is 78 and lives in PA. She rents a ground floor apt. And has no assets except for 650,000 in an IRA. She also receives 2800 in SS/Month. SS covers most of her expenses currently. Details on her situation are below. My question is, what can we do when her money runs out? By my calculation, she'll have about a decade before her money is completely spent assuming between 8,000 and 9,000 in monthly costs. My understanding is that medicaid will kick in if/when she runs out of money. How do we ensure that she gets covered? As heartless as it sounds, we (my sister and I) could help her financially, but we want to avoid doing so. We've seen our friends go into their life savings helping their parents and we want to avoid it at all costs.

Background:

She is currently living alone, but I check in on her 3-4 times a week. My sister and cousin were also checking in on her the other days of the week, but they are unableto help as much d/t circumstances. I help her bathe, shop, go to doctor, and my sister handles her finances. She does not drive.  She has diabetes and is unable to walk without assistance, usually a walker. We managed to keep this up for the last several years, but circumstances have changed and it's simply unsafe to continue in this manner. In the last three weeks, she has had two falls  and a severe hypoglycemic episode which put her in the hospital. While she is still relatively mentally aware, i have no doubt she'll be unable to care for herself at all in the future. That, along with feeling burned out and resentful mean it's really time to get help.

She will be in the hospital for a couple more days and possibly rehab (to work on her walking) for the next several weeks. Thankfully, insurance should cover everything, and during this time, I want to get her set up with a more formalized care plan.

As I mentioned at the top, she has a decent amount of money, though her costs are about to go way up. She has 9 more months on her lease, and we're planning to get her an aid during that time. My thinking is that she needs someone at the beginningand end of the day, 4 hours in the morning and 4 hours at night. During the middleof the day, she usuallynaps and watches tv. Once she's asleep, she should be fine until the next day if her sugar levels are correct before going down. I'm anticipating that care will be around 6000/month, meaning her monthly costs will be approx. $9000. Longterm, it seems more economical to go into assisted living. Places we've looked at top out around $8000/mo for room and 24/7 care. Thankfully, while she's not thrilled about any of these options, she's willing to go along.

Assuming a spending rate between 8 and 9k per month, her money will run out in a decade. She will still get 3k/mo in SS which helps a lot, but won't be enough to pay for care. If she goes to assisted living, is there a listing of places that take medicaid? How do we ensure she gets it/qualifies?

Appreciate any help or recommendations. Thanks!"
"My mother is almost 89, long story short, very independent woman until she broke her hip 3 months ago. She’s recovering well, I played a big part in her recovery. Now she’s walking with a walker but needs more assistance than I can provide. I have a family with two pre-teen girls and a full time job. I need to prioritize my mental health to be able to function. Somehow my mother makes me feel guilty for not living up to her standards. I am constantly struggling with this and getting into arguments with her which is not healthy. Anyone who has some wisdom please share. Thanks for reading."
"At some point, you look up and realize that you are now in a family role you did see coming so soon; perhaps feeling unprepared to claim. How have you adjust to being the one who holds the responsibility of keeping the family together and on track?"
"Maybe I should be posting this on a legal forum, but maybe someone here has insight so... here goes. For background on my situation with my mom, a review of past posts should suffice.  Nutshell: we live together in a house with no mortgage, she is suffering a precipitous physical and mental breakdown (no Alz, no dementia, we've checked), she's broke, she's half blind, she can barely walk, and she's narcissistic, highly uncooperative, erratic in behavior and lacking insight on her true situation.  There is no other family help, as my only sibling has noped out.  I am financially independent.

My mother has life estate in the house we live in, and I am remainderman (will ""get it"" when she dies, not that it will retain much value by the time she would be finished trashing it).  I've never anticipated being able to personally profit from its sale, so that's not the issue for me.  It is our family's only real asset to pay for senior care.  Realistically, it needs to be sold and its proceeds used for her care in assisted living.  (Although it was transferred to my name in 2015, which puts it past the Medicaid look-back period, my mom refuses to have anything to do with Medicaid - and honestly the Medicaid funded options in my area are absolutely subpar and I wouldn't put a dog in one of those nursing homes if I could help it - my aunt is already in one and it's dreadful - so it's the least attractive option, though it is an option.)

Mom refuses to even consider the option of selling her childhood home, despite the fact it is spectacularly unsuited for an immobile senior and the layout is likely contributing to her physical precarity and her increasing inability to do her ADL's.  And under our state law, the house (though my name is on the deed as ""owner"") cannot be sold out from under her without her consent because she has life estate.

However, the law also states that the life estate holder (my mom) is solely responsible for the upkeep of the property during her lifetime.  As I said, she's broke.  She cannot afford critical repairs to the house that are looming.  She has basically misspent her money on relatively frivolous things like a new fence (not needed) or a prettier new window here and there, or glass block windows for a basement she never goes in, etc.  She continually demands I pay ""my share"" of the lawn mowing, yard cleanup, plumbing in the bathroom that only she uses, or whenever she wants the handyman to come by and plant some azaleas.  That sort of thing.

(I want to add that I pay her monthly rent in order to live here, something I have been doing even back when the house was in both of our names legally and there was no life estate.  So she gets money from me.  She just doesn't spend it properly.)

So, while she scrapes up enough cash to pay the taxes every year, she's not got the funds or even the understanding that SHE is (not WE are) responsible for critical maintenance of the property.  And we've got a roof replacement looming.  She has zero funds to pay for that and did I mention she refuses to borrow against the precious childhood home because ""she might lose it to the bank""?

My question (which I never thought I'd have to ever ask) is: do I have the option of suing her for not taking care of critical repairs, and more importantly, what legal recourse do I have to get her to agree or to force her to sell the property?

I feel like the only option here is either for me to (a) spend my life savings on in-home help for her or for assisted living, or (b) vacate the premises, get an apartment, and watch from a distance as she continues to implode and also trash the property, eventually calling APS on her (and realistically APS usually does nothing in these cases).  Note- I do not live in a ""filial responsibility"" state.

I'm resistant to finding an apartment only because there is a shortage of apartments in this area and I would be forced to move to an inconvenient distance away from both her and my aunt who is in nursing care and has no one to look after her (the nursing home is horrible and being investigated by the state, so that's a whole nother ball of wax for me to deal with).

""Take out a home equity loan to pay for care"" -- see above, can't do that without her permission.

""Apply for Medicaid"" -- see above, the only possible option is Medicaid funded in home like PACE but the person has to be approved for nursing level of care, and my mom probably won't need that until she falls down and breaks a hip or something (she's fallen 7 or 8 or 9 times now, I've lost count).

I can't see any way out of this that doesn't involve suffering/injury for her and and/or losing the family home.  Is there something I'm not considering?

I am seeing a geriatric care manager soon (without my mom's knowledge or involvement, as it would probably trigger a massive meltdown on her part), but I wanted to think about all this before I meet with the person, who probably does not suspect what a weird and dysfunctional family she's about to advise. :-("
"Curious if anyone else has dealt with a parent going though macular degeneration? I believe my mom's is advanced.....she has been getting shots in her eyes for months but she also smokes and I think this is accelerating the condition. 

She has also fallen 5 or 6 times over the last year. She only tells me weeks or months after she falls and always seems to bash her face into things. She said one time she thinks she broke her nose!

I'm just stunned and wondering what to expect over the next year. I'm thinking I need POA as soon as possible, and I need to start looking at care homes for legally blind folks. Not to mention making sure she doesn't drive...anything else I'm overlooking?"
Has anyone had a family member experience more than chemo brain during/after chemo. Like straight up short term memory is gone. My dad started showing major memory issues after IV chemo treatments (Dec 2021) and began radiation and chemo pills from January to mid February. The memory has not improved and this seems way more than chemo brain. He still has several scans to do. MRI/pet scan/CT scan. Has anyone ever experienced a family member go through dementia coinciding with chemo?
"I’m looking for perspectives on this. For a little background, my mom is always in charge. My sisters & I think she’s jeopardizing our dad by not allowing the house to be modified in any way to make it safer for him (she does do all the grocery shopping, laundry, meal prep, house issues, takes him to all doctor appointments, pays the bills).
When talking to her, I try to suggest getting help in the house or moving. She will have none of it. Then proceeds to lecture me that I couldn’t possibly know what she needs or how she feels because I’ve never been in her situation. She then tells me it’s the same thing as someone with no children telling someone with children how to raise them. 
What are your thoughts on this analogy?"
"Hello friends. Asking for support as I care for my mother. 62, Parkinson's, RA, Obese, severe anxiety, the whole package. I've been taking care of her solo for ~2 years now, only a year since parkinson's diagnosis.

She had a fall a week ago that seems to have rendered her nearly unable to walk. She used to be able to use her walker to get to the bathroom, but now she relies on her Rascal scooter. And it takes everything in her power to even get into the scooter. She almost fell on the ground again last night trying to get into it.

Every day since then I have been so worried about her. When I'm at work I text her constantly to make sure she's okay. I've declined several invites from friends because I didn't want her to be alone. But yet I feel so trapped by this life. I'm depressed and burned out from work and want to take a vacation, or even a day trip, for my mental health but I just can't. I'm too important to my mother. I'm afraid she'll die if I go anywhere for more than a couple hours.

Yes, we have been receiving assistance, albeit minimal. Area Agency on Aging has provided us with a caretaker for two days a week, but she was pregnant at the time and has been out on maternity. Since then they have been short staffed and unable to provide us a caretaker for several months. Once or twice we got a replacement but they barely did any work for us.

So I feel at a dead end here. I want to be freed from this burden, as does she, but my resources are limited. No family or friends will help us. Nursing home unavailable as she's opposed and we live in Section 8 (PA) and I don't want to have to move out of this nice house. 

Any advice, resources or even sympathy appreciated. This is so hard on me and I truly don't know what to do next."
"She’s in assisted living. She is for sure going to have an accident any day now. She won’t give up the keys. Im usually the one giving advice on this sub, but I’m stumped on this one. 

I’m sure the facility is going to tell me there’s nothing they can do. I’m tempted to call the police, but doubt there’s much value there. Her driving is so erratic and dangerous that we’re certain she’s going to kill or maim someone with her car, and we feel helpless to prevent that tragedy. It’d be different if I thought she’d kill only herself with the car, but I can’t stomach the thought of her hurting someone else when I knew all along it was inevitable. I’ve got enough guilt (thanks mom), to last me a lifetime already. 

There is no negotiating with her. None. Absolutely no hope of her giving up the keys or the car willingly. None. Period. If we steal the keys she’ll just call AAA. We must force the issue or wait for the tragedy. Any thoughts on how we might force the issue? Maybe someone knows some MVD policy or some other little-known law or rule or something? (I know I’m reaching here; just desperate.)

Thanks.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for all of your encouragement and advice. I really didn’t know that any state’s DMVs had any kind of means to address this kind of thing. I’m certain if we have her license taken away she will just continue to drive anyway, but it’s worth doing for our own sanity."
"After finally having my dad agree to move to AL in CA, and the new AL facility finally being open. He'd put a deposit down back in Oct 2021. 
From my other post we went through quite a lot of convincing. I went through mountains of paper work, He had a doctor's appointment which also went through mountains of paper work. Everything took hours. Was organizing a move.

Then my dad had a zoom assessment where they told me his Edema is too bad and they can't take him becasue he's too much of a liability. They didn't talk to his doctor or anything, didn't even tell my dad, and they were incredibly short with me. When I started to complain that this is 6 months of our lives down the drain, the contact person was just like ""I'm just the messenger, bye."" 

Like anyone experience something like this? This is why people go to AL, because of health issues that they can't manage themselves. He's had this all his life, sure it's worse as he's aged, but it's not going to go away. And yes, he can walk and says that he's not in pain.

I'm absolutely beside myself livid. I think the real reason is that my dad was rude to the assessors and they just made up any excuse to not let him in.  I know after the assessment my dad proudly told me how stupid all their questions were and he told them this and also how smart he is. When he told me this I had a feeling he shot himself in his own foot. I did tell him this, but of course according to him it's BS.  Plus he seemed kind of happy he wasn't going to moving in the near future. At what point do I just say fuck it and not deal with them anymore?

A freaking narcissist does not age well, people."
"Both my 76 year old father and my 73 year old mother have had strokes and my mom is permanently disabled from hers. 

My mom is basically a shut in and my dad can barely move and only goes out for medical appointments and has diabetes.  So I have two parents that are sick at the same time.

I try and visit them but I have to work a full time job and I bring them food and take my son (their grandson) to visit them but one visit when I brought my teenage son my dad was sitting at the kitchen table in the afternoon in his underwear.  Maybe I’m a prude, but being his daughter it made me feel like I wanted to vomit in my mouth.  It happened again on another visit when I was visiting by myself.  My son tolerates visits but knows my parents aren’t right as my  ex husbands parents are fully functioning grandparents, despite being elderly.

Another time I announced myself and went in and found my dad with his hands down his pants and I walked right out to another room away from it.  At first I thought he was pleasuring himself but then no turns out he had peed into a plastic jar and put it right on the kitchen counter (in plain view).  Thanks dad. 

I know my parents are in bad shape medically, and have mobility issues, but I don’t think my son needs to see grandpa sitting at the kitchen table in his underwear.  I kinda hate going over there when this happens.  He has bone on bone can barely move and refuses to get the surgery to fix it (I had offered to stay with my mom when I was unemployed so that he could get the surgery and my mom could be taken care of). 

Am I being too much of a prude? Had anyone else encountered this situation with their parents and is there a graceful way to handle the situation? I’m kind of resentful that I’ve seen things I would have preferred as their child to never see and don’t like having my son exposed to the behavior either.   Virtual visits would be great but they’re technologically illiterate and likely to remain that way.

The whole situation makes me sad and they need more help than they get but even their paid caregivers have just ran away from the situation (and I can understand why).

Im also a wee bit resentful that my sister has no conscience/guilt and ignores my parents even though she is local and I’m left dealing with them.  Her three kids have never even my parents.

Finally, I’m kind upset they started sicking my moms friend on contacting me (who is lovely but will talk on the phone for hours).   When my parents last decided on their own to go into the hospital, I think she was trying to guilt trip me to go see them but I had my son to take care of that weekend and quite honestly I took him enough to the hospital to visit them in the past.  

I don’t mean to be mean, but it’s been years and years of this parental decline and sometimes I think I’ll probably drop dead before they do. They had a fantasy that I’d quit my job and take care of them, which is great but it wouldn’t pay my bills.  I’m trying  to figure out the right balance between my responsibility to my parents and my sanity."
"My mom has life insurance. She is 78, and wants to be buried with my dad, even tho they got divorced. My dad suddenly died and did not have life insurance (that we are aware of). No will. Nothing. 

Could we possibly use moms life insurance to purchase a grave for the both of them, with her still being alive and not cashing out her entire policy?"
"The short story: 78 year old narcissistic mom, serious fall risk (has fallen 7-8 times in last 9 months), refuses to move out of her home, getting more decrepit as the months pass… fell a week ago, claimed not to be injured, but obviously strained her neck. Tried to self-treat with “physical therapy” and made things worse. Now walking stiffly around the house and screaming in pain. Doesn’t want to go to ER (still a poorly staffed COVID hellscape) or prompt care. Has pain meds but claim they don’t work. Won’t sit or lie down and rest, won’t put heating pad or ice on.

All she wants to do is hobble around and scream and give orders.  Teetering every moment on the verge of falling. Literally everything I try to do for her is contradicted or shot down.

I got her to sit in a chair. For now.

What. The. Actual. Fuck. Do. I. Do. Now?"
"I am not sure if this is the proper subreddit to post this in, but I am seeking some advice pertaining to my girlfriend's father (72 y/o), who is currently in Texas (roughly 2k miles from us).

Roughly 8 weeks ago, he had a heart attack and a stroke. Prior to this occurring, he was employed and living alone in an apartment. He is currently in a rehab facility, but due to the severity of the event, he is making slow progress - motor skills and cognitive abilities are significantly impaired. We are being told that he will not be able to work again, and will not be able to live on his own again - therefore we are working to find him a position for long term care with continued therapy.

Through his employment, he was on Blue Cross Blue Shield, but come early May, that will no longer be available to him. We have two options from the looks of it: use Medicare Part A, or transition over to Cobra so he can continue using Blue Cross Blue Shield. We are under the impression that keeping Medicare is the best financial move, but the complexities of Medicare and Cobra are beginning to become overwhelming - making it difficult for my girlfriend to move forward in such a time-crunch situation.

Does anyone have experience with the insurance dilemma that I mentioned above, that could provide insight? What should we be looking out for, what should we consider? Are there any support groups that my girlfriend could join to speak with others that are also struggling with parents? Are there any organizations that focus on helping those in situations like the one my girlfriend, or her father, are in?

Thank you.

"I (30 F) live with my mom (65). My dad passed away almost 10 years ago and between my mom and myself we pull together to pay bills and keep the house together. 

Since 2020, I’ve noticed a “fogginess” with her, and I can’t tell if she’s just not listening to me (she’s addicted to her tablet) or straight up forgetting conversations we have. A small example: she will accidentally buy or rent tv shows on streaming platforms even though money is tight and we’ve discussed cutting back expenses. 

She is on disability and has a condition that does affect blood flow, so I’m sure that is related. And I know everyone has moments of forgetfulness. 

My mom is not an invalid and can take care of herself but I can’t help but having flashbacks of caring for my father. She has always been the backbone and caregiver in the family, so I’m sure she’s wanting to relax. But, it seems that she is accepting that she wants to live the rest of her life watching TV and playing on her tablet. 

I don’t want to baby her, but I also don’t want to turn a blind eye and pretend it’s not happening.

I really don’t have anyone I feel comfortable discussing this with in my life, so I’m posting this to get an outsider perspective."
"I live in south east asia and have two elderly parents in their 70s (I am 27).

I do not have a good relationship with my father ever since I found out about his affair 7 years ago. His health is terrible because he smoked all his life and ever since the pandemic happened, completely stopped taking care of himself. He is in bed for 22 hours a day and his health is deteriorating to say the least.

My mother's health is not great either. She had a heart attack at the start of the pandemic and recently went into retirement. She has always been a giver and provider and has no idea what to do with herself now. There are subtle signs that her health is also going downhill but I do not want to go into the details of that. I am dealing with a lot of emotions,  but mainly:

anger - because my parents made and continue to make poor choices in their lives

guilt - of wanting to live my own life and not care for them

I am reaching the brink towards a mental breakdown from exhaustion from work and not having had a break in 2 years. I have a trip planned in a month's time but my chronic overthinking and catastrophizing is bringing me to my knees. (I am seeing a therapist to work on this) I am just so tired....my thoughts are very muddled and I don't know what my next steps are. I am not 30 yet, there are so many things I want to do and experience life in my own way....

where and how do i set the boundaries in terms what to do if shit hits the fan?  Am I obligated to be a caregiver because I live with them? what if my mother gets diagnosed with cancer? or my father? do I cancel my trip so I can stay behind to take care of things? am I the asshole if I still go on my trip (a couple of months) if one of them falls gravely ill? 

Thank you for listening."
"Mom kept leaving her keys in the door. If she came in after me, she'd leave them in the front door all night. We live in a good neighborhood, but that's not safe anywhere.

I finally solved it: I got a dish from Etsy that's too small for anything but her keys that says, ""Keys, Please."" She's tried putting her sunglasses in it and they fall out. Take that, clutter!

It works beautifully. Highly recommend for anyone else having this problem.

If anyone else has practical suggestions for outwitting your parents' problems, lemme know, because I'd love to hear them."
"My mom has a condition that has resulted in the collapse of 2 of the 3 arteries to her foot and calf. As a result she now has dry gangrene and the affected areas are rotting. I've seen every vascular doctor, podiatrist,  wound care specialist and other hail Mary type of intervention I could come up with. She is in a private care facility and her hospice team is managing her pain etc. Added to this she has vascular dementia,  again as a result of the circulation collapse.  The surgeon says amputation is the only option however her odds of recovery are quite small. She is frail, 82yrs old and smoked for 65 years. I don't want her last days to be alone in some random hospital, likely in pain from an above the knee amputation, confused and scares in her brief moments of lucidity.  
The other path is to care for the wound which won't do anything other than keep in from her sight and allow the infection to claim her unless divine intervention allows a peaceful passing from another cause such as a stroke. She has suffered many small strokes so that isn't without some possibility. I'm in veterinary medicine and have a better than layperson grasp of what is happening. But I can find no peace. Is it my own horror that I don't want to see my mom's leg cut off? That I don't want to watch the painful and scary recovery,  if there even is one? I don't know but I am torn in so many pieces. I have no husband or family to help. My brother is far away and playing ostrich. It is up to me to chose. I think she'd rather not have her leg amputated and , were she of sound mind, that's what she'd say? I think. 
Meanwhile I have a friend of hers who questions,  judges and otherwise makes this harder. 
Any thoughts would be so very welcome."
"My father of 75 years is becoming older by the month. As such, it is becoming more and more difficult for him to manage daily life as it relates to bills, online passwords etc. Is there a recommended method on how to gather and store this ""crucial info"" for aging parents?"
"Tom Brokaw and his MD. daughter help us learn what conversations are important and where to dig deeper.

""Yes, dad but what defines a heroic measure to you?""  
Does anyone have any helpful outlines that can supplement and support conversations with aging parents or know where to find them?

also, if you have had some of these convos how did you start them and how'd they go?

"I posted last week about the frustrations of doing my mother's taxes, and, this weekend, I had her checkbook to make electronic tax payments. That's when I noticed a check stub for $6,000 made out to the church she's belonged to for 60 years. When I asked her about it, she said it was a pledge she made five years ago to a building fund for a new building the church decided to add. (They have built the building, though my mother has never even set foot in it.)

Five years ago, she was still in a reasonably sound, competent state of mind. She showed me a letter the church sent her that listed both her more recent donations and her outstanding $6,000 pledge to the building fund. She was left in a good financial situation, so $6,000 won't exactly bankrupt her, but it's still a lot. She's 92 and getting to the point where she may need more care. We might need to replace the HVAC system on her house this year, which could easily be $10,000-$14,000 these days. She's had to get two tooth crowns recently, which came to $3,000. 

How do you deal with a church soliciting donations and pledges from someone who's no longer really competent to manage her own finances? My mother has never been stupid about her money, and she's not a spendthrift. She knows to hang up the phone on scammers and ask me about anything she doesn't understand, but the church is kind of an Achilles' heel because of her years of attendance and loyalty. I have a feeling this might be one major point of vulnerability in terms of making sure she doesn't give away money she might need for her own care."
"I sent my 2 out of town siblings a list of everything I had to do this week for Mom, and asked them to take care of it. Not one reply. 

None of the items have been taken care of, even the easy ones like “Do something for Mom for Easter”,  “Make arrangements for a prescription to be delivered “, “Get small bottles of water, ensure, 
and juices for her fridge”. 

I have talked about this with my Mom, and she is 100% understanding of my feelings. She knows I would do things for her no matter what, but would like some extra support - particularly in the form of a sibling visit to help when things go sideways ( once or twice a year).

I found out one sibling, who couldn’t make it here to help during the past month, went to Florida for Easter. I have lost all respect for them both.

As of now, I no longer have siblings. It is easier to navigate the emotional and physical aspects of caring for Mom if I don’t rely on “they can come back me up when I get nutso”. Because they apparently can’t. Or don’t. Or won’t. 

I have blocked them both. I’ve never blocked anyone in my life - I had to look up how to do it - haha. My Mom got a message from my BIL to “pray for me”. 

I don’t want to be an angry, bitter person for the rest of my life. That is so not me (hence the cheerful, do it all, no problem attitude I have had for so many years ). But, I have become this person I don’t even know.

I plan to got to therapy to get myself right. But, there will never be any meaningful relationship between my siblings and myself - if there is any relationship at all in the future. Some things just cut too deep to heal without scars."
"Hey everyone, 

My mother is getting older now and I am concerned for her. She has cognitively declined quite a bit. I've been thinking of putting in a ""granny camera"". Any thoughts? Which do you use?"
"My mom just turned 69 in February. She lost her mom in September 2021, which has, understandably, been very hard on her. It has been hard on all of us.

Anyway, ever since then, my mom's health has gone down hill, physically and mentally. She barely leaves the house unless she absolutely has to (she doesn't even like to go for short walks around our apartment complex or to the attached garage to get something out of the fridge/freezer). She just sits in her recliner knitting and watching Netflix or scrolling social on her phone.

She had a UTI that she took antibiotics for (only a five day course and I'm not sure she finished the course), but she has buzzing in her ears, is constantly lightheaded and can barely move. She doesn't do anything for herself anymore. She barely eats - she has colitis and is constantly flaring because when she does eat, it's garbage - doughy bagels with the thinnest spread of peanut butter, salami, chips, salty peanuts. 

She refuses to make an appointment with an ENT or a gastroenterologist or primary to get a full checkup. She would prefer not to know if there's something seriously wrong. 

I am supposed to move in August for my job, but my dad works full-time, my brother works full-time+ and we don't have anyone local to us to help out. I'm incredibly worried, but she won't hear my feelings. She thinks I'm being ridiculous to be worried. We're supposed to go on a family cruise in October, but I don't see how she'll be well enough to be at sea for sixteen days with no way to obtain medical care (I know there is a ship doctor, but I also they aren't equipped for major trouble). 

I don't know what to do - I'm trying to make things as easy as possible for her (I don't ask for anything, we leave all decisions to her comfort level), but she's scaring the living daylights out of me. I just found out she didn't wear a mask the whole time she and my dad were out the other day - COVID will be the end of her because she won't see a doctor.

Any advice would be most welcome. Thank you! Happy Easter and Chag Sameach to all who celebrate."
"My parents had me at an old age, my father was in his late 60s and my mother in her 50s. Knowing they were older caused me and my siblings to worry about them and care for them since we were very young. Every so often i think about it and I’m already grieving them and they’re still here. I find myself crying over the fact that I’m going to lose them sooner than i want to. Now I’m 22 and my father is 88 and I worry everyday. He’s unable to walk now and has recently fallen. I am at college so he never told me this happened until I saw him while visiting this weekend. He had two black eyes so I asked and he had to tell me what happened. He has fallen several times in the past several years and is always too proud to tell us unless we really annoy him. As I’m in the car after saying goodbye, on my way back to campus, I looked up the black eyes and they’re called raccoon eyes, and are a result of a very serious head injury even fracture. My mom said she’s tried to take him to the doctor but he won’t go. I just asked to try again and she said she will. I love them so much and it breaks my heart to see them age. I wish I could stop it all from happening."
"You know what ticks me off, I’m sorry this is a rant because it’s so frustrating how parents who are fundamentalists like to use the Bible to justify their bad parenting decisions and behaviour when they were younger and guilt trip Adult  children into having a relationship with them  now that they’re older and feeble . 
My dad is full of crap, first class regurgitated crap. 
This man went and had a whole other family and with tell us every single day that you know there were other children that were more deserving than we were and we should be so grateful and we should run I’ll keep and work out and work for I’ll keep. 
I literally felt like this man did not want to have kids and sometimes he would sit there and he was talk and fat shame my mom while we were there. And she just sat there and took it- “because he is the head of the household “
 He now has the temerity to to stand on his soap box  and say that we my siblings and I from my mom must look after they must seek counsel for them all of a sudden he is using the Bible to justify why we as his children that by the way he hated all this time must now be on his beck  and call, all because his other children and secret family don’t pay him any mind now. 
fuck him I will look after him until the day he dies and do my duty as a child ,  but we will never be have anything beyond that. 
The very reason I struggled with image issues that I am working through now is because of him, but no- he “is anointed by G-d and therefore could do no wrong or can be questioned about anything.”"
"And I am so fucking angry. I'm seething. I'm so full of rage I can hardly imagine it fading. I'm choking on it. And before anyone suggests it, I have a therapist.

My dad died of a heart attack at home last week. I jumped on a plane, left my life, and came back to take care of my mom for an indefinite amount of time. I haven't been back in 2.5 years and... oh my god. The state of this house, of her, and of their finances... I'm suddenly a full-time carer, responsible for an old, crumbling, hoarders house, and handling everything. 

The thing is, I'm an only child. They have no friends. They have no close family. Their health had been failing for years and they've done nothing but hide the reality from me. I fled from here and built a life in another country, went low contact, yet here I am.

Mom can't live here on her own. There's no care set up. She can't stand on her own for more than a few minutes at a time. She knows nothing of her finances. But more than anything, she couldn't care less what their lack of foresight and planning will do to my life. I can't even have an adult conversation about it with her. Even after the same thing happened to them with both their mothers... even after all the conversations and pleading I've done throughout the years. Have a look through my comments/posts if you want some examples.

And this state she's in? Stage 4 COPD. Oxygen 24/7. Her saturation levels dip into the mid 60s when she walks from one room to the next. Why did they let this get so bad? She doesn't even have a will (which is getting rectified Monday). 

I can't mourn. I can't live. I can't breathe until this house is cleared out, sold, and mom is in a place where I can return to my life. My god I'm so angry.

I've lurked here for a while, preparing. And I guess now I'm stepping up into the light. I'm glad to have this community. Thank you for listening."
"I have a very frail around 80 year old father.  He has trouble walking; he can (maybe) get around with a walker if he has to, but last year he fell and broke bones.

He has 24/7 home health aides.

In the morning before he gets up, he’ll call the home health aide (by calling out their names; they sleep in a bedroom about 20 feet from his).

But one doesn’t come, unless he keeps calling for maybe 15 minutes. So my father will get out of bed by himself and walk down the hallway with his walker.  The aide will say, “I was in the bathroom so I can’t come immediately”.  But that excuse is not true.  

And when my father is in the living room, he’ll get out of his recliner (which is electric and can raise itself) and walk down the hallway with his walker and go to the restroom by himself.  The home health aide will be in another room about 30 feet away and will call out, “do you need help?” but won’t get up to follow him.

I’m concerned that my father will fall, either in getting out of bed or walking to the restroom (or in navigating in the restroom by himself).  The home health aide, in my view, needs to jump up whenever he needs help for these things: otherwise he’s going to fall at some point.  But the home health aide just sits in bed or sits watching tv and doesn’t come help.

When I’m at home, I get up (even if it’s 4am) and come to my father’s bedroom if he calls out and the aide doesn’t come quickly.  And if I hear him walking by himself, I dash to shadow him.

Am I being too demanding in expecting a home health aide to come when he needs, and to follow him closely when he walks even if he doesn’t ask for help?

Thanks."
"My Dad has diabetes and COPD. He eats nothing but sweets and baked goods that he or my mom buys for him. He smoked my entire life except for the last year, when diagnosed for copd. 

He is out of breath constantly and I know this is only going to get worse. And I don’t care. I spent years in the ‘80s, 90s and 00s when I was a kid and teen begging him to quit. And now here we are, gasping for air at times. Is this a shock to you? It isn’t to me. 

My only sibling committed suicide 10 years ago so I here I am cleaning up the mess made by others. 

Does anyone have a book or podcast recommendation on how to deal with the anger that comes from ppl not practicing self care for decades and then looking to me to give them care? 

Thank you for your time"
"My 69 yr old mother was admitted to the hospital with a stroke.
We have a large support system of family and friends locally.  Everyone is asking what they can do. I understand they need/want to feel useful and support us. At this point though there's really nothing to be done. 
Any suggestions on tasks to give them?"
"Earlier this morning my mother blew up on me while I was driving her to a doctor's appointment.

She made assumptions about something I've already told her multiple times previously in the past and got extremely mad at me and blamed me. Said, I like to ""rub it in her face"" that she's unable to remember things and that I should just repeat them without questions. 🤦🏻‍♀️

Honestly the repetitiveness of our conversations really annoys and frustrates me now. 

And although I've been waiting for a new therapist to try and help me work through my life issues.. I wanted to hear others experiences and maybe ideas of what I can work on.

My mother and I have never really had a good relationship, but she's elderly. I'm an only child and she's all I have now so I'm trying hard to improve my communicational skills and check on my mental well-being seeing I have a toddler and I want to set good boundaries and a healthy relationship within our family for his upbringing."
"Dad is 78, in an ALF, been there for 6 months (been my responsibility for 1.5 years now), made no plans or preparations for this time of his life, it's become my problem, no other family to help or ""block"" this constant interaction, and he has major depression/anxiety issues that pretty much affect him like he has dementia.


I'm just at this point where I don't know how to respond to him anymore. I've tried all the things people have suggested for me to do and it never works. Be kind, be understanding, be agreeable, deflect, ignore it, yes them to death. Nothing works.



I get these daily phone calls. Same conversation every time.
Him: ""Oh, just calling to say hi.""
Me: ""Hi, what's up?""
Him: ""You won't believe how crazy it is here. It is just so crazy!"" Proceeds to tell me how (for example) the staff went in his room to look for him because he wasn't in his usual spot, complains about having to wait to get in the dining room for his meals, there's too many people, then there's not enough people. You name it, if it's mundane enough, he'll complain about it.


So, today I instantly just say nothing and let him go on and on. For one, I don't want to hear it. I replied to the staff looking for him with, ""Well, they were just doing their job and making sure you are ok."" That pisses him off and I get a, ""OK then! Well, you have a nice day. Bye."" 



This is what I deal with constantly. No matter what I say, it's not good enough. Or I don't say enough. What am I supposed to do in this situation?


He lies about dumb things or completely over-exaggerates. I don't directly call him out about it, but I'll maybe ask a few questions (like a lawyer would do lol) and now he's outted himself and realizes it. Again, then I'm the jerk. 



When I go to his ALF, he's like a damn celebrity. He knows everyone, knows the other resident's family, the staff love him and tell me how great he is. Why do I get to deal with the manipulative liar?? The person who makes sure he's not living on the street and gets taken care of properly. I don't get it.


I know he's bored, I know he feels like he's lost his independence, I'm sure he worries about how things will progress with him physically. I've tried over the past year to help with things like boredom and letting him do things on his own. Nothing sticks. Nothing works. 


I've done it all from hiring companions to giving him little jobs to giving him things to entertain himself. He won't entertain himself. It's like he's just waiting and wants to be ready for his life to change and doesn't want any distractions from that...he seriously used to think one of the nurses or companions would take him home with them and he'd live a regular life again. When do you get to a point of acceptance? He's been in facilities for 1.5 years now. 



Thanks for reading this rambling. I know I might sound awful, and I've posted on here before...I never have good days with him. It's always sad or irritating. I feel bad for getting to this low point where I'm about to be like, ""Fuck it. What's the point."" Any advice or insight appreciated."
"I've been doing my Mom's taxes since 2014 when my older brother died. He's previously been doing them with TurboTax, so I picked up where he left off. My mother's income is not complicated, but it's getting worse every year because her memory and cognition are declining. 

This year, we made and agreed on a place to keep all mail that arrived that was related to taxes, on her mostly-unused fancy dining room table. I made sure some important documents ended up there, but then there were her stock 1099s. She keeps track of all her stocks and dividends in a huge, ancient handwritten ledger. It used to be impressively accurate. Not anymore. She had gotten check stubs from dividend checks all confused with the 1099s, and then 1099s for some stocks were just missing. I had to spend five hours on the phone and online yesterday tracking down the missing information. They all had dates of when they'd mailed a 1099 to her, but she had no idea where they are. And the surface of her table has ended up covered in stacks of various bills, bank statements, junk mail, health insurance, car insurance, etc..., all mixed up, plus some stuff in grocery bags on the floor. I had to go through all of it, sifting for the things I needed. 

And before anyone makes the suggestion, yes, we need to get all her stocks placed in a stock account at a company where all this can be managed electronically. We were about to do that right before the start of the pandemic, but then we were trying to keep her isolated to protect her from COVID. 

Throughout it all, I kept having to repress the feeling of being furious at her for dumping me into this chaos when we'd agreed where all this stuff was to be put. But at the same time, I know she can't help it. But my own life became very chaotic in January and February when this stuff would have been coming in, so I didn't have time to go through her mail every day to make sure things got put in the right place. 

I got everything done I could get done, but I'm not 100% sure about two energy stocks because they are taking the entire weekend off, so I may need to file an extension. At least I know it's right to within a few dollars."
"I love my mom so much. She's done so much for me in my life and I just want her to be happy and healthy.

But she is so incredibly stubborn and refuses to listen to me and my brother was emotionally abusive to her when he took care of her and my dad these past few years and never took her to doctors, dentists or anything. 

I was so relieved to move her in with me and my fiance but now I am dealing with the ramifications of ignoring her health issues for so long. She stopped caring for her teeth a long time ago and when I finally took her to a dentist earlier this year he said that most of her teeth were infected and needed to be removed. It will cost us something like $12k to remove all her teeth and install snap on dentures, in addition to a liquid only diet for months while she recovers. The dentist said it would be a traumatic procedure, especially for depressed older patients. Mom doesn't want the surgery and my brother is also against it because ""she doesn't want it done"" but in my opinion I also think that he doesn't want to pay the money. The truth is that if we don't fix her teeth, the infection will eventually hit her bloodstream which would be fatal. I cried a lot after this because I'm not going to force her to go through with it, so I'm just going to be watching her slowly die.

Then one day this week, she suddenly asked me to help her get out of bed. I was shocked to see how much pain she was in, struggling to sit up - I had no idea because she never told me. I would always ask her how she was feeling, if she was in any pain and she would always answer that she was fine. I've been asking her if she wanted painkillers for the pain and she immediately says yes, which is disconcerting because she had always hated painkillers throughout her life. I took her to an urgent care doctor that day - they took X-Rays and the preliminary diagnosis is that she has osteoarthritis in her hip joint and degenerative disc disease in her lower back, on top of overall osteoporosis. 

I'm so upset and stressed, I woke up after sleeping 4 hours worried about her and went to go check on her. She needed to use the bathroom so I helped her, but now I can't fall back asleep because I keep worrying about her.

My fiance and I are also scheduled to take a flight out of town next Friday. He's also going to see a specialist for some of his health issues and I am coming along to help drive him to and from his appointments. I was also looking forward to the change of scenery and do sightseeing/hiking, which I haven't been able to do in years and was really looking forward to. Up until now, I was feeling OK with leaving my mom alone for a few days but now that she's in so much pain, I'm scared of leaving her alone and I'm torn between cancelling the trip and paying the money to drop her off at a respite place. I'm worried that I wouldn't be able to find one in time and/or they would treat her badly or that they won't understand her because her english is not very good."
"My Grandmother (99) has always been very independent. She got married young, was widowed shortly before all the kids were out of the house, and had lived alone for the better part of the last fifty years. She had a stroke fifteen years ago and my brother (45) moved in with her to take care of her. My Uncle1 (78) has Power of attorney over her finances and investments, is the executor of her will, etc., but lives several hundred miles away.  My mother(73), lives over a thousand miles away. My Uncle2 lives about ten miles from Grandma, but only saw her once or twice per year before her stroke. After her stroke, he would take Grandma and Bro shopping once or twice a month and write checks from her account for her bills. In and out in an hour or so. 

In the past 15 years, under my brother's care, she has had a minor cardiac event, a blood pressure issue that made her lightheaded, and that's about it. He makes sure she eats and takes her meds, helps when asked, gives her space when she wants it and pushes her when she needs it. They have a routine worked out that they both are happy with.

A month ago she mentioned having pain in her left arm. As she uses that arm exclusively after the stroke, my brother called my uncle2 to get her an appointment with a doctor, because my uncle had insisted on monitoring her medical care. After much examination and repeated questioning, she admitted that she may have bumped her arm. She was sent to a recovery facility to give her a few days of care and allow her to rest her arm and heal. My brother tried to visit her but was told that he needed not only the vaccine, which he had, but a booster, which he didn't to be allowed inside. So he got a booster and called back to see how long he had to wait after the booster before he could visit only to be told all he needed was the vaccine. He finally saw her a little over a week after she went in and she asked him when she was going home. They talked about moving furniture to make things easier when she went home, she asked for him to call me to help him get things ready. I (47), DD (21), and DH (50) drove the couple hundred miles to help clean and move furniture because our jobs are less tied down to location. 

While driving Bro sent me an email that Uncle1 had sent to Mom after a call from Uncle2. He said that Grandma says she likes the facility better than home and so they need to evict Bro, clean the house out of all the ""junk"", and sell it. He said that Uncle2 says there is nothing even worth selling at a yard sale, but if she wants anything she should probably go get it in the near future. He specifically mentioned a few items that were well known to be valuable and well established to be willed to other people. As executor of the will he should have been well aware of that, but apparently didn't remember or doesn't care.  

We went and saw Grandma, and had a video call so she could see Sis and Mom. talked to her roommate and nurses. They all said of course she wants to go home. She said on the call she wants to go home. Her hearing aid is having issues and we suspect there is a blockage of wax in her ear so she wasn't hearing well. We asked that they have her ear checked. The nurses say that only Uncle2 can authorize that. Only Uncle2 can authorize getting info about her over the phone or taking her outside. Mom has called repeatedly to get info and has been given the runaround.   We talked to the social worker at the facility who said there was no reason Uncle2 should keep info from his siblings and she would ask him to authorize their names to be added to the list. He refused. She said there was no reason to keep grandma there and she obviously was doing better at home. That was two weeks ago. We had to go home to deal with our own issues. Uncle2 has been visiting a few times per week. Bro has been visiting a few times per week. Grandma has been telling him she wants to come home, but Uncle 2 says she wants to stay there. She has had pain in her hands and feet after Uncle2 visits and gets her to say she wants to stay. The social worker did imply an elder abuse investigation may be warranted. Mom and stepdad can't come to visit until the end of the month and wanted to get Uncle1 involved because he is really the only one who can override Uncle2's decisions. Uncle1 was very angry Mom had shared his email and is now firmly on Uncle2's side because as he says Uncle2 has taken care of her for twenty years and would never do anything to hurt her. Uncle2 has always been a manipulative sadist who uses his police badge to get what he wants for as long as I have known him, but his brother doesn't visit often and only seems to see him in his best light.

Any advice on dealing with this situation? Should I let the older generation make the decisions for her or push for Grandma to make up her own mind? Is there any way I can get Grandma some protection from Uncle2?"
"My aging parents (66 and 63) recently (against my wishes) recently purchased a 3-storey + basement townhouse. They'll be moving into it in a few weeks, and I am very worried that they'll fall at some point without anyone knowing. My mom currently walks with a bit of a limp, which is even more worrisome. As you would expect, they are very stubborn and push that they will be fine. 

They are considering selling the property in 10 years and switch to an apartment, but what can happen in those 10 years with so many flights of stairs makes me very worried. Especially with so many stairs. The bedroom floor is on the top level and the main ""living"" floor (kitchen, living, dining) are on the floor below it.

Anyone run into a similar situation and know of anything that was useful to install for your parents?

Some ideas i've been thinking of:  
\- Motion sensor-based lights on the staircases: My mom likes to not use electricity even when she might need it, so to avoid a situation where she goes down/up in the dark I thought these might be useful.  
\- Robo vacuums so my mom doesn't have to worry about cleaning multiple floors  
\- Smart lock: for seeing who is at the door, locking/unlocking without moving, etc. Not sure which brand would be a good choice yet but would like it to be integrated to a hub along with security cameras.  
\- Security cameras  
\- Some kind of fall detection device (e.g. apple watch)  
\- Alexa/Google nest hub so I can ""drop in"" occasionally to check everything is ok.  
\- Smart home / voice control assistant with Cantonese/Vietnamese support: Right now i have a google home set up for them already, but my mom barely speaks any English so it would be great to have something that's more voice supportive in case of an emergency.

I was even thinking about how we could get around reducing the amount of work it took to bring groceries up, though not much came up in my research.

Edit: laundry is on the first floor ;("
"Hey all. It's me again.

So, backstory, I (33 F) temporarily moved in with my mom (83 F) as she needs almost regular assistance at home. She has mobility issues, and has trouble cleaning up after herself, getting dressed, preparing her meals, etc. She has a home aide come in 6 hours a day that helps her with lunch, bathing, exercising, etc., and I fill in the gaps when the aide leaves (breakfast, dinner). Occasionally, I have to clean up after my mom after pooping, as she can no longer do it herself.

I work from home right now, and put my 2nd job on hold. But, I have an upcoming business trip that will last for 12 days. I told my sister (50 F) this, hoping she would volunteer herself, as she has no other obligations (in a relationship, but no kids) and lives an hour and a half away and can work remotely. Well, she didn't volunteer herself, and when I asked, she refused. I don't think she'll be able to handle it either.

You see, she has zero empathy. What she wants is to leave my mom alone and let the aide clean up after her when they come it at 9am. Mom wakes up at 6am, she cannot miss her meals because she is diabetic. Mom insists on walking and standing, but without a walker, or if she turns too fast or loses her balance, she is a fall risk. My sister also refuses to clean up my mom when she goes to the bathroom. She also freezes up in an emergency situation (she pretended to sleep while her boyfriend was choking because she didn't know what to do).

I can ask my aunt, but she is a primary caregiver to her husband, who is also a fall risk and needs minor care. I'm just... I'm so frustrated with my sister because she's the older one, she should know these things. Add to that, she is the biological child, and I'm adopted. Don't get me wrong, that doesn't change the fact that my mom and I love each other, but you would think that that sort of bond should be stronger. I don't really know.

After my dad died less than a month ago (and getting rushed to the hospital 2 months ago), and then moving my mom and myself into a new apartment in >2 weeks, while also juggling 2 jobs and other obligations... I'm just so very tired, I didn't even have time to grieve. I needed to keep everyone in line and keep things going. I even caught COVID in-between moving (thankfully mom hasn't moved in yet so it gave me time to quarantine in the new apartment).

I'm so tired.  


  
UPDATE TO ADD: Before I moved in, my sister and I checked out the apartment where we eventually moved in. She said it looks nice, the neighborhood is great, there's wifi and ""I can work here and stay here if you're away."" I held on to that, and now that I need help..... well. :( "
"Hello everyone! New here but hoping this isn’t a redundant post (I searched but don’t know if there’s a correct term for what I’m looking for). 

Are there services that will come in to advise how to make a home safer for a mobility challenged older adult? My father has had some significant reductions in mobility very quickly recently and isn’t making great decisions to boot. He recently bought a condo (I was pushing for a change to an independent but supervised living arrangement). Against my wishes, he started to move some things in on his own the day of closing (clothes, etc, nothing heavy) and had a bad fall and shattered his nose and broke his jaw (I had no clue he was doing this until I received a call at 11pm that night from the ER nurse). 

Since he’s adamant about staying on his own, I want to make the condo as safe as possible (not sure he’ll actually use anything as 2 years ago he was told to use a shower seat; I bought it since he wouldn’t; it’s still in the box). I have zero clue other than like bathroom grab bars. I’d really like to have someone come out and determine what all needs to be done to accommodate his disabilities. 

Thanks!"
"Hi everyone. I’m a 27 yr old, only-child  working as a flight attendant living in a different city than my Mom. My mother has struggled with health issues primarily related to depression for the last 10yrs and has formed a huge codependency on me even though she works full time. I was flying back to my hometown twice a month to see her bc she always made me feel so guilty.  

This last month she got a blood infection (related to another health condition but result of lack of self care) and she’s been in the hospital for the past few weeks. She’s having difficulty walking and her memory mirrors that of dementia. She hasn’t been diagnosed with anything neurological but there’s clearly an issue. She will be transitioning to a rehab to work on her physical strength but afterwards discharged to go home. She’s 47, single, and lives alone. 

Am I expected to now be her full care taker FOREVER? I hate to sound insensitive but my mom is 47. I don’t have the space in my apartment for someone else and I also travel full time for work. Is the only other option really a nursing home? She has been asking me when I plan on moving back home to care for her but I don’t want to. I also don’t want her moving to my city expecting that level of care because I am constantly on the go and I don’t even know if I want to live in this country at all. 🥺 Im sad for her but the situation is difficult just because when she was physically able to care for herself, she didn’t have the motivation. She even tells me now that I’m her only reason to live. U don’t put that type of pressure on someone."
"There seems to be a serious lack of accessible technologies for seniors, especially ones with tremors and vision problems, etc. Are there specific accessible technologies you guys use to video call with them?"
"Long story short: my frail grandmother has been in hospital for 6 months.  She has failed to thrive or co-operate with physio, leaving her now with virtually no independence and bedbound.  She contracted covid a few weeks ago, but was fine until around day 8 when she suddenly deteriorated extremely rapidly, leading her doctor to indicate to us that her death was imminent.   I was called home from where I live to say my goodbyes.

Fast forward to today, two weeks later, and she has made a (relatively speaking) good recovery after the assistance of oxygen and IV fluids.  Just as it looked like the situation was stabilising to the extent where we could begin to think about trying to get back to life again, she has now been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia - although so far appears to be responding well to the antibiotics.  

Whilst I do not grudge for a moment being here to support my mum and grandmother, the emotional toll of the uncertainly of the whole ordeal is becoming increasingly heavy.  I'm wracked with constant anxiety, waiting for another phone call from the hospital to say something has happened, or she's picked up another infection.  There is absolutely no indication one way or another as to what the next day/week/month will look like for her.  My life is now on pause, and my very generous partner's along with it whilst we wait and see.  I can't go home - I live on an island that is only served by three ferries a day.  If I got a call saying I needed to be at the hospital ASAP, there's no way off the island after 4pm until 7am the next morning.  

How do you cope with the total lack of certainty?  I can barely relax, I can't concentrate at work, and there's no end in sight to any of this.  Visiting the hospital for hours every day (to help her eat, and to stave off lonliness) is physically and emotionally exhausting, and although I do not grudge it, there is no resbite from it.  It's going to break me soon enough, and then I'll be no use to anyone."
"I'm having a really tough time with my dad and step mom right now. A year and a half ago, they were doing great. Dad got a good company running, making good money, bought his dream car, and they finalized plans to demolish their old house and build their dream house. They were traveling and playing golf. Both 70 years old. 

Then last year, right after they got moved to a 3 story rental house and demo had begun on the old one, dad was diagnosed with brain cancer. The real bad kind. And now everything is fucked. I was a month out from finishing school for a new career, which is now stalled and I depend on my partner, which I hate but am grateful for. 

This is incredibly difficult for everyone. I try to have understanding and empathy for my stepmother, who is his primary caregiver. But she is making this bad situation even worse for everyone and I don't know know how to help and to keep my own sanity and some sort of life to go back to when this is done. 

My stepmother is small, frail, and has osteoporosis. She's also become insufferable in her negativity and guilt tripping. I think she's in denial and thinks this will all be fine eventually. The fact is, it won't, but she refuses to hear that.

I do understand much of her anger is because she's overwhelmed, afraid, sad and angry. I try not to take it to heart and to help as much as I can and to accommodate her as much as possible. But it's hard! She insists everything be done a certain way. Dad must eat 5 million times a day, hungry or not, or she accuses him of not fighting hard enough. He must take his medicine at exact times. She gets upset with him for changing the subject or not getting ready in time, she thinks he's being difficult on purpose, buut its pretty obvious to me these difficulties are due to the brain tumor. She only speaks of negativity and his illness, never anything positive any more. 

I live an 8 hour drive away and have a sister who lives across the country. I have a life in my town, though I'm at a point where I was between obligations, so I've been able to visit at least every month for a week or more. When I'm there, my job is to ""motivate"" my dad and follow her scheduling for him. I'm a little more laid back and try to allow him as much autonomy as possible, so she sees me as lazy and unwilling to *really* help out. But he still eats and gets his meds.

Even so, she wants me there constantly. When I do go home to tend to my partner and my life, she starts texting within days about when exactly my next trip will be because they need me for: insert mini crisis. I know she's just having a hard time and coping by trying to control what she can, but it's a lot. 

I do not think they should be on their own. I've offered and tried to get some in-home help but they've fired a few and refused any more. She claims dad won't have it and they can't afford it. They have plenty of money and great insurance, but she acts like the only way to get help is to find someone on Craigslist and pay thousands out of pocket. 

Stepmom will be getting surgery for her shoulder later this month, which I'd agreed to come stay to help care for her after. But I'm feeling afraid that I won't be able to handle both of their care on my own. Dad is not very mobile, is in briefs, and forgetful. He does have a lift chair and cane, but he needs a lot of supervision and tends to need a very long time to move from one place to the next. And they have a 3 story house and use each level (bedroom, living, office.) She'll need help also.

I have fractured my ankle and am on crutches so I won't have full mobility myself. Stepmo's been hounding me about plans, though I've already told her when I'll be there but must finalize with my doctor first. She's not thrilled about me hurting my ankle. 

She asked if I thought I'd need extra help. I said yes, absolutely! And then proceeded to launch a big passive aggressive text about how they will be sure not to hurt my poor little ankle and she's oh so sorry that their cancer and surgeries have imposed on me. She insinuates that since she can handle it I should too. I feel like she's trying to set me up to fail. 

I'm about at my limit for being her anger outlet. My life has been on hold so that she can pretend everything is fine. I know she's there all the time and I'm not, but this is still difficult all of us, she's not the only one affected. 

They won't take any suggestions for help, but I think we're going to have to overrule them on that at some point. I can't force her to stop martyring herself for my dad but I can set boundaries for myself and what I'm willing to do. 

Also, my sister has offered to move in with them or even just near them,  to help. But my sister has kids and stepmother doesn't know her as well as me, so she is against that idea. She was even against a visit from them, claiming she wouldn't be able to cook and entertain that many people, which is an absurd thing to say since she was coming to help. 

I'd been asking my parents to move closer to me for years rather than rebuild. They insisted they can't because their life and friends are in their current town. They're still building the damn house, which includes things like custom short countertops, (because she's short,) and the kind of tile the builder suggested against because no one wants it these days and will make it harder to sell. 

The house building cost is dependant on my dad's salary from running his company. Not ideal. He has trouble standing up and finding his email icon on his computer. He's lost any sense of time and what day or month it is. Keeps adding if it's time to turn on the Superbowl. It's not sustainable to think he can continue running the company for long. Of course stepmom would like for me to take that responsibility over...  along with doing their last year's taxes. Ya know, just little things like that. I told her that was beyond my pay grade.

Dad very likely doesn't have long. I hate that we can't seem to give him any rest or joy at this time. I try to be there as much as I can so that he hears something kind and more than her grumbling at him. They always had a great, happy relationship, and this is really sad. I know he just wants to make her happy. And he said that all he wants is to be able to spend one night in that new house. I'd love to make that happen but it's getting to a point that it may not be possible. We don't always get a happy ending I guess. 

I'm feeling helpless and overwhelmed. I want to be sympathetic to my stepmother and appreciate what she's doing for my dad. I try to be gentle and understanding. But she's never satisfied and keeps moving the goalposts on me. I can't force them to get help. But I can't continue to sacrifice my own life so they can pretend everything is going to plan, (if only her husband's loser daughter would step up and help a little!)

I'm trying to find a balance between helping and not getting steamrolled. I don't want to leave them hanging. I don't want to leave my dad alone with her while she's acting like this. I think I've done my best and will continue to do so. I am trying to let the guilt tripping roll off and not get to me. But it's hard, especially when I'm away from home and immersed in it for weeks at a time. 

It helped to write all this out anyway. I just needed to get this off my chest."
"My phone conversation with my 78 year old mom who lives in another state with my dad (82) who has physical and cognitive decline. 
Me: it’s so nice that my sisters & their families are coming in for Seder this weekend. 
Mom: not really. 
Me: they are taking care of everything & you & dad won’t be alone. 
Mom: a lot of it still falls on me. And it’s very different than going to someone else’s house, eating then you get to leave. 
All of my friends are going to one of their kids houses. 
Me: you could’ve traveled to one of us. You’re always welcome. 
Mom: let me tell you something. Nobody cares. 
While we are on the phone my dad walks into the kitchen asking where the juice is. 
Mom: do NOT keep drinking the juice! I’m not willing to keep replenishing it! (She is always screaming at him). 
I can’t even stand talking to her on the phone. What’s gonna happen when I visit in a couple weeks?"
"Reading this sub has made me feel so lucky. 

I have two siblings.  We all live in the same city as my parents, and we all help in different ways.  Some a bit more, some a bit less, based on our expertise and availability.  We each have our assigned areas of responsibility (health/transportation/bills+finances/tech support, etc), and we try to rebalance if one load is getting too heavy.

They are financially comfortable, and we're in Canada so healthcare is not a financial concern. We're not at the point that we need assisted living, but when we do, it won't be an extreme hardship. 

My father is such a nice person to take care of.  He is genuinely appreciative for everything we do for him, and says nice things to each of us about what the other siblings have done lately. I actually feel glad that I am in a position that I can help him in his time of need, and it lets me spend time with him. 

Some days I get down when it feels like I have too much on my plate.  Thank you all for making me appreciate how easy I have it."
"**Key facts**

Between 2015 and 2050, the proportion of the world's population over 60 years will nearly double from 12% to 22%.

By 2020, the number of people aged 60 years and older will outnumber children younger than 5 years.

The pace of population ageing is much faster than in the past.

All countries face major challenges to ensure that their health and social systems are ready to make the most of this demographic shift.

**Overview**

People worldwide are living longer. Today most people can expect to live into their sixties and beyond. Every country in the world is experiencing growth in both the size and the proportion of older persons in the population.

By 2030, 1 in 6 people in the world will be aged 60 years or over. At this time the share of the population aged 60 years and over will increase from 1 billion in 2020 to 1.4 billion. By 2050, the world’s population of people aged 60 years and older will double (2.1 billion). The number of persons aged 80 years or older is expected to triple between 2020 and 2050 to reach 426 million.

While this shift in distribution of a country's population towards older ages – known as population ageing – started in high-income countries (for example in Japan 30% of the population is already over 60 years old), it is now low- and middle-income countries that are experiencing the greatest change. By 2050, two-thirds of the world’s population over 60 years will live in low- and middle-income countries.

**Common health conditions associated with ageing**

Common conditions in older age include hearing loss, cataracts and refractive errors, back and neck pain and osteoarthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, depression and dementia. As people age, they are more likely to experience several conditions at the same time.

Older age is also characterized by the emergence of several complex health states commonly called geriatric syndromes. They are often the consequence of multiple underlying factors and include frailty, urinary incontinence, falls, delirium and pressure ulcers.

**Factors influencing healthy ageing**

A longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole. Additional years provide the chance to pursue new activities such as further education, a new career or a long-neglected passion. Older people also contribute in many ways to their families and communities. Yet the extent of these opportunities and contributions depends heavily on one factor: health.

Evidence suggests that the proportion of life in good health has remained broadly constant, implying that the additional years are in poor health. If people can experience these extra years of life in good health and if they live in a supportive environment, their ability to do the things they value will be little different from that of a younger person. If these added years are dominated by declines in physical and mental capacity, the implications for older people and for society are more negative.

Although some of the variations in older people’s health are genetic, most is due to people’s physical and social environments – including their homes, neighbourhoods, and communities, as well as their personal characteristics – such as their sex, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. The environments that people live in as children – or even as developing fetuses–combined with their personal characteristics, have long-term effects on how they age.

Physical and social environments can affect health directly or through barriers or incentives that affect opportunities, decisions and health behaviour. Maintaining healthy behaviours throughout life, particularly eating a balanced diet, engaging in regular physical activity and refraining from tobacco use, all contribute to reducing the risk of non-communicable diseases, improving physical and mental capacity and delaying care dependency.

Supportive physical and social environments also enable people to do what is important to them, despite losses in capacity. The availability of safe and accessible public buildings and transport, and places that are easy to walk around, are examples of supportive environments. In developing a public-health response to ageing, it is important not just to consider individual and environmental approaches that ameliorate the losses associated with older age, but also those that may reinforce recovery, adaptation and psychosocial growth.

**Challenges in responding to population ageing**

There is no typical older person. Some 80-year-olds have physical and mental capacities similar to many 30-year-olds. Other people experience significant declines in capacities at much younger ages. A comprehensive public health response must address this wide range of older people’s experiences and needs.

The diversity seen in older age is not random. A large part arises from people’s physical and social environments and the impact of these environments on their opportunities and health behaviour. The relationship we have with our environments is skewed by personal characteristics such as the family we were born into, our sex and our ethnicity, leading to inequalities in health.

Older people are often assumed to be frail or dependent and a burden to society. Public health professionals, and society as a whole, need to address these and other ageist attitudes, which can lead to discrimination, affect the way policies are developed and the opportunities older people have to experience healthy aging.

Globalization, technological developments (e.g.,in transport and communication), urbanization, migration and changing gender norms are influencing the lives of older people in direct and indirect ways. A public health response must take stock of these current and projected trends and frame policies accordingly.

**In doing so, age-friendly practices:**

1.recognise the wide range of capacities and resources among older people;

2.anticipate and respond flexibly to ageing-related needs and preferences;

3.respect older people's decisions and lifestyle choices;

4.reduce inequities;protect those who are most vulnerable;

5.promote older people's inclusion in and contribute to all areas of community life.

6.Pay more attention and company.If there is no time to accompany them, you can buy Digital Picture Frame for parents or grandparents, so that they can see us at any time, such as NPET Smart LCD Digital Picture Frame, high-speed wifi transmission and 10.1-inch screen, which can be faster and more efficient. Clearly see the person we want to see, and give companionship and warmth to them."
"Hi all! My dad, who gets extremely dizzy and falls a lot, agreed to get a walker. But there’s so much variety and we are not in a position where we can consult a specialist. 

I am thinking about the kind without wheels, with handles on two levels, so that dad can use it to get up from the bed. But I’m not sure about the width. Wide is more stable, right? But I’ve seen reviews from unhappy customers that complained about the walker being wider than stated (and it wasn’t super wide).

If someone’s parent suffers from dizziness and loss of coordination, could you please share their experience with a walker? What should I look for and what to avoid?

Edit: unfortunately, anything more complicated than a basic walker is not an option for now."
"If you live away from your aging folks, how often do you fly in to help the sibling who lives near them? Under normal circumstances, how often do you go visit?

Would you go if Mom was in the hospital? 

Would you go if it was clear that the “at home” sibling was “losing it” with the stress of caring for the parents? 

Would you go if your sibling asked you to? 

I would really appreciate some honest answers here. As the “at home” sibling, I am trying to access if my expectations of help are too high. Thank you!!"
"My father regularly goes to the VA, but we only hear his medical conditions from him. We know he has COPD, but not sure what else except he lets us know sometimes he falls while at home. We recently had dinner with him and he smelled horribly, we told him to shower. Also he never lets anyone in his home, like he’s embarrassed of the interior (we suspect dirty). He does not drive and visits the American Legion down the street 2-3x/week. 

Recently, no one would contact him for 24 hours so my brother used his spare key to enter and my dad wasn’t there. But, the house was disgusting. Very hoarder situation, probably months of takeout food containers piled up, clothes spread out, bugs all in the fridge, burnt ceiling (smokes inside), broken windows in the back, bottles of pee lined up. 

My brother drove to the Legion and my dad was shitfaced and didn’t recognize my brother even after 5 minutes. He has drank all his life and even when inebriated recognized close ones. My brother had to show him a picture of them together for my dad to believe.

We are thinking of getting POA somehow, his home is seriously a health hazard. Is there anything the VA offers for this? We’d ideally want him in assisted living or somewhere that he can’t get away with the unsanitary conditions."
"My father has become a danger to himself. He has been almost no contact, and is allowing a homeless prostitute to live with him after he was widower a 2nd time. 

She steals from him, trades his stuff for drugs, which she then smokes in the house. A roommate has tried to get her out, but every time they change the locks, he gives her the new key.

Is anyone familiar enough with US Elderlaw to give me some ideas? I'm going to have to put him somewhere, but she's stolen so much that none of us can afford an ALF. He's literally mortgaged out too much of his home equity to support her.

A family friend is an attorney, and mentioned getting him declared incapable of making decisions. I don't know enough about it to get him somewhere safe, where he can't just invite prostitutes to live with him again. He's also still driving a car.

TL;DR: how do I get a hooker out of dad's house?"
"Yesterday I wrote an extremely long email to one of my uncles, in the email I asked him to make a good faith effort to help my ill/struggling mom in any way he could think of. This is after exhausting every last capacity I have to pull the weight as her sole caregiver  for a year. I was just thinking it would be nice if he participated in any way, even if it's just calling to check in, or offering advice from time to  time. He responded by telling me that the whole family has known that my mother has struggled with mental health issues, ill health, and poverty for  years. He is not surprised she now needs help. From his perspective, the family has already helped her by sending her a few checks in the mail from time to time to fix her car. He explained that when he goes on trips he pays a service to care for his dog, and that this service is expensive. He also explained that he didn't have the ""courage"" it takes to interact with someone like my mom... Holy hell, she's a perfectly average church lady, she's just  anxious, sick, and poor. I don't know how much courage it takes..."
"I'm here visiting my parents from out of town for the weekend. I used to live in Colorado where I was very happy, but now I live in Pennsylvania which is 4 hours away, so I can be closer to them since they're older. Mom is 76 and dad is 82. 

I am the youngest, by far, of my siblings. My parents had my brothers young and had my late.  My brothers are 13 and 15 years older than me. 

I am the only one who visits them, who cleans the house, or does anything to check on them and make sure they're ok. My oldest brother says since they don't want help, he won't bother. My middle brother just ignores and won't even respond to me. 

I am here now and spent the entire day cleaning their home because it was disgusting. My brothers know but they don't bother to respond to anything. My mom and dad can't take care of themselves anymore, their hygiene is terrible, the house is disgusting, they are not able to take care of themselves but refuse housekeepers, nurses, anything that could help because the house is so gross. They are just declining physically and mentally. 

I have 2 brothers and we each have partners but my partner and I are the only two coming here to help. My partner and i have been together 6 years and both my brothers have long term partners they've been with for 25+ years.  Imagine if we each took a turn once a month and had someone coming in monthly to clean and help and the we could each just come once every 6 months. It would be so much less of a burden. But no one else is willing to take on any kind of inconvenience for our parents. 

I just can't understand how you could let your own parent live this way, or let your baby sister pull all the weight. We all have jobs and lives but why am I the only one sacrificing to try to help our parents??

At the least, they could offer to help pay for my hotel, gas, and tolls to come here once a month but they don't even think to do that. I would love to get my parents to a retirement community or something but they are resistant to that, to cleaning people, to anything that could help... and I have 0 support from my brothers. 

I don't know what to do anymore. If you have advice, I'd love to hear. If you just read all this, thank you.  I am just lost..."
"My mom is very afraid to get a recommended shoulder surgery. Her 2nd opinion doctor told her the recovery will be very difficult for her, and that she should just get cortisone shots but they don't help. She's been disabled for several years now due to arthritis. She's also obese, uses a cane to walk. She has a friend scaring her out of the surgery too, saying she knows someone who hadthe surgery and is worse off. But the alternative is not moving, which leads to more physical and cognitive decline. If she did have the surgery, I imagine she'll go to a short-term rehab facility before going home. I guess I'm looking for some anecdotal info about shoulder replacement surgeries. Can people like her recover from one?"
"Hello all,

So I recently got back in contact with my biological father (66m), who has been on and off the streets/drugs since before I was born and was never really in our lives. 

My brother and I live in South Carolina. He currently lives in Florida and draws social security, and has been staying at a nursing facility the past couple months following an injury and surgery. He also has diabetes and neuropathy. My point of contact has been my step-sister (his legal step-daughter), who has been so great in giving us information and keeping up with him. I’ve expressed that I would love for him to come live near me, and she thinks he would love that too.

I’ve been doing preliminary searches on living facilities near me, pricing and options, etc. In the coming months he will be eligible for Medicaid, but I don’t know everything about the numbers just yet. I honestly have no idea what to look/check for, how his govt assistance would factor in, things like this. My grandparents all passed when I was young and my mom is only 57, so I’ve never been responsible for an elderly person and I just have no idea where to start. Any tips or information would be appreciated."
"Hi all,

My granddad almost fell for a banking customer service scam yesterday. Basically someone will call saying they are working for the bank and they need \[my granddad\] to do cooperate because he might have been scammed or something. They almost managed to install both TeamViewer and Anydesk. Luckily they failed, but this did get me thinking on how to make sure he can browse the internet safely and click on whatever he wants without risking to lose money/files whatever. 

I know it is not possible to protect him from everything and we also try to educate him about the risks of clicking on links/opening email attachments and that kind of stuff. However, he suffers from dementia and is quite stubborn. So i think more should/could be done to protect him. His laptop is painstakingly slow (think it's from 2011 or even older) so we will buy him a new one (also because this one is \*really\* frustrating to work on:)). This also creates the opportunity to arrange stuff properly so he can browse and do whatever he wants, but be protected from threats.

I have looked around and found people saying to create and admin account of which he does not have the password, so he cannot install software on his own. Also, people install parental control software.

I am looking for suggestions/experiences people have, maybe threats i did not even think about. I don't think i need (or want!) to know his entire browsing history or other things he uses his computer for, however some control would be nice. How have people tackled this problem on here? I'm sure i'm not the only one:)"
"My mother has poor memory but I need to collect the details and explore what is all available. My mom for example says she has two health insurances, how can I look them up? Or any other financial accounts?"
"Long story, kinda short - Growing up, my father (65) was abusive & manipulative to his wife (61) & kids. Ended up to everyone distancing themselves from him, once divorce was final & we grew up into adults.

Now as my parents get older, I’m looking at budgets & planning retirements. 

He cheated & was physically abusive to my mother & left her out to dry in her early 50s. No work experience, no family, not from this country & has a hard time with the language barrier as well.

My mother’s retirement & financial situation is really bad & sad - being that she raised us & supportive of my father and did no wrong in why they are divorced.

My father is financially well-off. And he asked to find out her retirement plans etc & to see if there’s any need for help. (Trying to act like a family savior now that’s he’s older) - When I bring it up, I can see him passing the blame to us (children / late 20s) . Am I wrong to counter & confront him by stating the blame is actually on him for leaving his family & he’s not allowed to pass the blame. 

I don’t want to rehash the past, but if he passes the blame, I’ll be tempted to bring up the real reasons why my mother is in a financial bind plus other problems.

Is it worth the discussion? I’m not looking to start an argument or pass the blame, respectful conversation, but I’m not going to let him run over me like I was a kid again."
"This going to be a long one, so apologies in advance.

The start of all of this was March 2020, my mom was living alone in a very rural part of New England, slowly slipping in and out of mental clarity and unable to either recognize, or admit the severity of the cognitive slippage. This didn't become clear to me till my mother was placed on furlough due to Covid-19 shut-downs at her workplace, and came to me for help purchasing and setting up a cheap smart-phone, and forwarding supervisor updates from her Microsoft Outlook account to her Gmail. She had no PC at home, and had been relying on the local library computer, and a flip phone to stay in contact with her employer. With all of the local libraries closed, no internet access at her home, and no cell reception in her neighborhood (again, an extremely rural part of New England) plus no landline, she needed help trouble shooting, and fast. Connectivity was immediately necessitated so that she could stay up to date with furlough requirements, and continue checking in with her supervisor.

I helped her find an affordable smart phone and a hot spot near her house (just doing some basic googling from across the country gave me a decent map of where she could go to log-in to Xfinity hot spots) I then tried to grab all of her login information and start the process of forwarding the most pressing emails from her Outlook account to her Gmail. That is when it became apparent that she had not been operating at full mental capacity. Apparently the local librarian near her house was holding her usernames and passwords at the local branch, and mom had no idea how to access any of her accounts without that specific librarian's help. She was also too ashamed to admit this to the tech department at her work, and insisted that we try to guess her passwords for many hours, unsurprisingly we were locked out due to suspicious activity... Later I would find out, that due to the confidential nature of mom's work with clients, it was specifically against her company's tech policy to forward her work emails to a personal account, and that the local librarian having access to her logins was a fire(able) breach as well. She also had an extremely hard time learning and retaining the basic operations of her extremely low barrier to entry Consumer Cellular (specifically for aging persons) cell phone, and began to call me from a neighbor's landline three or four times a day for basic operating instructions, how to charge it, which button turns it on, etc. she'd almost immediately forget these details.

Eventually, due to the severity of her tech handicaps, and the increasing level of anxiety and fear about losing her job, I crossed the country to get her set up. This was after two weeks of spending multiple hours with her on the phone, and little progress made. When I got to her house I realized what kind of issue we actually had. The house was in a state of squalor, rodents and bugs. Laundry was in black trash bags in her room. There was no food in the refrigerator. The freezer was full of banana peels, bags of fish bones, and eggshells, basically she was freezing food scraps, to eventually bring to the compost center in town, but never was doing it... She'd dropped weight down to 90 lbs, this is a 5 ft 10 lady.

I immediately began to suspect something neurological was going on, what clinched it was her car accident 8 days into my visit, she'd gone for a ""drive to release stress"" and ended up taking out a portion of a neighbor's fence, when she misjudged the distance between the passenger side of her car, and his property. The car was totaled. She then admitted, she'd been having these kinds of accidents more and more, but ""I shouldn't worry"" because ""these accidents wouldn't be going on her driving record"" since she was wasn't making insurance claims, she was settling with the recipients of the property damage in cash, and paying out of pocket for autobody repairs.

After the accident I contacted her primary care physician and got three referrals, one to a neurologist, one to a neuropsychologist, and one to the radiology dept. at the local hospital for an MRI. This was incredibly difficult, as it was in the middle of Covid, but I made it happen. The neurologist suspected Wernicke's syndrome, but it was eventually ruled out, he had no other insights. The neuropsychologist gave her a battery of tests, and identified slippage in working memory, attentional resources, and heightened levels of anxiety and paranoia, but couldn't offer a specific diagnosis. The MRI revealed white matter irregularities consistent with severe white matter disease, but her PCP wanted a specialist to weigh in before issuing an official diagnosis.

2 years later, and I'm still at her house. It was decided that she would stop working, and could go to live with my Aunt in NC, she could sell her house, and live off of social security and the home sale profits down in NC. My aunt had graciously agreed to put her up in the spare bedroom rent free ad infinitum... The only catch was - that in order to sell her house, it needed fresh flooring in the kitchen, bathroom, and laundry room, as well as a complete bathroom remodel, and interior/exterior painting, that's where my elbow grease has come in handy as I've taken on her remodel myself. Mom's entire savings was and is $11,000.00 to survive on for the rest of her life. Her disability has rendered her incapable of learning new skills, so there are no job prospects for the future.

Here is where I need advice, 4 days ago my aunt threw in the towel and decided having my mom there was way too stressful. She didn't have the grace to tell me in person. She just bought my mom a one way ticket back to her house (where I am) for a few weeks from now. The kicker is, in my mom's irrational state, and high paranoia, she's decided I'm the enemy. She's accused me multiple times of plotting against her, and when we are in the same house her rants turn vitriolic. The bummer is that, she also won't admit that the white matter disease, and cognitive decline are an issue, she is chalking her previous problems up to the stress from being put on furlough and facing job insecurity during Covid, she says she is fine now.

So here I am expecting my mother to arrive in a few weeks, the house is not completed or ready for sale, she now has nowhere to live on the horizon after the sale of her house. I only have a few thousand dollars in the bank and a small apartment waiting for me back home in Oregon, so I don't have the space or resources to house her. My brother has an extremely modest income, and has told me that he doesn't have the patience to help her when she gets ""erratic"" which is more and more often.

I've looked into asking another one of her 5 siblings to help her, but they either live out of state, so I have negligible relationships with them (have only seen them at weddings or funerals, a couple times in my life) or they are in the state I am currently in, but family relations have broken down over the years. Mom has thoroughly alienated them with her ""erratic"" (my brother's word) behavior. I've also looked into SSI insurance to help her since she is now physically disabled, the catch is that she refuses to admit disability, as a matter of pride, she also refuses to see anymore specialists to determine the underlying cause of the white matter disease (MS?) The only way to access SSI Insurance would be to have her disabilities fully documented, something she has not completed.

I am doing my best to help my mom, I'm aware that she might lose her house, her only asset, and her ability to survive if I don't figure this out. I'd like to approach some other aunts and uncles to ask for help, but I'm not sure how to do that. I'm not even Facebook friends with them, in the 2000's before the dementia like symptoms, she already had a diagnosis of disordered personality (Dependent Personality Disorder, with GAD, and Borderline as co-morbid disorders, diagnosed by a previous therapist) which alienated our nuclear family away from the extended family...

If she loses all of her resources and ability to attain income, and she can't find a way to get along with the family, it seems logical that as she deteriorates more, she could become an adult ward of the state and be placed in a Medicaid funded nursing home, the Medicaid funded nursing homes in my area are regularly cited for violations, and the average senior placed in one passes away between 6 mos to a year post placement... I have no idea what to do...

Anyway, sorry this was so long, any advice or perspective would be much appreciated. Thanks."
"I'm the sole care taker of a narcissistic grandparent.

"My 64 year old mother has some health issues (kidney disease, some heart disease, early emphysema, high blood pressure)… plus bipolar and anxiety. she has been to the hospital 5 times since the start of the year convinced she is having a stroke. Every time her blood pressure shoots up she calls 911 or gets in an Uber and goes to the ER. She does not drive. We moved her into AL last month to handle medication administration. It had stabilized in the last month. She made them call 911 today. Yes her bp was high, but I just could not leave my 5 year old in the care of my stomach bug-ridden husband to run to the hospital again to sit with her while she complains about the food at the AL and we wait for her 5th MRI since January to tell her nothing has changed and she’s not had a stroke.

Venting. Boundaries. Sorry. Anybody else?"
"My FIL is home for the first time since his stroke in November. We are needing to buy an electric hoyer lift and don’t know where to start. Anyone have one they loved or hated? Need to know which ones work and which to steer clear of. 

Also, is buying on Amazon ok? Or DME supplier?"
"I grew up in a very unstable and violent household.  Now I am caring for people who mentally, physically and sexually abused me when I was a child.  My entire childhood was filled with trauma. 

Since then they have asked for forgiveness and I have forgiven them for past harm. But they still have the toxic selfish personalities that led to the abuse in the past. I still have to deal with them. 

All this while my wife and I am trying to raise two healthy children under five of my own. 

The amount of all of the stress that this is causing in my life and my marriage is astounding. I can barely function anymore. I’m having daily phone conversations over medical care that has me so stressed out that I get a loss for words and at times literally can’t even talk. I’m snapping at everyone; snapping at my kids. I have zero patience anymore. 

I’m just filled with rage and anger and bitterness about the situation. They have cost my immediate healthy family that my wife and l worked so has to create for ourselves hundreds of thousands of dollars for their care. 

How do I not lose my mind?

How do you guys cope with the stress?"
"Hi!

Just like the title says, ISO pull ups for my incontinent mom. We’ve been using Depends Protection Plus, but there is leakage when she stands up from her bed. I’m afraid the carpet in her bedroom is going to get ruined from urine (besides the smell).

So, what is the most absorbing and comfortable diaper for her? TIA!"
"Dear Bruce, 

I’m sorry to hear of your struggles with aphasia. You’re one of my favorite actors. I’ve seen Pulp Fiction over fifty times! Watching it that much naturally made everyone else in my family fans of yours also. My mom turned into your super fan. Die Hard turned into our Christmas movie, Sixth Sense never lost its shock factor, and my mom watched The Story of Us perhaps even more than I watched Pulp Fiction. She had a crush on you and still does, I think. 

That is why I am writing this letter. It is to thank you. Thank you for making something so difficult and private about your life public. You have helped more than you could ever imagine. 

For the last several years, my mom has been having some memory problems. At first it was silly things, like everyone does; losing keys, forgetting to put groceries away, stuff like that. However, it’s soon escalated to be a little more concerning. She would forget my name and my siblings’ names. She once called my sister crying from the side of the highway because she was lost on her way to her favorite department store in the city she has lived in for over 50 years. She came to visit my home and left the burner of the stove on with a pot holder on it. 

Eventually, a few years ago, I banded my siblings together and we made a plan and decided that we had to talk to her. My mom is a ferociously proud, independent woman and we knew that it would not be easy. What we did not anticipate, however, was how hard it was. 

I approached it with my mom first and it went horribly. My mother became angry and abruptly ended our call. We next decided that my older sister who is a nurse would take a try. She did a great job and was very compassionate, and although my mom was still maintaining nothing was wrong, she said she would think about going to see someone. Progress. 

And then a backslide; in the following days and weeks she became more combative about her situation. We would be talking about old times, and she would remember something - like an old pet’s name - and crow: “Someone with a memory problem could never remember something like that, huh? I have a good memory after all, admit it.” She never ended up making the appointment. 

Eventually, we sent in my youngest sibling to talk to her. She denied that there was a problem and, yet again, became defensive. Since then, we have all worried about her and tried to gently prod her into talking to her doctor since we could not talk her into seeing a specialist, but nothing worked. 

Nothing until you, that is. 

When you made your private struggle public, she took notice. Last night, she called me and said, “I am worried that I might have the same kind of thing like Bruce Willis has. I cannot remember words very well and I think maybe I should go and see a neurologist.” I have cried happy tears for the last 12 hours, my siblings are celebrating, I feel so relieved that maybe she can get some help. 

Thank you for your bravery. It has changed lives, it has changed mine. I want you to know that I appreciate you so much. I am sending healing vibes and love to you; you will forever be my hero.

"Hi all!

&#x200B;

So, for the meantime, I have moved in with my elderly mom (83). I have not been with her for 15 years, and have now only experiencing her habits and quirks in her old age. We moved into a new apartment and, while the walls aren't paper-thin per se, you can still very much hear her when she snores, groans, and yell in her sleep. I am not sure what to do, and her doctor is the most difficult person to talk to (walk-ins only, can't really reach her, we don't trust her -- it's a whole thing). Is there anything I can do to help my mom? She doesn't seem to be restless during the day and barely naps.   


For context, she is diabetic (Type I). Could it be her diet? We are just letting her eat what she wants because of her age and don't want to keep her from enjoying the rest of her life.  


Thank you, everyone."
"Tired of yelling and repeating phrases, is there a portable megaphone, mic/speaker or something to make it easier for me to speak and older person to hear?

They use RF Headphones to listen to TV and they can hear after repeated loud yelling.

Anyone find something that works better than yelling?"
"My parents - father (82) and mother (78) - still live in the house we grew up in. 
Dad is barely physically functional. He can barely get in & out of a chair by himself and is in constant pain. How he is doing the stairs so far without falling is beyond me. 
They are both declining cognitively. Dad more than mom. Mom is a little forgetful but still ok and “with it” otherwise. 
My dad really should be in assisted living or have regular help in the house. Both of which my mom refuses. We had an elder proof lady come to the house & tell us what needs to happen if they stay there. Of course, mom did nothing with that info. 
My sisters & I all live out of state and mom cannot handle it. The fact that none of us are there rules her life. She refuses any help or move because she prefers one of us to be right there to help with everything just as she did with her parents. 
Anyway, at this point, my sisters & I are waiting for a crisis/emergency. 
We are all going to visit in a few weeks & will try once again to convince them to do something. Doubt it will work. 
Meanwhile talking to mom is frustrating because she complains nonstop but refuses to help herself (they have long-term care insurance which they aren’t using & my mom could use some emotional support from a therapist). She also yells at my dad for things like not helping clean up after dinner, when he can barely get out of a chair."
"Sadly my mother passed away. Before that the plan was to have her go home after rehab with help. So I bought all sorts of “stuff”, 2 different wheelchairs, 2 different walkers, a commode, transfer chairs, and lots of other random aids that never got used, it doesn’t feel right to sell them, and certainly is wrong to just throw them in the trash. But how do I find someone who could use this stuff, or an organization to donate it to? She also was on oxygen for a while so she has several oxygen machines, and I know those are very expensive, again I’m not looking to make a profit, but putting them at the curb seems a waste when those could help someone in need

Any info is appreciated"
"So my cousin’s wedding is next month. My mom wants to go but she’s living in a long term care facility and I can’t meet her care needs due to my own chronic illness/disability. My dad may want to go, but he has dementia so that could change. 

I have no idea what kind of care this would entail or how to find someone to provide it for her. We have a tenuous relationship at best due to a long history of abuse, but she’s currently being extra nice since I told her if she wasn’t, I would go no contact. This makes the entire idea of this slightly terrifying. She doesn’t travel well on her best days and can be overwhelming, prior to her more recent health issues even. 

My brother just says, sure hire someone but offers no assistance. Their relationship is okay, better than ours for sure. He just doesn’t actually DO anything to help with either of their care. 

Help? Am I crazy to even think this could work? I don’t want to not have her at the wedding, she’s looking forward to it. My cousin’s mom (my mom’s youngest sister) passed away two weeks before my moms hospitalization and subsequent move into long term care so this is kind of a big deal for our family."
"So here's a little back story, my grandma died of having an extreme lack of caloric intake which made her heart weak.  I'm afraid my mom is going to end up the exact same way.    Today she went out for Chinese with my brother,  1 spring roll 1 egg drop soup.  That's it. 

All she wants is tea, ever.   She goes out to lunch with my aunt, just tea.  Eats fucking nothing.  Half a sandwich if there's lots of walking.   She just has no clue about this and clearly gets hazy thinking through the day and constantly falls asleep.   ""Nothing's wrong with me"" over and over.  Probably not even  800 calories a day.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO OR SAY.   Is this normal for aging women to eat a sliver of a bean a day?"

"Hi,

Wondering if I might be able to get some general advice about where to start and what to do as it pertains to this whole sitution? 

My moms partner (not married but jointly own their house) has congestive heart failure and was hospitalized for it and is now in transition ""swingbed"" part of the hospital but is not doing well. We are not sure if he will ever make it back home or need nursing home care for life. They are both 76. 

My mother has short term memory issues. None of us children live near. So without him running the household and no local support we'll need to do something it seems for both of them. 

They are retired middle class professionals so have some retirment funds (I don't have any details) and own a small house outright. 

Wondering where to start with this overall given the situation? 

Thank you."
"My (40F) mom (70F) lives in a apartment in the basement of my house. She has had a stroke and has lost lot of mobility and faculty. She wants to be independent and refuse to walk with a cane, or get outside help although she needs it. I take her to all her appointments, deal with everything financial, taxes, bills. I subsidizes her rent and utilities because she makes nothing. I make her dinner that I bring down otherwise she doesn’t eat. I call for her appointments, take her grocery shopping, go get her coffee, etc. Yet she not grateful at all. She said that I owe her. Yesterday she insulted me because I didn’t get her text to get her some stuff. She said I do everything for my friends but when it comes to her I’m always busy… I have so much rage inside of me because of that. I talked to her about the old folk home and she guilt trip her way out."
What are some successful sleep aids for senior citizens with dementia that gets up several times a night?
"I know y'all can't give an answer but maybe advice if you've been through this.

Long story short. I'm an only child. My Uncle that lives in California passed away and left me his home and everything in it. We have the option to move there or sell the house and get a bigger home where we currently live. We live in the Midwest. My Mother has heart failure she's 76. She's in a low income independent senior apartment. She doesn't have a car but there is a shuttle bus for her Dr appointments and grocery trips. 

My Mom has said if we move she's coming with us no matter what.  We can't afford to have her live with us or have the room at my Uncle's home. We are all she has so I feel guilty leaving her. The area my Uncle lives in is very expensive. Taxes are high. Cost of living is just higher all around. The best is the weather there and the Ocean which I love. I just don't know what to do? I feel guilty leaving her. What happens when her health is worse? I'd have to fly back and forth to help her? We also have two young children as well. I guess I'm just torn. She'll flip and go nuts if we move but I also am sad because I'd love to live in CA. However we could get a bigger home here if we sold the CA home. 
Have any of you moved away from an elderly parent? Do you regret it? Is it more stressful?"
"Aging mom has severe mobility issues and tight quarters in their bedroom. There’s not enough room for her, my dad, and a third person to help her get in bed. I was wondering if there is a stable rotating platform to turn her? It would be a godsend so she could sleep in her own bed. Thank you in advance!"
"So I have written here several times about my mother and uncle. I had finally convinced her to stay for at least two weeks in a wonderful senior residence with  meals, nursing, good personell, etc. She was all on board and we were going to have me put on her account to help pay her bills (her memory is quite bad after her strokes), sell some property, put her brother on a lease (he lives in a property she owns and she has been paying his bills.. Elderly abuse was called due to his financial abuse of her and that he has a lock on her door and will give the code to noone, not even her. Sounds crazy and it is).

So yesterday I got a call at my job. My uncle had showed up on Sunday screaming bloody murder and how he had to save her from the nursing home. They were calling the police as he was coming back for her later on Monday to take her home. My cousins, who were going to visit her and help her with her phone calls, got to the home just as she was going into the hall with my uncles girlfriend. They put me on speakerphone (my cousins, I live in another country) and I had to tell my Mom how she just needed to stay for two weeks so we could clean her house, talk to attorney, do paperwork, get the lock off etc. How if she went with my uncle, she would be in a dangerous situation since she can only open the house from the inside and with her fasls, noone could get to her, If she ended up in the hospital, he would never tell us as he has blocked us completely. She told me in front of everyone what a horrible daughter I was and how I was choosing everything for her,. She told us she didn't want to talk anymore but I told her, you have to. You need nursing, you must pay this nursing home bill, I can't keep paying for you which is the only reason I wanted to be on your accounts, how we were so scared we would never see her again. She said she would stay one more day. The director of the nursing home asked my uncle why he was in such a rush to take her home, she had no nursing care. My mom said she knew a lady who was willing to move in with her and take care of her. 

It was a horrible phone call and I ended up hanging up and breaking down in tears. My cousins called later and said my Mom had signed out and said she would be back later. She left her medicine/insulin, clothing there. Dissappeared. The nursing home called the police and social services. My uncle had taken her home. She is now there, happy as a clam. I called her just to say her medicine was still at the nursing home and could she pay her bill as she had promised (they had my card on file and were about to charge me a few thousand for her stay). Then I hung up. I just didn't feel like talking to her.

So I took a mental day today from work. My boss said she thinks I should take the week after I explained the situation. My cousins are mad and call my mother a liar. Funny thing is, I feel worst for one cousin who is developmentally delayed mentally and  was crying nonstop when we couldn't find my Mom. We all feel like our hearts were ripped out. I was planning to go in 2 weeks. I still am. Hopefully my cousins and I can have a nice dinner. I don't know what to say to Mom. I thank this community for your help. You are a nice sounding board and I hope this never happens to you."
"I’m the step daughter, but of course love her as if she were my mother. The thing is- they refuse to plan for what’s coming( she’s 83) and rely on me to handle things as I’m the closest. I have a demanding job and a family as well. I feel as though I’m disappointing them but I really need help. How can I get them to step up their game?"
"I’m an only child. I’ve been dating my partner for 5 years, while also taking care of my mom. (I live with my parent) This is now starting to affect my relationship. Besides COVID, I’m unable to do things like travel or even go out to eat because I consider how it will affect my mom who has health issues and I don’t always want to leave her alone. My partner says he feels limited by me, our relationship is limited.

I will not put her into a retirement community or a home. She doesn’t want that. I’m all she has. She doesn’t even have friends. Any ideas for how to manage taking care of her without completely losing my relationship in the process?"
"My parents are going through some rough times, arguing on a daily basis and my father wanting to divorce and leave. It is all around my mother's infidelity which happened more than 50 years ago.

It's not new news, this came out decades ago already, we talked about it as a family and all this time it seemed like my father got over it and forgave her. But in the last few weeks it seems to have suddenly exploded with my father, with fits of rage and jealousy and him wanting a divorce and to leave. My mother doesn't want to split up, thinks it's unwarranted and irrational after all these years, and that it would be bad for both of them. But together they're making each other's lives miserable.

They are in their 80s, so both advanced with their ages. Neither are really independent, so whilst it could be an option to go through with the divorce and live separately, it would be a huge upheaval for both, for me to provide care for them and would probably mean both going to live in some assisted living arrangement. And I can barely cover my bills, working and studying at the moment.

Impossible to reason with him though, seems like he's stuck in a groove and can't snap out of it. It's driving me and my mother insane.

Anyone gone through something similar? Any advice?

(Crossposting here for too. Someone in r/relationship_advice mentioned to check out for dementia, so I will get onto that as well.)"
"Sorry in advance for this lengthy post! 

I (25F) have been a caregiver to my bariatric mother (63) since I was 14/15. She was mobile then, I would just clean her, but the last three years she has been bedbound. I have two older brothers, one who lives far and completely cut us out of his life and another who is two years older than me and has been helping a lot. But we’re both exhausted emotionally as we have not been able to live a life of our own. He’s completely depressed, bordering suicidal and just stays in his room most days. 
I have minimal friends but don’t talk often because they don’t understand why I don’t just leave and live my life. I told them it’s not easy, because it would be considered elder abuse and we can’t afford a home health aid. My 95 year old grandma lives with us now (also bedbound) and I can’t work because taking care of two ill people takes all of our time. 
I tried to move out last year because I tried to take my friends advice, but my mom threatened to kill herself and said i was abandoning her. My brother became extremely resentful and didn’t talk to me for weeks, he would just walk past me like I didn’t exist. This obviously caused a lot of heartache for me so I stayed and things sort of mellowed out. But now I’m in a situation now where if I leave, I’m giving up the only family I know and they will hate me. If I choose my family, I’m giving up my life and any opportunity for normality. What do I do? By the way I can’t put them in a home because they refuse to. Can’t commit them because they’re both sound of mind. 

TL;DR I cant choose between taking care of my family and living my own life with them hating me forever"
"Hi Everyone, 

I've seen a few posts about ageing parents and dehydration and would love to get your thoughts on the situation with my dad - mid 70s, who was recently hospitalised with severe dehydration, after a serious of UTIs had knocked him off his feet.

Thinking about how to get him to drink more...I've read through other posts which talk about stressing the importance of hydration, and also making sure that the water is accessible (easy-to-open bottles, right temperature, etc.)

The thing is that my dad has issues with his prostate too and he has said that he doesn't want to drink too much because between that, his prostate and other issues like arthritis and general ageing-related aches and pains, he'll never get a good night's sleep I.e. he doesn't want to have to get up to go to the loo.

I'm considering suggesting a urine bottle.  But am very reluctant to do so because I worry that I may offend him greatly, and he may consider it a sort of attack on his dignity.  I know this because his mobility is not that great over more than a couple of dozen meters, and one time I suggested we get him a wheelchair at the airport, he did not take the suggestion kindly.  

Sorry for the long-winded way of asking the question: is a urine bottle suggestion for someone who CAN walk to the loo a worthwhile proposal, or can it only be viewed as humiliating in this context?"
"My father is currently in the hospital and the social worker said he needs a high needs group home in the Las Vegas area. He has multiple medical issues (heart, lung, kidney, skin and liver), on oxygen, open pressure sore on his buttocks, he's a larger man and needs assistance of 2-3 caregivers to get in and out of bed, use the toilet, etc. How do I go about finding a good group home? My sibling and I both live out of state and have children and full time jobs. My brother was just out there to move him from rehab to assisted living, but when dad got to assisted living they said he had declined a lot since they evaluated him and his care needs are too high. They sent him to the hospital because he was unable to urinate. Now the hospital says he needs a group home. I wish the rehab place would have been more upfront about his care needs because we would have chosen a group home over assisted living facility. But rehab said either would be good. Dad chose the assisted living facility because he would be more likely to find some friends with more independent people to chose from. Now he needs the group home."
"I was just checking out an independent living facility with my mom who is really overweight but independent. They priced her care package at I feel like the highest end. I didn't see a single overweight old person there. Is there an issue with finding a place for heavier old people? I realize that the pick up issue can be a problem, but it was frustrating."
"Long post - bare with me. 

I decided to part ways with my father last year and moved into my own apartment with my two young kids. My father is 61 and expected me to live with him for the rest of his years (being the eldest daughter, it’s a cultural expectation). It was something I was willing to do…until I had kids and things became complicated. My father is an alcoholic (my children’s father isn’t a huge drinker so seeing my father drunk around the kids bothered him), smokes likes a sailor, hygiene and cleanliness made the whole condo have a distinct scent. After my newborns nurse suggested telling my father that exposure to smoke can cause SIDS (my father would smoke in the garage I’d park my car with the doors shut), I just got a laugh from him. After asking for some changes several times, I was hit with a drunken “this is who I am. I’m not changing.” Taking care of two kids and working full time is hard, but I felt like I was starting to take care of someone who didn’t want to take care of himself. (I still feel guilt to this day about him living by himself).

I also believe he suffers from depression and his health is declining, but he refuses to go to the doctor, despite offering to make his appointments and drive him. After parting ways, our relationship has improved, but he started having seizures. He doesn’t let anybody in the apartment (I’ve offered to come by and clean it for him). 

What more can I do? Was I wrong for leaving him? Anybody in the same shoes?"
"My 80-year old father is alone (my mother is gone and my sister cut ties with him over his behavior).  His health is poor and he has nothing to do all day but overthink every conversation. He frequently blows up my phone with hurtful, manipulative, multi-paragraph text messages.  Other times he is excessively appreciative and affectionate. 

Caring for him is stressful because it stirs up all the bad memories of his abuse when I was young, and his unpredictable behavior now, alternating loving behavior with cruelty, is extremely distressing. 

I don’t really know what to do except wait for him to die, really - he has COPD, which will take him at some point - but I am extremely depressed. I would really be happier never seeing him again, but he has alienated everyone else in his life."
"I'm an immigrant currently residing in Singapore. I came here over 20 years ago with my mother, but I'm utterly done with the country for various personal, career, values and political reasons and would like to move abroad as soon as I am financially able to. Which will be when I graduate university and work a couple of years to save up and boost my portfolio, estimated 2026-2027.

The area I am most likely moving to is London, United Kingdom, or maybe other english-speaking western countries. I plan to move there to do a postgraduate degree, as that is the easiest way to get a visa into the country and eventually convert to become a citizen.

My biggest concern is that I truly can't bear leaving my mother alone in Singapore to survive all by herself. She has sacrificed so much for me ever since I was born, financially, emotionally, everything. I owe her so much, I love her dearly, and want to be there right beside her to support her as she grows old. To really give back to her, make her happy, make sure she doesn't feel lonely or abandoned, fulfil her dreams etc.

My mother does not speak English fluently and will struggle to adapt to the new and unfamiliar environment, as she has lived in Asia all her life. I also have no idea how I will obtain a visa for her since she will be an elderly who cannot possibly get an employment visa. I also don't think she even wishes to move to such countries, as she has told me she really loves living in Singapore and keeps discouraging me from moving. She even own a really nice real estate here which cements her desire to stay in Singapore and not move. I have no relatives or anyone here in the country who is able to take over the job of taking care of her if I ever decide to move.

But I have dreamed of moving for over 10 years now, I have been planning this for so long. I truly do not want to stay in this country. I cannot see myself being truly fulfilled in life by staying here. What should I do..."
"My mom is turning 71 this year and currently lives with my family and I. We'll be acquiring my husbands family home this year and will be building her a detached ADU in the backyard.

We don't have the best cohabitating relationship and I'm trying to be more relaxed and less anxious around her. TBH I can be pretty high strung and mean toward her because of childhood traumas that I'm still working through.

Anywho, she doesn't want to move with us but I think the fact that I'm her only child and that she consistently forgets very important things (like burning food consistently and once left her car with keys inside and engine running while she went out to eat) are major signs that she shouldn't be living independently anymore. 

I mainly drive her 90-95% of the time and if she does end up driving on her own I make sure she actually puts on her glasses and call to make sure she's arrived safely at her destination, but I also have realized her reaction time isn't what it use to be and fills me up with worry when she drives on her own.

My grandmother and the majority of her siblings and cousins I've talked to about the matter have all agreed that she should not be living alone and that my plan to build her a detached unit in my backyard is the best scenario for us.

What can I do legally and personally to make sure my mother stays with me but also make sure she can still have a certain amount of independence? I love her and don't want her to feel like I'm controlling her life but it's just that point in her life where I truly believe she can no longer be living on her own.

Aside from some memory loss she is very much a capable person."
My grandma has dementia and often gets really anxious. Anyone who has tried ashwagandha or any herbal supplements that could help? Thank you.
"I hear this advice all the time, especially when it pertains to toxic situations involving loved ones. For those that have a strained relationship with their aging parent(s), who are in true need of help: how do you cope? Their poor choices (finances and addiction) aren't my responsibility, but it many times feels like it is, because of their age/vulnerability. I'm feeling overwhelmed, and have a hard time compartmentalizing the sadness of seeing it all."
"I recently returned home to care for my 80 year old dad after he had heart surgery. I hadn't been to the house in a while due to covid and his desire to visit us. I noticed that he was receiving a bunch of junk in the mail. A mountain of junk in fact. St Joseph's Indian School and Labre Indian School were the worst offenders. These organizations sent dream catchers, grocery bags, pens, greeting cards, stickers, gloves and other assorted trinkets. All made in China. All going in the land fill. I read the literature and it was pure poverty porn. 

I did a little research. These mailings are guilt mailings that target the elderly, dementia patients, Alzheimer's patients and the confused. They send a bunch of cheap crap to make people guilty or feel obligated to donate. Their practices are predatory and it pisses me off. They also sell their mailing lists to other grifting charities. They ask to be written into wills. They take people's inheritances. They fight the families of the elderly who have gone into homes. It's disgusting.

I called these two organizations to have my dad taken off their mailing list. They both said it would take months. I went to the local post office to see if they had any suggestions. They  were at a loss but the postal worker told me it was a huge problem. I did a little more research. It was suggested that I report them to the FTC. I did and they suggested I report it to the states Attorney General. I am going to. 

They aren't good charities. There have been allegations of sexual abuse by the priests that run it. St Joseph's got in trouble because the were using fake stories of kids that didn't exist. There are better charities if you want to help Native Americans ( which they definitely need). Fortunately my dad is of sound mind so far and didn't give them any money but I worry for those who aren't so lucky. Sorry for the long post."
"Mom & step dad in their 80s, father is 90. ALL are doing pretty well, reasonably healthy and living independently. We're just starting to see the beginnings of mental/physical decline. Heartfelt thanks to everyone contributibg here, immensely helpful for my own education and to help get into the right headspace as life moves forward."
"My mom is 69 and in pretty good health. Her memory is starting to decline and she doesn’t drive anymore. She wants me to find her a house where other seniors rent a room and share a kitchen. I think this would be great for her, too. 

I have no idea where to find such a setup. When I do online searches, I either find rooms for rent (all ages) or individual senior housing apartments (which she can’t afford). 

Any ideas? Thanks!"
"My mom has lived with another old woman for like ten years now. They literally haven't been apart in years, they helped each other a lot with doctors visits and meds and falling in the house, etc. Mom called this lady Mom and this lady called my mom her daughter.

&#x200B;

Roommate has promised for years that Mom would get to live her trailer in the event that she died. I told mom forever to get it in writing but it never happened. Now roommate passed yesterday morning and the roommate's daughter is already planning to kick her out. They claim the roommate doesn't actually own it, that their ex husband does. But they also said they 'dont want to deal with it' because of the taxes. So it sounds like the mother DID own it and they're going to give it or sell it back to the ex husband's family to avoid dealing with this (daughter is NOT a fan of my mom, and had a very sour relationship with her mother, the roommate)  


We might have 0 legal case for actually retaining the trailer in any capacity, even if not ownership probably not  even just the promise of mom being allowed to live there. But even with that aside, how legal is it from them to be trying to kick her out to sell the land underneath her just because this lady died?

&#x200B;

She's been living in this trailer for YEARS, but the bills are all in roommate's name (she owned it, or so she said, and all the bills were established before mom moved in). Is it legal for them to evict mom immediately to sell the land? Does she have any tenants or squatter's rights? She's been paying a little bit a month as 'rent' and contributing to bills/food for years, but there's no contract or rental agreement. Can we fight them evicting her?

Edit: this is in Alabama."
"My father has appointments every now and then with a hematology/oncology doctor.  He now refuses to go and when the office’s automatic reminder system calls, he answers the phone and cancels the appointment.

He has a scare with some kind of cancer a few years ago (skin cancer, I think) and is in very poor health; he is largely immobile and is suddenly a widower.  He has 24/7 home health aides.

He is extremely strong willed.

So: when your aging parents refuse to go to the doctor, do you just let them not go, even when it’s perhaps relatively important?

In this case, I am going to change his phone number on all medical records so that calls go to me.

Thanks."
"Just found out my 78 year old mother has had a loaded gun in her house for the four years she has lived by me. My brother knew this and neither my mom or brother told me. Neither feels  they should have told me. The only reason it came up was because he feels I should have a gun too and is buying my mom a smaller pistol.  I am beyond shocked, hurt and angry that I was not told. I feel it put my husband and I at risk not knowing. I am in and out of my mom’s house 3 to 4 times a week. My brother lives 3 hours away.  My mother is fully functioning and my father had many guns (hunter) when he was alive. I tried to have separate conversation with my mom and it did not go well. Trying to make peace with this information and struggling."
Overwhelmed with how many different companies there are. We want something that would be good if my mother passed out and fell. We are not interested in apple watch as that seems too complicated for her and she doesn't have an apple phone. We want GPS tracking and she is okay with wearing pendant and or watch. Monthly costs are fine. We will also install lockbox. Thanks in advance : )
"Would like to hear about everyone's experiences good or bad with small residential assisted living or adult foster care based in a private house. 

Better or worst than long term facilities?

Do smaller homes have better staff to resident ratio?

If you have worked in or own one I would love to hear from you. Would love details about your facility and why it's better in your opinion.

Thanks in advance for any help or information."
"My (28f) dad (63m) just had brain surgery.  I am currently spending the week making his apartment more livable and making things easier for him in any way I can. I live across the country and he lives alone, so he has friends, sisters, and nurses to check on him a few times a week at least. 

He is doing very well and seems to have his complete autonomy. Looking forward, my goal is to leave him with some stuff that can stimulate his brain and keep him occupied on things that aren’t the news or tinkering with the house too much, possibly falling or hurting himself. 

I feel like he needs a hobby or interest or somethings he can do to keep him busy. Before he was discharged I tried to get him a word search book so I’m on that train of thought, but thinking of a more elevated source recreation. 

Wondering if anyone else found anything that helps with this. Even the simplest thing sometimes can have a big impact on senior’s moods, routines, or whole entire days. So if anyone has anything that I can introduce into his world to keep his mind busy. 

Thank you."
"They're both almost in their 70s and I'm in my mid 30s. I work about 50-60 hours a week and dont know any family member that can take care of them. They still can do lots of things but cant do stuff that require heavy lifting (groceries, furniture, etc) but I'm more concerned about when they get even older and wont be able to do those things they used to be able to. I've looked into care homes and they literally cost more than my monthly mortgage. I'm also concerned about care home abuse. I also dont want to quit my job just to take care of them because I've worked so hard to get here and it may be more difficult to make a living finding another job. Happened to a few of my friends already.

The only setup I have right now are smart cameras around the house so I can keep an eye on them while I'm at work and I'm about half an hour away if an emergency were to happen."
"I’ve been sitting on this one for quite a while.   I’m not sure exactly why I’ve decided to share it, but I feel compelled to nonetheless...

My mom is absolutely one of the toughest women I know, in all honesty I had a healthy fear of my mom for that very reason!  Let's just say every  comedian like Eddy Murphy or Kevin Hart who has shared a story about their mom is absolutely 100% true.  I use to laugh at my brother Stephen when he had guitar lessons and I used to laugh at my other brother Warren when he played the piano and I stopped laughing when I realized how talented he was.  I had no choice but to endure the laughs when my mother signed me up for tapdancing!  (pause for laughter) Yes,  my mother enrolled me into tapdancing class and I blame that healthy fear.

I cannot quite remember, but I took that class for two or three years before I had the balls to look her in the eyes and say ""I do not want to do this anymore"".  She just looked at me with disappointment and pinched my arm.  I cannot remember if they were tears of joy because I knew It would be the last time I would ever wear tap shoes again or if it was the pain coursing through my arm from being pinched with a set of keys that just happened to be in her hand.

In all fairness, my mom is also one of the kindest women I know.  I could rhyme off a plethora of stories where she was kind of like a super hero without a cape and saved my ass.  One of my favourite memories is track and field day at Laurentian University, not sure what grade I was in, but I represented Redwood Acres public school.  It was late in the afternoon and I had won three out of the three competitions I had entered and my mom arrived just as I received my metals.  It was very unexpected to see her there and I will never forget the many hugs.  Years later as a teen, I became more involved in sports and other things that teens do and there was no doubt a disconnect.  For the most part that disconnect carried on into my twenties and thirties and beyond, except for those times she showed up like a super hero and saved the day even when I didn't deserve it. 

In my late 20's I was not in a good place and I brushed off the dust on a book called the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.  I walked by that book a thousand times until the day I really needed it and the only way I could detail how that book changed my life would be to write a book about it.  On one occasion I decided to practise one of the habits and chose not to argue with my mom and just agree to what she wanted.  Long story long, I found myself driving my mom two hours into God knows where in some hick town to look at a car she knows very little about because God.  I decided at that very moment that I would chauffeur my mom to wherever she wanted to go and we would make a day of it regardless of the outcome.  I kept my opinion to myself and we did in fact have a great day, even though the car we looked at had four flat tires and the red paint was now pink, covered in gunk from sitting under a tree for two years. We didn't even open a door, we just stared at the car for a couple minutes and we were on our way.  If God was in on it,  I don't think it had anything to do with the car that day.

The sad reality is over the years, I lost my mom to the bible.  I honestly have no clue who my mother is or what her independent thoughts are without being filtered through the bible.  Over the last 20 years, we have had many discussions, and debates that never have we ever come to a conclusion.  We just agree to disagree disagreeably...  Those who have read the 7 Habits are reading that last sentence over again with a puzzled look, I am sure.  If we weren't debating the bible, American politics or my plethora of mistakes over the years,  we would watch movies and documentaries of a biblical nature and I did my very best to gain a little knowledge or find a lesson.  I wish I would have done that more often.

My mom is now 83 and I may lose her again!  This time to ovarian cancer and in true fashion, my mother is a fighter and this will be one epic battle.  When cancer cells spread to the abdomen, fluid builds up between the stomach and the lining of the stomach.  She recently had 5L of fluid drained and the pain was excruciating before, during and after.  The first time she had this procedure, it was 3L.   I am sad and not for the reasons you would think.  I am sad because I don't feel sad...   I know that sounds horrible but the fact of the matter is, that is the only way that I can explain it and more importantly the reason I do feel compelled to share this story.  Today, my brother Warren is the hero without a cape and my nephew Dylon is his sidekick. They are her caregivers and I show up on occasion because it FEELS like the right thing to do.

As one does in this situation, we often retrace our steps and ask what could we have done differently, you will go back years and try to put the pieces together in an attempt to understand the decisions you made and how those decisions collectively have brought you here today.   If I could sum it up in one sentence,  I would say unequivocally that choosing not to value the feelings of another that is important to you over being right or even thinking you are right will one day feel so wrong.  [please read that again]  I would say unequivocally that choosing not to value the feelings of someone you love over being right or even thinking you are right will one day feel so wrong. Those moments that mean the most to me, are the moments I acknowledged that accepting my mother wholeheartedly for who she is and why she is who she is was the right thing to do and I wish I would have adopted that mindset years ago and lived by it, loved by it.

"Hi everyone! June is Alzheimers and Dementia awareness month. I am looking for a guest(s) that would be up to coming on my video podcast to talk about what A&D is, what are some signs and ways we can try to prevent/mitigate A&D for ourselves. You don't have to be a medical professional (though that would be helpful). 
We are filming on 3/27, time TBD. 
We are a fairly new and small podcast. 
Let me know if you are interested, know someone who might be interested or have any questions!

"Below is an email I just sent to the executive director of the AL facility that my mother moved into two weeks ago. Are these med policies crazy? I am really feeling some red flags. To date it has been a pretty good experience, but this all has me frustrated and freaked out. Is this typical? (I know I was very judgey in my tone but come on… really?!)


Executive Director:

I’m just following up on a couple of messages I left you on your work voicemail tonight. I just arrived back home from sorting out my mother’s medication at the [AL]. She returned from watching a movie at my home tonight shortly after 10 PM. She was told that they were not allowed to give her medication because it was out of compliance because of the scheduled 9:00-10:00 window.

When I called the facility, no one answered. So I had to drive there at 11:30 PM to ensure she was given her medication. The med tech, Danielle, was wonderful to deal with. She informed me that she could give it to me, and I could then give it to her.

My concerns:

1. It should have been communicated to us that arriving after the medication window would prevent her from receiving it. Her doctors’ orders are that the medication be administered nightly… not that it be administered between 9-10 PM. That is an arbitrary window established by us (the family). 

2. When you all couldn’t give it to her, someone should have called me to come back to administer it, rather than saying she should wait until the next day. Not having her medication is not an option. While I do not understand the policy of withholding medication 10-15 min after the window has passed (this seems like a larger liability for you all to jeopardize people’s health than to give the medication 10 minutes later), going forward I should be called anytime there is an issue like this.

3. Very concerning to me is the fact that the entire bottle of Clonazepam is currently missing and she was not given the medication tonight even though I came. Danielle said she would put a note for the next morning to sort that out, but in the meantime my mother did not receive that pill. Clonazepam is a controlled substance for anxiety, so we (she or the family) will not be able to just call in a refill if they are truly missing. My mother says she has received them on time every day to this point, but she will start going into withdrawals if she does not receive it in a timely manner.

I will be coming by in the morning and I would appreciate a call at your earliest opportunity."
"   Something occurs to me, it's a crazy idea. It would probably seldom work. But I am tasked now with settling off my folks estate. they have all antique furniture and lots of collectible china and serviceware and figurines. I dont know what if any is super valuable. I hate the idea of it going pennies on the dollar in an estate sale, then they turn around and sell it on ebay. Wish i knew what was what.

Right before covid Dad wanted to run an estate sale to declutter the house. he balked at the idea when he found out he wouldnt get what things were worth. then covid hit and then his health was declining so that idea was gone. Would have made this process alot easier had we decluttered. Would make this process alot easier if there were a listing of what things were and flag what was valuable.  mom loved looking things up and reading their history. She was somewhat of an expert on it and on the markings on the back. For example she has a Limoges platter with a dish set that is at least 65 years old and most assuredly older. 

Anyway, really easy to accumulate and stuff things in servers and cabinets etc. Might be easier to declutter if able, or pics and names. Should have an inventory for insurance anyway. 

just an idea

Anyone have experience with estate sales and other methods to liquidate the estate? Are there brokers for furniture antiques and collectible dishware and figurines and such.

Thanks"
"Hi all,

Thank you for taking to the time to read this.  I have what I feel is a pretty serious situation with my mom and some other family members and I'm hoping to find some support and advice from others who have been in similar situations with their aging parent. 

First a little about my mom.   She is 57 and has several medication conditions.  Liver disease, type 1 diabetes, drop foot, and neuropathy, and has survived two heart attacks and has stints.  I'm sure she has more that I don't know about.   She still works in a psych ward at a hospital as a mental health technician despite all of her medical conditions and constant injuries.  She's been on medical leave several times the past few years for falls and slips and diabetes-related illnesses.  She lives with her husband who works 2-3 jobs at a time for somewhat low wages but it's a cultural thing for him to work very hard and always be trying to bring in money.  He also has some serious health issues but not nearly as bad as my mom.  He is not the most stand-up guy when it comes to taking care of health, family, etc.  His solution is to go to work.  I wish my mom could rely on him to take care of her, but he can barely take care of himself.

My mom owns a 5 bedroom mobile home that this paid off, but the lot rent is pretty expensive still.  She has lived there with her husband, my 34-year-old sister and her husband, and their 4 kids.  My sister and her husband fell on a hard time and had to give their home up about 4 years ago and have been living with my mom ever since.   My sister has not worked most of her adult life but has recently started a  CNA program at a local hospital and seems to be doing well and is making some money.  Her husband has bounced around to different retail jobs for several years.  They do not pay rent even though I've brought it up several times and discussed it with my mom.  I am very pissed that they take advantage of my mom this way.  My mom is a pull the shirt off her back to take care of any one type of mom.  She has always been that way and I don't think she will force the issue unless I do it for her.  On top of that, her house is falling apart.  The plumbing leaks, there is mold in several closets near tubs and toilets, there are holes in her bathroom tub area so bad that rats can get in.  So they have rodents running around which is super dangerous and the kids should not be around it.  I have threatened to call CPS and warned everyone that they need to stop the rat situation prevent it from happening again, but despite that everyone seems to bury their heads in the sand including my mom.   In addition to the rats, the house is just falling apart.  Holes in the floor, mold, everything is just falling apart.   I want everyone out of there, but I feel like my hands are tied without sending the authorities.  Despite all this stuff, my sister and her husband, my mom, and my husband are all very loving and care deeply about each other so I have been hesitant to call to force the issue.  My mom loves her grandkids and would be devastated.  My mom is financially ruined with debt and has not filed her taxes in 4-5 years so I don't think selling and buying a new home is a possibility. My sister and her husband avoid the conversations at all costs and will bury their heads.  I have tried for several years to have a come to Jesus talk with them.

I don't believe that my mom is emotionally or cognitively able to figure her way out of this situation but she does admit that she feels stuck and is very depressed and very hopeless.  I have tried for years to get her to make changes but she just doesn't do it.  I think it's just such a heavy lift that she can't do it.  I also feel like I can't do it.  I haven't been to her house in 5 years, and it was bad then.  She has a lot of mental health issues and a history of being verbally, sexually, and physically abused as a kid.  She was an addict in her younger years but got clean when I was about 7 years old (about 30 years ago now) and took care of us kids the best she could from then on (I am the oldest, the other kids don't remember all the bad stuff).  I think the drugs did exacerbate the mental health and abuses issues she suffered from as a child.  My mom had me when she was 17 so we pretty much grew up together to some degree.  From a pretty early age, I started to be more of a parental figure in the relationship with my mom.   She doesn't call me and tell me things because she feels terrible about me having to pry out the truth about how she's doing or get a better picture from my other siblings.  I hate our relationship dynamic but this is the way it is and it won't change in this lifetime, believe me, I've tried.

My mom and her husband have been staying with his sister for the past three months to be there for her after losing her husband.  I have been so relieved about this because I knew she would be a better influence on my mom and she'd get a break from all the stress and see what it's like outside of the living situation she has been in for several years.  I kind of figured it would be a temporary thing and I tried to convince my mom and help her plan for what's next knowing I really don't want her to go back to her house.  Unfortunately today, my aunt older her that she is going to be moving and that they would have to go in the next 3-4 weeks.  Logically to me, it makes sense.  Let's find her a new place to live.  But my mom does not think logically.  She feels stuck and says she's just going back to her old living situation.  I talked to my wife and she is okay with her and her husband staying here for a weekend, but thinks it's a bad idea to let them stay at our house for a few months and help them find something new.  I love my mom but I agree.  It would put a lot of stress on my house and we live in a small three-bedroom home as it is.  My other siblings all have full houses with little kids and limited space too.

I have been talking to my mom for a few years to try to get her to plan to get in social security disability and medicare (Medicaid?).  You have to be off of work for a year before you can be accepted, which is troublesome because my mom still works even though she's on medical leave so often.  She doesn't know what to do to make ends meet for a year and I honestly don't either.  I can't afford to care for her unfortunately or I would in a heartbeat.   My bio-dad recently got on disability after being on unemployment due to covid for a year and he has FAR fewer medical issues than my mom.    She feels like she's stuck and has to work until she dies, which I don' think is true.

I really don't want my mom to move back to her old decrepit house and go back to being in a very miserable situation.  I really want her to get on disability and settle down and focus on her all of her medical issues and spend some time with her grandkids.   I really want her to not have to worry about having a  job so she has medical insurance.  I really want to force my sister and her husband to move out and do their own thing without breaking up the family and dividing everyone.  I have a full life with family, a full-time job, and in my last year of college.  I need help, she needs help, and I'm not sure where to even start anymore.  I understand why she feels hopeless because I feel somewhat hopeless at times too.  Any advice or feedback would be amazing, especially in the way of helping my mom get on disability, paying for her basic living expenses and housing, etc.  We live in Washington State if anyone has specific advice for any programs, I'm desperate and want to hear everything."
"28F, and my mother is in her 60s, but I have been estranged since I was a teenager because of her treatment resistant schizophrenia. Going to therapy myself and growing up some, I’ve finally reached a point of acceptance, and have started to rationalize it to myself that it might be close to caring for a parent with early onset dementia.

I feel like it’s made me grow up incredibly quick, in both good and bad ways, and I’m mourning the loss of my relationship with her that I wish I could have, especially since my husband and I would like to have a kid soon, becoming a mom without my own mom."
"I live on the west coast and my parents on the east. While I love my parents and want to help them, they ask for money frequently. They ask for money and refuse to discuss what they are doing with the money and also refuse to communicate around a plan for making a plan for spending/saving.

I want to help support them but am struggling to balance wanting to not give them money till they are willing to look at expenditures or give them money because they are my parents and I worry about them. Has anyone been in a situation somewhat like this and what did you do? 

They get social security and disability, and that's really all their income is. We've cut back on streaming/cable, and are looking to put them on the family plan my husband and I have.

Mom's very depressed, dad isn't mobile. They live in a mobile home that's slowly falling apart. They don't go anywhere. My mom drinks.

Just wondering what to do in general living so far away."
"Hey everyone. We are planning to move my elderly mother back to her home country to live out her days, and I would like to ask for your advice on logistics.

- My mother cannot walk or stand without assistance. She is an extreme fall risk.
- We will use her own wheelchair. 
- She has incontinence, and bowel incontinence. She has an anal fissure. 
- Diabetic with glaucoma. Does not need insulin shots. 
- She uses diapers and pads. She needs to go to the bathroom every 2-4 hours. 
- The flight is 16-20 hours, not including the wait times at the airport. US to Asia. 
- After the flight, there is a 4-hour drive to her hometown.

Please, how can I make this as easy and as comfortable as possible for her and her companion (which would be me)? I have no caregiving training, and apart from helping her walk, I cannot wipe her well because of her anal fissure (I'm incredibly scared of making it worse). We are possibly traveling by ourselves but I am trying to get another companion.

I am sitting here, thinking of how I'm gonna bring her home, and already it is making me feel so exhausted. I also need to return to the US for my work right away. I need guidance.

Thank you."
"My father has 24/7 in-home care.  The caregivers are wonderful.

They help him get out of bed, get dressed and go back to bed, and they cook meals, but otherwise they spend most of the time watching TV, with the TV blaring.

I hate TV noise, so this is a big reason why I’m thinking that 24/7 care is not necessary when a family member is visiting.  

Getting up in the morning and going to bed requires care.  Otherwise, except if there is an emergency, I don’t see the need."
"There's no specific answer I'm looking for, any thoughts are helpful. I've posted here before and I really appreciate having folks to talk to. I (31/F) am single, an only child, and other family died when I was little, so I have no experience with any of this.

My (75/F) mom is not in good health and fell on the ice again. No breaks, but this time she wasn't able to climb the stairs to get to the bathroom or her bedroom for a week. I had to drive nine hours to get to her.

My mom and I don't get along under a shared roof. As a single woman, I also really don't want my mom to ""live with me."" But I'm not sure what other options I have. It'd be nice to see her once a week instead of twice a year.

I'm in the market to buy my first house. I'd like to keep her out of a nursing home for as long as possible. These are the options I see:

**A) Finding my mom a subsidized senior apartment near me** (she is very low income). I'd cover most or all of the rent (~$700). The problem here is that my mom is deeply attached to her three cats, and the apartments I've looked at have long waiting lists and one-pet maximums. I don't think she'd agree to move down here without her cats. Laundry facilities are shared and I don't think she has the strength to walk long distances with laundry.

**B) Getting my mom a normal apartment.** I'd cover rent (~$1,100). Might have to be 30 minutes away. I don't think she'd be able to drive anywhere down here (bad vision, etc) and would have to rely on uber/lyft or me.

**C) Buying a house with a good layout and turning part of it an in-law suite.** In a perfect world, I'd have a detached unit, but that's extremely expensive ($100k+). I'd hope costs would be ~50k. The unit would be really small (300 feet) and she complains about not having enough storage space as it is. Ideally I'd like to have separate kitchen and laundry, but that could be $15k+. A shared kitchen would be uncomfortable because of social occasions and also because I drink (she met my dad in AA...)

Any opinions are appreciated."
"We're in sort of a strange situation and I'm wondering if anyone can relate, or share similar experiences. We're just not sure what to expect...

Let me try to explain this as succinctly as I can:

* My wife and I just turned 60.
* Seven years ago we got rid of nearly everything and moved to Europe.
* It's time to come home and my 92 year old Mother wants us to live with (and take care of) her.
* She lives alone in a large house with plenty of room.

We have some money saved up, but not quite enough for me to retire. I'll probably consult or something. My wife doesn't work, so we should have plenty of spare time to help Mom. (She doesn't need much right now, but that will obviously change later.)

I have been reading that many couples/families eventually *regret* living with an ageing parent. But I wonder if those people were still working? Or still had kids at home?

Would love to hear about your experiences and get any advice that you might have."
Any information is welcome. I’m doing this for the first time and my parents had me late so none of my friends have gone through this. Any must-haves? Any red flags to look out for?
"So glad to have found this sub. My FIL is in his early eighties and in good health except when he is not and ends up in the hospital with various heart problems. He moved to Florida twenty years ago with my MIL, who died about a decade ago, and is stubborn as hell about moving back north near us or even into assisted living in Florida (he lives in a classic Florida retirement home — single level but four bedrooms). Does anyone have a great story about getting a parent into assisted living prior to an abysmal tragedy or is that simply a pipe dream?"
"My grandmother has been moved to hospice with late stage dementia and several infections which do not respond to treatment. She is 93 and lived a good life. 

I haven’t seen her since the pandemic got rolling since her facility did not allow visitors so I have no illusions she will know me. 

I need to say my goodbyes but I want to keep her comfortable as possible here at the end, and I worry some 40 year old man showing up like “hi grandma” would be jarring and distressing for her. 

How do I conduct myself around her when I see her?"
"My mom is 70 and slightly forgetful, occasionally confused, absolutely not tech savvy. My father passed just over a year ago and he was none of those things despite being nine years older. Anyway, since his passing she lost her person/life buddy (he drove, kept her on her toes about things, they were each other’s company) and now she is super bored and depressed because she doesn’t have an outlet for her energy while I’m working (she lives with me). She keeps talking about getting a job but I know she can’t really work…. Are there jobs or activities for older people where they can feel responsible and that they’re contributing without the expectations of the kind of competence it takes to actually perform a job?"
My father died today. I’m numb but I also can’t stop crying.
"Questions are below but the backstory:

My mothers health is declining and she has been living with my sisters. Since then my mom has gone into the hospital multiple times. This last time my sisters actually called it quits and asked the police to take her as they couldn't manage her care.

I don't really get full stories from my sisters and will go no contact with them after my mother passes away.

Lately my mother is in a rehab facility and that facility is petitioning to appoint a public guardian because my sister isnt providing enough information for the facility to get Medicaid established.

I don't really talk to my mother I know I'm a horrible son, but I did get a notice here and I was thinking about applying to become the guardian to help my mother get into a long term care facility. However I live out of the country.

This is in Las Vegas, Nevada if that helps.

On to the questions:

* Are there any good resources for becoming a guardian?

* Would it be smart to take this on knowing I will be out of the country?

* How do I find good long term care facilities?

* How do we deal with Medicaid? The rehab facility seems to be applying for her. I think my mom's pension puts her over the income so what happens then?

* Is there a way to protect her house for my sisters to live in, they really do need it but are adults now. Grandchildren do live there sometimes.

Any tips or thoughts you have are valid even if they don't pertain to these questions."
"So I am in Cali and my mom has medicare A and B. Recently,  due to vascular dementia and peripheral atery disease , I found a private board and care facility close by me in a lovely area. It isn't her own home but it is the best I know how to see she is cared for. She does own a beautiful home that she desperately wants to go back to. It absolutely breaks my heart. However she needs 24 hour care and the cost for that is all out of pocket. Even if we reversed mortgage and did all the things we could be faced with no money and no home for her depending on her hopefully living another 10 to 15 years. I am so terrified I'm making the wrong choices for her. I want her to be in her home but have no idea how people pay for such care long term... am just wretched and so sad."
"Preface: I live in CA, dad's in PA. I am his only living relative in US.

My father (81) is driving me completely mad! Over a year ago he on his own asked me to look for places he could potentially move to as he felt that his house was too big and unmanageable (IT IS!). I was like wow great, I never thought he'd want that himself. 

So I did. In October he actually came here and looked at possibilities and even put a deposit down for a brand new complex which sounds perfect. He knew the opening is the End of March since October.

Now it's just stupid excuse after stupid excuse (taxes, his computer doesn't work, he has to write emails, he has his prescriptions coming to the nearby CVS, he has too much stuff, doesn't have any clothing, has to write emails ect.). Like I get that move at any age especially his is scary but he's done absolutely NOTHING and as far as I can tell his plan is to do NOTHING to move. 

I know It's up to me to go there and do everything but he says he's not ready and that I'm pushing too much, too bossy, and want to run his life. Husband says I should just go there pack shit and put him on a plane, but he's not a freaking infant (acts like one) but I can't do this with force.

I'm pretty sure dad is depressed, I know he's not living, just merely existing (All winter he didn't leave the house becasue it was too cold. He literally left the house 4 times to go to a Dr's appointment. He's made himself a shut in. All he does is complain about everything. He doesn't go to the store just has home help go and then just complains that they don't buy him what he wants, I got a 10 min long cry about how the honey they brought his wasn't good. FFS go to the store yourself!. DO SOMEHTING!  He tells me his life is too difficult and miserable every single day.

I pushed him about the AL facility today (trying to sell it as simplifying his life) as they will want rent by the end of them month. He says it's fine he'll pay the rent but continue living in PA becasue ""he isn't going to live long anyway"" so the money doesn't matter...

God I fucking lost on him, called him a selfish POS, which he is. He's never seen me in anything my whole life and really doesn't get how this effects me at all that, I'm meant to travel to him 4+ times a year.

I'm early pregnant, I've put a transfer on HOLD last year mainly becasue of him (He was supposed to move here last year between Aug- OCT and I was going to help him). But I went ahead with transfer in Jan cause I can't keep putting my life on hold I'm not getting any younger either and so far it's been successful. He doesn't know yet, but knowing how stoic he is I don't think he'll care or that it'll change his mind in any way.

The issue is I know that I won't be able to help him move after June/July, maybe earlier, and then he's stuck in PA for at least another winter and then I have a real baby to deal with. 

So essentially I just have to wait until he falls (which he will (poor mobility, chronic pain and becasue he does fall)) and seriously hurts himself and he won't be able to go home again. Well good luck moving him across county then. He'll be stuck in a home in PA and I'm gonna have to somehow drop my life for the rest of his life to travel back and forth. 

They say I shouldn't stress during pregnancy but this father is the ONLY source of stress and it's so much I've already had a cry today and I'm freaking shaking. 

Sorry for massive lengths diatribe. I'm just so beyond pissed about what happened in the 1.5 years it went from ""yes I want to move into a facility so my life will be easier,"" to ""life is so freaking hard and everything sucks, but I cannot move!"""
"So, I have written a bit about my mother previously. Right now, when things seem to get worse, they really get worse. Currently I am still have POA as my mother has been so-so about granting it to her cousin who is like her sister. My mother has had multiple strokes and she is currently in a skilled nursing home/rehab that she has actually stayed in longer than 3 days (currently going on six weeks and it seems to be quite nice). She wants to go home even though she has no plans for how she will have help when she gets there. She does not want to pay for 24 hour care but that is what she needs. I am pushing her more towards just staying at the nursing home since she can afford it and it is a very nice facility that she can afford. I contacted some local nursing agencies in the area that had availability but she will not take the numbers for them. I have talked to her social worker to encourage her to stay and work closely with my cousins.

My issue is still my uncle. He previously tried to cut my mother off from her family, put a digital lock on her door ""for her protection"" (which he did not give her the code to). I am currently living on a whole other continent but I have been doing as much as I can remotely (and yes, I will be going down in three weeks. Currently my husbands parents are quite ill and we are taking care of them. Also, I am the only one working so my job pays the bills). My mother has payed his bills and the family has helped him his entire life in terms of finances. She even has take care of the house she owns and he lives in (she lives in another house nearby).

Anyways, my uncle now claims that he had my mother sign some papers giving him ownership of a house that he lives in (which my mother owns), some land in a vacation area by a lake that is worth a good bit of money, and , alludes to him owning her house. What hurts is that I have an attorney that I have had go to my mother and explain that she needs a local POA (this I did last September) and he suggested that she either give the house to my uncle or just sell it because my uncle needs to be cut out of her life for good.The attorney has literally been ""on-call"" for her since last year but she refuses to call because she did not see the point of it and did not like him because he is too frank. Now, the crap has really hit the fan and I do not know what to do. I literally cannot just drop everything and run to her since I do have a life here and none of the family leave applies to me. All I can do is tell her what to do ""Call the attorney"". And when I tell her this one day, she can sometimes forget the next day who/why she has to call them if she is over-emotional when I call her. She claims she has not signed anything but she also does not remember things that happened the previous day so it is possible.

Tomorrow we are  changing all the locks on her house (doing this though POA on my side), which I hope she still owns and does according to the county, because noone in the family can get inside to clean it (my uncle will not talk to any of us and we had to call the elderly abuse services on him because of what he did to my mother). It just hurts. Meanwhile my mother is still insisting that she goes home. But at this point, I dont know if she has a home to go to. I just feel so sad all the time. This really hurts and all I can do is watch until I get there and do as much as I can remotely. Sometimes you cannot just ""drop everything"" ."
"Today my dad with dementia blurted out a shameful thing he did when he was 14 back in the 50's. I'm not going to say because, well, this is Reddit. It's pretty bad, and I've been grappling back and forth all day with it. It happened one time and he was has felt bone-deep shame about it all these years, but whoa. I'm repulsed but I also feel pity for him. I don't know how much the truth of it has been warped by his dementia, but the ashamed way he talked about it sounded as lucid as he gets.

I feel like most people find out that their parent is a closet racist. Are other people discovering awful truths from their parents as their cognition declines?

I'd say this is a good reminder to emotionally process your secrets before dementia does it for you."
"Background: I'm 21F and my parents are 72 and 72. They live alone in the house I grew up in when I am away at college which is about 6 hours away.

I'm home for spring break now and I feel like I am watching the beginning of my mothers decline. She has osteoporosis and recently developed some sort of knee injury which has resulted in her barely being mobile. She's had two shots of cortisone and is going back for a third but I'm insisting she goes to PT so she can begin to be more mobile and gain strength. Additionally, she's basically a functioning alcoholic (only at night tho, cheers) which leads to her being increasingly less coordinated and more prone to falls. She walks around with socks on 24/7 and has no interest in me suggesting non-slip socks or any more stable option. She genuinely does nothing. She lays in bed for most of the day everyday and watches things on her IPad or reads. Meanwhile my dad still works full time. Obviously she's over 70, I don't blame her for not working but I do blame her for being completely sedentary and unhealthy. She is missing a large portion of her teeth and has put off getting them worked on for probably close to a decade (money is not an issue). My dad also tells me she eats practically nothing. He says for dinner she will have a handful of cooked spinach. 

I'm frustrated and I'm at a loss. She refuses to just accept that she is older and take the proper precautions she needs to to be healthy. At this point, I am fully convinced she is going to get drunk, fall, and die or be severely impacted. I am only 21 and I am in the middle of getting a masters degree. The impending threat of being a caregiver before I am even 25 feel more imminent every day I watch her do (or not do) anything. I'm not really sure what the point of this post is. Maybe I just need to rant or maybe I need advice. She's fully cognizant. I can't just escort her to the doctor and talk over her and expose everything wrong with her. Well, I could but I think most people will understand that's not the most appropriate approach. And my dad is the best person in my life but he has just gotten caught in the mix of this so I don't blame him. He's just as old and has to take care of himself as well."
Does anyone have experience with a parent with multiple health/autoimmune issues who needs a total hip replacement? Just worried about the outcome and any post surgical issues like infection or blood clots.
"For those of you working full-time and who aren't near your parents, how much of your upcoming paid time off do you allocate towards caring for your parents?

At the end of 2021, I had a huge health scare with my parents, which resulted in me using up all of my vacation time for the year. We discussed selling their house and moving them into some kind of assisted living facility, but that's obviously going to take time. Also, I'm pretty sure that wasn't the last health scare we'll have. My sister and I both work full-time at opposite ends of the country, with our parents being in the middle. I cannot work remotely. My sister technically can, but the shared custody of my nephew complicates that a lot. Also, we have both found that the lack of privacy when staying with our parents makes remote work almost impossible to begin with. Neither of us can relocate and find jobs there, and neither one of us is well off enough to just quit working for a few years.

At this point, I've just allocated all of my 2022 vacation time to parent care and am afraid to use any of it for anything else. This is not really a big deal to me, except that I realized that it's probably going to be that way every year for the rest of their lives. I don't really need the ""vacation"" time, but not having any time to attend to personal affairs is really going to make things difficult. I'm sure other people have to deal with this problem too."
"Just wanted to throw a fist up in solidarity 👊 to those trying to help parents with dementia manage the time change. I spent half an hour on the phone this morning trying to help Dad figure out where he could get the accurate time until I see him tomorrow to change his watches. It is heartbreaking how hard he tries to make sense of it, yet today somehow I managed to tap into a well of patience that, quite frankly, I don’t always have. I am sure I am not alone. ✌️🙏"
"My sister helps my parents. My mom isn't diagnosed but has pretty bad short term memory issues and my dad has numerous issues with mobility, heart and specifically blood clotting. I have been trying to do things to lesson my sister's workload (she is local and I am 3,000 miles away). Previously, I managed all the bills, found stuff (walker, oxygen tank holder, etc). 

I want to focus on getting them more home healthcare this week (month?)  They aren't rich but are freaking out over the costs (my dad has one medicine that is pretty expensive and isn't covered)  Does medicare help with any of the costs for any type of home healthcare? They would be open to almost any help. He gets therapy (a few types). I think if their insurance (aetna) or medicare paid for some they would be more enthusiastic about getting help. (As stands, they prefer calling my sister which is another issue.)  

Thanks for any ideas!"
"My parents are in their late 70s and still using Windows 7. They use their computer for banking amongst other things, and reluctant to upgrade because there will be a learning curve moving to win 10 or 11. While they have virus scan software installed I'm concerned it will go out of support soon, and the other applications they're using (email client, browser) are probably already not receiving updates.

My mother has always been the tech-savvy one of my parents but has cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and is unlikely to pick up a new OS, making it more difficult to upgrade.

I'm tempted to push them towards upgrading as it won't get any easier as they age and the need to update will only increase.

Does anyone have advice on how to deal with this and could share their experience with OS upgrades or otherwise? Seems like tech accessibility is yet to really deal with ageism and the pathways are difficult for people without the means to learn new platforms."
"My mother (who moved in with me a few months ago out of unfortunate necessity) just received a home visit from a wonderfully blunt nurse who told my mother under no uncertain terms that if she continue to sit on the lift chair recliner that the wounds on her bottom are going to get worse (and in fact have gotten much worse since she came by a few days ago). 

During the nurse's first visit a few days ago, she told my mother to lay down on her side and not sit on her rear all day. Mom ignored her (of course) and now the wound is much larger, starting to get infected, and she's grown a new one. 

When the nurse said her peace, I put my hands together as if in prayer, looked her in the eyes and mouthed the words ""Thank you!"" She smiled and nodded at me. She knew. My mother never listens to anyone, especially me, and it's wonderful to hear someone tell it straight to her: If you do ABC, the consequences will be XYZ. 

I just wanted to send a huge thank you to the nurses, doctors, and other care workers who tell the patient what they NEED to hear instead of sugar-coating it. It might not have penetrated my mother's thick stubborn shell, but at least I know she's making the wrong choices for herself and there is nothing I can do about it."
"My Mom had digestive issues before she passed. She would at times have bad problems and went to the ER one night late. I dont know for sure if she had blood in her stool. But she stopped taking them at one point.

My dad the last year had some bad digestive issues. Once or twice a month he woul have a very urgent need to go. And he would tell me it was alot of volume and abnormal. he drank alot of pepto.

Both of them went to the doctor for it and were told to try fiber and probiotics. Didnt really help either of them. When Dad was in the hospital the last time they found he had bleeding ulcers. he never described his stool as bloody or signs of blood. His doctor never mentioned nor checked for bleeding ulcers. Both my folks took BP meds so i'm wondering if they could cause bleeding ulcers? I'm wondering if that was my Mom's problem as well.

What I learned too late is to be more proactive with the doctors. better to ask them to check on things than assume it isnt there. maybe for my Dad it was that he didnt describe it properly. Or really understand. Just thought id pass it along."
"I dont see this in here but i'm wondering if anyone suffers this. You spend so much time and energy and emotion caring for your Mom or dad until they pass away. Its such a big blow and adjustment. Your meaning was to care for them. Even though you know how it will end you do your best to keep it going and not think it could be any day.

Then afterwards you gain a certain clarity as all the emotion is gone. You see every mistake you made. Accuse yourself over every harsh word or thought. Remember everything you didnt do or could have done better. But it's over and you can;t change anything.

I read it somewhere a couple days ago. This is somewhat normal but it serves no good end. You can't just keep running in the wheel and going over it all again and again. You already paid the price and punished yourself. It's not fair to keep punishing yourself. What I do now, 5 months on. I try and be aware of my unwanted thoughts and catch myself. i remind myself forcefully that it's over and done with and can't be changed. No matter how much i could go back and do more.

But I think it would never be good enough. As crazy as I sound I think I blame myself that I couldnt understand better and I couldnt save them. Esp my dad.  I couldnt see through his dementia and understand.  I feel like I failed them both.

But I was here. I'd hate to think what would have happened if I wasn't. In the end we just have to accept and forgive ourselves. Anything else serves no purpose. It will hurt for a very long time. But its getting better. If anyone else out there is in the same way i pray you find peace.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your compassion and kindness. I think I responded to everyone. If i missed someone know that I really appreciate every single response. Take good care."
"my grandma has had a couple of serious falls. she is generally resistant to age-related care but absolutely refuses to consider live in help or moving to an assisted living facility. I've gotten her to accept a visiting physical therapist to work on her balance, they have sessions 3x a week. BUT. she falls and she doesn't tell me!! my step grandfather snitched on her and said she was on the floor for H O U R S before he found her when she fell last year -- he wants her to get life alert too. 

I've heard life alert isn't great in terms of rigid contracts and price, what do you recommend? price isn't an issue, she's in rural Pennsylvania so reliability and ease of set up is king for me."
"My dad is 67 years old. He had a heart attack when he was 63 or so. Quintuple bypass. He did code on the table but they managed to not only revive him but actually make the fifth bypass that really saved his life. No one knows the extent of his use, but he did get addicted to hard drugs in his 40s/50s. He went from being an affluent accountant to divorced and having nothing. So needless to say, he hasn’t had extra money to deal with his health until he finally took retirement this past year. But something seems really off. I spend more time with him than anyone else and there just seems to be something going on that I can’t put my finger on. First- he is extremely noisy. Everything thing he does is very dramatic. He doesn’t set his cup down, he slams it. When he does dishes, he bangs them around. I don’t know how to explain it, but he is ridiculously loud. He talks to himself all the time. I can hear almost everything he is thinking because he says it out loud. He is always sighing and making moaning noises. Often, they’re pitiful like a whine. Sometimes, it’s more of a grunt. Which also comes with audible belching and farting. He seems to have developed an OCD and spends most of his time in the kitchen. He’ll spend lots of time rearranging cabinets and drawers. He forgets where he puts things all the time and gets audibly frustrated. Too many quirks to list. It seems like he makes a mess just for the activity of cleaning it up for something to do. He has no hobbies. Of course I’m concerned about his health. But I’m wondering if there is some sort of mental decline?"
"Complex family dynamics, but my 85 yr old mom is dealing with 3 family members with significant emotional issues who live in her house and who haven't respected her boundaries, she's experienced some verbal abuse, dealt with a lot of meltdowns, and even had two incidents of one person grabbing her arm. She also isn't getting enough help from them. I had enough after trying to intervene unsuccessfully for a long time and finally called Adult Protective Services. They are making a case and will send a social worker to her house. Has anyone else had to do this? What was it like? It's such a volatile situation and I'm nervous about blowback on my mom. I live in a different state. I'm also worried that they would get one person fired (a mandated reporter) or create a permanent record for anyone, and I am trying to make things better not catastrophic for them all! My mom feels very protective of these family members and did not want me to report. I am feeling really anxious. The intake counselor said over and over that they aren't punitive, that they won't do anything my mom doesn't want them to do. Is that true? I'm not sure I handled this appropriately."
"I haven’t posted my mom’s story on here. When I was 21, my dad passed away, and I felt too young, though I had my mom to guide us through it. She passed away today, both unexpectedly given the circumstances, but also not a total surprise. I’m 31, and I again feel too young. I’ve spent the last three week reading everyone’s posts and finding so much comfort knowing I wasn’t the only one going through this. I’ll continue to be around, probably seeking guidance from posts surround settling of affairs. Maybe some day I will post a lessons learned about the whole affair, but right now  I am not quite there. Thank you all, from one internet stranger to another."
"What do tech-challenged elderly folks do when they need to fill out forms and do other semi-complicated things online? We've got an issue with one of our parents being highly unable to do necessary online tasks and constantly requiring in-person ""tech support"" even for relatively simple things (which annoys my spouse immensely). They are moving to an elderly community soon some distance from us. And we may not always be living in the same area, anyway. 

Are elderly folks just expected to go to the public library and ask for staff help? I imagine it's asking too much for some kind of dedicated tech person to be on staff at an elderly community, though the need must be great."
"My mom lives out of state with her husband. She is 61 with no job or income. She is unable to care for herself amd is living in squalor according to some family members that live in her town/state. She is diabetic and depressed. Her diabetes is so out of whack she was in the ER last weekend. 
I feel annoyed, angry, stressed and worried. I feel bad for feeling like I don't want to deal with any of this. I also don't know what to do. She wants to die but won't actually kill herself because she believes if you commit suicide that you go straight to hell. Ok fine..
But self neglect is a slower form of suicide and our plan as siblings and family was to confront her about this. We are looking to get her to give us access to her doctors so we can tell him or her how bad things are so she can get the help she needs.
Getting a medical power of attorney is possibly an option but the law in her state changed recently and the social worker didnt have much info on it. I don't have much info on it. I'm waiting on a ln email back from her states legal advice for seniors dept.
What are your experiences? Please help me, I don't know how much of this is my responsibility, I am working on healthy boundaries just in general but I need help.
We had planned to go down this weekend and have a heart-to-heart talk about her living conditions in her help. We are hoping to basically scare her into giving us access to her doctors so she can get the help she needs. We can get Adult Protective Services involved if we absolutely have to. Thank you in advance for any help or advice that you have to offer"
"We finally have our life in Colorado after moving away from her and Texas. And of course her miserable, 20+ year single, no friends self got a stroke and was in her shit for 2 days.  

She always has horrible shit to say about my race and status even though she doesn't have a car and cleans shit for a living (no shame in that). She talks shit about me in Chinese when it's just me, my wife, and her at the table.  

If we have to move back because of this witch, the resentment will eat me alive. Our marriage won't survive. Giving up paradise to move back home to someone who hates me just because of my skin color.

I really wish she would have just died."
Dentist wants to pull all Mom's remaining teeth for dentures because she has so many cavities.  Oral surgeon disagrees & says she will just lose the dentures.  Anyone have experience with dentures for older parent w/memory issues?
"I’m going to initiate a claim on my dad’s behalf with MetLife to start collecting long term care to put toward his expenses at assisted living. 

I read some online reviews from people who had a difficult time with getting that started, basically some of them said they had a lot of problems dealing with the company, while others said it was pretty straightforward. 

Does anyone have any tips to help ensure smooth sailing with LTC, or even some pointers that they wished someone had told them? I’m really hoping to get this done with as few complications as possible."
"This could probably be crossposted in AITA. And it's a long one, so buckle up.


My mother (77) was wheelchair bound for about the past 5 years or so due to what we all assumed was arthritis. She had been complaining of knee, hip, and back pain for *years* prior to the wheelchair. I say assumed because she has completely eschewed any medical care for the past 35 years (since my sister was born). Although in a wheelchair, she was able to live independently (my dad passed away last year).


4 weeks ago we were moving her to a new, bigger apartment (wheelchair accessible) and she had a minor fall at night trying to use the bathroom (which had all kinds of grab bars). She made it back to bed, but couldn't get out of bed in the morning and was in *severe* pain. After a few hours of trying to help her, I called an ambulance and she *very reluctantly* went to the ER only after the paramedics convinced her. 


At the ER they did x rays of her entire pelvic area and saw multiple masses. CT scans, MRIs followed and masses on her sacrum, spinal column, uterus, and pancreas were discovered. She was admitted to the hospital where she spent the next two weeks undergoing a ton of tests and trying to get her pain under control. 


At the hospital a further *extremely large* mass was discovered in her breast. More tests ensued and the official diagnosis is Stage 4 Metastatic Breast Cancer with confirmed spread to the sacrum, spinal column, and pancreas. The uterine mass turned out to be benign fibroids. She has since been undergoing palliative radiation on the sacrum. The oncologists have said this is not curable - that really only pain relief is the goal. 


We followed up with the Oncologist this week and because her pain has lessened (although she is still on some serious pain meds), he is recommending proceeding with hormone suppressant therapy after radiation for about 4 weeks with the goal being to reduce the tumors to further reduce pain. She told them that her goal is to get back into the wheelchair and living independently again. She told them that she is committed to do whatever it takes. The Oncologist seems to think that with radiation, hormone therapy, and potentially chemo, she could have several years left.


Since the fall/bathroom incident she is completely bed bound, completely incontinent (she was not previously), and cannot even sit up without major assistance. She's lost a lot of weight and what muscles she did have are further atrophied. My sister and I have been caring for her at home for the past couple of weeks with assistance from home health. A nurse has come a couple of times each week, an aide comes a couple of times per week to bathe her and a physical therapy tech comes once per week. She was given PT exercises to work on daily to regain strength.


BUT. She refuses to do the PT exercises when I try suggest it and help guide her. She claims she is doing them on her own (she's not). She is only eating a few hundred calories a day and drinking probably less than 20 ounces of fluids per day. She was severely constipated during and shortly after the hospital stay (probably due to the pain meds). The nurses have repeatedly told her that she needs to eat and drink more, but she refuses.  I am constantly telling her to drink and offering her food which she refuses. She'll ask for certain food or drink, we will accommodate, and it ends up getting thrown out. She tries to refuse diaper changes, but we put our foot down on that one and make it happen.


We have started looking into getting her into a rehab/skilled nursing facility. We cannot manage her rehab ourselves obviously. When we broach the subject, she becomes defensive and shuts the conversation down. We have repeatedly explained to her that it isn't a nursing home and that the purpose is to get her back to at least where she was before (WHICH SHE TOLD THE DOCTOR SHE WANTS. Sorry to yell.). 


She's going to refuse to go into rehab. We know this. The *MAJOR* problem is that I live on the other side of the country and my sister has two little kids. We both work and are both currently on FMLA leave from our jobs. FMLA only allows 12 weeks per year. We can't continue to be her full time caregivers if she remains bedbound. Also, if she remains bedbound, assisted living isn't an option because of the level of care she needs. Not to mention the cost. We've looked into private home care, but that is unreasonably expensive as well. There's not a lot of money to work with. 


She's facing the prospect of a nursing home. I have a career, a home, a spouse, and a life where I live. My sister has the same but with two little ones. I don't have kids and my job will afford me the ability to be set up in old age. I work in a very specialized field that is location-dependent so I can't easily move and replace my job. Plus there is my spouse's career as well. There's a ton of baggage and family history that has caused a lot of resentment in our relationship with our mother. Neither one of us is willing to upend our lives to become full time caregivers especially since she's not willing to make an effort (despite what she told her doctor).


Are we the assholes? Anyone experience something similar? WTF do we do?"
My mom has lived in her childhood home which is a two flat building in the city her whole life. My dad passed in 2002 leaving her a young widow. She got a nice amount of money plus my brother and I received social security benefits until we turned 18. She blew through this money. It wasn’t until my boyfriend who is now my husband and I moved into her downstairs apartment when we realized she had no money to pay the property taxes let alone other bills. We still have no idea what she spent her money we gave her for rent that first year. It wasn’t until 2018 when she got a notice in the mail stating if she didn’t pay her property tax the house would be put on the market in 90 days. So my husband and I had to front an entire year and a half’s rent so she didn’t lose her home. We did it because we had the money. Flash forward to 2020 and my husband and I tell her we had this great idea to make the basement a duplex for us because we have a baby on the way. We thought it would be great to stay and she can help watch the baby while we work. She agrees. We clear the basement out. She then won’t let us spend our money to fix it up she yells at us. She said she’s putting the house on the market next year why waste our money. We decide to buy our own home at this point. She gets angry at us. We are her meal ticket at staying there. We pay the property taxes directly from our rent. We get the house we wanted and leave. She then asks my brother for the property tax money. He has no obligation he doesn’t live there. He’s too nice and pays it. It’s now 6 months later. He wants his money back. We’ve done all the fixing up on this place that we can. Whoever buys this building is just going to gut it out. Now is the time to sell. She refuses to listen. She plays the victim card and the conversation goes nowhere. Property taxes were due March 1. She thinks she doesn’t have to pay them. Whoever buys has to pay it. She has zero dollars to her name she lives monthly off her social security. We literally cannot pay anymore money. She says we can because she knows my husband and my brother have really good jobs. Do we do tough love here? Is there anyway we can force her hand to sell?
"Like the title says, MIL keeps getting lost when driving. So far she’s always figured it out but as we all know these things don’t get better. She lives 2000 miles away so it’s not like I can just go look for her. 

Anyway, I had the thought we could put an Apple AirTag in her car. Not as great as a gps but would give us an idea of where the car is."
"My mom (64) slipped on black ice 4 weeks ago and got a pilon fracture in her ankle (tibia broken in multiple place, broken fibula, and even a fracture just below her knee). She is not going to be weight bearing for another 2.5 months.

My mom has been completely dependent on my Dad and I this whole time.  she uses a commode to go to the bathroom, need helps changing, needs/wants? someone to spot her whenever she uses the walker, ect. She also needs to get up and change positions/locations about every 1 or 2 hours because her hip and butt starts to hurt. Every time is like a 15 minute process rearranging pillows, bringing over a bench to elevate her leg, bringing her phones, computer, and other things to her and trying to make her as comfortable as possible. This of course has been hard on her mentally and physically but it has also been difficult for me and my Dad since we are both working full time (remotely) and I live 4 hours away but have been staying with them to help.

We are hoping my Mom will start to gain some independence as she heals. But it is possible she may require this same level of help until she can bear weight in 10 weeks. My Mom is adamant about not wanting to go to a rehab center and not wanting a home health aide. We had multiple conversations with her and she said, ""I am grossed out by having someone touch me who has been touching other sick people."" I am completely frustrated by her stance but there is nothing I can do about it. It is possible she will change her mind but as of now, she doesn't want hired help.

I have been here helping for 3 weeks and am planning on going home this weekend. The thing is, I don't *need* to go home. I work remotely so i can be anywhere. However, I miss my home, my partner (who I live with) and my cat. I'm in an awkward position because I feel really bad leaving my 70 year old Dad alone to cook, clean, and take care of my Mom (and he works remotely full time). I don't know what is reasonable for me to do in this situation. As of now, I'm thinking I will just go back and forth, like go home for a week and then come back for a week and repeat until my Mom is more independent. I also have a brother but he is dealing with his own personal problems. He helps when we ask him to but he definitely does the bare minimum and cannot be relied on. Ive already fought with my Mom about my brother and she doesn't understand why I am angry at him.

I am just incredibly frustrated that my Mom refuses to allow anything that would make this situation easier for us. I wouldn't have to worry about coming back if she would allow a home health aide to stay here for like 4-6 hours/day. They can also help with light cleaning. Basically my Mom's lack of desire to want to help us is making me not want to help her and I feel like my empathy tank is empty.

What would you do in this situation?"
"Hi Everyone!

I am a student at Yale on a mission to eventually eradicate Alzheimer's, and **I have an important message for y’all in this sub.** If you’re someone who really cares about ending Alzheimer’s, please pay attention!

As I am sure you all know, anyone over the age of 40 is at risk for developing **early-stage** Alzheimer's, and the disease is best fought when caught early. For context, I am working for an early stage, AI-powered diagnostics company called Craniometrix - check them out [here](https://craniometrix.com/) (the founder and CEO is actually my friend from Yale). At the **doctor's** office, the typical diagnostic tests they use to try and catch Alzheimer's before symptoms **appear** are about 30% accurate **at early detection,** whereas Craniometrix has developed a method that is 94% accurate, *using tests that you can do online from your computer in a few minutes.* **They have peer-reviewed academic research on the efficacy of these tools.**

**The founder started the company because several of his family members had Alzheimer’s and it was never diagnosed until very late.** **His mission is to help as many people avoid that outcome as possible, and we can offer the diagnostics to this sub at-cost**, i.e. ***Craniometrix would make no money on these tests***. The goal here is simply to provide as much value to everyone in this group that cares about ending Alzheimer’s just as much as we do! You can use the code ENDALZ to get the test at a 50% discount for only $25

I know this may not generally be the type of content that is posted here, but would be happy to verify my identity, send you all more information, and answer any questions you may have! ***Please dm me or reply to this post if you have any more questions***. I am looking forward to hearing from you all soon!"
"I’m (43F) struggling with my MIL’s (75F) fiscal instability. She is living with us half the year, and the other half of the year she lives in her cottage. She is widowed, on a fixed income, and has basically no savings. 

Last December we learned she was way behind on the taxes for the cottage, and was risking seizure of the property to pay the debt. In addition, she had $2500 of credit card debt that was accumulating interest. 

I paid off the taxes (with penalties and interest) and the credit card debt (again, to stop the compounding interest). I told her I can’t keep doing this kind of thing on the regular: she has to make and keep a budget, or consider selling off the cottage to fund her lifestyle. 

My spouse is functionally the SAH parent: he generates very little income. I receive a modest salary as a teacher, but inherited enough that I generally earn 3x my teacher’s salary in investment gains each year. 

Complicating things is the fact that MIL is trying to do things like pay SIL’s car insurance because she won’t do it herself. 

It’s a mess. Help!"
"Hello everyone.

My grandmother is starting to get up there in age and she is starting to have more serious episodes of  pain and her health is declining. I was wondering if anyone has come across a device that will call a phone number (in this case mine) when a button is pressed.

My grandmother specifically is not a fan of necklaces or bracelets, she doesn't keep her phone with her as I keep telling her she should, and a lot of these events happen at night in a disorientated state. She also is hesitant to call an ambulance, and would call me first if she can.

&#x200B;

I looked a little bit into pagers but the effective  range seems rather low. What I would ideally like is a big button that could sit on a bedside table and when it's pressed it would call or alert me on my phone. In pretty much all circumstances now, she would probably be unable to get up from bed or operate a phone and dial a phone number.

&#x200B;

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance."
"My parents are getting old.  My mom doesn’t drive and needs my dad to take care of anything outside of the house.  My dad is having medical issues and has been to hospital a few times in the last year.  This leaves my mom alone.  Any good services for transportation, possibly food and home check ups, etc is n the phoenix/Peoria area?   My mom is old school with phones and apps.  She would prefer to call rather than get on a computer.   My siblings and I are out of state.  Any info would be appreciated."

"My father has a 4,100 square foot house, with lots of space.  He has 24/7 caregivers, since he’s in poor health.  I spend days at a time living there, to keep an eye on him. (I’m a middle-aged adult and live hundreds of miles away.)

One caregiver in particular drives me crazy; if I go to the kitchen and open a cupboard, I’m asked, “What can I help you find?”  I can’t do anything in what I consider my own home without being followed around and asked what I’m doing.  And the caregiver sits in the kitchen all day with the TV blaring; I hate noise so I just stay in my bedroom.

So I feel like I’m imposing, even though I’m basically in my own home (the house has been in our family for over 60 years and I spent much of my childhood there).

Anyone else driven crazy by caregivers, or feel like a stranger in your own home due to caregivers?"
"Not for advice, just venting.

I solely took care of my step-father's needs for the three months before he passed, when he became so ill he wound up in the hospital, then rehab, then memory care, and had to have additional nursing on top of everything. My mother was too sick, scared, angry, or whatever stage of whatever she was dealing with to pitch in (and I've been having to deal with her care and transport as she navigates a chronic illness these last three years). As you all know too well, there's no handbook for this (I am SO thankful for this sub), one just has to figure it all out themselves. It was a brutal time.

I am now taking care of the aftermath, and I swear it never stops! As soon as I think I've paid the last bill and answered the last notice, there's another one in my mailbox. It's like Harry's letters from Hogwarts. Three or four bills, OK, but this is insane. And each facility has its own system. Nobody cares that the patient died, or what the family is going through. Pharmacies don't care, medical facilities don't care, insurance doesn't care, our government sure AF doesn't care, as long as everyone gets paid.

It just hit me hard today, as I'm sitting here writing checks AND pulling everything together for their taxes. And the fact that we're luckier than most drives me mad. It never. fucking. ends."
"Dad's cancer has spread so much that chemotherapy would only buy him some unpleasant months, so he's decided not to pursue any treatment - which is a decision I 100% agree with (he's 76). His oncologist gave him ""maybe 12 months, realistically, probably less."" Judging by his health and current state, I'll be happy if we get 6. 

We're all flip-flopping around on how well we're accepting this; good days and bad, but nothing that feels out of the ordinary alarming, just family adjusting to the news.

He had an appointment with hospice today. He's still refusing a lot of help he probably needs, but he at least agreed to pain management, and someone coming out and checking in on things a couple times a week.

He also now has a living will and a DNR on file.

My step-mom now has a social worker to help the rest of the family navigate things.

We're trying to find out details to his life insurance policy. He hasn't had the paperwork on it in years. It's through the state, though (retired police officer), so the PD or the local county clerk should be able to get the info for us or at least tell us who to contact to get it. I know he changed the beneficiary from me to my step-mom shortly after he re-married, but that's the last I heard about it. It's not a big policy, but it's enough.

At some point, I think I or my step-mom may need medical POA, but he doesn't seem quite ready for that conversation yet, same for funeral arrangements. We'd thought about discussing them with him this weekend, but the hospice visit was a bigger emotional blow to him today than we were expecting, so I think we need to give that a little time.

It's all been a big adjustment for him; from refusing any and all care to winding up on hospice with a few months left to live all within the span of about 6 weeks. It feels important to give him the space to process that and to make sure we're having quality time together and not making every interaction a conversation about death.

At this point, doing our best to enjoy the time we have is about all that we can do."
"
Sorry there’s a bit of a long backstory for this rant to explain where I’m coming from. To  start my mum is turning 75 and is a senior herself. Been single for 30 years now after leaving my dad when I was 1. She has always been extremely fiscally responsible and creative with money to get us where we needed to be. It was tough but she managed. She’s also intelligent and definitely not a 75 year old physically or mentally- she does laps around my 55 year old in laws. 

Rewind to 5 years ago. The only friends she has that are doing well with aging and retirement are the ones who are married. She’s had 5 single girlfriends and her own mother depend on her in the last 7 years. One she let live with her for over a year while she got herself figured out with money. Another she travelled 600km to visit monthly to help with errands she needed, and then helped arrange her euthanization with the hospital when it came to that. She has children in the same city but my mother was the one to step up. 

Then she has another friend who lives in Toronto which is a bitch to drive to from where we live in the GTA where my mother literally packed up her entire condo, got her into a retirement home, and got her condo sold to finance this living arrangement. Then her friend checked herself out 4 months later because she didn’t like the eating schedule. Now a year later she’s degraded so much mentally we had a care team call my mum since she became POA and is now responsible for next steps while this woman’s family of 2 brothers has essentially abandoned her. 


NOW currently we are housing my godmother at our farm property after her daughter passed away last year. But she is very mobility challenged, has teeth falling out, other health issues and can’t navigate around this new city on her own so now my mum is doing all the appointments, paying for them and wondering how long this will go on for while I’m expecting my first baby and her first grand child. My godmother has another son but he told her to stay where she is because we are helping her.. so essentially he doesn’t want to take responsibility for his aging health-poor mother. 

TLDR and in summation: My 75 year old mother and I got into a conversation because I’m getting defensive of her time and energy spent on taking care of all her old single girlfriends when I just want her to enjoy these golden years. She’s also starting to become resentful for the same reason. I asked her what would happen if you weren’t around for them? What are all these other single women with reduced capacity and finances doing or going to do as they continue to age? This seems like a silent crisis and has me very curious about all of this. 

I guess I just needed to vent. Maybe we’re being selfish for wanting our time alone as our family grows now and we should be happy to help whoever we can…. I just don’t know. I don’t like the amount of guilt and resentment I have for the now current situation of taking care of my god mother. It’s all so conflicting and confusing. 

Thanks for anyone who read this."
"My grandma (90) likes to vent to our family about her caregivers even if her caregivers are working ok. I actually commend them for being patient with her. She likes to bitch to them about being lazy and stuff even if they're doing so much. She also doesn't have interests besides gossipping about other people and finds the city (where she currently is) very boring. Recently, she's requesting to go back to her provincial house which is very far from the city. Healthcare there sucks. Hospitals are far away. She cannot live there on her own anymore (she has fallen many times before). And we told her many many times that it's not practical and no one will accompany her since her caregivers are based in the city. Back then, she had caregivers there who abuse her and thus, the reason why my dad moved her to the city. Is there any way to appease her? Any tips on how to deal with a difficult elderly? We've tried to send her yarns and a crochet hook, subscribed to cable, we even visit her often, but she is just too damn annoying. She really likes to vent which stresses us out. And we're not very young either. We all have heart issues too which she knows about too. It's like she wants to kill us slowly through stress."
"My dad (72) has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder but refuses to believe it. He was inpatient for a month with manic and delusional behaviors. He lives in an apartment, has no money, Medicare insurance. He’s able to take care of himself physically but mentally sometimes that’s a challenge. What living situations are available if it’s a mental illness and not a physical problem? Would that qualify for assisted living on Medicare? Who do I work with to find out? (Living with me isn’t an option; I’m often the “bad guy” in his delusions and apparently at fault for all.)"
"My fiance's mother fractured her hip over a month ago. She denied anything was wrong for about three days before family was finally able to convince her she needed to go to the ER. Once she was admitted and the fracture was diagnosed, the doctors wanted her scheduled for surgery as soon as possible. She refused the surgery. She stayed in the hospital another week, all the while her doctors and my fiance trying to convince her she needed treatment.  

After that week, she checked herself out of the hospital against medical advice and had her sister and BIL drive her home- with a still fractured hip. Her reasoning was she wanted to ""take care of some paperwork"" before going to the Mayo Clinic for surgery. Since coming home several weeks ago, she has remained largely immobile in her wheelchair since she can't move without immense pain.  

Thus far, she has made no efforts to ""get her affairs in order"" so she can have surgery. The hospital sent her home with blood thinners to prevent blood clots from developing, but she refuses to take them. She has pretty severe edema in her legs and it looks like her feet have developed some sort of infection (peeling skin, weeping sores). She is self treating with a random antibiotic she had in her medicine stash.  

My fiance is at his wit's end. He feels like he is watching his mother commit slow suicide. He offers to help her with paperwork and finances but she refuses. She is paranoid he is going to steal her money and ship her off if he has any sort of POA. He's offered to make appointments with a house call service, but she won't give him the insurance info- again due to paranoia.

He can't tell if this may be dementia setting in because she has always been this way. He is completely at a loss for what to do. He is the only child and his parents are divorced, so if something were to happen it would fall on him.  

Does anyone have advice or been in a similar situation? I'm trying my best to help him and her, but she doesn't listen to him and she sure as hell won't listen to me. (She's paranoid that I'm after his money/her house) My own mother is healthy and reasonable (and in a different state), so I don't really have experience with this or know what laws/resources Florida may have available. Appreciate any advice.  

Sorry for the length, but thank you for reading."
"My mother (75) fainted recently and needs to see a doctor. She’s away from her home, visiting me on the east coast. Her insurance is:

Medicare + Aetna drugs + Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield plan G

How do I locate a physician to evaluate her in my area? I’ve googled but there’s not much straightforward information. 

Help."
"Emotionally support\*

My (31/F) mom (75F) was diagnosed with dry macular degeneration in one eye, which severely impairs her vision in one eye and could happen to the other eye, which is fine right now.

&#x200B;

She's upset about it, and I'm not sure what to do say or do. My mom lives in alone in a rural town without easy access to other seniors. She has no retirement savings and lives off social security. She had a bad childhood, a bad marriage, a bad job, and is unhappy with the life she's had.

I want to support her, but I'm worried about her becoming emotionally dependent on me. I'm only 31, an only child, and struggling with the loss of her in a parent role and having to become her emotional caretaker.

She fell on the ice last year and called the ER because she thought she broke something (she didn't, just a lot of pain). When the ambulance was coming to me, she said ""I'm scared,"" and I felt both helpless and in that moment, motherless.

&#x200B;

Is this normal behavior for a parent? Is this just a normal part of the transition in providing eldercare? What should I be doing?"
"Hi Everyone, thank you in advance. My Dad has been diagnosed with early cognitive decline. Has anyone had any experience with Prevagen? He does not like taking medicine in general so if something were introduced I would have to be able to back it up medically (I am a nurse :))."
"My mom (64) slipped on black ice 3 weeks ago and got a pilon fracture in her ankle (tibia broken in multiple place, broken fibula, and even a fracture just below her knee).  She is not going to be weight bearing for another 2.5 months.

My mom has been completely dependent on my Dad and I this whole time. She uses a walker, but she can't get up off the couch by herself because the walker tilts when she leans on it, she uses a commode to go to the bathroom, need helps changing, needs/wants? someone to spot her whenever she uses the walker, ect. She also needs to get up and change positions/locations about every 1 or 2 hours because her hip and butt starts to hurt and every time is like a 15 minute process rearranging pillows and trying to make her as comfortable as possible. This of course has been hard on her mentally and physically but it has also been difficult for me and my Dad since we are both working full time (remotely) and I live 4 hours away but have been staying with them to help.

I'm wondering if anyone has any recommendations for how my Mom can regain independence while she is sill not able to bear weight on her leg. I brought up the idea of an iwalk and crutches to her but she thinks she is too old to use those devices. She is worried about losing her balance and falling. She is interested in the knee scooter but I'm not sure how hard it would be to maneuver in one of those.  If she could just get up from the couch and go to the bathroom by herself that would be incredibly beneficial to everyone.

Also is it normal for someone to not be able to get off the couch themselves while not being able to bear weight on one leg? I don't understand why the walker tilts. I tried to get up with it using just one leg and it was fine. Granted Im 50 pounds lighter than her. Maybe we need a walker for heavier people, but she would still want someone to spot her so it wouldn't even help much. Is it necessary  to spot someone on a walker?

All I know is the 3 of us will go insane if this continues for the next 10 weeks. We really need a solution. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

&#x200B;

Update: I want to thank everyone for all the advice and compassion. I found this EZ Stand device online which is basically a double couch cane. I think that will definitely help her be able to stand up on her own.  And then we are going to get a knee scooter. She seems willing to try both these products so hopefully they will help a lot. "
"I have a widower father who is mobility-impaired.  He has 24/7 caregivers who stay with him and help him.  He is almost 80 and in very poor health.

Every day is the same: he sits in a recliner all day long, is wheeled to the kitchen table for meals, is wheeled back to the recliner, and then is wheeled to his bedroom.  He walks just a few feet per day and goes outside only once every few weeks.

He has vitamin D deficiency and I would think that sitting all day long would not be good for him.  He’s definitely put on some weight.  Surely going outside and even waking around the yard or even just sitting in the sun for 15 minutes would help.

I ask him if he wants to go outside or go anywhere and he doesn’t want to.  

Would you let this continue?  Or would you force him to walk some (he can, with a walker) and force him to go outside?

Thanks."
"My mom is 62 and has had type I diabetes since she was 5. She managed her blood sugars really well for her whole life until she went into a week-long diabetic coma 9 years ago. For a few years after this she still did a great job with managing her blood sugar levels while also dealing with the effects of the coma on her brain (balance problems, memory loss, troubles with handwriting, and more). It seemed like she was doing alright for a time, albeit with some new daily hurdles, until her boyfriend passed away suddenly in 2018. Since then she's been hospitalized 2-3 times per year because her blood sugar levels get too high (600+, she forgets to take her insulin) and often for weeks at a time followed by extended stays at rehab centers. Her balance and ability to walk have declined significantly, as has her short term memory, word recall, and ability to write (though she occasionally has better days). We finally got a diagnosis of vascular dementia a year or so ago, which her doctors noted may have been expedited due to the coma and frequently high blood sugars over the past couple years. After 2 hospitalizations and rehab stays back to back last Fall/over Christmas and New Years (again due to forgetting insulin/having extremely elevated blood sugar levels + an infection) I finally made the decision to move her to assisted living. I know that this is the right call, and we've found a wonderful place for her that will help her better manage her insulin, but I still feel bad that she has to make this move when she is still so young. 

She's remarkably positive about all of the changes (me becoming her POA, selling her house, making the move in general) which is a blessing, but I still worry about her mental health once she's moved and settled. She's a very positive person and can talk to/befriend just about anyone but I worry about her making friends and feeling a sense of community in a place where many residents are typically 80+. When we toured the facility it did seem like there were some younger residents, but still about 10 years her senior. Has anyone else had a younger parent or family member move to assisted living? If so, how did it go?"
"Hi all. My dad is 81 and decided last year that he no longer wanted to live alone and far from family, so my husband and I moved him up to MA from GA. He does live alone in an apartment but it's 5 minutes away. I have been coordinating and taking him to his medical appointments, talking to doctors with him, and keeping on top of his meds. He's always been bad at dealing with bureaucracy and logistical stuff, and he's definitely gotten worse lately.

His memory has gotten noticeably worse in the past two to three years, from normal to forgetting some common words when he's trying to describe something, forgetting birthdays etc. His dr up here did a memory test and said he has mild cognitive decline. 

So far he can still drive, cook, do housework, etc. However, he doesn't have any interest in pursuing his memory loss further medically to determine what part or parts of his memory or cognition are worse than others. That's fine, it's his choice, but for me it means that I don't know if/how it'll progress.

Right now, no one has power of attorney. My mom is his primary health care proxy and I am the alternate. We are going to change that so I'm the primary. 

My question is really about power of attorney. I think that appointing me as durable power of attorney makes sense so that I can handle financial issues if they arise, but I'm unsure of whether it should be effective immediately or only go into effect if he is deemed incompetent. My dad doesn't have any objections to either. Do those of you with experience with this have any opinions? 

We did meet with an estate lawyer but she wasn't any help. I told her beforehand that I wanted to make sure his will (drawn up in GA) was sound, that I'm the executor of his will and wanted to make sure that what's in the will and the beneficiaries on his accounts match, and that thought I should have power of attorney, and when she met with us, she was hostile toward me from the beginning. I understand that people do try to and succeed in taking advantage of their parents, so I can see that me bringing him in and asking about those things was suspect, but that's what every website about helping elderly parents tells you to do! In the end she refused to help us.

Anyway, I say that just to be transparent about why I'm not asking a lawyer these questions. 

Thank you in advance!"
"We decided to purchase a Hero pill dispenser for my mom because sometimes she forgets to take her meds, or if she took her meds, or doesn't remember which to take when, and if she doesn't fill her pill box at the beginning of the week she's lost. After some research, we decided to buy the Hero for her. Here's some things we didn't know before we got it, but learned quickly after. 


- it's very easy to break into the machine. It comes with a Fisher Price type key that just hits a trigger when you put it in and that pops the door open. You can easily reach it with a paperclip or bobby pin. 



- once the machine is set up, if someone tries to open the machine, it will send you an alert that it was opened. Which is good. However if you unplug the machine, then open the door, then plug it back in, you won't get notified. Less good. Also if there's a problem with the machine, it may prompt you to open it and reinsert a tray. When it does this, it doesn't notify the caregiver that the machine was opened. 



- the machine is INCREDIBLY loud when it's dispensing. It makes a loud grinding, vibrating noise that sounds like someone is drilling through your foundation. This was a real surprise to all of us. 



- the machine tells you when your medication has 7 pills left and reminds you to refill your script. This is helpful. They also have their own pharmacy that you can use that will automatically send you refills when its running low. This is also good (we haven't tried that function yet). You can't, however, change the set number for pills for when to remind. This is very unfortunate. If you have a medication that you need to take 6 pills a day, a reminder at 7 only gives you 1 day to renew. I contacted the company and they said to ""lie"" and tell the machine there's less pills in it than there are, so when it thinks it's empty, it's really not. Seems like there should be an easy fix by updating the app, especially if this is a known issue. 



Overall we've been pretty happy with it. My mom was nervous that it was too much technology and it scared me her, but in less than a day she figured out how to dispense her scheduled doses and request ""on demand"" doses (this does notify the caregiver, which is great). She wanted the schedule changed because it was waking her up too early and I was able to do that remotely. I was also able to change the dosing that was incorrect remotely. I hope this helps someone that was thinking about getting the machine, because these are things I would have liked to know beforehand."
"I see a lot of posts and replies of the sentiment of ""Let your parents lie in the bed they make"" or ""They are not your problem to fix"" or ""You have to let them make mistakes"" or the like. 

I understand the intention of wanting to either respect your parents' autonomy or to create boundaries in order to keep your sanity BUT THIS ADVICE IS LARGELY UNHELPFUL!!!

A lot of us are in situations where our parents' physical safety or financial stability is in our hands. Also, their emotional and social state is fragile due to the myriad of changes that happen as they age so we are also rightly worried about those aspects. Not to mention that if our parents make a mess of x y or z, we're the ones who have to fix it because they aren't able to and there's no one else to do it. Boundaries are a luxury not all of us can have.

I don't come here to be told to let my parents run their lives' into the ground if they want to. I come here for helpful, concrete advice and support. So next time you advise someone to let their parents do whatever they want regardless of the consequences...just don't.

Rant over.

EDIT: I seem to have dug up some powerful feelings from the community with this post. I stand by my statements but I also want to acknowledge that caring for an aging parent is difficult and I'm sure we're all just trying our best."
"Hi everyone. I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice or experience with this. My mother (71) has been declining for several years - I think about 10. Her own mother developed vascular dementia in her 50s and died at 76, and also had debilitating osteoarthritis in her neck, which my mother also shares.

I think that the chronic pain (which absolutely ruins my mother's day to day life) makes her cognitive function worse, but that the dementia issue would still be there without the pain.

The problem that I have is that she will not make a doctor's appointment for either issue, and she won't speak to me about it without weeks of rage and silent treatment afterwards. I know that she finds it distressing and antagonising coming from me, but she has always been difficult to speak to and has become even more difficult and angry and I can't really cope with it any more if nothing is addressed. She did bring up ""memory issues"" herself at a follow up appointment for a hip replacement a couple of years ago (I was present) - her GP laughed and said if she hadn't left the gas on and knows where she is then there isn't a problem. But there is definitely a problem. 

To my actual question - I've drafted a letter to send to her GP to ask if they can somehow broach the subject (pain, brain or both) with her without mentioning that I've said anything. Is this an approach that any GP might take seriously or even be able to follow up? I've got no family to discuss any of this with and am feeling a bit lost so I was wondering if anyone might have some wisdom to share.

I know this is garbled, thank you for your time if you got to the end!"
"My 98-year-old mother lives with me. She is in pretty good health, but gets dizzy sometimes and has fallen. I want to get a surveillance system to watch my mother when I need to go out. I am thinking of getting Blink cameras and setting them up in strategic locations. Has anyone experience with them? Is there a different system that you would suggest?"
"Hi there, 
Well this is horrible. My mom had a stay in a hospital for a foot wound concurrent with some dementia and is now in one of these places. The area of the skilled nursing facility is nice but the inside of this place is awful. To say it is tearing me apart to leave her here isn't enough. However, due to fall risks etc etc , she has to stay here for awhile.  Reddit, the staff just seems over it and some have serious attitude.  If I'm visiting and my mom need to use the bathroom,  some are utter jerks about the inconvenience.  Would you A. Be just the sweetest and attempt to befriend and endear yourself ( and mom) to them? Acknowledge their hard work ( and I am sure they do work hard) and profusely thank them while holding back and sass? Or B. Be reasonable and professional but confront any attitude and be clear that such is unacceptable? I'm so tired. The hospital itself was a nightmare of miscommunication, morphine and a general ""idk"" from everyone. 
Side note is that I'm in the veterinary field at a non profit.  I'd rather have my mom there. The care, the attention and overall dedication supercedes anything I've experienced on the human side. 
Thanks so much, reddit peoples ❤"
"Hello All,

Just wanted to get some input on any ideas people have for inspiring/motivating aging parents? My mother is only mid 60s but already showing some decline in physical and mental status. Covid definitely made the situation worse with social isolation. I visit 2-3 times a week and she lives alone. Living separately was a choice made on my part for my sanity. However it does often seem like its a lose lose situation. Living alone causes her to be lonely but more independent. Living with me causes issues in my own mental wellbeing and dependency on me. I am in my late 20s and still trying to have a sense of my own life - no partner yet. 

What are some suggestions that you may have: 

Currently, 

\-Promote social activities: going out with friends

\-Daily exercise

\-Daily brain activity such as word search/puzzles

\-Daily communication - I call once a day/visit 2-3 times weekly

I feel like you can only do so much to help.. Ultimately the person needs to want to help themselves and we can support them. 

Welcome any ideas/suggestions! Thanks to all in advance."
How do you know where to draw the line between needing to get a parent declared mentally incompetent vs. them possibly being ok but just making horrible life choices as they age? 😔 I just don’t know how I’ll know where to draw the line but feel like my parents are on a fast track to no good.
"\[NY\] We are currently renting a townhome two doors down from my MIL's place, which she owns outright. She has been diagnosed with dementia and is currently in a care facility, where she is likely to stay. We moved to be close to her when she was diagnosed with cancer, but she went into a somewhat miraculous remission (at least for the past year or so).

MIL receives social security and a monthly income from investments. Not sure of the amount, but I think the total is around $4000/month. Her Medicare coverage (not sure if that's how you put it) at the facility runs out today.

MIL's cousin has POA, and is advising we sell her home. However, she is very open to whatever my husband thinks. My idea is that we pay rent to MIL (hopefully less than what we are currently spending), while cleaning/renovating it for eventual sale. My husband has a sister, and there are no other direct heirs.

What do we need to think about, plan, do? What is the best way to proceed?

UPDATE: It's looking like MIL doesn't have a whole lot of savings and income, so we'll probably have to sell her home. Will update more later as I get more information. "
"Like so many here, dealing with a difficult parent. Mother is 83, divorced from my dad 35 years ago, remarried in her 80s, second husband died a few years ago. Have a difficult and distant relationship due to her behavior throughout childhood and then also as an adult. Shes made terrible financial decisions her whole life, culminating in deciding to move a giant household of crap from TX to SC ""to be near family"" who didn't want her 8 years ago. She expected my brother to take care of her and her husband, despite our stepfather being an almost stranger to us and that he has his own kids in IL. Since he died shes gone downhill, several health problems, was hospitalized last year and her health and cognition declined rapidly. She is literally malnurished due to multiple abdominal surgeries and her poor appetite. She was sent home and I flew to SC (I live in WA) to stay with her for a week. Her house was filthy, bug infested, cats not cared for (skinny, fleas, untenable litterbox) and cats had toileted all over the house. I cleaned, I hired caregivers for daily help. My brother lives there but hes really really busy, and also my brother cared for our oldest brother who died young of cancer and then our Dad who had Alzheimers and lived with my brother and his wife for 5 years. My brother also lived next door to his in laws. He told my mom flat out she should not move to SC he could not take care of her. But she was butt hurt since he took care of our Dad and did anyways. We hoped being home and recovering from her illness would let her get better but her cognition slips more and more. Shes no longer safe alone. She can't take her meds correctly, she doesn't eat. She pays lip service to eating but secretly is happy shes thin and let it slip a few times she doesn't want to gain any weight. No insight into teh fact shes literally malnourished. I also think she thinks she ate (remembering eating yesterday) when she hasn't. She finally (with much drama, yelling ""get out of my house and don't come back"" etc etc) agreed she needs help, agreed to move to assisted living. Because of her health issues she has a chronic wound and won't be accepted to assisted living in SC. She could move to WA and they would take her here. Plus I'm a health care provider and I know stuff and can help her arrange care. Since she has no money (many years of squandering it especially buy a crapload of stuff that fills her house) the only reason this is an option is the housing market gave her some equity in her house. But it needs emptied, it needs repairs and its not going to sell for top dollar until shes out and its fixed up. She initially agreed to make my brother POA but is now freaking out saying were stealing her stuff. She thinks she has another house somewhere with more stuff in in ""and shes not going anywhere until she goes through it all.""She thinks her lifetime of collected totchkes and junk is valuable and she ""has to get someone in here."" SHe can't dress herself anymore.  Its constant arguing. We went through 2 weeks where she insisted she was not in the house shes in. She keeps saying ""no I also have a house at 123 Mystreet"" and when I tell her thats where she is she says ""no! I'm at that place by the lake!""  I can no longer pay for caregivers, its costing a lot. I considered putting out my own money to get her into a facility here and then taking it back from house proceeds but as my husband points out, without one of us being POA she doesn't have to pay me back and honestly with her personality I could see her not doing it plus her cognition. Finally got the Dr to take me seriously about her cognition but can't get an appointment with neuro to get a test and diagnosis until late March. My brother is having to go twice a day to give her her pills because even with a pill organizer and reminders she skipped doses, took the wrong doses, takes the meds out of the box, sets the on the table then never takes them. Shes furious he took her drugs and thinks she can manage them herself.  I'm very close to pulling caregivers, calling APS for self neglect and asking the state to apppoint a guardian."
"How do you encourage your parents that it is better to stay in rehab/go to the adjoining assisted living rather than going home? I feel that my mother has more freedom if she lived in a nice assisted living rather than at home with nursing care. She doesn't seem to realize that the costs for care at home with end up topping the costs of the assisted living and this does not include the extra benifits assited living offers (ex. rehab/pool use/activities/house cleaning/preparation of food/travel with their bus to places in the city like her doctor/store/even local casino). Currently she is in a nice high-end rehab center and they have an adjoining assisted living that looks really nice. I have talked to the social worker and asked if maybe they could have people who live there who are my mother's age (77) to talk to her because she thinks she is too young for assisted living and she would prefer to be at home. But she has to have 24 hour nursing care at home and to me, it just feels that she would lock herself in at home rather than participate in the more social setting the assisted living offers. I realise she has to make that choice herself but she seems to not see that the option she wants is actually making it tougher for her. Everytime she has been at home, after one month, she has a fall, lands back in the hospital and back in rehab. This has been happening since last september."
"I want to figure out a way to listen to podcasts with my elderly mom across the internet.  She can’t trigger it herself, (too complicated and she has Macular Degeneration) but I think she’d really enjoy the experience. 

Something like this; we start a FaceTime call and then I can trigger a podcast on both ends and we listen together on our individual devices while still being able to talk  to each other. 

She has an Echo, but can barely remember how to use it beyond asking the weather.  I  get her a HomePod mini if that would be easier for the process. She also has an iPhone and iPad. 
Any suggestions?  Thanks!"

"With a father half paralyzed by stroke and a number of other medical mishaps over the years with other family, I'm at least acquainted with the negatives of modern medicine. I stumbled upon Being Mortal in a book store and, intrigued by the title, went on to read the first few pages of the introduction before buying it and reading the rest, and I have to say that for everyone in this sub and anyone else, this book is a must read.

As a physician, Gawande recounts anecdotes of the elderly, the infirm, and the ill (both severely and terminally), and at each junction explores modern medicine's tendency to maximize safety and prolong life at the cost of a patient's overall well being, to which quality of life is extremely important. We put out parents and grandparents in nursing homes after the point at which we can no longer care for them, both to unload our burden as well as give them the care they need. This, though, comes at the cost of their pride, freedom, and way of life - and with it their identity. Close ones may be struggling with a severe or terminal illness and we wish for them to continue treatment hoping the condition is cured, but at the cost of a deluge of side effects that cripple their previous way of life.

I often am biased to my own perspective and often do not consider what my father's or mother's perspective might be when frustrated at their lack of ability to deal with the situation at hand, but this book has left me more sympathetic and understanding, and I hope that to anyone who has read until now that you also read this book and come away with it better able to understand and cope with your situation, whatever it may be.

tl;dr Being Mortal by Atul Gawande is a fantastic book that is a must read, especially for the people in this sub, that talks about how to deal with those approaching the end of their life and doing so with compassoon"
"I'm looking for something that is easy to get in, offers support and an added bonus would be if they look good.
Any help would be appreciated."
"Hi all,

I’m finding the constant surprises almost worse than the realities of helping our parents. I’ve now spent 4 hours on the phone trying to figure out what’s going on today. 

My dad was hospitalized with Covid, then went to rehab, and is now getting released. The terms that people use. The procedures. Who arranges for home care, the facilities or us? It’s all a constant surprise and a mass of confusion. 

Is there a book? 
Things like Senior Living vs assisted living vs home health care vs ???. Aids vs nurses vs therapists? When do they need which services? When do they need to move to a different apartment with more services? Definitions for all the terms. Pericare means cleaning his butt?  But also other things? Maybe? 
Medicare vs medicare supplement insurance vs medicare replacement insurance vs ???."
"I've posted about my dad a couple times before. He's 78 and has many medical problems. He's doing ok now and most days can get around fine and take care of his basic needs. Every two weeks or so though he has a couple bad days where, although he can still take care of his basic needs, it's only barely and he spends the days in bed. 

He currently has 3 caregivers.

One is a VA caregiver and they come 3 times a week for a couple hours to help with basic household chores. He's gone through several of these. He generally treats them like shit and they stop showing up so he has to call the VA and get them to send someone else.

One is a lady who used to be my mom's caregiver before she died. My parents knew her from my dad's job when he still worked and she got fired for stealing. My parents believed her saying she was falsely accused (I don't believe it for a second) so they started giving her money to come take care of my mom when she got sick. A few months after my mom died, my dad fell, broke his ankle, ended up in the hospital, got covid, went into a diabetic coma and almost died. His recovery took a while and when he was released from rehab this lady became his regular caregiver. She's a piece of shit. Horribly racist. She's always talking shit about everyone, including me. She tells my dad I'm a bad son for not doing everything for him when she's too busy. She's had my dad's friends call me to complain I'm not taking care of him. Every now and then my dad will get into a fight with her and they won't talk for a couple days. I'm guessing at some point she realizes she needs the money and comes crawling back. If I say anything bad about her to my dad, he gets upset and says she's been there for mom and him. He won't let her go.

The third caregiver is a friend of mine. I had to go out of town one weekend when the piece of shit caregiver was going on vacation so I asked this friend, who was recently out of work and losing her house and could use the money, if she'd mind hanging with him for the weekend while I was out of town as this was when he still wasn't able to care for himself. By the time I came back my dad had asked her to move into the addition on the house, rent free, so he'd have someone nearby overnight when his other caregiver wasn't there. I wasn't involved in this decision at all, but I warned my friend that my dad is very stubborn and can be a real asshole. She decided to go through with it.

Flash forward to now, my dad has decided he wants to move. The house has too many memories and he's upset all the time so he wants out. He talked to a realtor and is moving forward, but has basically been told in this market he's looking at May at the earliest to buy. My friend was there for these conversations and so was trying to get something lined up for May. Now my dad has told her she has to be out by the end of March because he doesn't believe the realtor.

What I know has happened is the piece of shit caregiver has been complaining that my friend is a loser, destroying the house and he should kick her out because she's dating a black man and brings him over. I'm willing to bet a lot of this is her ranting at him and putting these ideas in his head in the first place. 

So that's where we are. My dad is kicking out the one caregiver I trust and will be stuck with just this other lady and she's both unreliable and a terrible person. Of course my dad isn't even thinking about what happens when he gets worse and this lady goes missing for a few days like she does as well as not having anyone there with him overnight. He had a good deal with my friend and he sees it as he did her a favor and says she didn't actually do much anyway.

My instinct is to lay it out straight for my dad. ""You'll be left with just this one lady. When you get worse, and you will, and she goes missing or you get mad at her, which will happen, absolutely do not call me crying that you need me to drop everything and come help you. The answer will be no. You had options and you made your choice.""

I know he won't take that well, but his response could be anything from ignoring it and saying I'm overreacting and it'll be fine to him breaking down and threatening suicide which he's done to me before. He's very emotionally unstable. 

Does anyone have any better advice for me before I go down that road? I'd really appreciate it."
"My dad (64) has had dementia that was clinically diagnosed about 3 years ago (lived a hard life). On Christmas Day, he fell and broke his hip. Sadly, he ignored the pain until a week later (New Year's Day), when he called me and said he hadn't moved since he got home. He was taken in an ambulance to a hospital in NY where he has now been for 53 days. After his hip surgery, he basically fell into a near-coma state, where he couldn't speak at all for close to two weeks. The doctors are adamant that he didn't have a stroke, so they are uncertain why he has declined so rapidly. Since then, he has been able to speak, but what he says is totally nonsensical. I talked to him tonight, and he told me he couldn't talk because he was ""in traffic driving back from Connecticut"". He doesn't know where he is, what year he is, who is, or why he's even in the hospital. He has been taken off a feeding tube, but is fed via spoon pureed meals. He hasn't moved his body since he got there, let alone gotten out of bed. The hospital is eager to get him into a long-term care facility, but spaces are far and few between. Has anybody experienced this situation, and what the future holds?"
"I’m wondering if someone can walk me through the steps of how to get my dad the care he needs. Here is the situation. My dad (92y) and my mom (87y) live together independently. My dad has been losing his cognitive abilities faster and faster to the point where my mom has to do everything for him. He doesn’t appreciate this and is quite angry with her that she won’t let him use the kitchen or drink alcohol or go places on his own. This is all very hard on her and my brother recently suggested that it is time “to put him in a nursing home”. I am wondering how we would go about this….last year I hired a home health aide to come to my parents house to help with ADL’s, and cooking and cleaning and my dad just absolutely pitched a fit and refused cooperate with the helper and was threatening to walk out and leave the house so my mom caved and discontinued the service. I don’t see how we would keep him in a assisted living situation. I asked my mom to go to the local council on aging and ask for advice. And also to make an appointment to speak to his doctor about his condition. Are there specific diagnosis he would need to have to be declared incompetent? Does my mom need to speak to a lawyer? Let’s assume my dad is not going to willingly sign any POA paperwork. Please can I have guidance about the steps to take and questions to ask. Oh also….my mom would not be going to AL….she’s in good shape mentally and physically. Thanks"
"Myself and my family (husband, 2 small children) live in Texas. My mom (64) lives in Florida with my stepfather who has end stage COPD. He is starting to fall a lot and may need hospice care soon. My mom and I have a decent but distant relationship after growing up with an emotionally abusive neglectful one from her my entire life.
My mother refuses to acknowledge his declining health and has a mental breakdown any time I mention her plan for after he passes. I don’t know what her finances look like as far as being able to live on her own (she works part time as a hair stylist). And today has mentioned to my other sister that she would move to Texas to be closer to me and my babies and visit my sister (NY) during summers. 
Again, I have no idea how she would manage this as she is terrified to do the smallest things (fly on a plane, drive on a highway, organize her personal affairs) my stepfather has always done these things for her or with her. She cannot afford to live in even an efficiency apartment in the area in which I live, I know that much. The mobile home that she lives in in FL is worth about half of what it would cost to buy one here.
If she were to move in with us, I fear it would tear my family apart. It would be like throwing an atomic bomb in my home. She is selfish, rude, disrespectful, and constant victimizes herself if you try and talk to her about anything as an adult. When my sister told me about her plan (she has never mentioned any of this to me before) I had a panic attack and chest pain and felt like throwing up. If that’s not a sign that this cannot happen, I don’t know what is. 
How do I have that conversation with her? Again, she barely does anything for herself and I often feel like I have to parent her.
I also don’t want to pawn her off on my sister who has grown children and is enjoying her first taste of independence in 26 years."
"My parents are in their early 80s. They get by day to day, but the house they have is too much. It’s about 20 years old now and needs updating/fixing constantly and they just aren’t interested in doing all the yard work, cleaning, etc. I think they would be happier in a condo. The thing is that I don’t know where they will be in 5-10 years. They have expressed interest in independent living type places, but don’t want that now. Is it better for them to stay where they are and move later on? 

The other concern is they don’t love the area they are in. It was a retirement area when they moved in, but now it’s mostly families with young kids. They also don’t like the traffic and things like that. They would like to be with other retirees, but I wonder how difficult it would be to move to a different city/town and have to find new doctors, driving ins new area, etc.

They keep asking me what I think they should do and I really don’t know. I’ve tried researching and that is what brought me here."
"Parents both in their 80's are not coping well and need more support. Mom was very independent and able to care for Dad up to a few months back when he fell and broke a femur. This required rehab, hospitalization and once he got back they both contracted COVID, presumably from the assisted living facility. 

Mom is unable to care for him at this point and it hoping one of my siblings will care for him but we are uncertain if he will go live with them. He has some mental challenges that prevent me from caring for him and prefers to lean all over Mother for care. She can no longer support this. She is still weak from COVID and can barely care for herself. If her situation doesn't improve I will need to provide full time care for her. Already, I've put my career on hold. With all the doctor visits, shopping for her, making arrangements, etc I don't have time to work but need to go back to full time employment soon. 

She refuses to go to assisted living and I don't blame her. I'm looking into a over 55 condo complex that is nearby a medical facility hoping we can get her situated there. Is anyone else in a similar situation? Could you provide some advice?"
My mother had pneumonia and was in the hospital for about 6 weeks.  We got her into an acute rehab facility but they are saying she can only stay for 14 days. Can she go to a skilled living facility/rehab until her 100 days are up on Medicare to get her stronger or do we have to take her home. We have TriCare and extra money for nurses but I was just hoping she would be stronger before we took her home. Any help would be appreciated.
"I’m in my early 30s and my father is in his mid 60s. He had a stroke 3 years ago, and started showing symptoms of dementia about a year later. As his physical health improved from the stroke, his judgment, memory, and temperament started declining. Simultaneously as all that was going on I also started becoming more and more angry about my childhood. I figured that I’d probably never get any apologies about anything about my childhood, but not that my father has dementia I know that it’ll never happen. 

As an adult I haven’t had the closest relationship with him as an adult, but to be fair I’m very standoffish and distant from everyone. I feel like I should be empathetic about his situation, but I’m not. All I can think about is how miserable he made me as a child. I was pulled out of public school to be homeschooled in the 3rd grade, but my parents barely taught me anything. I denied a basic education and socialization from children my own age for no real reason except for my father being a narcissist and thinking he could educate me better than the school district but he never really attempted attempted to educate me. 

I also have a few memories that I barely thought about previously, but recently I can’t stop thinking about. When I was in my early teens my father attempted to groom me over a few weeks, then a short time later tried to convince me to take a shower in front of him (view my post history if you want to see the full story). At the time it seemed kinda weird, but the closer that I get to bring his age at the time of the incident I realize how inappropriate that was and it makes me hate him more and more. I try not to dwell on the incident, but it keeps popping back in my head, nothing actually happened, but the more I think about what he attempted the angrier I become. 

So at this point my father has been in an assisted care facility for a year(a pretty nice one I might add) and I only saw him once since he was admitted. He doesn’t have access to his money, a phone or a computer. He doesn’t have a phone anymore because he kept calling 911 on the staff over trivial or non existent problems. He’s always felt that he’s the smartest person in the room and even though he has dementia and is aware of it, he still feels that way. And the police are the only thing that he tries to use to gain control. 

I feel like I should feel bad about his predicament, it’s basically like he’s living in prison with occasional visits from my mother and sister. But I don’t feel bad about his situation, I just feel bad about not feeling bad. I know this has been a long rambling drunk post, but I’m curious if anyone has experienced a thing that I have or if I’m just a sociopath?"
"I have been majorly depressed recently due to some life issues. Im not going to be able to keep my promise to my parents about taking care of them. My dad is just making me feel like crap all the time and pushing me to meet new people while at the same time just taking care of them 24/7 basically. I love them dont get me wrong and i feel super bad because of my dads medical issues, I guess I just dont know how to tactfully tell them this.  I was referred here by relationship advice."
"I am guessing that most elderly people who become antisocial shut-ins were probably not terribly social when they were younger, and that old age is just amplifying their normal personality. My mother is the complete opposite. She spent 50+ years building and cultivating her social network, and is the most extroverted person I've ever known. Her entire reason for living has always been in-person social interaction.

Recently she had a complete mental breakdown, which resulted in 2 stays in a psychiatric facility, where she was treated for severe, severe depression. Coming from both her era and culture, there is a huge, huge stigma surrounding mental illness. It does not exist. You do not talk about it, admit to having it, or know anyone who has ever suffered from it. It just isn't done, period.

She is actually doing a lot better now, but she absolutely refuses to talk to her many friends. She won't even talk to her two siblings, which is really sad. The thing is, her image and reputation are everything to her, so she doesn't want people to see her in her current state. I think her current plan is just to die without having contact with anyone on the face of the planet besides my father, my sister, and me. This is obviously making her even more depressed, because her entire reason for existence is social interaction. I am not sure what to do about it at this point. Therapy doesn't seem to help, because she has a deep-rooted bias against that too, and can't let her friends know that she has been in therapy."
"Hello to all who have followed my family's story over the past year. For those who haven't kept up, last January (2021) I came to the conclusion that my parents, both 90 at the time, could no longer be safe and well in the house in which they had lived for more than 55 years. In March they moved to assisted living, and I documented the entire process on this sub using the ""I HAVE MOVED MY PARENTS"" title line. During the course of 2021 both my parents passed away. Today I document the closure.

Yesterday was my mother's funeral. She was Catholic, so it was a requiem mass per her wishes, delayed because she passed on Christmas Eve and key family members were held out of state by COVID concerns, job pressures, and bad weather, until finally we were able to have the service.

As we had done when Dad passed in July, my brother and I collaborated on the eulogy, sharing the job of presenting it as the mass came to an end. It went well.

While my brother was in town, we completed all the financial business. We have a great relationship and were able to do everything without any rancor at all. This involved some banking and, along with our wives, going through Mom's jewelry boxes and making some selections, again without any problems.

And now, my brother and his wife are on their flight home, and the other relatives and friends have left as well. It's just me, sitting at my computer, not sure what I'll do with the time I will have on my hands. I have lots of choices and will prioritize with my wife things like home improvement, travel, new service opportunities, all things we'd like to do before we get much older.

My parents' bills and final taxes are all paid, the accounts all reconciled, there's not much more to be done. One thing remains, and that is that in the next day or two I'll return Mom's ashes to the funeral home and they'll see that she joins Dad in the national cemetery in Portland where they'll be reunited at last.

I miss them terribly but I realize they had good long lives full of love and togetherness and that the time came for their passing whether I was ready or not.

Now we come to what I really wanted to say in this post: I wanted to say what I learned and to leave a message for all you care givers.

I learned that even though sometimes it's hard to care for aging parents, it's worth the effort. A time will come when you'd give much to hear them sing again or tell that same story. Readers of my posts will be able to see the times I wrote about frustration, fear, maybe a little bit of anger, despair, and yet, it's worth it and I'd do it all again.

Additionally, I want to tell you all who are caring for your loved ones that to me, you are heroes. Many of you have it way worse off than I ever did, and yet you persevere, sacrificing your time and energy to help those too sick and weak to help themselves. This sub is a good place to vent, as people will always provide thoughts and encouragement. Do post often, especially to share your challenges and your victories, no matter how small. You'll find this to be a safe place where you can share.

I'll check in from time to time to offer thoughts and encouragement if I feel I can make a positive contribution. 

Thank you, thank you all. You might not know it, but you helped me immensely.  I will always be grateful for the encouragement, ideas, good wishes, and especially the prayers. And with that, again I say thank you, and goodbye."
"The issue in a nutshell: My aging parents’ health is worsening by the month and their home is no longer safe for them.  They refuse to do anything about it and I have no clue what, if anything, I can do to help.  Please read on . . .

A bit of background: My parents are both 75.  I am one of four adult children ranging in age from 52 to 42.  I am the third child and youngest daughter.  For what it’s worth, my two older sisters do not have a relationship with either of our parents or me and my brother.  Fortunately, I have a great relationship with my brother, the youngest.  We are in complete agreement regarding the issues described below.

COVID’s impact: COVID hit my parents right between the eyes, as is true for many of us.  In March 2020, their lives ground to a halt in every conceivable way.  My mother was in relatively poor health before March 2020, but was at least getting out of the house one or two times a week to go grocery shopping, etc.  She has always had a fairly significant weight issue (zero judgment; so do I) and an issue with fluid retention.  To be blunt, she is largely helpless without my father.  My father has always been physically active, handling virtually all household repairs himself and even running his own one-man heating and air conditioning business for several decades.  Naturally, he has started to slow down a bit in recent years, but is still basically functional.  In the last two years, they have left the house approximately four times.  They transitioned to a grocery delivery service in March 2020 and still use it to this day.  They are both vaccinated.  They haven’t seen a doctor in over two years.  They have lived in the same house for 50 years and always tended toward hoarding, which I wrote off as a byproduct of their upbringing until recently.  Their 1,200-square-foot basement is now at capacity, full of items like inoperable appliances and televisions, empty boxes, old clothes, ancient toys, tools, and paper stacked to the ceiling.  Needless-to-say, this is a tremendous fire hazard.  One spark and . . . I don’t even want to say it.  My father has started to store papers and boxes in his van, which is not in working condition.

The medical issues:  As I mentioned, my mother was not in the best of health before COVID.  She saw a doctor fairly regularly prior to COVID, but sadly, the doctor contracted it himself and died in 2020.  Each time I ask her if/when she plans to make an appointment with any other doctor in the practice, she brushes me off with: “Yeah, I will,” or “Definitely this week.”  We have been playing this game for at least nine months now.  She stopped driving over 25 years ago, so she is 100% reliant on my father to take her where she needs to go.  He has no issue with taking her, but leaves the scheduling of the actual appointment up to her.  My parents, brother, and I all live within 30 minutes of each other in a major metropolitan area, so finding both family support and a high-quality doctor are as easy as picking up the phone.  I should mention that my mother’s memory has begun to falter, yet another issue that is worsening by the month and that she and my father are completely ignoring.  If it is imperative that she see a GP as soon as humanly possible, a neurologist is definitely second on the list.  

My mother and I have always been able to talk about anything and everything with complete openness and honesty, but this issue is an anomaly.  I am aware that she has struggled with depression for decades, but the idea of taking an anti-depressant or, worse, seeing a therapist, would not be considered under any circumstances.  As someone who has also dealt with (treated) depression for well over 30 years, I understand what it’s like to not care about much of anything, particularly yourself.  My parents have missed two years of holidays and family celebrations, including birthday parties for their three young grandchildren, aged 11 and under.  The notion of gathering as a family does not seem to be important to them at all anymore.  It is as if they are content to live out the rest of their lives in their home, talking with their son and youngest daughter by phone occasionally and essentially never seeing their grandchildren again.

To put on my armchair therapist hat, my parents have always been codependent on one another.  They did not maintain outside friendships through the decades and have been each other‘s only long-term relationship.  For the record, both grew up in unstable homes with alcoholic parents, but neither drink, so substance use is not an issue here.  Many adult children would simply drive over there and insist to be allowed in.  They would pull up in a 1-800-GOT-JUNK van and start cleaning out the basement.  They would schedule doctor’s appointments for both of my parents and pick them up to drive them to the appointments.  I can assure you that my parents would absolutely not be open to any of this.  To be honest, I don’t feel as if I’m “allowed” to go over there, much less unannounced.  Both my brother and I suspect that the upstairs portion of the house is a complete shambles as well.  It must be mentioned that my father has always had a bit of an anger issue and does not allow himself to be pressured or “controlled” in any way, so that is a concern in itself.  They have formed this bubble around themselves and they seem content to sit in it, binge-watching TV shows they’ve seen a dozen times, ignoring family holidays, and never picking up the phone to check in with their family while their health deteriorates by the week.

It feels too easy to label them as selfish and get mad about the whole thing.  I have tried to approach this with kindness and patience, but at two years post-COVID shutdown, both are wearing thin for my brother and myself.  We miss our parents and to be frank, we feel like we’re losing them in real time.  My father mentioned recently that my mother eats so little and her clothes are “falling off of her.”  She has fallen in the shower twice in recent months; paramedics had to lift her to her feet.  Her only movement during the day is from the kitchen to the bathroom, back to the kitchen, then to bed.  I doubt she walks 200 steps per day.  I can’t imagine how much longer this can continue without serious ramifications.

The question: My parents are aware that my brother and I are both willing to help them in any way that is necessary at a moment’s notice.  They’re adults and can do (or not do) as they like, but how can my brother and I sit back and watch this unfold in silence, especially given the development about the basement?  Every time the phone rings, I am seized with fear that This Is It.

If you’ve made it this far, I truly appreciate it.  Any constructive advice or thoughts for a very concerned daughter are more than welcome."
"My mom came home from short term care 3 weeks ago. The first week was a disaster. She was convinced the TV was showing the same shows it had the day before, and she turned off her oxygen then turned it all the way up because ""they"" told her to. Since then, she has continued to have issues. She doesn't remember what day it is, she has absolutely false memories, and the TV issues continue. My mom majored in English and minored in biology at USC. She has always relied on logic, so this last thing is what sent me in a spiral. She was watching Ancient Aliens where they were talking about lizard people. I asked what she was watching, and she told me how interesting it was. When I told her it was fiction/fake, she was surprised and said she didn't know that it was fake.

Basically, is this normal coming back from short term care? She'd had a fall and needed wound care. She had some minor memory issues like leaving out the milk, but nothing like this before going in."
"Background: My fiance's mother was recently admitted to the hospital with a blood oxygen level of 72. They had her on a ventilator, but now they have her on a bipap, so she is a little better. She can only have her mask off for a few minutes before she becomes disoriented again. Sadly, she has been sick for months (and didn't tell us) and hadn't seen a doctor (her husband finally called an ambulance) so they don't know exactly what is wrong or if she will get better.
My fiance drove across the country to visit her. But he is having such a hard time seeing her in the state that she is in. He feels extremely guilty that he isn't by her side all the time, but it is taking a huge emotional toll on him. He couldn't bring himself to visit her today, and he feels extremely guilty about it.
Have any of you been in a similar situation? Do you have any advice? I told him not to feel bad, that he needs to take care of himself first so that he can take care of her."
"My  elderly father was recently diagnosed with cancer and will begin  chemotherapy next week. He and my mom have five cats in a house filled  with clutter, such that the cats are kept solely in the bedroom.

The  chemo nurse has advised my Dad to stay away from the cats during his  treatment, and my parents' solution to this issue is to move my dad into  an upstairs guest bedroom. This is a huge safety concern since both  parents have mobility issues and are certainly at risk of falling. The  upstairs hallway is so cluttered that it is difficult to get through,  and a stretcher would not be able to fit.

Their  home is laid out in such a way that there is only one ground floor room  with a door that would be a suitable bedroom for my father to rest in  -- the one with the cats in it.  There is so much clutter in the house  that there isn't an alternate room in the house for the cats to go.

My  parents are quite defensive about this issue and are in denial about  its severity. Instead of dealing with the issue of finding an alternate  location for the cats, they are potentially creating a health and safety  hazard for themselves. When confronted, they said they would rather pay  to have a stair lift installed than relocate the cats.

Any advice on how to handle this issue?

EDIT: My siblings and I live out of state, so one of us taking the cats is not an option."
"I’m at a loss. My (38F) father (62M) had a stroke in 2005 and he’s been declining ever since. He no longer works and “sits at home bored” despite the many activities we have provided for him which include crafts, volunteer work, and clubs. He’s angry and often disengaged, spending time flirting with women in his phone (my parents have had an open marriage for 25 years at least).

In August, he went nuclear while my mom went for a visit out of state. He threatened violence against her, her friends, my brother, and myself. He stood outside my home and threatened to slash my tires and that’s when I called the cops. We moved my mom out of the house for safety. Not long after he got into an accident and totaled his car. We took his license.

Without my mom he wasn’t eating well, wasn’t able to drive, wasn’t cleaning up after himself. We talked him into moving him to an independent living facility that would offer food, cleaning, drives, activities,
etc. 

It was at this time that I discovered that he was falling for a number of romance scams, losing nearly $2000 in month. I was able to make claims and get it all back.

For awhile things calmed down. I have been helping with his finances. He’s set up in the new place. But this past week it all went to hell as he fell for more romance scams. Valentines week must be good for them.

His cards were shut off, he says by the bank. So he called and demanded I buy him a $50 apple gift card. My mom and I gave in after several abusive calls. We warned him multiple times that this was absolutely a scam. 

Sure enough “she” got into a “crash” after receiving the money. Sent a picture of a car that I reversed image searched to an article from another country 5 years ago. 

Now it’s all “I should have listened.”

I’m exhausted. I work freelance full time, I have a husband and a toddler, a house of my own. I’m stuck between this feeling of guilt not helping him and frustrating at myself for falling for his emotionally manipulative crap. I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know how to help him stop falling for this and losing his money without losing my sanity. 

Anyone been through this and have a creative solution?

TLDR: my dad is losing money to romance scams, bank cut off his card, abusively demands money from me. I am at a loss."
"My father in law currently lives alone in a home that my husband owns. We had it remodeled last year so that he and my husbands brother (BIL) could move in together as my FIL has short-term memory issues, goes to dialysis 3-4x a week, and just in general needs help for most things like cooking and cleaning. The only thing he seems capable of is using his phone, hiring people to do things to the house (that he does not own and has no money to actually pay with), and take care of his personal hygiene (3-4 showers a day). Unfortunately, my BIL never moved in. My MIL (mother in law) basically kicked him out and said she was done with him and has pushed all responsibility onto her sons (long story as with my FIL’s increasing amount of health issues his anger has also increased). He needs more care than he’s currently receiving and is costing my husband and I money (as in my FIL cannot afford to pay bills because he uses his money to eat out, etc). I recently learned that he has been taking his medication on his own but that his levels at dialysis have been poor - I suspect because he’s not taking his medication as directed and needs assistance with this. I also learned that no one is really checking on him aside from the occasional visit from my BIL.

My husband and I live out of state and cannot believe anything his family says, we also cannot afford to travel constantly to try and be there in person. It’s a hard situation and I know my husband wants to help his family. I just feel as though he needs more help and would benefit from an assisted living facility or something which has been brought up numerous times by multiple people in the family but because my MIL has essentially washed her hands of the situation and they are still married, there is not a whole lot any of the rest of us can do. I just feel it’s getting to a point of neglect and part of me wants to contact adult protective services and report it. I just feel like I also don’t want to be the whistleblower and create more drama within an already toxic and drama filled family. The other part of me says to do it because I will feel guilty when (not if) something happens to him. 

I’m just conflicted and could use some advice for talking to his family since most of the time I’m also left out of the conversations because I’m not blood related."
"So I replied with something similar to this in another thread on this sub but I wanted to hear if anyone else has had different results. My mother (80) passed last year from cancer. Before she did, she was pretty much incapacitated from a hip replacement due to a fracture in cancer riddled bone. She was a very difficult individual all of her life and became much more so with illness. No dementia so no way to have her declared incompetent. However, she essentially refused all outside help and was demanding round the clock care to the point that my father and I didn't get more than 2 hours of sleep at a time for nearly two months outside of those times she was hospitalized.

We were at the end of our ropes and truly unable to safely take care of everything she needed by the end. Each time she was at the hospital we would communicate this to the doctors and social workers. And each time they sent her home anyway with nothing more than a list of services to call despite us explaining that she wouldn't accept the outside help. We tried hiring people and refusing to do all of the care while that person was available but mom would scream and refuse help from them to the point that they all felt they had to immediately quit for liability reasons.

We tried EPS who again just gave us lists and also pretty much said that as long as she was in the house we had to care for her if we couldn't keep other caregivers there. NOT THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE CARED FOR HER JUST THAT WE WERE TRYING TO SEE IF THERE WAS A WAY TO FORCE HER TO ACCEPT EVEN A MODICUM OF OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE BEFORE ONE OR BOTH OF US HAD A PSYCHOTIC BREAK DUE TO STRESS AND SLEEP DEPRIVATION. The answer is that there is no way unless they are declared incompetent.

The point is, pretty much every post suggests handling a difficult elder by telling the doctors, social workers or EPS that they aren't safe at home like that is some magic bullet that will fix things and it's not. The hospital is not going to keep them more than a few days extra, they are not going to force them into rehab or care, and they are going to expect anyone that is resident in the same house to see to it that care is provided no matter what the situation.

"So, me, my brother, and mom are in this situation where a doctor told my grandma couldn’t live by herself anymore, so my mom found a house and the 4 of us are living under one roof now. it has been a year and everything been good, but mom has this thing where she does not want her to be left by herself ever. she came to this when one day my brother was out, i was at work, and she went out somewhere with her then boyfriend and when she came home, my grandma fell and was on the floor. so now she doesn’t want to leave her by herself anymore and want one person to be home. 

i feel like there will be a time where we all going to have plans and as long as she eats, one person will be home in a couple hours, and coming home, she will be okay. she doesn’t need 24/7 supervision as she just needs help with cooking, laundry and driving, everything else she can do on her own. she keeps telling my grandma that she will not leave her by herself.

just examples: one time, i was going to orientation for my job, my mom was out doing something, my brother was going to hang with a friend. my brother and i was leaving at the same time and told me “where are you going?” “when will you be back?” “i was just about to go out” and looked upset about it. even later on my mom told me, “you know your grandma can’t be left by herself, right?” Another thing that annoyed me was on my off days, she would spend the day/night with her ex, so she’s took my off days as an opportunity for herself and a comment she made told me, “you know you can get a haircut if you want to” like, i don’t need to be told what i can/cannot do. i’m 22 years old. like my schedule/availability is not yours. we are allow to live/enjoy life. she feels like she can’t get her hair braided, nails done, go to a doctors appointment, go to a friends house that is down the street, movies, out to eat without someone being here. 

i just don’t see how it is fair that just because two other people have already made plans, the other is prohibited from doing the same thing. ik now life isn’t fair, but i don’t understand how 3 people working and continuing living life. idk how this is going to work now or in the future.

i am not saying she is unimportant, that i hate living here, or i don’t want to help, but i just don’t understand how we are supposed live like this when we all have work and our own individual life. i am not going to make plans and have to check in with two other people about what they got going on with their personal lives and work schedules. it just feels like i cannot have a life.

i just don’t see how this is healthy for my mom, because she constantly saying she is on our schedule and always say “she needs a break” or one day it seems like she wanted to go somewhere to watch a football game, i was going to work and my brother was going to hang with his wife and then said “oh that means i cannot go” why is it just because you are helping your mom with care that you do not have the right to live and enjoy life still

An alternative i am thinking about is a medical alert system whenever she’s by herself so just in case, there will be a fall detection or a push of a button, emergency will be there and we will get a notification and someone will be there as soon as possible. but don’t know how to talk to my mom about it because i feel she will 100% reject the idea, get offended or my grandma will too. 

I think what i am saying is that at the end of the day, we all have to work and continue living life and don’t see how this can work out now or in the future. there are times where she stays at my aunt house, but that is not often

thank you for reading, if you have any advice, please comment below

tl;dr: in this situation where my mom does not want to leave her alone in the house and having a hard time understanding how is this suppose to workout in the long run because with our work schedules and personal lives. thinking of a medical alert system but fear both my mom and grandma would reject this idea badly"
"* Talk about falls often
* Talk about falls even more than that
* Try to get padding on cement floors or wood floors
* Get people with bedrooms upstairs on to the first floor
* Fix the steps, salt the ice, etc.
* Look at how falls might happen
* Ask the parent what they are doing to avoid falls
* Tell them to take their time even if people behind them are impatient
* If they can't get down the stairs outside, call 911. Far better to help them get down than have to load them up in an ambulance
* Talk about falls
* Talk about falls
* Say ""If you fall, it's probably your fault!"" Not always, of course. But most falls can be avoided.
* If you feel dizzy, sit down.
* If you have to, pee yourself but don't walk to the bathroom if you can't walk well enough.
* Put it like this: ""If you fall, you could easily be looking at 6 months in a nursing home! Do you want that?"" Etc.

Something like this should really be in the sidebar: ""A note about FALLS"", etc. 

Any other ideas for this bullet list?"
"My mom is 76 and lives in AZ. She fell today and broke her arm.  My sister and I live on the east coast and trying to figure out how we can best help her. My aunt lives near by in AZ but won’t be able to take care of her full time. My mom also has a puppy that will need to be taken care of. My mom also is on lots of medications for pain, anxiety, depression etc and I would like to get some feedback on where to even begin. Not sure she can just easily take care of herself and she has been falling more over the past year. She drinks too which doesn’t help. So just worry about her moving forward and want to know the best way to approach helping her."
"Hello, I've just joined this subreddit as I am trying to do everything I can to better care for my grandmother with osteoporosis. She is 80 years old and in solid mental health, but her osteoporosis has accelerated significantly in the past year- causing her to fall three times in the past year. She had been on an amazing road to recovery after her second fall, but she fell again this week (femoral neck fracture) and had a resulting hip arthroplasty. She will be in rehab for the next week to assist with her recovery, but throughout this experience she has been insistent on doing everything possible to maintain her independence and lifestyle (living at home alone, minimizing caretaker hours, going out to dinner with friends etc...). After her last two falls we had a 24hr caretaker for her sourced through an agency but my grandma was trying to reduce it to 12 hours or less as soon as possible. On this fall, she lied to us that she had been alone that day after dismissing the caregiver and didn't alert me or anyone else to the fall until the day after it occurred (and lied about when it happened).

I just want to stop this pattern from repeating itself as I know she's heavily susceptible to fall again. Open to ANY and ALL advice, tips, etc.."
"My parents need in-home help, and we are hiring people directly rather than going through an agency, at least for now.  I'm looking for a simple app for caregivers to clock their time, so that my sibling and I have an easy way to track time, that we can see from our phones, rather than having a sign-in book.  

We don't need an app that manages all of the payment due, overtime, taxes, etc.  We have that taken care of and just need something simple to track time in a transparent way.  

Any recommendations?  Clockify looks good, but thought I'd check in here first.

TIA!"
"Later this week, my husband will be spending time with his dad who has indicated that he’s ready to hand over information for my husband to help his stepmother make financial and funeral decisions, should she be predeceased by her husband. 

The situation looks likely as my f-i-l is in failing health. He and his wife own their home, but we don’t know the financial particulars of that or anything else. 

We were surprised by my f-i-l asking to get together to discuss this because he has historically declined to ever address the issue of mortality or end of life plans. 

Our question is, what documents can my husband bring for his dad to sign (realizing possible need for notary) that might help when the time comes that he’s incapacitated or decisions need to be made? (With his wife’s approval of course. Father in law is concerned she may not be able to make good decisions, which may or may not be the case. I think she can be a tough cookie when the situation calls for it, but she’s been a little frail lately too.) If Dad dies before her, I think they want to sell the house and have her move into some sort of independent or assisted living, not sure what her level of need might be.

I thought I had this all figured out, but now being faced with it, it’s daunting."
"My mom recently broke her ankle severely and needs a lot of help. She has been unable to do pretty much anything herself for the past week and she will be in this condition for at least the next few weeks. Her bandages need to be changed multiple times per day, she needs help getting to the commode, She also has to move positions about every 30 minutes and someone needs to help rearrange pillows, get her up, etc. Basically, it's a lot of work. My dad took off work to care for her but there is still alot to do. Someone basically needs to be with her almost all the time. 

 I live 4 hours away from my parents and my brother lives 30 minutes away. Afew days after she came back from the hospital, I took a train over to my parents and will be here for a week. Im going to go home for a few days and then come back and stay probably for another week. I work remotely ( I just started my job this week) so I am able to do this. 

I am making this post because I am extremely disappointed in my brother. He is trying to start a business so he is also a remote worker. He comes over here everyday but he barely helps at all. He basically just goes up to his room and does work, eats my parent's food, and doesn't even clean up after himself. I really have no idea why he even comes here. Him being here makes things harder for everyone else. If me or my dad ask him to do a task, he may or may not do it and he doesn't help with anything on his own. He doesn't check up on my mom or ask if she needs anything. The lack of sensitivity towards my mom is incredibly disturbing to me. 

He has always been like this so I'm not surprised, I'm just so frustrated with him. I tried talking to him today and he basically just ignored me. I don't know what to do."
"He is in his 80s and needs a wheelchair and oxygen (he can walk some). How common is it to get someone to transport an older person to an appointment and take them back home. (My sister would meet him at the appointment. She doesn't trust him to ask questions or report back.) Is there some sort of uber-type service for this? I am in NY and we actually have a type of transport for this but my parents are in Nevada. Besides [care.com](https://care.com), where else could I look for in-home assistance? It is mostly unskilled but they would need to work with his oxygen tank so we can't just have anyone. (Also, they have to deal with my mom who can be sort of, ahem, set in her ways.)"
"My father in law passed away last week, leaving my 91 yo mother in law to live in her 2 story home alone. We are 35 mins away and have planned to check in with her every other day. I’m so scared she will fall as her mobility is limited and uses a walker. Moving to a retirement home is not an option for her, so we’re looking at everything we can think of to keep her safe. 
I’m researching fall detection monitoring and looking for advice and experience that anyone can offer. So far Fitbit Ionic looks like a good option if I can find a small wristband. But open to anything eg Lifeline etc. All ideas welcome. TIA"
"I thought it was finally going to get easier, after months of hospitalization and rehab facilities mom was supposed to come home Thursday 

I managed to even get her a 24/7 live in aid for a month

I got her every possible walker and wheelchair and everything she could possibly need to be comfortable at home 

And then she fell during physical therapy this morning, broken femur

Now i’m back to square one, this is so frustrating I simply don’t know how i’m going to deal with this"

Hi everyone,

Wanted to get some guidance from the community on my parents current situation. 

Got both parents into separate ALF in 2021 after a long battle to get them out of their houses. It was a major win and my father (80/Dementia) appears to be transitioning nicely. My two sisters live 5-10 minutes from both facilities and I live roughly 1 hour away. 

While my mother (70/Severe Dementia/COPD) seems to like the ALF facility, we struggle with a few different items. She has COPD level 4 and requires breathing treatments 3 times a day + having a rescue inhaler always with her. Because of her severe dementia, she constantly loses the rescue inhaler and the ALF nurses just aren’t able to stay on top of her needs. The dementia also causes her to lose things (remote, shampoo, etc.) in which she calls all of the family throughout the day asking for help. She also has many appointments that she has to attend and it is tough on the family to take time off of work to help get her to the appointments. 

On top of this, she recently fell and broke her hip and is currently in a rehab facility struggling with getting her proper medication. 

The family (3 children) are doing our best to manage the nursing staff, appointments, mothers needs/asks but it doesn’t seem to be working great. We are constantly having to ask the nurses at the ALF why things are done incorrectly or get random calls from our mother that she can’t breathe. Plus the dementia makes it very difficult to explain a situation to her without her getting upset. 

I am going to move out of state in the next two years so my wife can be closer to her family/older parents but I want to put a plan in place prior to the move. The current set up seems very reactionary and not sustainable long term. 

My question is, would it make more sense to interview caregivers to help my mother at the ALF facility to help with inhaler/dementia/errands/appointments? Or would it make more sense to look at a nursing home versus ALF facility? 

My sisters are against the caregivers as they feel like it will mean more people to communicate with versus actually helping. They also don’t want to move her from her current ALF facility because she is so close to their current housing. But the current situation feels like a fire drill every week and is wearing on all of us. 

I am stuck because I feel like there are better solutions to help our situation versus us doing everything ourselves. Open to any suggestions, thanks for listening."
"Hey there -- curious about folks' experience in Oregon nursing homes that are under executive order.  Residents in my mom's facility are essentially confined to their rooms and we've been told that taking them out of the facility except for medical purposes is not allowed.    This does not seem 1) legal; 2) healthy.       At the very least, taking your parent outside for fresh air has to be allowed, right?  After 2 years of this pandemic and understanding that everyone in the facility if vaccinated - how does the state weigh the pros and cons of isolating versus figuring out a way for the resident to get fresh air and exercise?    We had a friend told that rather than taking their mom outside to visit with multiple family members, those family members had to be in her room, which seems counter-intuitive.   I guess what i am asking, are these policies like to be facility specific or are they common at all facilities that are under EO.  would they be required by the state?   We have lots of questions about the standard of care that is required.... but this seems like it should be relatively easy to figure out if we are being unreasonable, or if the facility has just gone to a really weird place"
"I am in my mid 30s with an aging parent. Well in reality my dad has been older since I was born. He has always hid his true age from everyone but a lawyer that I spoke with said he believes him to be 92. 

My mom was 20 when I was born and I was her 4th child (she was forced to Marry an older man at 14 and when they split she had nowhere to go, and that’s when my dad came into the picture). My father was very verbally and emotionally abusive to my mother and siblings, so my mom left him when I was a baby. I remember when I was little he was very kind to me, would visit me often, and buy me toys. 

I was born in a foreign country, and my mom and I moved to the US when I was 8. My dad would call me and say how I was his everything, all that he had left and he was so alone now. According to other people all he would do is talk about me and how I was everything to him. He would sometimes call me drunk in the middle of the night crying that he missed me. 

His level of adoration made me very uncomfortable. I always felt like I could not measure up so I tried to avoid the situation. At 20 I had a son, and I did not even tell my dad until he was a month old because I didn’t want to disappoint him. I never introduced my son to my dad… I don’t know why, it didn’t feel right. I did not visit my dad for 20 years. I dealt with the problem by avoiding it. I have severe depression and OCD and life is hard enough for me. 

I went to see my dad in 2020 and seeing him be old (he actually looks extremely good for his age, I thought he was about 75) made me regret not treating him well. He went into a deep depression recently and is all of the sudden showing signs of advanced dementia. He is forgetting who I am. 

He did not arrange anything for his old age (he was born into a well off family, and had every chance to). He had 2 other children but never took care of them, I have never even met them. So I am pretty much an only child in this situation. 

I feel like I should take care of him, and have to. I don’t think that I can mentally handle living with him, I wished I could but my mental health is shaky. I am trying to find a way to afford a decent living facility for him, which will absolutely drain me financially but such is life. I am raising a teenager, and I don’t want to leave my son in the same position when I get old. 

The guilt I feel is so bad that I have not been able to do anything. I just cry. I wished I could talk to him and apologize. I wished I could take care of him. I feel like the worst daughter in the world, and many people say that I am. I just had to get this off of my chest. The guilt is heavy. I love him, I just don’t know how to."
"Hello everyone. 

My grandma is 89 years old and lives independently with my grandpa (87 yo). They live in a motor home in Texas with their dog. My grandma relies heavily on my grandpa for her care; up until recently, he has been able to provide her with all her care. My grandma has had issues with her memory for the last couple of years, but nothing too crazy and we expected it with her age. 

My grandma and my mom have always been close; they take once a day on the phone, usually for about 20 minutes. I take care of my mom; she was diagnosed with severe heart failure 2 years ago and ended up on the heart transplant list. I also had a baby a few months ago, so phone calls are the way we keep in contact with them and check up on them. We live over 1,000 miles away. My brother lives about 45 min away, but rarely goes to visit due to covid. 

Yesterday, my mom noticed my grandma was increasingly confused, and her voice sounded off. She confided in me that she's noticed my grandma mentation has been getting worse over the last week and she sounded off. I called my brother to have him go check on them, because it sounds to me like grandma needs to go to the hospital. He called them, they tried to tell him not to go down they were fine, but they agreed to let him visit tomorrow (2/13) and he would take my grandma to urgent care. My grandpa ended up calling my mom a few hours and told my mom that grandma isn't getting up out of her chair, and hasn't gotten out of her chair ""in a while."" I asked him if she's getting up to go pee, he said no she just sits in her chair. My grandpa is a very stoic man, he rarely shows emotions and it sounded like he was going to cry.

This made me very concerned. I called my brother back and had him go visit grandma and grandpa today. I told him we need to call EMS and get her seen at the hospital because it sounds like she has a UTI and is going septic. My brother agreed and went over. He asked me to call EMS while he was en route to save time, and he'd go to the hospital. 

EMS ended up arriving before my brother got there and my grandparents sent ems away. Apparently. It was a single, small woman who didn't do an assessment on my grandma, just left when she was told to, even though my grandma is confused. My grandpa won't force her to go to the hospital either. 

My brother tried to talk my grandma into letting him take her, but she refused. My brother won't force her because she's still able to say ""no"" and refuse care. My brother said the motor home smells strongly of urine and it looks like her chair is stained (like it would be if she was peeing on it). 

I honestly don't know what to do next. I truly believe my grandma needs to be evaluated, I'm an ICU nurse and I know how precarious geriatric patients can be. This could be a very simple fix, just some fluid and antibiotics, but the longer we let this go, the worse it will get. The people that are near to her won't make her get evaluated, though. 

My aunt is buying a plane ticket and heading down there, she's hopefully going to land tomorrow but it could be as late as Tuesday. In the meantime, my grandma is going to continue to deteriorate. I do not believe she can get out of chair. My brother did not try to get her to stand, he asked her if she would, and she said ""No"". 

Any advice on what to do or who to call next? 

TDLR: I live 1000 miles away from my 89 year old grandma who is acting confused. My 87 year old grandpa allowed her to send ems away without receiving an evaluation. She is unable to get out of her chair and is peeing in her chair on herself. My brother isn't forcing her to be evaluated either. Is there anything else I can do to get her evaluated? I don't want her to pass away in a pee encrusted chair from something that can easily be treated with antibiotics.  

TY"
"So, Mom has been assisted living the past few weeks. We recently learned she was refusing her medications (i.e., they offer the meds 1x, she says she's busy/tired/etc, and they go away and don't try again; they take ""not now"" as a refusal) We now have them at least not leaving until she takes her needed-to-stay-out-of-the-hospital-and-not-die medication, but we really don't know about the others. 

We have been told that they don't keep a record if she refuses or takes her meds. If we luck into talking to the person who delivers the meds, she'll tell us. This seems..... wrong. Like illegal wrong.  Surely documentation of some sort is required. A quick web search doesn't help me find requirements - does anyone else have a suggestion of where to look? This is in SC, USA, if that's helpful."
"My (51M) elderly father (82M) has been reluctant to move into assisted living.  We were supposed to make the move yesterday, but he said he was scared and wanted to wait until Monday.  With great reluctance, I agreed.  He has a lifetime history of breaking promises, gaslighting, and belligerence and I have an enormous amount of pent up anger toward him.  My concern is that my anger will undo weeks of effort and only hurt my stepmother's access to care because his SS and pension are the bulk of their current income. 


Background:

- My stepmother/his wife (81F) has moderate/severe dementia and was recently moved in to memory care in the same facility after months of effort.
- He is barely able to take care of himself.  Meals on Wheels keeps him fed, but for the last year the house has looked like animals live there.
- His severe ADHD and NPD make him utterly impervious to rational appeals, any sense of duty, any sense of shame, etc.  You're either with him or against him, no matter how absurd his position might be.
- He's a recovering alcoholic that's been sober 45 years now and it's the one thing I'm proud of him for.
- I currently have co-trustee and PoA for him, he has guardianship and PoA for his wife/my stepmother.
- This man has burned every bridge between himself and every other family member across the span of his life.  His own siblings have basically said to me: ""After a lifetime of abuse from him, we're out.  We support you kids but we refuse to get involved with him directly again.""
- Knowing that he's exhausted my brother's patience and resources in his attempts to help, I'm concerned he's trying to run out the clock with me.
- I live several states away and have taken a leave of absence from work to deal with this situation and very much want to return to my home and my spouse.

The lease has been signed, and I'm worried I'm going to completely lose it if/when he tries to cop out and push it back further for any reason.

I can feel the siren call of self-righteous rage and am certain that's the wrong play here so I'm reaching out to the hive mind for suggestions."
"Hi all, I guess I’m asking what other people would do in my situation. 
I moved a province away from my 72 year old dad who lives alone about 9 months ago. He doesn’t really have any other family around to help him, my one brother lives close but works full time to support his 3 kids including newborn. 
Yesterday my dad went to the hospital with a stroke, which he had been feeling the symptoms of for 3 days before he got help. He’s still walking and doing well as far as stroke patients go- that’s what the nurses tell me on the phone. He’s in hospital now, can’t write with his one hand and his  treatment is very much undecided. 
My husband works from home and I’m on maternity leave for quite a while still, and my current employer is in the province my dad lives in since I moved just after I went on mat leave. We could relatively easily move my little family into my dads house to keep an eye on him and help him with his rehab and care. I’m scared he’ll have another stroke and need further care and rehab than he’s already needing while we’re living away. 
I also tend to over react so that’s why I’m asking what other people would do if they were in such a situation :) would you uproot your work from home family to go stay with him even though his symptoms seem mild as far as strokes go? 
My husband likes the idea because we could rent our place out for $$ and be closer to family again for a while. I also don’t want to do anything my dads not comfortable with and he isn’t a man who accepts help easily. So uhhhh… what would you do?! 
Thanks for your input, I know that’s long! 
😅😬"
"Wondering if anyone has dealt with this before: my parents are in their 80s. They are in a constant state of dehydration, which is causing health problems. They both know they're supposed to drink water, but they both refuse to. I think they don't like the inconvenience of having to pee. Growing up, I never saw them drink water at all, so I guess they just never understood that the human body needs water in order to function. Doctors and nurses have repeated lectured them on this topic, but they just won't do it."
"Some of y'all might have seen my last post on here, about trying to get some help from my family who is pretty much absent unless there is a full blown emergency (fall, car accident, etc). 

I (25F) share a home with my grandfather (87), I look after him a bit, and maintain the house/chores/etc. He does most things himself, but being 87, having some cognitive/memory issues, balance issues, and limited arm/shoulder movement I do help out a lot. 

Until now, he has been operating his chainsaw every now and then to do some yard work. It's been nothing major, just cutting small trees and branches, but it always scared me seeing him operate it because of his balance issues, and I never thought it looked safe. Until now I had been to scared to take any action, partially because I felt it was not my responsibility, but now, since no one else is doing anything about it, I did something. 

He previously claimed that he ONLY used the chainsaw when I was home, to be safe. He told everyone this, including friends and family. (Even though we did not want him using the chainsaw, period.). Well, last weekend I left to go on a weekend trip with my partner and some friends, 2+ hours away.

Well, I got back home and the first thing I hear is him telling me that his chainsaw is broken. ""How did it break?"" I ask., and ""What were you doing using the chainsaw when I was away? I thought you only used it when someone was home."" To that he replied ""I never said that"" which got me so heated...

To make a long story short I called the store where he got it repaired and asked them for clarification. Apparently he even mentioned to the specialist that his granddaughter/family did not want him using it, and they even had a talk with him about it!! The specialist was super understanding. 

I took it out of the garage, and my partner is storing it somewhere for me. I had previously asked my aunt (grandfather's daughter) to do the same, and she declined... ""I'm not dealing with that"". So I took it into my own hands, because I refuse to come home from work one day and see my 87 year old grandfather sprawled out in the yard hurt because of a chainsaw accident. 

Just bracing myself now for the kickback, and the attitude. I will probably get some sexist and hurtful remarks, and I'll probably get super frustrated and angry, but it's worth it. I'm not dealing with this again.

UPDATE:
He found out its gone, I told him it is in a safe place. He is surprisingly understanding about it so far."
"Sorry. I posted before my concerns. My 90 year old MIL had melanoma on her eyelid. So they removed the melanoma which included her entire eyelid leaving her with a medical flap. Then they discovered precancerous cells, and did another surgery. She then got Covid which put her in the hospital for a week then a rehab center for 2 weeks. Now, her exposed eye is infected and they had to stitch it close and they are not sure if she is is going to lose the eye. Why do you you put a 90 year old woman through this? She has failed so much since the initial surgery. Is melanoma a painful thing for a 90 year old to live with? I’m at the point, frankly, it’s the quality of life."
"My dad (85) was diagnosed with prostate cancer last year.  He’s stable, PSA under control, but he’s having some other health issues that make me wonder if the cancer is spreading.  My mother-in-law (73) was recently diagnosed with a rare and aggressive cancer. I’m afraid my husband and I will lose two parents this year. But, when my dad was first diagnosed, I was extremely upset; I’m an anxious person as it is. What’s odd now is I almost feel complacent… I’ve kind of resigned myself to “this is my life now.”  Is this normal?"
"We just discovered my MIL is paying $18.99 a week for her newspaper. Yet the subscription price listed online is $6.99.

I’m livid. I called and posed as my MIL and asked why I was paying almost 3 times as much as the advertised rate. He said he would lower my rate to the published one but rates change “all the time” and I can change my rate every 6 months.

I feel this is theft. And taking advantage of their key demographic of older people. My MIL is 89, won’t use the internet and relies on that paper as part of her routine so cancelling it isn’t feasible but I’m still so angry. I have no idea how long she’s been overpaying as she’s just now allowing us to look at her bills. Just sickening how these companies take advantage of anyone not paying constant attention to their shenanigans.

"Hi there, 

My husband and I have recently had an opportunity open up to move closer to both sets of our aging parents. Both sets of parents are in good health now for their age, but we currently live about 45 minutes to an hour away from them and we can see that being a strain if we needed to be caregivers. 

We LOVE where we live currently; great neighborhood, great school for our young child, and great culture and vibe. The location where our parents live is much more calm, suburban and (to put it bluntly) boring. We are wondering if anyone else has faced this decision before their parents needed their help or anyone has been through caring for aging parents from afar who might recommend moving before they need us? 

We are having a tough time making this decision especially since two of my grandparents lived into their 80's and 90's! If my parents don't need my care for 20+ years, I'd rather stay where I'm at for a while!! I know you can't plan for that or know when it might come, but just wondering if anyone else has dealt with this or can offer up any tips?"
We're considering hiring an in home aide that doesn't work through an agency. We've never completed a background check and we're looking for any feedback on the process. Do we need just the SSN and DOB from the aide? What information can we obtain? We are in NY btw.
"I had a dream last night that really confirmed the mental state I am in about it. Long story short is I was in an elevator with my parents (my mom being anxious, my dad not saying anything, which is what he does when he's nervous) and right before I made it to the 74th floor, the elevator breaks and we are free falling downward. Right now in life I might finally be able to move out and find a house with my partner, I would love to move out of my state to finally feel like I'm going some where in life, however, with my parents being in their late 50s and early 60s with my dad having cancer, chrones disease and multiple other issues and my mom having dementia (early in the process) and kidney disease, on top of neither one of them really caring about their health (they see that life is short and they just want to enjoy the things they have which is food since were low income). It's frustrating because I'm trying to better myself and I feel guilty to leave them, I am trying to find that happy medium where I live not too far from them if anything happens  (at least an hour or 2). It's stressful, I'm losing my hair, I can feel my blood pressure becoming higher and don't wanna end up like my dad. I got my own health issues too being almost 26 and I feel Overwhelmed. Im trying to finish college. I feel awful cause my girlfriend who lives with me now has to deal with the stress too. We don't have the funds to live outside of here especially during the pandemic as before I was on campus and felt so much better physically and mentally even when there were negative things happening. /shrug"
"My dad is 90 and lives in a retirement home. For his age, he’s doing pretty well. However, he lives in Ontario and we live on the west coast. I’m his only son, no other family that can provide support. I spoke to him about moving to a home out here - he’s on board, things are in motion!

We’ve got most of the logistics sorted or people helping coordinate. Really I’m just looking for advice regarding things I haven’t thought of? Emotional vs purely practical advice. Any thoughts?"
My 88 year old mother lives alone and we are looking into buying her an iWatch in case she falls and needs help. I’m wondering if that would be a viable option or if one of the monthly subscription based services would be better?
"I'm having a hard time getting through to my mom about her weight with her being too thin.

She had a heart attack in May of 2020. She was 63. It made no sense as she has always been thin and active and has always eaten really healthy. Because she already had a very active lifestyle it isn't like she can just clean up her diet and feel like she is taking care of herself. She makes a point now to exercise more (mostly the elliptical and strength work), and eats even cleaner than she did before. She does have decent strength as she can carry around our tall 20 month old (he was born a few weeks after her heart attack).

She's very, very skinny now. My husband says she looks like she has an eating disorder. Every time I see how skinny her legs are I feel anxious because it's not healthy and I can't get through to her and I'm worried.

I've talked to her about what she eats and it is very healthy. I'm not sure if it is small portions but she IS eating, and regularly throughout the day. 

I think she is so afraid of eating anything that might remotely be connected to heart issues now, and it's her way of trying to have some control over what happened. I'm worried because if something ever happened to her, like she got cancer, she has absolutely no reserves on her body to support her. When I bring this up to her she says ""I'm not going to get cancer"".

Honestly even just putting on ten pounds would look better and be healthier, but she basically has said, for years, even before this, that she can't put on weight (she's certainly not eating food that would help her put on weight). I've never thought that she has eating issues before this (doesn't have a history of disordered eating).

I am hoping some of you may have some advice based on your own experience. She's only 63 and is otherwise very healthy, and would like her to have a long, healthy, end to her life."
"Mom’s words after I vented after showing her the disaster my husband made of our kitchen in one day (& that he probably won’t get to clean before I get home and start on it). 

At first she was sympathetic, but then brought up how she had my two older sisters, worked 2 jobs, and had to clean up after my father, and keep a clean house. My husband and I have no children, but she’s not taking into account that she had no parents to care for every day after work, no wound care to do, etc. And, I work two jobs - one full time and one side gig that I do as often as possible. 

Mom is usually kinder than this, but she has moments like this and the only thing to do is let her say her peace and ignore it until the subject changes."
"I live with my elderly Father (70) who is showing signs of early onset dementia. He doesn't drive anymore. I have been trying to get my driver's license. I'm using my Dad's car, it's a 2002 Toyota Camry which hasn't been properly maintained for years. The thing is, my Dad is refusing to get the work done on the car that it needs, and I refuse to drive a car that has been neglected/improperly maintained for obvious reasons, which creates a problem for us. Is there anything I can do? He also has a court date in March for rear-ending a city bus in his now-totaled Camaro because he lost consciousness behind the wheel and the police ticketed him with ""failure to control speed to avoid a collision"" Well duh, that's probably because he was unconscious. This accident is why he doesn't drive anymore. I'm disputing that charge but in the meantime is there anything I can do (including legally) to make him get the work that needs to be done on the car, or are my hands basically tied here? I'm assuming this begins the long road of getting him to see a Doctor (which he also refuses to do) so that he can be diagnosed with whatever kind of dementia it is. I have medical POA but not financial POA, if that's worth mentioning."
"My mother is 62 years old, and recently widowed. She has been limited in her exposure of interpersonal communication and  technology communication because her husband was very controlling. She lives in a rural area with limited social programs for now until she  can sell her house and move closer to me, as she is very lonely. 
Does anyone have any resources or ideas on how to help her or help me help her with understanding how internet, computers, email, and tablets work? 
She has a laptop, a Google account, Facebook, and a tablet, but she hardly knows the basics.
 She doesn't understand basic computer operations like saving photos,  documents or wi fi settings. I spent 20 minutes over the phone helping to to forward an email, after she lost said email somewhere in the ""arch-ives.""She doesn't seem to understand Facebook at all because I ask her if she saw my photos, and she said no, they never showed up. 
 I can't spend this much time helping her figure this stuff out. I am expecting my first child in 2 weeks and really want to focus on caring for my baby, not my mother. I need to help her be more independent. I can't seem to find anything on you tube, which I think she knows how to use 🤔 ."
"Hey guys, after a harrowing 3 months caring for my 79 year old mother after a hospitalization (not covid), I finally convinced her to move into an extremely nice, top of the line assisted living facility. She moved in less than three weeks ago, and is already threatening to break the lease and go back ""home"" (totally unsustainable for a variety of reasons.) 

She claims they are ""controlling her life,"" that everyone here is ""not mentally with it,"" that the people that ARE with it don't have any interest in expanding their circle of friends to include her. 

But then she'll tell me that she sat next to a nice lady at dinner that's still working, or another nice man who took a trip to Argentina last year, or someone else who seems ""with it"" enough to have shared a meaningful anecdote with her that she felt was worth telling me about. 

I ask her what she means about them ""controlling her life""; she means that they ask her how she is doing and if she needs anything. She is strongly and repeatedly objecting to medication management - after agreeing to it, btw! - so I'll take her off it and see if that helps.  

I wonder if this is a normal response to the adjustment to assisted living? Did anyone else have grandparents or parents who arrived, claimed to hate it after 2 weeks, and then loved it? I assume covid restrictions aren't helping but I can't help but think that she is determined to hate it and not making much of an effort."
"It just sat in the room next store and listen to my elder make a call to life long friend. And my mistake was to say I have two phone numbers for these folks and one is probably their cell phone or summer camp phone number. But that I knew this number was confirmed as their home number. And then my elder makes the call all they want to do is go over all the phone numbers with their friend who has their own memory issues. I ALMOST lost my mind listing to my elder trying to research this unessicary task when they can hardly get a full sentence out and when the other person has memory issues. I even went back in the room in the middle of the phone call and said ""let it go, move on to another topic"" and they simply cannot do that any more. Their mind take so much to get it moving that like a train that just got up to speed, it can't stop. I want to my elder to stay in touch with friends via the phone but it's so hard for them and I am sitting by feeling them all the words they are struggling to find. It's hard."
"For some context about my story, I was employed or in education continuously for the 12 years leading up to 2021 in a field that takes a lot of personal investment (doctorate in science). My track record was pristine and I never had a bad workplace interaction, with plenty of references to back that up.

In December of 2020/January of 2021, right as a 1 year work contract was ending, my 68 year old mom had a heart attack and a stroke that completely disabled her. What followed was an endless string of ICU visits, medical interventions, and constant terror and confusion on her part. She steadily deteriorated to the point where there is no hope for recovery. She is divorced and I am her only family member in this region of the country. I had to fix all of her medical, legal, and financial affairs, and hardly got a moment's rest. With the small amount of free time I did have, I worked *pro bono* for my old collaborators just to keep my technical skills somewhat sharp. I also had to take some time to myself to cope.

After we ran out of medical options (mom's on hospice), and after selling her home and belongings, I was suddenly hit with having free time again, as I have no more serious obligations other than keeping her company when I can. I re-entered the job market but I am getting a ton of scrutiny from recruiters, and I get a sense that the hiring managers may not take seriously my explanation of ""I had to drop what I was doing for a medical crisis"", and instead may view it as an excuse or indication of flakiness. I also am explaining this to all of my old coworkers who serve as references, which makes me feel shame in some way that I didn't live up to my career potential. They are supportive, though, but I feel like people who haven't lived through this situation may have a hard time appreciating how difficult it really is.

For anyone that has gone through this, do you have any tips? How did people react, and how explicit were you about the situation?"
"My husband (78) is no longer the man I married. I'm trying to keep our good times, of which there were many in my heart but living with him, especially in Covid isolation, has become a chore I resent.  

He doesn't want to go anywhere, or do anything. He sleeps, reads and stares off into space throughout the day, and at night watches TV.   He can't converse about anything, but the mundane.

He manages to take care of his daily needs like showering, and making himself meals when I don't but I do literally everything else. I do all the shopping, home repairs and care for the outdoors. 

Recently, I've had some health problems and have realized that if I hadn't had a little help from our kids, I might not have made it through it.

I'm so tired and I feel like life is passing us by.  His memory seems fine.  Thoughts?"
"Hi everyone,

I am the founder of a small company researching virtual reality in connection to loneliness and isolation. We have a grant from the National Science Foundation and are working with a local university to observe the effects of virtual reality technology on an individual’s psychology and nervous system. As part of our National Science Foundation research, I am hoping to interview adults with aging parents who are socially isolated or lonely.

Interviews will be by Zoom or phone call and should be about 20 - 25 minutes. Everyone who participates will get a $15 Amazon Gift Card. I know it isn’t much, but hopefully the gesture makes it worth your time, I am very grateful for any insight and feedback!

DM me or email me at ralph@ralphvr.com if interested.

Thank you."
"I'm a bit concerned about my dad's recent activity of adding random women to his friend list.  Dad lives alone now that mom is in a nursing facility.  He still visits her regularly so still very devoted to his wife.  

Lately I've noticed a growing number of random women appear on his list where he likes, comments on their photos often. These women range in age from 20s-50s, and often post selfies, triggering hundreds of likes and comments from admirers.  An example comment from dad goes ""What a beautiful lady, hope you find a man with a heart of gold like mine"".  While comments like these may be harmless, I'm most concerned about the women who live in our immediate city.

I feel like this activity is inappropriate for someone his age, and also makes him vulnerable to online predators since he's got his full name, phone, and picture in public.  I've tried talking to him only to be told to mind my own business.  How frustrating.  I'm notabiut to talk to my friends about this, hence I've come to Reddit to air it out.

I'm wondering how common this behavior is with elderly men. I always thought once men got older their libido and attraction to women decline. Is anyone else's elderly dad like this?"
"Hello all.  I'm having a problem figuring out how to take my mom off of the title of their car.  She's been declared incompetent and therefore my father has power of attorney.  He got into an accident and totaled the car.  He doesn't want it so he just wants to sell it to the insurance company and get the money.  The insurance company said to just have mom sign it, but she's been legally declared incompetent and thereby cannot legally sign any contracts.  I can't figure out how to go about this at the Secretary of State.  My father was injured in the accident and has been staying with me ever since.  I'd really like to do as much of this in advance so he doesn't have to go out in the cold and snowy weather.  What forms do I need to have?  What can I do in advance?  The website doesn't seem to even think of this as a possibility so nothing is listed on what to do.  There's a few options if she was dead, but not if she's just gone nutso.  I'm really frustrated and need some help."
"Mom has dementia, and is to the point where she pretty much doesn't talk and can't really make even simple decisions (what to eat, what to wear, what to do etc.)
She has lost lots of weight and majority of her clothes do not fit nor does she have a use for fancy ""going out"" clothes (think gowns, nice coats, silk blouses). We want to declutter and make her environment more comfortable, she has a HUGE collection of clothes that takes up a majority of her bedroom space.

What are the ethics of cleaning out her closet and only keep things that are needed? 
Has anyone else gone thru this? What did you do?"
"I'm in the middle of a shitty situation, and I need some help figuring out a way forward.

FIL is quite sick. Cancer, parkinsons, and some parkinsons dementia. His health, which was never great, has been spiraling downward over the last 2 years.

He flatly refused to go to a progressive assisted living community when he started needing help and could have arranged a place to his liking. We tried to make this happen this 2 years ago before the situation deteriorated, but he kept coming up with objections and wouldn't take any action. He has had some in-home hospice support, but he was incredibly verbally abusive to the caregivers and kicked them out, then cancelled the service. We tried again, same thing happened again.

Over the last several months, he has fallen multiple times in the home and beyond, landing him in the hospital several times. He is also verbally abusive to hospital staff. Each time, the second he is medically stable, he checks himself out of the hospital and berates MIL into coming to pick him up. She always complies.

He wants to stay home, and he wants MIL to be his sole caregiver. It is killing her. She recently had a health scare of her own that she had to put on the back burner because he fell again.

He is verbally abusive to her and had a first incident of physical abuse last spring--bad enough that she had to leave him for a time. He talked her in to coming back.

My spouse is their only child, and we live a few states away. He tries to help and provide respite to his mom, but every time he does it seems to make the situation worse. He and FIL have never had a good relationship (and, to be honest, neither have FIL and MIL--it has always been emotionally abusive). Over the decades we have tried and tried and tried to give MIL an out, but she keeps going back.

FIL is currently losing his ability to walk. Local first responders have been called 1-2x/week to help him back into bed or to take him to the hospital.

He needs to be in a nursing home OR have full-time in-home care. He will accept neither of these options. The only thing he will accept is staying home with MIL.

What can we do? Does anyone have advice?"
Looking for a safe retirement investment that makes more than money sitting in a bank savings account. I'll be contacting a financial advisor but I was curious if anyone has invested money for their parents and are happy with the results.
"But it's hard. So much of the time I go to bed regretting an argument or a remark I made in the heat of the moment while talking to her on the phone. She has schizophrenia and is an alcoholic (but she never drinks in front of me; we pretend she doesn't and its always been that way). Many schizophrenics turn into addicts to cope with the illness. I don't blame her.

But man oh man, she has high anxiety and worries about everything. She lives in negativity - she basks in it. The world is always in trouble, the economy will always blow up in the future, the world is dangerous place, be extra careful or else etc. etc.

I want to be kinder and I always remind myself to be kinder, but it doesn't seem to be working. I hate ending a phone call after arguing with her, because I don't blame her for the way she is. I am mean and cold and dismissive sometimes. I forget that she's mentally ill and I forget her age and what she went through in life. It's just hard dealing with the negativity and arguments we have.

Tips?"
"This is kind of a strange post, but do any of you have misophonia? one of my triggers is mouth noises. Chewing, lip smacking, tongue clicking - just general mouth noises making me want to curl up in a ball and die. 

As my parents and my older relatives age, there are more and more mouth noises in the picture.

Do any of you have this issue and if so, how do you deal with it? And if you don't have misophonia I appreciate that mouth noises might just be annoying but for those of us with misophonia, exposure to these triggers can cause an anxiety attack. If it were as easy as just dealing with it, I'd be dealing with it."
I’m a SAHM to a 2.5yo and my husband WFH. Might it be possible for us to care for my FIL in our home without paid caregivers? He is currently max assist (2 people needed) to get to the bedside commode. Any tips welcome. This is all very overwhelming and extremely expensive
What struggles do you notice with your parents/patients regarding medication? Do you always have to assist them with medication intake?
"My dad had a stroke in late 2020. I traveled back to South America to help him recover and after 3 months he was able to mostly live by himself again. One of my siblings who does have a bit of a mental illness moved to the house next to his to keep him company and keep him safe. In late 2021, my dad fell and broke his hip. The doctors didn't notice the fracture and for ten days he just laid in bed. He didn't want to call another specialist or anything. Finally, another specialist saw his x-ray and noticed the fracture, so he was moved to a hospital. In the hospital, he had a terrible experience. They waited for 7 days until his prosthetics was requested, another 7 days for the request to be approved (while being in isolation due to covid restrictions), and finally another 7 days to get the surgery done and be discharged. In that time, he lost a ton of weight and I think he suffered delirium due to the bad care he received (it'd take nurses hours to come and give him painkillers and once he had to spend more than hour before he was changed after having done number 2). After he was out, he spent about a week living again with my sibling who ended up quitting and just leaving because he couldn't care for him. My dad was refusing food and water and suffering constipation as a consequence. Another sibling brought him to his house and pushed him and was able to eat a little bit more and drink a little bit more water. He spent there two days before going to a good recovery center (basically, an ALF that is also equipped to treat people recovering after surgery). However, my dad is still refusing food and water. He always finds an excuse to not do stuff (e.g. the doctor said I should drink tea and they haven't brought the tea, so I cannot eat until then. Or he says he is drinking and eating when he's not doing it as much). He's been in pain because of cramps in his stomach because he doesn't eat or drink as much as he needs, and of course fails to have good BMs as well. He doesn't sit supposedly because of that pain which also means he's not recovering from his surgery at all.

What can we do at this point? Should we ask the center to call a psychiatrist and see what is wrong? Is it possible this is dementia? When we talk to him, he says he does want to recover and do all the stuff we've planned (like coming to the US for my PhD graduation) but at the same time, it just all feels like he's saying stuff, so we don't tell him what to do, but he's starving himself in the process."
"I am sure there is a lot of experienced folks on here that have solid advice.


1. Should I be a joint signer on my Dad's bank account or should I give the bank my durable power of attorney and sign as his agent?

2. What is a medicaid trust and how much do they normally cost to setup?

My Dad lives on SS and owns his home with a small mortgage and has quite bit of equity in it. This is the asset we are trying to determine what to do with. He is currently unable to live on his own.

Thanks!"
"My mother and I don't talk, my Father clearly has dementia and they live together. I am assuming he can still take instruction and do tasks/favours for her. She's 60's and he's mid-late 70's perhaps? I've always struggled to remember their birthdays & I think that's very symbolic of our connection- which is quite surface level. 

I get twinges of guilt before bed, & that often sends me into a spell of sadness... I genuinely don't know what to do. My mother doesn't reach out, my father seems like he cannot. My heart breaks that it seems like her and I are too prideful to give in. I'm also upset that as the **child** of an emotionally abusive/physically abusive/addict parent... **I** have to make the first move and call? *I guess I better call then eh?* I just find it very difficult to face two dying people. It's been something so absolutely terrifying for me to face I know it's so immature, as someone who is 27... I am so uncomfortable with seeing my parents deteriorate. 

I know that in a sense, if I don't face the dead... I will be rudely awoken by it's reality later on down the line.

This is a lot. I'm sorry. I know y'all aren't therapists. I appreciate a chance to vent. Thanks."
"Obviously one should call as much as possible, but I try to have new things to talk about and reasons to call to not make it so obvious that I'm trying to help with the loneliness.  Does anyone have any creative ways of keeping in contact with a lonely parent?"
My aging in-laws said they didn't want to do a Medicaid trust because they had concerns that they would be forced to be put in a low income health care settings prone to abuse and neglect by staff. Is there any truth in this? Asking because this whole endeavor is making me think I need to plan if I may need LTC in th future.
"My mom, 78, has stage 4 cancer and has spent almost all of her money maintaining her comfortable lifestyle.  She's responding very well to cancer treatment, which is great! But she starts oral chemo in a few weeks, which Medicare doesn't cover.  We don't know her exact oral prescription yet, but apparently those treatments could be as much as $10,000 per month. She told a sibling that she has about $60k to her name, and she owns a house, although she is in the process of taking out a second reverse mortgage. She won't talk about money with me, other than to say she plans on dying when she runs out, and that it's none of my business.  In the meantime, she's aggressively treating her cancer, which Medicare has been paying in full as far as I know.  

What does she do when she runs out of money? It seems she'll need to get rid of her house and spend her remaining money before she can get onto Medicaid, which will at least pay for part of the oral chemo, but then what? She'll have about $680 per month in Social Security and no home.  That's it. 

I don't know what to do, and I would love to hear from others who are farther down this road."
"Hi all,

Not sure if can I post it here, if not please delete. I found this really amazing place that helped my dad a lot (still helping!) and It wasn't easy to find. You can find so many assisted living around the area but he really loves this place. If you are interested, you can check their page: [https://www.theashford.com/our-communities/the-ashford-of-mt-washington](https://www.theashford.com/our-communities/the-ashford-of-mt-washington)"
"Hello! I'm looking for advice on how to set up a legal payroll for home health care workers that my mom is going to hire.

My original plan was to just pay them out of pocket, but she's in housing that will deduct care expenses from rent, so I want to be able to show the paystubs and potentially invoices in possible.

Does anyone have experience with this and a recommendation for how to document? I'm willing to pay for a program that makes it easy as long as the cost is worth it.

Thanks!"
"My 95 year old father has been paying for his Genworth Long Term Care policy for 30+ years. He moved into assisted living a year ago and went through the process of being evaluated for receiving benefits. His physician recommended approval. The Genworth evaluation process included a 2 1/2 hour exhausting and unorganized zoom call. The decision was that he didn’t qualify. His physician appealed and it was denied with no real explanation. My father had a terrible fall a month ago, followed by hospitalization and rehab. We’ve restarted the Genworth process now that he is receiving more assistance. 

Does anyone know the magic words we need to say in his upcoming re-evaluation for him to receive benefits from the policy? It’s heartbreaking to think of how much money he has put into it. 

Thank you!"
"My parents are 82 and 83. Mom has COPD, neuropathy, incontinence, and has been in a cycle of hospital, rehab, home, rinse and repeat, for the last three years. She is not strong and has had numerous falls, usually related to a bout of UTI or pneumonia. The falls so far haven't resulted in anything more than compression fractures in her spine, which cause her pain even a year later. Her mind is fairly good, unless she's having a bout of illness.  


Dad has Psoriatic Arthritis, with damage and severe pain in his feet and hips, some sort of heart issue he hasn't told us much about, and some level of dementia that has mainly affected his executive functions. He takes medications that depress his immune system and lives in a state with a HIGH number of Covid cases, but still goes out every day to the store, to eat out with friends, to be the chauffeur for an injured friend, etc., etc. They're both vaxxed but at their age, that doesn't mean as much as it does for younger folks. And we can't persuade him that he should exercise caution in regard to Covid. When he was at the ER a couple of months ago, he called a friend who was 8 days from a Covid positive test to pick him up, rather than have my brother who lives 1.5 hours away come get him.  


They live in an apartment complex, in a state that just got two feet of snow. I talked with Dad during the snowstorm, and oh, yes, he wasn't planning on going anywhere, they were safe and didn't need anything. The apartment complex had a team of workers clearing snow constantly during the heavy snowfall. But the next day, my mom tells me that he decided he had to go out to buy a snow shovel, to clear off the walkway! 1) The apartment complex will do that! 2) Dad has no business trying to shovel heavy, wet snow at his age! That's part of why they moved to an apartment!  


And Mom also tells me, proudly, that she talked to her friend who is as old as she, who uses a Rollator instead of a walker. And Mom decided she would switch from her walker back to the Rollator that is in their closet. No! Aghhh! My husband and I tried to remind her that her physical therapist told her NOT to the use the Rollator, that the four wheels and turning action make it TOO quick and unstable for her. She needs the greater stability of a walker, with only two wheels, which don't rotate, and the tennis ball back legs which glide. She was furious that we weren't proud of her and insisted that it has been ""fine"" for the day that she's used the Rollator. Yes, it is fine, for days or weeks, until she falls once again, and it's only a matter of time before one of these falls results in a broken hip or worse.  


I am powerless, living states away. The Visiting Nurse Association social worker (no longer on their case unfortunately as they timed out and are now with a long-term charity instead) insisted that they work on getting the Frail Elder Waiver so they can apply for Medicaid, and then get Medicaid to pay for a Home Health Aide to be in the home for more hours, to enable Mom to stay at home rather than go into long term care. They agreed to do it, but wouldn't let me run the paperwork, and so it is taking For. Ev. Er. It will move forward soon, but in the meantime, they make bad decisions all the time that are dangerous or wasteful and so on.  


I don't know if I'm venting or asking for advice. My brother and I know that honestly, it is time they had almost full-time care or were in a facility, but they are \*just\* coherent enough that no judge would give us guardianship yet, and they won't agree to go into a nursing home yet. And I get it, no one wants to leave their nice home and their things and live in a facility, but then, please be smart and don't do crap that makes it more and more likely you'll be injured or sick, okay?!?!?"
"According to the most recent Doctor's notes, my Mom has moderate cognitive impairment from vascular dementia. We did not know this was an active diagnosis from her MD, so had never discussed it. (Long list of factors how this seemed to happen; better for another post.) 

I live about 300 miles away from my Mom, so I have begun spending  brief, intensive visits with her each month for the past 3 months. These visits have been very focused on what she needs RIGHT NOW, whatever the urgent issue of the day is. On the last visit, she was complaining about not being able to keep her own meds in her room in the AL. (Relevant - she got to the AL because she was not taking her meds properly for a long time and ended up in the hospital a few months ago.) 

As she calmed down, I sat down with her and asked if we could talk about something. She made eye contact with me as I told her about her dementia diagnosis, that although she has been complaining about memory issues, this diagnosis means it's more than just simple aging, and it makes it hard for her to make safe decisions for herself, etc. After a couple of minutes going back to how she knows how to manage her meds, and me trying to direct the conversation back to what I said to her and if she understood - she looked at me directly and asked ""So, why are you telling me this?"" I answer ""because I don't want you to think that I am lying to you or hiding anything from you. You have a right to know what is going on with your health.""

And, she said: "" So, what am I supposed to do with that information?"" 

...

...

It was not a question I had thought about how to answer. I was not prepared for it - I was prepared for her arguing with me, maybe being upset about it. It was a great question. It was a heartbreaking question. 

I told her ""Well, I guess you don't have to do anything. But, I've been honest with you about it, so I guess that's it."" And she went back to complaining about something else. 

I suppose it would have gone differently if we had the discussion a few years ago. It just really stood out to me that at *this* time, at *this* level of impairment, the label has no meaning to her anymore. 

I am still stuck in thinking about this more than feeling anything about it. I'm wondering about other people's experiences. Maybe it will help me figure out my own feelings."
"Here is my [Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/s1q7no/i_feel_like_im_watching_a_car_start_to_crash_into/) .

I was practically speechless. My brother - who has a tendency to tell Mom what she can't do, but then clean up the mess after she does it anyway - really stuck to his guns. We told my Mom that we would help her get into the AL, but we would not do anything to help her move back into her house. We changed one aspect of the plan that made the transition more palatable to her, which meant she didn't have to say ""I can't do this"" out loud, which I think helped her pride. 

The Rehab allowed her to stay another week (we'll have to submit that bill to the LTC insurance). She and her aide boxed up a lot of things from her house to move. My brother actually was exposed to Covid the day before the move, and the aide had to be the only person there the day she actually moved in! (This woman is a blessing and a half.) Mom's been there for about a week. 

It's going to be a long road of adjustment, and I'm actually going to be posting on some other individual events/thoughts/feelings for sure.  

I appreciate everyone's support, here."
"Within the last week, we got word that a resident and an employee at mother's assisted living facility tested positive for COVID-19, and were asymptomatic.

I usually visit on Sunday afternoons, but I skipped today because of the earlier diagnoses, and also because my dog caused me to pull a muscle in my back. Got the word about mother about half an hour ago.

My brother talked to her and says that she just seems tired. So far, she's just running a fever. It's getting to the point that she can't hear her phone ring, so I haven't talked to her myself."
"So mom went to a nursing home in September. I suspected she wouldn't be able to manage being alone at home and we now know that she can't.
So we empty the apt. The Stough Group is doing a final walk thru today and they insist on charging her for Feb, full rent. They have a new tenant going in on March 1. 
I just think they're shitty."
"My dad's (68) dementia is hitting new levels and I'm really having a hard time with it. I cry at everything, I'm not sleeping well, having panic attacks. All this started a few days ago when I discovered we all had covid in the house. It feels like it set me off. Dad's covid has been very mild, thankfully, but his mental capacity has gone down significantly. He's not changing his diapers, he's making huge potty messes in the bathroom and bed, I'm constantly cleaning him up and his areas. I think it's time to have home help or hospice or something like that. How did you deal with the mental load of all this? I've cried till I'm dehydrated and cried some more. I feel like I'm mourning his loss, while he's still in need of my care. This sucks so much. I hate dementia.
I'll be calling his doc asap to begin getting assistance in home for him and talking to my doc about meds for me to cope. Am I doing the right thing? This feels so final. I'm a fixer type personality and this is something I absolutely cannot fix and it's breaking me."
"In 2017, my family and I got a house with my mom. Everything was put in her name because she had really good credit, whereas my husband and I had mediocre credit at best. When we moved her out of her rental, it was an absolute shitshow from the hoarding she had done over the 15 years she had been there. It was so bad, that her landlords whom she had a close relationship with for years wound up taking her to court for damages (that’s a whole other story that I won’t get into). Anyway, after dealing with that mess, it became obvious to me that my mom has been a full-on alcoholic for quite sometime. She takes benzos and is on blood thinners so she gets blackout drunk really easily and then has falling incidents. Falling incidents that have increased in frequency over the years. I keep trying to have talks with her about this, and how it would be nice if she began taking care of herself so that she could see her grandchildren grow up. Every bit of advice that I’ve given her has fallen on deaf ears. I have told her that her health is deteriorating rapidly, and if she doesn’t get ahead of it, she’s going to wind up suffering an early demise. I have told her that her falling from the drinking is bad enough that one of my children could go downstairs to see her one morning and find her dead. She broke her hand recently from one of her falls, and she didn’t even know it until she woke up the following morning. She is barely able to do her job at work anymore, and coworkers that are close family friends have said that she struggled to even get around (she’s a nurse). She’s out right now on disability due to her hand injury, but I’m afraid that once she gets cleared to go back to work, she will just wind up going back and continuing the cycle. She is about to turn 65 this year and has multiple pensions lined up, and I told her she should just make her health a priority and take care of her back issues that she’s put off for years (she has vertebrae that have fused together), and her knees, joints, etc, and then retire at 65. She leaves me mostly in the dark about what her long term plan is. I keep begging her to speak to a financial advisor and get her financials organized in case something happens to her (put the house in a trust, ask for what recommendations will put her in the best position for herself and make it easier for me once she passes). I’ve told her to contact a Medicare navigator to try and plan ahead about what she has to do in the coming months to get her insurance going and a managed care plan picked out, but she drags her feet. Despite me having her best interest in mind while also looking out for my family so that she doesn’t wind up becoming a huge burden if she doesn’t sort out what she needs to, she just listens, nods, and continues to make no changes. I try and have these discussions in a non-confrontational way, and present it as just doing the most sensible and responsible thing for her future, but still, she does nothing and continues to leave me in the dark. She has put me in the position that her falling has led to us having to bring her to seek medical care on multiple occasions, and what’s more, my young children are seeing her in these states. I have no idea what to do at this point, and I would leave her to do what she wants if it didn’t impact my family, but it does. The longer she puts off her health, the harder it is going to be to care for her over the next few years. Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? If so, how did you work things out? Either way, any advice is appreciated."
"My mom is 68 and in total denial about aging. She works a physical job that involves tons of driving in a major metropolitan area. She goes out drinking and/or with friends most evenings. And she keeps getting injured.

I got a text at 11pm last night that she'd just got to the ER with a broken leg and sprained (other leg) ankle from tripping off a curb. Last year she had a medical issue that kept her out of work and home for several months. Before that it was another injury.

I'm dreading the call I'm going to have to make in a few minutes where I figure out her plans for recovery. My stepdad can't help with transfers due to his own major medical issues. Is she expecting to go home and do everything herself? (This is what I expect she'll say.) Homecare aids? A short term rehab facility is what she needs, but I know she won't agree to one.

She needs to retire. (And yes she can financially.) But she's afraid of facing her age and slowing down. I thought I had her convinced after the last major medical issue she had. But she's been right back out working, cruising bars and visiting friends. (Nevermind COVID. At least she's vaccinated and masks in stores and at client's houses.) 

How do you get a boomer to slow down and/or retire when they think they're invincible and immortal?? (She desperately needs therapy to deal with her mother's and husband's failing health as well, but thinks calling her ""friend"" who's a therapist to go out for drinks when she ""needs"" to talk is the same thing.) Her mom worked until she was in her mid-80's, walked out in traffic, got hit in the head by a truck's mirror, and ended up with dementia from the brain trauma. (There's more to that but that's broad strokes.) I don't want to sit idly by while my mom goes down the same path, 10 years sooner.

Has anyone here been successful at getting their parents to slow down? I'd love any ideas y'all have."
"My mother is 64 with decades of mental illness. When she was younger she had more emotional problems but as she has aged it has transformed into issues with her thinking (paranoia, panic, delusions). The paranoia is especially acute at night, to the point she cannot be alone at night and we have to have in home aides from 10-7 every night ($$$$$).

In the last 4-5 months she has spiraled:


Police picking her up when wandering to get away from her home which she feels is unsafe (it’s an independent living facility that is like Fort Knox - I can’t even get in because they won’t issue more than one key fob per resident)

Multiple trips to the mental hospital

Totaled her car in October and is not driving now (thank god)

3 trips to ER in the last two weeks because she felt panicky


Physically, she has had health issues as well. Some of these we have discovered in trying to get her evaluated and helped. They are:

Stage 3B Chronic Kidney disease with more symptoms manifesting

High blood pressure (shoots up to over 200 systolic at times when she is in an episode) - fairly well controlled when she is not in an episode 

Chronic UTIs which seem to be related to urinary retention. Every time she goes into the hospital she has a UTI. They really seem to accelerate the delusions and paranoia. We have a bladder study and follow up urologist appt in the next two weeks, but it has taken two months to get these appointments

A CT scan revealed that she has emphysema. She doesn’t seem to lack oxygen saturation, but we are waiting for an appointment with her primary care to discuss the results.

Her mental acuity seems to be fuzzy at times. She has difficulty with anything with complex planning involved, and sometimes I think her ability to grasp and understand medical information is lacking…but her memory is ok. I worry about dementia but I can’t tell if her brain is just foggy from medications and urinary tract infections


She doesn’t have mobility issues, she CAN cook (though doesn’t do a good job of planning her day around meals or the forethought it takes to shop and cook), she can shower, dress, and physically can do the activities of daily living. But emotionally and mentally she cannot run her life.

In your experience is assisted living a fit for these kinds of limitations? Would they take her? I think having a structured environment that cleans the house, feeds her, has staff available for when she is freaking out, and provides transportation would help her immensely. 

Because she is unstable and I have a five-year-old I do not feel comfortable letting her live with me"
"I (F 61) live in Portland, OR. My mom lives in Houston, Texas. I have one sibling - a brother (65) who lives near my mother. Mom is 85 and she's been through hell the last 7 months. My family all has high cholesterol. My mom has high blood pressure (diagnosed in early 20s) that is well maintained with meds. She has not treated her high cholesterol with statins.

In July, she had 5 coronary stents placed. (I flew to Texas and stayed for 10 days. She was in the hospital the whole time. ) I was worried about covid, but we were both fully vaxxed and we agreed to take the risk. I wore my mask through two airports and during an Uber ride. She didn't want me to wear the mask while in her hospital room, which I thought was risky, but my brother and his wife weren't wearing theirs, so I acquiesced. Mom went home and started her recovery knowing that her docs were concerned about blockage in her carotid artery and her legs. 

A couple of months later, my mom had a carotid stent placed due to blockages. Her vocal cord was damaged and now she has only one functioning vocal cord. 

Today, my mom is having a femoral bypass in one leg. She is receiving a donor artery from a cadaver. She was told she had 100% blockage in both legs, so she will have the same procedure on the other leg in three weeks. She may lose some or all toes. I'm assuming she will need immunosuppressive drugs so she doesn't reject the donated artery. 

I am vaxxed and boosted with Moderna. My mom has had 2 doses of Pfizer, no booster. 

I have decided not to go to Texas to support her for this procedure because I'm afraid I will contract omicron during travel. I'm not overly concerned about my own ability to survive because I'm vaxxed, but if I were to catch covid and pass it to her, she would certainly die from the disease. 

My brother is there to care for her. If I were to travel, I would only be able to stay for a short time - 3 or 4 days. I provide childcare for my 3-year-old granddaughter, so I have her to think about, as well. 

I guess I'm really looking for confirmation that I'm making the right choice here. Do the risks of traveling and possible exposure outweigh the benefits of a quick visit to hold her hand and offer moral support? 

I do speak to her on the phone daily and I offer moral support as often as possible. 

I think there are no good choices here. I would hate to have her survive these surgeries only to be exposed to covid from her daughter and then die of this shitty disease."
"Hey all, my mom got long term care insurance in the 1990s. The policy is with a company that still exists and shockingly has an excellent rating on Consumer Affairs. But I have been trying for four months to get them to pay for ...something. Anything. And it's like banging my head against the wall.

First, they insist on mailing everything. If they need information, they mail a letter. By the time it gets to me or to the doctor's office or the home health care agency or whatever, the request for information is now a week old and there is a scramble to provide them what they need.

Not only that, the letter might say something like ""because we don't have the information requested, we're closing your claim."" Only... I have no record of them ever asking for information. So I'll have to call, waste a half hour on the phone, figure out what they want, get providers to fax relevant documents...and then get a letter a month later saying they still don't have what they need.

I have faxed my medical POA three times. They say it's ""missing information"" (no one else has every questioned it.)

Last week, I got a letter listing approved assisted living facilities in my area. I requested that list on November 16.

My mom moved to assisted living two weeks ago. On December 21, that facility called the insurance company to get approval; they have not been approved and have not gotten any requests for information so that they may get approved.

It's infuriating. I think I'll report them to the state regulatory agency but in the meantime...

Have any of you ever been able to take advantage of any long term care insurance claims, ever? Or is this just a giant shell game?"
"I NEED HELP! Knowing what are my next steps here... 

I have a stage 4 cancer and am 43, the only child, only nearby living relative, the only person able and willing to take on the job of managing her affairs for now...

My widowed mother has finally started showing serious signs of dementia this past 16 months or so; forgetting conversations, getting lost on the way to familiar places, forgetting to pay bills even with constant reminders. 

Lot of self neglect; house is a hoarder house with trash piled hip deep, no heat, no running water, no food in the house, no microwave, stove, refrigerator, hot plate... no working toilet... 

She hasn't showed in over a year, gets by on a couple sponge baths weekly. Hasn't done laundry in over a year, just rotating through 2 or 3 outfits and hanging them outside ""to air out.""

Sometimes she forgets where I live, or gets lost on the way to her favorite grocery store where she's shopped for 20 years. 

Her license has been revoked for several months now. She had chances to get it reinstated and I tried like hell to hold her hand and walk her through it but she just couldn't get it done. Had almost 3 months to study for the written test and couldn't light a fire under her own butt enough to do even that much.

So now she's been driving every day on a revoked license. She lives in a town 30 miles away from where I live, and she'd understandably much rather come ""bother"" me daily than sit out in her hoarder house in the middle of nowhere being bored and lonely. Problem is she's a danger to self and others, driving 90 minutes round trip daily MINIMUM, on a revoked license, so of course she keeps getting pulled over and ticketed. 

I believe last night was the 5th or 6th time she's been ticketed, but the 3rd time an officer from her hometown has called me at 10 or 11 at night to say;

 ""Hey we have your mother and we hate to ask... but if you guys can't come get her and her car and her dog, we're going to have to impound the truck ($700) take the dog to the pound ($150+) and take her to jail ($$bail??).""

Besides it being physically tiring as a cancer patient to put my plans for getting some rest on hold and driving a near 2 hour round trip at 11pm, it's also a bit mentally exhausting to never know when you're going to get that call.

I've gotten her a good local lawyer to handle the tickets and court hearings, and got a case open with DHS/Adult Protective Services regarding serious self-neglect.

The thing is, she's deeply in denial... she will sit there, confronted with PROOF that she just forgot something she used to know, or a conversation we had 30 seconds ago... and she obstinately will not admit that her memory and function is anything other than perfect. And when you confront her on it, she'll make up a blatant lie and claim to believe it 100%.

For example I asked her, if she's such a great driver, why does she weave in her lane? And she instantly came back with ""it's driving accuracy practice..."" and spun me some BS about how her old driver ed teacher used to have students practice driving in different portions of their highway lane to avoid potholes and hazards on the street. 
I tell her it's illegal to do that and we go back and forth with a lot of ""no it's not-yes it is..."" Conversation ends in stalemate, no matter what approach I take.

All I want is to get her an OK apartment in town, and a home health care person who can take her to run errands a couple three times a week. 

She's got insurance and she's got over $4000 a month in retirement and nearly $2000 in SS. So honestly she might be better off if I can find her a little studio place and someone to help out, than a nursing home. She's not so far gone that she can't eat a bowl of cereal or safely microwave a burrito. I think she still has some time before she needs to be in memory care.

The problem is, she WILL not have that conversation willingly, I don't know how to GET her to have that conversation.  I tried to take her keys from her last night and she shoved me away and ran into her house and locked me out. 

Yes I probably COULD physically take them from her but I would probably cause her some bruises in the process and might have to technically commit some assault, battery, breaking, and entering to get it done.

Everything that I need to do to take control of hear situation and get her someplace safe and healthy, she is going to hate, fight me on tooth and nail, see it as unnecessary and the vilest of betrayals by an ungrateful devil child who has inexplicably turned on her...

I'm fine with that, I'm ready to do what it takes- do any of you have any experience on HOW? 

HOW do you get legal control, guardianship, power of attorney, or whatever, over someone who very vehemently doesn't want ANYone to have ANY Control over the tiniest aspect of their life?

Does anyone know where to start, what agency, what's the process, what evidence to start collecting, etc?

Any hint in the right direction would be amazingly helpful; you'd be doing a lot to save a weird mean old lady. :)"
"My parents use traditional walkers.  Has anyone had experience with the up walker? My mom's knees are so bad I thought it might give her more stability, as well as for my dad who has dementia.

Thanks!"
"Going through the house getting it ready for the estate sale. One frustration i have is the old pictures. Many of them I have no idea who the people are. I know most are family but it was too long ago or I have never met them. I just wanted to suggest that you could sit down with Mom and/or Dad and whatever family albums you have and remember old times. And write on the back of the pic perhaps who those people are. Esp the old pics that could be grandparents or uncles or great grandparents. Mom was raised  by her grandparents and I 'think' one pic is of them but I cant be sure. If so, that's the only pic we have of them.

Another thought, my folks forgot a lot of what they had tucked away. Like my Dad's old teen adventure books he read in the 30's. It would have been fun to read one and talk with him about what he dreamed of being when he was a kid.

Last one is financial records. One benefit Dad was getting he had forgotten what it was. There was also a employer funded life Insurance policy that he had forgotten about.  Over the course of decades you tend to stack things away and forget. But theres some treasures in there.

Edit: just a brief addition. I think most parents would love to try and recall old family stories. I tried with both of my folks and both said no one would care. By the time my Dad wanted to I just didnt have the interest anymore. Wish very much now i would have kept asking and done it when Dad wanted to. I enjoyed the few stories I got the last few years and so many are now gone forever.

It's odd that Mom didnt talk about her parents really until a year or so before she passed. She also said the first curseword I ever heard her say (crap). Turns out her father ran off when she was born and her mother worked out of town so for a large part of her childhood she was raised by her grandparents. Then her Mom remarried and they all moved out to California, kinda neat.

Edit: Good point brought up. Important thing is that they are happy and feel loved and safe. If this gets them engaged and talking and smiling then thats the most awesome thing. We often dont understand, misunderstand, we judge their words and actions by our world. When theirs can be so different. theyre doing the best they can, all they can. and we will all be there one day. Thank you for all the responses. I wish we as a society valued our elderly so much more and cared for them so much better."
"My Dad is 84, and at this point at home and bed-ridden. I am retired and take care of him 24x7 (with a lot of help).

He lost his wife and other son (my Mom & Brother) in September/October.

His primary fear, even more than dying, is me dying first and there being nobody left to take care of him. I'm 55yo and in ok health, but I understand his fear given what he's gone through recently.

Between his estate and mine there's plenty of resources to get him into a nursing home and pay for it. I can easily make detailed plans for disposing of his house/contents, consolidating accounts, choosing a home, etc.

What I don't have is someone I can trust to execute the process. There's literally no family or friends left between us that I can call on to step up just in case.

Is there a professional resources I can hand over the relevant info to and trust to do this? Will a law firm be willing to act as trustee, doing the detail work of managing final bills, selling house contents, selling a house, etc.?

I'm at a loss who I can designate / trust with my and my Dad's entire financial life ""just in case""."
" 

My Mother (F61), living in Texas, has been in and out of the hospital in January for mineral deficiencies due to alcoholism. She and I have been estranged for a number of years. I (M37), living in GA, have been contacted by the hospital that she is confused (delusional) and needs long term care. The caseworker for the hospital is looking at Nursing Homes for her to be transferred to. The caseworker also said that the Nursing Home would help with the Medicaid application process. I am worried that she will not qualify for Medicaid.

Her situation:

* She has been out of work and off insurance since 2019-2020.
* She owns a house in rural Texas, but has been living with a family friend in town. (Her house is unfinished & unlivable due to trash. Her friend is no longer offering her a place to stay).
* She owns undeveloped land in rural Alabama abutting a National Park,
* The family friend has supposedly been paying all her property taxes.
* She has been admitted to the hospital by emergency service twice in the past month for same issue.
* She has a drinking problem which exacerbates the health issues.

I have no idea if Medicaid can help or what other options she has, and am worried that a facility will try to trick me into being financially responsible. I cannot afford the cost of a Nursing Home on my salary in addition to my normal living expenses & personal debt.

Any advice is much appreciated."
"I’m sitting in the airport after learning yesterday my mother has been in the hospital 3 days without my knowledge. She was in a coma from an OD on her prescription medication for bipolar disorder. She also has Covid and Pneumonia. My “dad” posted about her condition on Facebook instead of calling the only family she has - me and her best friend of 40years. 

I’m 31 and am only child. I’m completely overwhelmed and trying to just process my fears. My best friend is flying with me to Mexico and can only stay for 2 days. 

I know I need to be calm and absorb everything the doctor says but I’m overwhelmed with emotions and unsure of everything I need to ask him. 

Dr. speaks English. So that’s one less worry. I’ve already paid 10,000 for her to be admitted because she needed a different hospital since she’s Covid positive. 

TLDR: mom unresponsive in Mexican hospital, what questions should I be sure to ask doctor?"
"I posted here back in November about my father's (75) stubborn refusal to even go to a doctor to figure out what was going on with his health. The family Thanksgiving kind of got turned upside down due to his health being so poor and his last-minute actions/inactions because of it and I thought that had lead to a change of heart. He agreed then to go to the doctor and see what was up - but by the time the actual appointments came around, he was stubbornly refusing again.

Last week, things got worse and he ended up in the ER. Long story short, a multitude of tests later, and Dad has advanced colon cancer. It's spread to his lungs that they know of. He's having an MRI tomorrow to see if it's spread anywhere else. Yesterday, doctors removed a dozen 1-2cm polyps and he has about a 10cm tumor. The doc says surgery is likely not a viable option at this point.

So here's to ignoring your health issues until they get too bad to fix. I'm trying not to dwell on that part, because it will do no good now for anyone. It's the way things are and you can't change the past.

Dad seems... very calm about it. He also seems more mentally present and more like his normal self than he has in months. It's kind of strange. It's like he's been living in crippling fear/anxiety the past few months that something terrible is wrong and now that he knows it is, the lack of uncertainty has brought him some peace/clarity. The stress of not knowing is gone.

He's agreeing to tests like the MRI and eager to meet with his doctor afterward to figure out what's next - if anything. His oncologist is a very straightforward, no-nonsense person who doesn't sugar coat anything. Dad said he really likes him and really appreciates that he'll just flat-out tell it like it is.

He says he's willing to do whatever treatments he can do that aren't going to make his life completely miserable. He doesn't want to do anything that's just going to prolong his life but make him feel terrible the entire time. So if there are things that can be done within that framework to improve his situation, great. If not, he says, well, he's had a long life, and it's been a good one.

As for me, I've known since his stroke a few years ago that he was running low on years and that became even more evident over the past year. Dad and I are super close and of course this is crazy hard and painful, but not entirely unexpected. In a way, I've been mentally preparing myself for it for a long time. That is, it turns out, marginally helpful, I think?

My mental health is still a train wreck (for this and other reasons, it was kind of a dumpster fire before the diagnosis), but today was better than yesterday. I have a doctor's appointment next week and I plan to bring it up. I've taken antidepressants in the past and I was already feeling like I might need to go back to that before finding out Dad has cancer.

I think my step-mom's in about the same ""this is really hard but not super unexpected"" boat, as is my husband, who's always had a great relationship with Dad.

My son (19) seems to be emotionally bouncing around all over the place right now as he works through processing everything, which is pretty normal, but I still worry about him. He says he's going to make an appointment with his therapist, who he'd gone to in the past for unrelated reasons, but hasn't needed to see for several months now.

So now this whole journey begins."
"My dad is 79 years old and he constantly plays with his penis (not masturbating) and diapers. He would put his hand in the diapers or take his penis out of the diaper and slightly squeeze it. I would not care but when he urinates, it would get on everywhere except on his diapers. I also put underpads under him to help with the urine but he keeps taking it off. It is so frustrating because I have to do laundry almost everyday and have to constantly clean in order to prevent the room from smelling. It cost around $5 per laundry load and it adds up a lot of money per month. I even put on two diapers to prevent this situation but it does not work. He always complains that wearing a diaper is embarrassing or too healthy and strong to wear one. I suspect that he is bored. He have no interests or activities. Any suggestions would be appreciated."
"My mother-in-law and father-in-law are preparing to move into an independent living facility. MIL has stage 4 colon cancer and has a 6 month prognosis. Also, my mother-in-law is expecting to go through hospice once her condition worsens. FIL has moderately severe Parkinsons and depends entirely on MIL for basic ADLs. Now MIL is unable to care for him and they are looking to move into an Independent Living Facility so he can adapt more easily to the adjustment and get more support once she is gone. 

Navigating through the senior care facilities is quite daunting. My wife and I suspect father-in-law needs a higher level of care need some advice about whether an independent living facility can still assist him with ADLs. He has lots of limitations with mobility, dressing himself, bathing himself. Our greatest concern is that he is a fall risk. My father-in-law can be quite stubborn with admitting he needs the support, and my mother-in-law is possibly in denial about the severity of his condition. I guess it's hard acknowledging the loss of independence for them. They wanted to age at home like everyone but that just didn't pan out for them.  Any advice from the community is greatly appreciated."
"Today, following some COVID-related delays, we were finally permitted back inside my parents' apartment to complete the process of emptying it out. When everything was removed, we turned in my mom's call button and keys.

It's over.

And some might wonder, what about me?

The enormity of my losses in the past eight months has still not fully hit me, and I have still not fully processed it all. I'm so glad I wrote these posts because they reassure me that it all really happened, and they help me recall some of the incidents and events along the way.

I remember that it was only about a year ago this week that I first approached them about leaving their home of over 55 years, and that they didn't really want to move.

I remember showing them different places and being disappointed either in the presentations, their reaction, or both, and believing they were being very selfish, as they found something wrong with every possibility.

I remember turning from pulling a restaurant door closed and seeing my mother on the floor,  her having fallen and broken her hip, and me calling 911.

I remember using the incident while my mother was hospitalized to convince my dad that they really did need more help, and finally getting his consent to move to assisted living, although this tough former police detective asked me like a schoolboy, ""do you think they'll like me there?""

I remember how hard my wife and her sister worked, given just a four day notice, to furnish the apartment with well-loved items from the house, to make it cheery, and what a beautiful job they did in so little time.

I remember the day Dad fell. I didn't think a lot about it at the time, but for him, that was the beginning of the end. He began to have delusions and to accuse my mother, his wife of 70 years, of inappropriate behavior, but somehow he knew one day to ask me, ""Please, can you tell me what's wrong with me?""

I remember the day of the psychotic breakdown that put him in the hospital, and ultimately resulted in his very much unexpected passing.

I remember how miserable my mother was after Dad died, and how one day when I went to see her, she surprised me by telling me he had come to visit, but he had brought a new girlfriend with him, compounding her misery. These delusions persisted the rest of her life.

I remember dozens of visits, doing my best to see to it that my mom was safe and comfortable.

And finally, I remember seeing her wheeled out of the facility on a gurney, having fallen twice in a weekend and re-injuring the bad hip, and following the ambulance moving her to the hospice house, and her passing four days later.

So much happened in so little time. My dream of them living happily ever after, making new friends, finding new interests and fun, didn't come true.

But  we did our best for them, which is what they deserved.

After one last look around, we closed the blinds, turned out the lights, and locked the door behind us.

It's over.

For the last time, I have moved my parents."
"My Mom moved into an ALF a month before the pandemic hit. She has trouble taking care of herself because of multiple medical conditions and is also bipolar. She is a heavy smoker and has recently been caught smoking in her room. When moving her in I begged her to not smoke in her room, but she does so at night. She's on limited income and I spent a year working with elder care advocates to find a facility for her, paid to move her in, and get her set up. I've been through a lot with her over the last 20 years. Poor choices (choosing cigarettes over food), refusing to be responsible for basic needs, irresponsible spending, medical and financial issues, suicidal tendencies, being committed, the list goes on. In this relationship I find that I am parenting my Mother instead of her parenting me. As an only child, I've tried to help to reduce my own feelings of guilt while also trying to not enable her. I am also raising 3 teenagers of my own with a full time job. Since we live across country, her moving in with us is not an option. She has too many medical doctors and I'm not sure I can emotionally handle her living with us. She just take. I am at a loss how to get through to her that she can not smoke in her room as it's not allowed. Second to that, is she doesn't stop, I'm not sure what her options are. The street? Thank you in advance for any advice for this very overwhelming situation."
"No advice needed, just venting.

We use an agency that comes by in the morning and at night to administer pills. One of the evening pills will zonk you out till kingdom come. We arranged for a minimum of 9 PM. This pill will immediately put you out. Earlier this year we noticed that they started coming earlier and earlier (like 7:30), so we complained, as dad will get up too early and think it's still evening and get super confused. Well we got a new evening person, who, after a few weeks, started coming in at 530! We noticed when we'd visit dad he'd be out like a light, so we checked the security cams.

We complained again, they said they'd work it out with her. But she calls my elderly father with dementia and tells him  that life is super hard for her, she's working two jobs and can only do the pills in between them etc etc. My brother was hesitant about complaining again because he feels for her, as she's a woman of colour (he's conscious of his white privilege) and struggling financially etc. I'm sympathetic and all but making dad go to bed at 530 drastically affects the quality of his life (especially for a sundowner), not to mention the fact that she's doing it unasked and then calling my dad directly to complain?! Not exactly ethical.

Long story short, I'll be the one administering the pills from now on. (And yes we know he should be in a home but there's a complex obstacle atm)."
"I just realized yesterday why I feel so shit. My blood pressure is super high (for me)—143/91. I’m one of the few people I know who eats 7 servings of vegetables a day! I try to exercise but it’s hard when someone is constantly needing you to fix the messes they made in the day and then blaming you for them. 

Anyone else feel like they draining the life force out of you? I feel like I’ll have aged in dog years when this is over."
"Hi there. My dad is near the end of his life. Unfortunately he never made a will, or any additional decree of last wishes. Our immediate fam had to meetup with his care home to decide on his hospice care. It was grim and fairly sad. We had no guidance about it either. I can feel the stress and sadness building on us by the day. My dad came from a time when you simply don’t talk about things like dying or aging. You change the subject or ignore it. Especially mortality, wills and last wishes. He refused to acknowledge those things - and now here we are. My family is shy and soft spoken about personal issues. It’s made these things much more difficult. The paradox is that I‘ve lived through the sadness of death and loss for most of my adult life. I’ve lost friends to alcoholism and substance abuse since - forever. Unfortunately it happens, so I cope with loss and grief because I have to. However, I’m frustrated that my Dad put the burden on us to decide his last wishes. Not even a 10 point list. Any suggestions are really appreciated. Thank you all."
"Where I can find an Asian-American or Asian-Canadian supporting group, social media, meet up (virtual), or some sort? I think it might help me to communicate/vent/learn from other people, instead of just me and my husband.  It seems like talking about my aging parents' issue takes the majority of our daily talk and I don't want all the negative affecting my own family. TIA!"
"This will be anonymized, but I’m concerned about my neighbour, and if anyone has experience with at-home care in Ontario, Canada, seniors’ rights etc, or even just Canadian experience it would be greatly valued.  

My neighbour and close friend (almost an adoptive grandmother), who is in her mid-eighties, will be released soon from a stroke rehab facility.  She is aiming to go back to her home, where her son is moving in (took early retirement and was in process of moving when she had her stroke).  But I am very worried, for reasons I will outline.

We have been trying very hard to support her son (he’s essentially moving back to a small town with close-knit politics), by offering to be a buffer between the community and him, information-wise (so he passes the update to us, we will inform any of her friends who call, to reduce his burden).  But conversations with him are troubling: he has no idea what her current condition is (clearly not communicating with her rehab team more than once a week maybe), confesses he doesn’t think he can handle her coming back to the home *she owns*, and that he might just put her in a home against her wishes.  Worst of all, he doesn’t want anyone to call him after 5 PM as “I’m drinking from then on” (!!!!!!).

Behind her back, he has been chasing away her friends from visiting her (yelling at a few including my mom, and another friend who visited her before a lockdown).  

It came to a head for me on Friday, when she called me.  She’s paralyzed on one side, but can still talk fairly well.  After hello, she said “I need you to pass a message to my son.  I want two stair lifts installed.  One to go upstairs, one to go downstairs.  Please tell him.”  I was shocked at how emphatic she was, and why had she not told him herself?  I think she did, and he willfully misunderstood her.  

She called me after her son’s “happy evening” started, so we didn’t call him until the next morning.  This is how that conversation went:

Me: “Um, your mother called last night.  She’s sounding pretty good!  She asked if I could pass along a message to you.  She wants to have two stairlifts installed-“

Him: “What?!?!  Why does she want Sirius radio?  Why would I help her install that??  There would be so many wires!  No way!”

Me: “*Stairlift*.  A *stairlift*, you know the chair that carries you up and down.  She just wanted me to tell you.  She is planning going back home, and I’m sure she’s planning how to do that.”

Him: “Oh.  Well I don’t think I will do that anyway, I can’t handle this.”  

Then he sent a text saying that he didn’t want to talk to us ever again because we were too stressful.

Now, this isn’t a “was I wrong to pass along a message faithfully?” Kind of post.  His mother is no dummy, I think he blew his top when she asked *him* first about the stairlifts, he had blown her off, so she decided to employ a bit of friendly social pressure.  

So at this point, she is 1 week to 1 month away from discharge.  Her son hasn’t changed anything in the house to make her life easier - hasn’t installed a bed on the main floor, nor stairlifts so she can use her bedroom upstairs, limits contact with her rehab facility, and is drinking *a lot* (no one takes the phone off the hook at 5 PM for a 1/4 oz).  He seems to be very frustrated, desperate and furious at the prospect of her returning and living with him.  

I will be honest, I am scared that bad things will happen (ie some form of abuse, and in her state she might not be able to communicate that).  Although she doesn’t want to live in a home, I’m wondering if it might not be the safer option…

Does anyone have more details on stroke rehab facilities?  Do they require a home visit before sending her home?  Because they will see her home is 100% inappropriate for her right now.  And more than that… if I called the facility and reported the son’s concerning behaviours, would they look more carefully into her living options?  Btw, his objections are NOT money related.  She could easily make her house accessible, he is just refusing to do anything to help.  

TL/DR: neighbour had stroke, in rehab, coming home soon.  Her son lives in the house, pushing away all her friends, refusing to fix house up so she can live there, and is drinking heavily as of 5pm.  How can I help her the best?  Should I report him to the rehab team so they don’t send her to a bad place?"
"My Dad is 70. I’d say from 67 onwards he started having serious continence issues. It’s gotten to the point where walking in the park with him is a gamble because he might poop in my car (he’s done so twice already). When he accidentally goes in the house he does a very poor job of cleaning it up himself, leading to the house smelling like **** and my mom or me having to clean it up. Afterward she gets furious and storms off and he gets depressed. I just leave.

I get that this is normal for older adults, but for it to be this bad this early into his elderly years is concerning. Is there a type of surgery or something I could recommend? He’s all there mentally, and mostly there physically. He also wears adult diapers 24/7, it’s just not enough.

Additionally I’d love to give him advice. The depression-pity party he has for himself isn’t helping anyone. He does a horrendous job cleaning it up so I don’t have much sympathy in that regard. At the end of the day my mom and I aren’t full-time nurses and he’s too insecure to tell us he had accident until we walk into it, which makes things even worse.

Thanks in advanced."
"My 88-year-old father has been wearing diapers/pads for almost a year now as a result of age-related incontinence. He lives in an assisted living facility and I’m his primary caregiver, so I purchase all of his supplies. He’s able to care for himself, but every time I speak with him, he feels compelled to me how often he changes his pads or goes to the bathroom. Every phone conversation includes a full report. Every visit includes a full report. Every.Single.Time.

I have repeatedly told him that I don’t need or want to hear all the details, but he continues to talk incessantly about it — even when we are in a restaurant or grocery store. Thankfully, he’s otherwise healthy and has a urologist looking for a solution, but this feels more like OCD or dementia than the actual physical problem, and it’s making me a little crazy.

I’d appreciate any advice on how to cope with this."
"She had her bladder removed about ten years ago due to having bladder cancer. It's been a slow moving cancer, and has come back in her neck/spine causing a spinal cord compression within the past couple years. As a result of having her bladder removed, she now has a Urostomy bad and has to gets her stent changed once every 10 weeks. It's my understanding that hospice is being issued to monitor her comfort since they won't be treating the cancer going forward.  They've determined that chemo would be more detrimental than it would be a help. The stent changes are necessary in order to keep her urine flowing. I don't understand why the stent changes wouldn't be covered if on hospice since it's something that needs to be done in order for her to not run into serious issues with her kidney; which she only has one of. She does have Medicare and a supplemental insurance. Does anyone have any information or guidance with this type of issue?"
"I've been trying to persuade her (late 70es, Parkinsons) to move from her current home to my country, so she can be at hand for all the things she's constantly nagging for help with. So far, she wants to stay in that country (where she has no relatives, only a number of friends), she wants us to drop our jobs and move down to care for her, and denies she is at all old/frail. Hence, we invited her to spend a week with us, in the coldest month, to see how bad it's not going to be.

Highlights of the week:

* Throwing coffee/wine over herself at least once a day. She falls asleep with a cup in hand, but when you try to remove it it's ""stop treating me like a decrepit, I'm not going to spill it"". Every interaction is a fight, so you stop picking them, only to regret the consequences.
* Almost setting fire to the house when frying some food for us. I told her to wait until I came home from work, but she started without me, and didn't ask husband for help with extractor fan (he was home and the smoke alarm made him rush in). Our home now smells like a chippy, too.
* Doing the dishes without soap because ""no one told her where it was"". She never asks for help with anything, we're expected to read her mind. Will then just go to the guest room and sulk until you come look for her to take her out.
* Planning several walks out (e.g. past retirement homes and assisted living facilities nearby), and cancelling them because slooooowly walking anywhere, with a person abusing and moaning 15 paces behind you gets really tired, really fast.
* Constant verbal abuse of my husband (always when he's not there), and projecting all sorts of bad things onto him. He's a bad husband, lazy, selfish, jealous, refuses to change his ways, is a drunk, etc. ""You're never happy with him"". There was only one stressor in this house this week, and it's not him!

I'm so enjoying the quiet 6+ hours it will take her to get back to her country, until she's back on WhatsApp interrupting everything I do."
"LONG = Sorry. bottom line is WHO’S IN CHARGE?

Multigenerational household Brazil. My mother-in-law is 76 and wildly non compliant diabetic (diet, meds, exercise [none]). Husband has lived with his entire life (it’s a Brazilian thing - I’m American). Every interaction between Husband and MIL is an argument. MIL is increasingly nonfunctional (she wouldn’t have a clue how to pay a bill, or get her many meds refilled, or, well, anything). We just took away all her meds (which were thrown into a box), discovering there were four heart related meds not filled and not taken - we’re now pill organizing and dispensing them throughout the day (13 pills, I have no idea how an elderly person such as she could possibly have handled this -she can’t figure out a remote or a microwave button etc). 

She has no friends. She never leaves the house, except for drs appointments (accompanied of course). Her day consists of watching tv, eating loaves of bread, and complaining. No exercise whatsoever so is increasingly shaky with balance. In-home visits from geriatric health assistant/nurses, the advice they give in one ear and out the other. Psych help was attempted and immediately rejected. We are desperately trying to get her into adult day care, but that’s a process (free, part of city program, but apparently are all of these steps to take first which are in process.

HERE’S THE QUESTION - 
If we start to truly step in and direct her care [sidebar: should we, or do just let her do whatever she wants and continue to deteriorate}, how do we handle the all-out war it will be? I read a bunch of articles about this, and they’re all - everybody talk, and show respect, and listen, and communicate - trust me, the situation here is way past that point, it’s a battlefield and has been forever. 

Nitty gritty examples -
(A) If left up to her, she’d eat bread and drink milk all day long (a big diabetic No). If we were truly responsible, we’d take away access, and ration it appropriately. This will be War. 

(B) she wants a bucket to pee in at night (she’s perfectly capable of using the bathroom, she’s lazy). [recent bucket we confiscated, covered in visible bacteria, I was shocked]. We say no more. Nurse told her no.  More War.

(C-Z…). Etc etc. she is “capable” to make decisions, but they are consistently the wrong ones and not in her best interests. And we live with her, so we can’t look the other way. (A boatload of non compliant diabetic issues - eyes, hands, mental capacity/confusion, some potentially dangerous decisions/choices). She wants what she wants when she wants it (whatever the particular “it” is, it’s never the right “it”).

Who’s in charge here? What are the tactics to take? (Outright nursing home/assisted living is premature vis a vis Brazilian customs/The System). Every day is war, we’re miserable, and if anything happens to either my husband or me, MIL will be screwed."
"Sorry in advance if this seems jumbled, I’m a little sleepy and shaken up. My dad has short term memory issues/possible early onset dementia. He was prescribed meds for his memory but won’t take them.

After my mom died the probate attorney told me to get financial and medical durable POA for my dad so we did. 

He has no wife or anything. He has a close friend - I’ll call her Lisa. More about her below.

I worked my whole life to move away from my toxic hometown and my dad supported me a bit through college (I had full scholarship but he supported my housing costs), so I definitely am just feeling obligated to help. However I’m applying to med school and my schedule is packed and difficult right now and will likely be difficult for many years. 

It has also come to light that my dad has been financially irresponsible and owes the IRS $100,000. 

So here’s what happened today:

My dad calls and talks to me for an hour about politics, his pets, how he wants to take a trip to Hawaii. He never asks me about my classes which kinda hurts me a bit but i guess he doesn’t remember what I do.

Then later I get a text from Lisa saying he has no money, is in a dire situation, doesn’t eat except for cheap snacks, the water was turned off, he can’t bathe, is trying to sell a property but there’s lawyers trying to take the proceeds to pay IRS debt. She’s been paying his electric bill and he’s been using a fireplace only to keep warm. 

Lisa is basically telling me I need to support him financially but I don’t want to give him too much money and get tangled up in this mess and enable him. He has tons of junk, old cars, property, that he should sell before I give him my money that I need to pay for education right? He’s not asking for my money - but I’m feeling guilted into it.

*should I cancel/revoke my POA’s? I’m scared of taking on too much responsibility.* I work and study a lot and can’t deal with lawyers calling me all day and I’m scared tbh! My mom died by suicide 2 years ago and I am depressed and still grieving.

The thing is that my dad also gets mad when I ask questions, he’s very secretive, and won’t give me any info about finances. So idk what to do, any advice is appreciated. Thanks if you read this far."
"Hello all, 

I've posted in here a few times about my mom.  She has dementia and back in October of last year she had to go into a hospital because her break with reality stuck around (for many days) and she was posing a risk to herself and my father/her husband.  She spent 2 months in a geriatric psyche unit to get her stabilized as best as possible.  They did a good job and she's now in a memory care unit.  She's been there 2 weeks.  She had a visit from the doctor's office that visits that nursing home.  I got a call from the office wanting to talk about our request for a hospice referral.  It came as a total surprise to me because I had never even thought about hospice for my mom.  The poor RN that was talking to me seemed completely flustered and said she'd have the hospice people call and talk to me directly.  She also apologized because it was in the chart as though we requested it, but we obviously hadn't.  She had hospice call us because the NP had said it would be a good fit for my mom.  After talking to the hospice nurse, I agree.  Hospice is going to provide a lot of extra care for my mom that the facility isn't be able to.  She's getting a new hospital bed and a recliner for her room.  The nurse has already found some things that are treatable to make her more comfortable.  She has also called and talked to me more in the past 36 hours than the hospital or nursing home people ever have.  She is passionate about what she does and she does it well.  (I have kinda high standards because my mother in law is a nurse and used to be a hospice nurse)

I'm having very mixed reactions to all this.  My motto when it comes to life is always ""quality over quantity because what is quantity without quality? Suffering"".  I knew that nothing was going to bring my mom back to what she was before the dementia kicked in.   I'm no longer angry at my mom for not going and getting meds to help slow this down when I first talked to her about it.  I've moved past my anger at her for sending so many people money.  I know that she is my mom, but isn't at the same time.  (low key proud of the therapy work that's gone into that).  While I know I'm never getting my mom back, I guess I wasn't quite ready to not have her around any more.  There's a lot of grief in my heart for all the things she's going to miss, for all the things that I'm going to miss, for all the things my daughter is going to miss.  My daughter is only 5.  She'll maybe remember her grandma but not any of the fun stuff.  My mom is never going to be able to make cookies with her.  She's never going to teach her how to sew or garden or anything like that.    

I don't know why I'm posting this.  I'm not looking for advice.  I don't have any advice to give.   

I hope everyone is having a good night/day/afternoon/evening/morning.  We're all doing our best to do right by our parents.  Whatever you're doing is enough."
"My parents live in my apartment when I was overseas, but I am back now. The main reason for me moving back is to take care of them. They are in their 80s. I came back first, living with them now, and I am trying to buy an apartment for them so my family (husband and kids) can move back as well. Not to mention it has been very challenging to look for an apartment with them, at this point I feel like my mental health has some priority. I don't know how to deal with their daily life, mainly because of my mom, I think. Some main facts here:

1. I work from home. 
2. My parents fight often, over very little things, normally starting from my mom. For example, my dad forgot the vegetable they bought and the vegetable went bad. That makes her upset, my dad talks too loud, or she can't find one of her things.
3. They cook together. I don't know why because it generates half the conflicts for the day. It's more like my mom does the final cooking but instructed my dad to do things throughout the whole process. If my dad didn't follow her instruction well, 7 of 10 she will be mad. 
4. My mom can't hear very well. That's just another thing that triggered her to become mad. But most time it is because she doesn't hear what we say and she just distorted based on what she thinks. They booked an appointment next month, so I am seeing some hope here.
5. My mom sighs a lot from the time she wakes up and throughout the day. The way she sighs seems intentional, might be unconscious for her. It sounds like she is expressing she is not happy with life, not satisfied with things, disappointed with the situations. It bothers me a lot. It feels like we are the reasons causing all her dissatisfaction. That was her conclusion since I was a teenager: we made her mad or she won't be mad or she won't have a bad temper. We are the cause.

It has been 3 weeks since I moved back and I didn't find a good solution for dealing with this situation daily. I don't remember when was the last time that everything was just normal for one day, no fight or no her being upset. When she is mad, my dad either fights with her, so both are loud, or most of the case, everyone is quiet and they stop talking to each other. 

I am not confident to talk to them openly and I don't think I have any chance to change anything. My mom will be really mad for sure once I point out one little thing. Situations 2 and 3 have been for at least 30 years. What I want is to seek some way out when I still have to live with them until the housing problem is solved. 

Any suggestions? I am starting to meditate daily and didn't help too much. Thanks for reading."
"Mom's not dyeing anytime soon (pretty sure), doc just didn't know her. The services sound great, I'm worried my mom will freak out because of the common misconception that hospice means death. 

Lss. She's in a new nursing home and was progressing great, had a Subarachnoid hemorrhage from hitting her head. Doc told me it was minor, was released back to the nursing home same day with the hospice recommendation. She seems almost back to normal in 2 days. 

So happy for free extra care from hospice, and please correct my if I'm deluding my health concerns with her\*, but how do I make hospice sound good to her? Apparently they legally have to tell her and wear name tags that say hospice which seems horrible imo.

\*Always had an extremely low tolerance for pain. She makes weird noises regularly and is in-coherent when in extreme pain. So easy to see why and ER doc would think she's lost her mind."
"So basically, my mother has been in and out of physical therapy rehabs and the hospital since october. In the beginning of october, the whole house got really sick from my nephew, and my mom (58, but diagnosed with HBP, diabetes, heart failure, and anxiety/ depression) never recovered. Beforehand she was still able to wlak and do the basics to take care of herself, but her sugar was insanely high and she had some kidney complications, so her ability to walk is now and gone she has been in a urinary catheter ever since. Long story short, she came home for good about a week ago or so, and my oldest sister is coming over every couple of days to change and wash her. My brother and I live with her, but we both work so it is hard for us to do much for her aside from making sure she eats and emptying the foley bag. I change her diapers when I have the time to spare, but both myself and my brother work a lot (from home) but still,hard to find time. There was supposed to be a home health aid sent, but due to the nations unemployment problems, they havent had one to send us. 

&#x200B;

But the reason why I am making this post is because of my concern for my mothers' cleanliness. She has diarrhea throughout the day, everyday, and by the time I change her or when my sister changes her, the catheter is completely covered in poo. She is often covered, and it is so much that I feel it is impossible to get all of it, but Im worried abot her getting an infection just laying there like that. I dontknow what to do. I am 21 years old and cannnot afford to leave the household, nor do I really want to, but myself and my siblings cannot afford to put her intoa  home where she would receive round the clock care. My mother is also mentally kinda unstable, and does not think there is anything wrong with the situation at hand, She has not done any physical therapy at home since shes been home. She has the barest of function to her legs, and cannot even sit up by herself, or pull her legs back up on to the bed. The house constantly smells of poo, and I feel like I am going crazy. I just dont know what to do and I feel like I am too young and inexperienced to even think of anything else. We tried sending her back to the rehab for PT, and they sent her home saying there was nothing wrong with her and there was no need for her to be there.

&#x200B;

tldr: Mom is now bedridden and cant take care of herself, but we her kids cant really do it either, and now she is just laying in a catheter in poo for hours until someone comes to change her. I am worried this will put her at risk for infections and dont know what to do anymore."
"Hi all - my mother is 74 and recently broke her leg after a fall. She has been in short-term rehab but will be returning to her independent living apartment next week. I would like to get something that has fall detection in case she falls and can't get up so she can get help ASAP. I've looked into medical alert devices but she really doesn't want to pay $40+ per month for Bay Alert, Lively, etc. 

I've also considered the Apple Watch, which has no monthly fee but does need to be charged every night and I worry she will forget to put it on if she goes to the bathroom in the middle of the night. 

Any suggestions or recommendations? I prefer something that automatically detects falls and alerts me and 911, but am also open to something that lets her call for help without having her phone on her if she falls and can't get up but is still conscious."
"Hi all. Thanks for a great sub. I've gotten so many great ideas for help with my elderly father with mobility and cognitive issues stay independent/get help. I live out of state.


**Question**:  Currently my father gets Meals on Wheels delivered, but he won't eat the dinners because many of the meals are not food he eats (pork, shrimp, etc). He's losing weight and I'm worried about him. He does go to the grocery sometimes, but it's difficult for him to get food he likes because of mobility problems. He does cook for himself, but not very often. My late mom cooked for him during their 40-year marriage. 


My retired cousin (60f) was raised by my dad and says she'd love to come one day a week and cook a couple of meals for him. He likes her cooking.  She says she doesn't want any money, but I'd like to pay her something.  What do you think is reasonable or appropriate?  (She lives in a MCOL city and doesn't drive, so I would pay for her Uber/Lyft of ~$25 as well.) I was thinking $30 and paying for the grocery supplies, but I wonder if that's too little or too much?  


Thanks for your help! 

(I'm not looking for other ideas about how to get food to dad.  We've tried grocery delivery service and door dash, but dad really only likes to eat when its a home cooked meal)"
"For years now, only two things have filled my dads days:  (1) caring for my mom; and (2) on the weekends, gambling at a local casino.  My mom is now hospitalized for probably 1-2.5 months, and he isn't allowed to visit due to covid restrictions.  He won't go to the casino by himself (thankfully) but this leaves him with ... absolutely nothing.  His hearing isn't wonderful, and his vision and internet savvy is kind of limited.  He can use email, and check stock prices, and I'm not sure how much else.  He is cognitively pretty darn close to what he always was, with just generalized decline.  Physically, he can walk well and drives himself places (which I hate, but he does it.)  His fine coordination isn't great, so he isnt likely to get into any forum type activities, but he can manage to type well enough to use the internet at a basic level.  He is a former stockbroker, and has some continuing interest in financial stuff, and during the season follows the Red Sox.  He has basically no surviving friends or family other than my brother and I and my kids.  Ideas I have:

(1) books:  he doesn't really read, but maybe if I help him find large print or audible books on his subjects;

(2) netflix etc:  he does not currently have \*any\* service.  Instead, they own like 200+ dvds, and my mom watches them again and again.  So I think he may have some bias against this, but if I help him through it, maybe I can get him started.  Searching/playing Netflix should be within his modest internet capability

(3) fantasy sports:  if only it was baseball season, perhaps a fantasy league would be within his abilities.  Perhaps it would be too complex anyway

(4) in person activities:  here, I have no real ideas.  He does not participate in any activities at the assisted living, and has disdain for most of them.  Nor does he seem to have any friends at the assisted living, most of them not being as sharp as he is.

I'm going to go visit him for a few days soon and would love any ideas you folks might have!"
"My father (81) has had his own business for 50 years. He refused to stop working and it’s now at the point where he cannot handle running it anymore (cognitively and physically). 
We basically made him close it down. We are in the process right now and it’s a complete mess (he doesn’t know what bills he pays, what the passwords are to stop payment, and more). 
My mom cannot handle his decline and spends her days yelling at him. I was on a 3 way call with my dad and the energy company to discontinue service at his office & she was screaming at him in the background! 
They refuse to move from their house which has too many stairs for my dad. We had an elder proof company come out & make recommendations for safety. Nothing has been done. 
My mom complains constantly that she has no help. When we make suggestions or try to help she refuses it. None of us live in the same city but we visit. 
I think she’s losing it. and I think my dad is being emotionally abused.  Mom refuses to get help - either physically with errands, driving my dad etc or emotionally with a therapist to support her."
"I'll try to sum up everything as best I can.  My parents have fallen off the wagon is the best way to put it.  I feel like there's not enough space to give all the details of the situation, nor can I really burden anyone on here to read through all of it.

How do you deal with parents who just refuse to do stuff for themselves?

I wish I could explain it all, but I know the underlying cause is deep seated depression for both of them.  Dad was diagnosed with Parkinson about 2-3 yrs ago and is going through ""stages of grief"" (depression anger, i think we're at the anger stage).  Mom was depressed before but this situation has only exacerbated it -and now she has even more resentment towards Dad, always saying ""I wish he wasn't sick"" and then being mad at him when he's having a bad day with his Parkinsons, as if he has control over it.  Mom doesn't want to be his caregiver, nor does she even want to take care of herself.  They constantly argue and bicker at each other too -full on yelling over stupid stuff in publci places like the grocery store or gas station -Stuff they NEVER would have done before.

I can't get into my siblings because we're all viewing the issue differently.  Mom and Dad seem to outright refuse to basic things for themselves.  Instead of eating breakfast they'll eat cookies.  Dad already had an issue with dehydration a month ago (was hospitalized), and just doesn't drink more.  They refuse to make their own doctor's appointments.  Mom needs PT to get into shape because she's been sedentary since she retired 7 yrs ago.  But she doesn't want to do anything to make herself better.  She's either too depressed and just content to let everyone do everything for her.

My siblings keep saying they need more help and care.  I'm done fighting with my parents over simple shit like eating breakfast, or a squared healthy meal, or going out to buy a pack of underwear for themselves.  None of us can afford to be their full time care takers, and nor are they physically at the point where they can't do anything (Dad can't drive but he is 100% capable to turn on a stove and cook oatmeal).  I'm tired of arguing with my brother (and his wife) on what to do.  None of us can afford to sit on hold for 45 minutes a rip trying to straighten out their insurance and HIPPA red tape.

I see a lot of this extra stuff my siblings doing as enabling them.  Because as much as I love my parents and they are GOOD people, they're also 100% content to wallow in their depression, and let everyone do stuff.  Or Dad gets mad at us of cutting the lawn, saying he'll do it, then never do it.  Mom's depression has led to her unwilling to do even simple tasks and COVID isolation furthered her to stayed isolated -and laziness.  Yes, its depression, but it is also 100% willful laziness.  I asked her today, why don't you go out and pick out some new clothes for yourself (literally hasn't bought clothes in 10yrs and everything has holes/ doesn't fit)?  Her response, ""Well, I think someone is..going to bop me on the head"" (which she is making up lies and excuses, and I say this with 100% confidence because this is 1000 conversations we've had about her doing stuff).  I will not deny elderly fears and stuff but she is making excuses and when you finally dig into the truth, it comes out that she's just doesn't want to.

I don't know what to do.  They need therapy.  They both need to want to get better themselves, not us doing it for them.  I can't make them go to the doctors, I can't afford to drop my life, nor can my siblings.  My one brother and wife just throw money at the problem, like buying gadgets is going to make them do anything, like it can't make them take a walk.  My other brother and wife beat the drum like we're all going to be their personal aids.  Assisted living is not safe nor affordable.  And aide might be possible, but again doesn't stop them from not cooking breakfast for themselves.  


I want my parents to get back on the wagon and want to be around for themselves.  I can't figure out what the solution is.  I feel like this situation is making me insane, but I have two good friends who's keeping me grounded.  How have any of you dealt with this situation?  I'm so sorry this is so long"
"Hello. As I (40F) have gotten older, I’ve realized how much emotional trauma my mother (68) has been carrying from her childhood, her young adult years, her unsupportive marriage (that she’s still in for almost 50 years) and from the loss of close family members. 

As I’ve interacted with her over the past few years, it seems like I’ve become less of a daughter and more of a therapist, where she divulged things about the family, my father (70), and really just stuff that I would be better off not knowing. 

My mom is retired doesn’t have any friends and has no hobbies. She doesn’t like to initiate things. She’s extremely shy, which is why, for the most part, I just let her talk and cry.

Despite a family history of dementia and Alzheimer’s, she still in her right mind with no major ailments (so thankful) but has no interest in pursuing anything to occupy her time, other than going out to your typical “boomer” discount or grocery stores to buy random things she doesn’t need. (My parents’ house is like an episode of hoarder’s.)

I’d like for my mom to go to therapy to talk with someone who can work through her past trauma and find healthier ways to deal with her emotions, but at 68, I’m wondering if she could still benefit. I’ve provided her with a list of potential therapists, and she attempted to call once, but didn’t follow thru with making the actual appointment.

My mom is the sweetest person that I know, but I find myself getting angry that she’s not interested in getting help or pursuing an interest in life. I’m not used to carrying anger in my heart. I just don’t want the burden of her family trauma passed on for me to carry, more so than they already are. (I need therapy myself!)

Has anyone had success in getting their older parent to go to therapy? If so, did it help them?

Thanks for your time."
"Update to [This previous post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/qxzbr4/how_to_bring_natural_death_earlier_than_usual/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

My granny is eating less amount of food now than usual and has been sleeping more. As of now she made me turn on TV in the middle of night. I told her it's over 1 AM but she kept repeating. I don't know from where she got this wish to watch TV as she didn't watched it for a past couple of days. 

She peed in her lower as well in her sleep.(2-3 times) At first I thought it's normal because even I leaked 💦 drops 2 months ago in sleep.

I read somewhere that before dieing, for a few days person may become energized. What are your thoughts?"
"My MIL and FIL both live with us due to a number of bad financial decisions and their house was practically falling down around them.  They have a hard time (well, I should say my MIL) letting go and accepting help.  We wanted to get someone to come in and help with laundry but they said no, we can do it.  A year has gone by and they have done like one load a week of essentials.  We discover they have scads of laundry piled up, so much so that I started doing it Sunday and I am only halfway done.  I went and bought bins and vacuum bags because, to me, if you haven't used it in a year, you might as well pack it up (I would give it away but....baby steps).  My FIL says, we can just leave it in the laundry room (um, nope) and my MIL says, I don't want to pack them, they will get wrinkled.  I have a low tolerance for nonsense so if by the time I am finished with the laundry and they don't have a solution to their own problem, I am going to pack them and put them in the basement (obviously they will never know, they sat in a dirty pile for a year). My question is, does anyone else have issues like this with their parents or in-laws?  It's like they can't accept that they can no longer do what they could and they are too proud to ask for help. It is quite frustrating!"
"please help me... I feel like sometimes I need therapy just to deal with my aging mom who also lives with us. this is just one example of the types of [conversations](https://imgur.com/a/CFik3VC) that leave me banging my head against the wall. I know I'm not alone so tell me how you handle this day to day without losing your own mind...

A little context... she needs me to take her to all her appts because she is too afraid to drive farther than 5 minutes from our house on her own. 😏"
"My parents are in great health and have transitioned to a community they love, and they would like me and my sibling to start learning a bit about their finances. They are proposing to give us their login information to their bank accounts so we can start to understand inflows and outflows and keep an eye out for anything out of the ordinary. They don't want to make us owners of the accounts. What are the best practices here? Multifactor authentication challenges immediately spring to mind as an issue, practically, but what else should we be thinking about medium term? We already have plans in place for end of life."
"My mother (62) is all about me having to read her mind or know she will change her mind. She will ask me do I want a certain dish, food, anything. She won’t say she wants it. Hell, she may not want it 100%, but needs a reason to get it. If she wants pineapple slices and not eat all of it, she asks me do I want pineapple slices? I say no. She says maybe she wants some and doesn’t want to eat all of it. She asks me do I want soda. She knows I don’t drink soda. She won’t tell me until hours later she wants soda. She says do you want to go to this store together? I say no. She yells at me maybe she wants to go. Is it her or her generation. She had me when 30. She has been like this and expecting me to read her mind and wants."
"Hello. 

I'm trying to figure out what, if any options, my father has. 

He is 70 years old and currently living with my wife and I. 

He is okay about 70 percent of the time, but gets dizzy spells and has multiple healthy/mental problems. 

About 2 months ago he passed out and ended up in the hospital for 2 weeks with a broken back and ribs. 

Luckily he has mostly healed from that, but still can feel dizzy which is what caused the ER visit. 

We worry about the bear future as we don't have the ability to care for him at home or much money. 

He is on Medicaid and gets a tiny amount of SSI every month. 

I know you don't always get what you want (especially with our financial situation), but they have a waiver program here so if you qualify for a nursing home you can stay in assisted living. I can't figure out how that all works and what it takes to qualify. 

Just thought I would try here since this group exists and maybe someone else is in Georgia. Thanks."
"My father-in-law seems to have some kind of dementia induced be a series of strokes. He's sometimes unable to do simple things (take his pills, even go to the bathroom). He's very low energy and spends a lot of the time staring into space. My mother-in-law can't quite accept the situation and seems to be badgering him to be more active. They have conflict, and he's been violent. My wife is scared that he'll do something really bad and either be arrested or seriously hurt her mother. They're both almost 80. They don't live in the United States, where we live, and they don't speak English.

I'm really not sure what the best course of action would be. My wife is considering visiting her parents to help, but their situation has always been somewhat tenuous, and she's worried that she'd end up fighting with her mother. It might be best for her father to be institutionalized, but neither of her parents seem open to the idea. We could try to bring them here, but I'm not sure if that's in their or our best interest.

Has anyone been in a similar situation before? Any thoughts as to how to handle this?"
"My father has extreme hearing loss and lives alone now my mother passed. He's very independent and mobile, but not hearing the door, the beeps from appliances, the phone, and other daily cues is a daily concern, not to mention my fears that he wouldn't hear a fire alarm. I'm looking into getting him connected with a service dog program to get a good assistance dog. He loves dogs but is not going to be able to train one himself, being in his 90s. Does anyone here have experience with service dogs? If you have input or suggestions of organizations that would be really helpful. We are in Northern California. I tried the veteran's assistance dog organization but they only serve the east coast. Thanks so much for any feedback

"My husband and I moved in with my mom in mid-2019 to help her with day- to-day living after she had a medium size stroke. At the time she didn't necessarily need a lot of care, but she couldn't drive due to her poor eye sight, and it was just easier to be there for her than to plan trips to her house several times a week because we lived over an hour a way at that time. She's been kind of going down hill ever since, growing weaker and her eyes sight and hearing and, her overall desire to do things steadily declined. (the more we do for her, the less she does for herself). Right now we believe she has just emotionally given up, but her body keeps going on. Her mother did the same thing.

Over the last few months my mom has shown significant cognitive decline. She rarely says anything any more and seems to lose focus easily. Like if you ask one question and then ask it in a different way or with more detail, she gets confused. Also, it takes her so long to answer simple questions I often think maybe she didn't even hear me. Within the last week she has had two episodes of  low blood pressure (which we have a doctor appointment for), but yesterday she took a shower while I was out running errands. (We had already agreed she wouldn't shower unless someone was home with her, but she either didn't remember or was being independent). She ended up sitting on the floor under running water for 3 hours until I got home. Thankfully she didn't break a hip or something.  We are getting her Life Alert now.

So that's our situation. Mom is on medicare and has a fixed income consisting of social security income and a very small monthly retirement disbursement. Her house payment is low and she has a substantial amount of equity, and a small savings account. We are in Colorado. Over the last 3 years with Covid, job loss, living off our savings, and especially giving up our own place and rent/housing prices rising so drastically, we don't have a lot of spare cash or much open credit.

We know nothing, and I really do mean nothing, about how to deal with this so I need to start educating myself on options.

1-Any advice for her care now and ideas for things that may arise in the future. I know I can google resources, but I would like to know what others have gone through. I find that the whole population of Reddit shows me things that I never knew could happen or existed, so stories are welcome.

2--Does anyone know where I could get some reliable legal advice regarding dealing with her finances. She has made her will, but that doesn't help me in dealing with things she can no longer make decisions for  now. Is there a particular type of lawyer I would look for? What questions should I ask?

3-One of my main concerns is mom being able to keep her house. I've heard that if she has significant medical bills, medicare would take her home to help pay for them. (with the great amount of equity she has, I believe that would be one of the first things they would do.) If they took her house, we may not be able to afford a home that would accommodate her. She can't climb any stairs and she's nearly blind and knows her way around this house. Mom having to go to a nursing home is my greatest nightmare. I was wondering if it's possible or wise to talk to her about putting the house in my name, so she'd always have a home no matter what happens to her medically and financially. Who would be able to answer questions regarding this? Lawyer or realtor?"
"This is not about anything my mom does “wrong.” It’s entirely about me not knowing how to deal with the feeling of seeing my mother declining.

She’s still physically and mentally healthy, as far as she and her doctors know. But she’s been the strongest, most confident, and self assured (dare I say stubborn and bull headed?) person I’ve known my entire life, and it is *so hard* to see worry and anxiety on her face about things that I didn’t previously realize were becoming hard for her.

I get short tempered that she asks for help, and I end up making her feel worse for it… It’s not because I don’t want to help her. It’s because I don’t want her to need my help. I want to talk to her about it, but I don’t know how to have a “Your looming mortality makes me feel and act shitty” conversation that gets my point across without making things worse.

Ugh… Has anyone dealt with this? Does anyone have suggestions for how I can address my own feelings and change my reactions to them?"
"I’m caring for my aging my mom. I currently live with her, however for my own well-being I am looking for my own place. My mother has COPD and is in (untreated) cognitive decline (she is in denial and becomes physically violent when any suggestions for memory care are made). She also has a Cluster B personality disorder. 
My mother has always talked aloud to herself, but now it’s a near-constant conversation that she has with herself. I have to wear headphones or have my white noise machine on all the time so that I’m not driven crazy. She also mutters and curses about me under her breath. Can anyone relate?"
"It's hard. I'm learning to gain a little more acceptance of mom's late stage dementia, the paranoia , but it's so hard. Three days of visits and I can't go there today. I just can't."
"Me (37) father (75)

Hello,

I don't know where to post this so I am doing it here. It's related to aging parent who pressurises me every time. I am getting extremely annoyed and very tired of his nonsense. For context, I have been living abroad since the  past 4 years and while I admit it's been hard and a lot of struggle, I  enjoy my space and the peace that has come from it after having gone  through some very traumatic experiences in the country of origin.

For  context, I lost my mother very recently. Anyway, ever since my move, my dad would ever so often put pressure here and there  and now today on the call he did it again. My dad has done this before too during my mum's  hospitalisations, asked me to leave everything and come back and take  care of my mother. Now that she's gone, he has started this. I am  extremely disappointed and very angry and am crying. I am shocked that  this is happening again. I just want to live in peace. For context I  am not married but that doesn't mean I don't ever want to. I  hate everything. I am so ... sad. This has killed all the motivation in  me and I do suffer from anxiety and depression (diagnosed medically) so  it takes a lot to actually be full of energy. Also to be noted, the family was never a happy one and extremely sad and depressed. He ignored my mother for her whole life and I was just someone that existed. I avoided him as he is temperamental and abusive and a huge hoarder. It was always disgusting the house. Nothing would be thrown. There are many other things freedom in that country and the house been non existant.

I  don't know what to do anymore. I am tired of fighting and the  expectations from my dad makes me want to just give up on  everything.

Please if you have  suggestions on how to deal with communicating with him it would be  great. I cannot go no contact with him, I mimimise already my contacts  with him but whatever. Also to note communication or talking to him  doesnt help.

EDIT: Changed certain wordings for better clarity."
"I just need to vent. I haven’t slept in 3 days, and can’t really eat. Mom went into the ER Thurs and has some sort of obstruction, so far it’s not improving and she’s in pain. She is my dad’s primary caretaker (he has aides 9am-9pm, with varying levels of attentiveness). Overnight my sister and I had to learn his routines, pill schedule and how to change ostomy. I had never done toileting care before this. Spending overnights at his house so he’s not alone. 

I work full-time remotely and am managing a large project, sister works onsite 2 hrs away so I have to be there most of the time. Husband is not great with these things, he tries though. Completely overwhelmed with my dad and terrified about my mom and what’s to come. I can’t stop googling horrible things. Thanks for listening."
"My husband's mother (78) and stepfather (68) live in Montgomery County Maryland in a condominium that they own. Husband's mother has COPD and has had multiple hospital stays over the past 6 months as well as numerous days-to-weeks long stays in in-patient physical therapy. Due to a broken knee, she cannot walk. 

Stepfather is an alcoholic whose problem has recently spiraled out of control. He can barely walk or stand due to edema in his legs and probably organs in failure. Over the past weeks we have noticed a marked increase in erratic, dementia-like behavior and confusion. I believe this is a result of his late-stage alcoholism. He will not discuss his medical problems with us in any detail so we only know that his liver and gall bladder are not OK. He is not a relative so we can't get any info on him. 

Neither of them have cell phones or email and are very difficult to reach by phone. We are 3000 miles away. There is no family in the immediate area. After the hospital was ready to release MIL we called the hospital social worker and told them to find her a bed in skilled nursing. Under no condition can she go home. So that is a stop-gap solution for her. 

But I don't know what to do for him. An Adult Protective Services case has been opened on him. The investigator was supposed to visit him on Friday but ""ran out of time"" and now, due to the holiday weekend, will not visit him until Tuesday. He is in urgent need of being admitted somewhere but I do not know who or where will take him or what treatment he will submit to. He told me only a week ago that he would not leave his home but the social worker at MIL's hospital said he asked her if he could go to the skilled nursing facility with his wife. Every conversation with him is a different narrative and a different bizarre interpretation of his reality. 

The condo is hoarded, I am told. Hallways are not clear. Not a single chair in the house where you can sit. Beer cans and squalor. I was in that condo just two years ago (Nov. 2019) and it was a neat as a pin. He wants me to set up 24/7 home health care but social services told me that was a dead end because of the hoarded home and because they will not work with him while intoxicated. Is this true?

My husband says we need to just wait until Tuesday and let the county investigator do their thing. But I can't sleep at night for fear that he will not even make it through the weekend. I am willing to fly out there but I need a game plan before I get on a plane. I don't want to fly across the country and potentially expose both of them to covid without knowing what I can possible accomplish. And, before you ask, no, we do not have power of attorney. For him or for her. And no one else does either. 

tl;dr: Alcoholic stepfather may be in a slow-motion medical crisis. APS has not taken any action yet and I cannot come up with an plan of attack. Is there something else I can do? Is there a home health aide that I can call who will take this on?"
"I’ve been caring for my grandfather since July 2020. He’s been doing very well and independent. Since Christmas he’s had some forgetfulness, but one day this week he really struggled and didn’t realize who I was or what was going on. He locked himself in his room. Fell down and luckily only suffered some cuts and Bruises. However now he’s totally out of it cognitively. He’s in the hospital now, but I am on my own and I know that I cannot care for him in an altered state. 

This is killing me though. The thought of him never going home again breaks my heart. His last dinner at home was sandwiches. Everything makes me sad. I just don’t think home is safe anymore.

TLDR I am suddenly having to move my grandfather into assisted living and it is breaking my heart."
"90 year old MIL fell about a week ago going from her bed to toilet. She called in middle of night for husband to help her. Yes, she lives alone although we have tried to hire someone to help her. She claims they are robbing her in her sleep. So husband and his brother have been going over and care for her 24/7. I can’t due to medical issues as I can’t pick her up if she falls. So she has gotten progressively worse. She’s hallucinating talking to people in corners that are not there. So after going to her primary, they say dangerously low sodium and rake her to ER. ER says actually not horribly low but she has Covid. This is antivax Nanny. No shortness of breath but she calls constantly telling me she’s dying and some imaginary person in the corner of her room will come home to help her. That I need to rescue her. I hope this makes sense as it is late and she just called. I honestly can’t deal with it tonight and it will take a while for a home health worker to come over. I’m mad that she listened to some uninformed a$$hole on TV and refused vaccination because it might change her DNA and insert tracking device. Not true but, So what, you’re planning on reproduction at 90? They want to track you going to church?"
"My dad lives with me. He thinks he keeps things straight and pretty clean but that is not the actual case at all. 

I've started to do a weekly cleaning session in his living spaces but I'm appalled at the damage he's done every time I enter his spaces. There's always unknown substances on every wall or door. There are cups or plates with mold. Lets not even discuss the bathroom. And soooooo much more. 

My dad gets very defensive anytime I clean something or even ask about anything related to cleanliness. I'm really not trying to embarrass my dad, I just want his space to be safe and my investment in the house to be protected. How do I talk to him about his habits without embarrassing him (and maybe also keep my sanity in the process)?"
We're in the midst of deciding between assisted living and living home with a home health aide. Living at home gives you some benefits like familiarity but assisted living gives you other benefits. Has anyone made this decision and have a preference? Thanks.

My 79 yo mother has had 2-3 UTIs per year for the last 3-4 years. Her GP has been keeping an eye on some lab values, and something triggered her to refer my mother to a nephrologist (kidneys). This is good. 


The nephrologist referred my mother to a urologist, but my mother refuses to do it. Not good.  She saw a urologist in the 1960s who tried stretching my mother's urethra and it was traumatic for my mother. 


She has an appointment with the nephrologist next week, it's supposed to be a follow-up on the urologist that she didn't see. I told her that she has to work up the trust to tell her nephrologist about her traumatic event from so long ago and how it's preventing her from doing what's expected. I told her that if she hides information from her doctors, they can't provide best possible care. She acknowledges what I'm saying but she's willful and forgetful, a bad combination.


Anyone else have similar experience? I'm 1,000 miles away from mom, being there frequently is not an option."
"Hello,   


I am considering tapping into my home equity, but I am a little confused by the numerous options. Is there any recommended tool or a website that can help navigate?   


Thanks a lot!"
"My FIL had a few surgeries in the last three months.  Since then, he’s deteriorated mentally a lot.  His neurologist suggested that the anesthesia may still be affecting him and it could take a few extra months for it to fully get out of his system and that the best thing for him is to activate his brain more by reading and stuff like that.

Problem is, he’s basically blind.  Reading is a non-starter.   He also has some very shaky hands so things that would involve more than a minimum of manual dexterity would probably frustrate him more than anything else.

What are some things he could try doing to keep his brain going that wouldn’t rely on those limitations?"
"To add another caregiver to help take care of mom. We're at a point where she is in pain during diaper changes and can barely tolerate rolling over to be cleaned and to have her diaper replaced. I am terrified I am going to hurt her and feel like I'd like to hand this one to someone with better (as in, any...) training.

I am completely exhausted emotionally from the past 8 years of incrementally more and more caretaking up until this point - she's bedridden, about 90% demented, talking gibberish, though today has been very weirdly OK and lucid. Angry, mean, anxious, does nothing at all to help herself and only complains. I do understand it, I'm going to be plenty pissed off at everyone, life and whatever supreme being should this be my end of life, as it may be. But as a caretaker, this endless assault of negativity is what chips away at my ability to hold onto my patience and compassion for her. I do NOT have endless reserves of either.

6 months ago I started this bedridden/incontinent/diaper changing journey with her thinking, I have a moral and ethical obligation to take care of my mother. This past week, I've started wondering about my obligation to my own mental health and the health of my family, my marriage, my parenting, my child. Is it wrong to think instead, I have a moral and ethical obligation to ENSURE SHE IS WELL TAKEN CARE OF?

UGH.

thanks for reading!

Update: we told mom we were going to try someone for 4 hours a day 7AM to 11AM, so I can take my kid to school without stressing about mom being alone. She has thrown a 5-day temper tantrum, won't speak to me, won't Look at me (and I am feeding her and changing diapers), and now tells my sister that ""We"" are Terrible and take Terrible care of her. It's lovely.

"Just found this group, so ""hello!"" I have a question about an ethical dilemma my mom (73) is dealing with related to my grandma (90). 

**SUMMARY (TL;DR):** Would you allow your 90yo grandma, who has mild-moderate dementia and lives alone on a semi-remote acreage, to continue to have her small (<10 lbs) dog live with her if she is not taking care of it? 

\*\*\*\*\*\*

**MORE CONTEXT:** My mom and uncle recently convinced my 90yo grandma to move to an assisted living facility, one in which she can live semi-independently. 

My grandma has a 10yo small dog to whom she has a very strong bond. My mom got her the dog, and it's been great for grandma and has been her companion since my grandpa died 10 years ago. Yet, my grandma has really neglected the dog's health in recent years (feeding it table scraps, not giving it its medication, etc.). Now, the dog is severely overweight, has a thyroid problem, badly needs its teeth cleaned, etc. My mom helps out where she can with the dog's care, but cannot ensure that grandma, who has mild-moderate dementia, will take proper care of the dog.

While residents at this assisted living facility (ALF) can have pets, my mom has opted to keep the dog temporarily to get it to lose some weight, get its teeth cleaned, and back on its medication. Grandma DEMANDED to have the dog with her. She threw *fits* at the facility about being there without the dog (and being there in general). So much so, that my mom and uncle decided that it wasn't going to work and brought grandma back home. *I felt they should have continued to keep her at the ALF and worked with staff to help her transition, however, I am not a ""decider"" in her care.* 

Fast-forward to this weekend when they were moving her back home, Grandma thought she was coming back to her familiar home and her dog. However, my mom has decided to keep the dog until her teeth are cleaned...or at least that is what she told Grandma. But, mom has told me that she doesn't think Grandma should have the dog anymore because ""she can't even take care of herself much less a dog that needs special care."" So, now my Grandma is at home alone and isolated every day without even her dog...although my mom and uncle stop by frequently so she almost always has someone visit each day.

Also a side note...Grandma thinks everything is my mom's fault and says/makes all kinds of very mean accusations toward my mom. Some of you might be in the same boat, hearing phrases like: *You just want me dead! They're trying to kill me! She just wants my money!*

Here is where I get stuck, though: I am an animal lover and am concerned about the dog's welfare, of course, but it also seems like keeping the dog from Grandma is somewhat cruel...and perhaps, in part, my mom subconsciously ""punishing"" Grandma. Is this situation as ethically ambiguous as I think it is or is the ""right"" answer very obvious to others?"
"a month because the only place that has an opening in the Philadelphia area that isn't over $6k a month is a little over $4k a month so they want to divide the cost among us. In PA medicaid doesn't pay for assisted living places only nursing homes. The only nursing homes with open spots are either too expensive or they're depressing places like one where the owner was arrested because an elderly woman with dementia was allowed to wander around by herself and she fell over a ledge and died or a place where they don't require the workers to be vacinatted and over half the patients have died from Covid. My mother currently lives on her own and she is mostly self sufficient but she needs help bathing and changing her diaper and putting on her oxygen mask before she goes to sleep.

She is alone during the day then goes to my sister and BIL's place at night so she is around people then my sister takes her home, gets her changed and put on her mask. We haven't been able to find anyone willing to work 2-3 hours at night to help her and my sister is stressed out doing it every night. They want to put her in an assisted living facility but they don't take medicaid so we have to pay for it. My mother gets SSI so that leaves around $3k a month. My sister and BIL want me to commit to paying $500 a month indefinitely to help pay for it. I'm feeling resentful because this is the financial status of my siblings.

Sister & BIL - tenured professors at Ivy League college. Earn around 500k a year. Most important have a full pension so guaranteed income for life. They won an expensive house but don't know how much the mortgage is. 2 kids who will need college tuition.

Brother 1 - lawyers who owns his own law firm. We don't know how much he makes but he owns several buildings so can't be doing that bad but guess the income for a lawyer who owns his own firm can vary. 2 kids.

Brother 2 - PhD scientist working for pharm company. Earns around 200k + bonus but is depressed and always claims he is worried about being fired. No kids.

Between the 3 of them they earn over $1M a year. 

I'm single, living a high COL city, don't earn that much, don't own a home or car and have almost nothing for my own retirement.  My current rent is 1k a month so they're asking me to pay 50% more for rent each month if I now have to pay $500 a month for my mother. How much do you think I should contribute? I have almost nothing for my own retirement, no spouse, no home, no tenured job with a full pension for life. Am I wrong to be annoyed? Any feedback is appreciated."
"Situation: Mom with moderate vascular dementia in rehab (until tomorrow). She got into rehab, via the hospital, after breaking her pelvis 3 times in 4 months and delirium caused by not taking one of her medications for about 6 months. Delirium has cleared, leaving mostly the dementia, along with pre-existing OCD, anxiety, vicious determination, and a tendency to value feelings more than facts going back decades. 

Discharge plans state her needs are 24/7 coverage for physical assistance (hands on for some activities, standby for others). 

Factually: she cannot get 24/7 coverage at home because 1) the home healthcare services are not sending folks to private homes right now because of COVID and 2) She has fired or been fired by 19 aides over the past 5 months. We can't get reliable coverage. 

Other factors: She only has one person able to work for her 8 hours/day for 5 days/week (right now; the aide sometimes has to take off to do other things). She physically does not have the money for 24/7 personal aides for more than a few years.  We paid a deposit on an assisted living facility, that she agreed to, but is now refusing. Brother is in same town; I live 300 miles away and have a few issues with physical ability to get there. 

After days of explaining and re-explaining and encouraging and listening and validating and having to repeat ourselves over and over, my brother and I have said we will not assist with her moving back into a dangerous situation (i.e. her house without coverage). She is insisting she is going to have her aide drive her home. The social worker says they will have to let her go if she insists - she is scheduled for discharge tomorrow. 

Enter the car-crash imagery. It's only a matter of time. 

I'd welcome any ideas about how to handle the things likely to happen  -- from panicked phone calls to checking on her to make sure she's not lying on the floor to managing calls from the aide who wants us to ""get her out of the middle"" of the conflict. 

Thanks for listening."
"So a few months ago, I was named my dad's guardian. My parents are separated, my mom living across the country and wanting nothing to do with my dad at all; so I was nominated by a social worker.

My dad's been in the hospital five times this past year for leg-related issues. He likes to sit in his char and drink and never move, and lets the filth accumulate around him. The house is decaying, etc. It's so bad, in October he was hospitalized with >!maggots in his leg wound. !<

That's when I was named guardian. I honestly thought the best thing for him was to move him to independent living. He's only 65. The problem is, he's super overly attached to our house, even in its decaying state. It was his dream to live in this neighborhood. Taking him out will probably actually kill him, even though letting him stay is also killing him. My mother finally got involved long enough to say she thought he should stay in the house, and deserves one more chance.   


So...I have to figure out how to clean the house well enough for a home-helper and also make repairs on the house....all from another country. Dad's in the US, I'm in Canada, and not super close either. I can't exactly quit my job to help him full time, I'm still paying off my US student loans. I have no idea how to handle any of this, and no idea why the judge thought it was just fine to have someone from another country managing this. I feel stuck, and frustrated because neither parent is being of any help."
"Hello everyone, 

My whole family has lived outside of our home country for more than 30 years,  and my parents are now in their late 60s (my mom) and mid 70s (my dad). My parents are financially stable, but unfortunately their plans to 'settle' in a their home country for their remaining years is no longer possible - and now they have to choose between two options that aren't ideal. 

I'd appreciate any general advice from those who have aging or elderly parents, and specifically any guidance and it is now up to my sibling and I to help them decide where to live. 

Here is the full story : 

My parents come from what was, at the time, a war-torn country, and it's the only country they are citizens of. Because of the war, they found work and lived for 30+ years as expatriates in a very transient country that I'll call Country A. My sibling and I both now live in Country A as working adults - but we are not citizens, and there is no way to attain citizenship so none of us will ever truly 'belong' or have full rights here. 

Retiring in Country A was not legally an option for any non-citizens at the time (it is now though), so my parents had no choice but to leave, which was very difficult for them after three decades in one place. The war ended in their home country by this point and it had become relatively stable, so they retired there and tried to reconnect with their relatives and their roots. 

Unfortunately they had only a few good years before the situation in the home country became absolute shit as it was plunged into an economic crisis. The healthcare system cannot cope, electricity is not reliable, and there is major inflation and issues with banks. Needless to say, they can no longer remain there so they are back to square one figuring out where to spend their remaining years and feeling very stressed out.  

Option 1: As I mentioned, they can now move to Country A, which is where my sibling and I both live and we are both married. It is expensive but safe and has everything they could possibly need. The only problem is my sibling and his partner expect to stay in this country for another 3-5 years, and my partner and I cannot commit to any time period because we both work on a project basis and my partner's line of work does not allow for remote work i.e. if a project comes up in another part of the world, we will have to move. So my parents could move here and they would have us to lean on emotionally and would have a decent enough social life, but there is no guarantee how long that would last, and we are the only reason they are considering it. If we leave, they would consider leaving too, which means they would be well into their 70s and 80s, trying to establish a home again... or they would stay here without us, but not sure how likely that is. I should add that the residency they would get here would be subject to renewal (or - very unlikely - rejection) every five years, so that is another risk. They would need to rent + furnish a place. 

My mother is emotionally fragile at the moment and prefers to stay here because it means even though she doesn't know how long will it last, at least it's a good few years with her children in the same city, and she's pretty attached to us. 

Option 2: They have a summer holiday home in a safe European country (Country B) with good healthcare and other facilities. It was purchased mainly as an investment ages ago and is small but livable. They are not citizens but can become permanent residents because they are homeowners, which would give them and us peace of mind because that would mean they can stay there as long as they want. They have a few friends there - but no relations - and the place gets pretty dead in the winter months. It's a 3-4 hour flight from where my sibling and I are, so visiting every few months would not be an issue. My father prefers this option because he doesn't want to be tied to his kids. 

And now we have to decide between these two . I should add that my parents don't know how to communicate with each other so they can't even discuss things properly, let alone come to an agreement, so they want us to make the decision for them even though they are both of sound mind. 

It is really sad seeing them feel lost at their age after working hard all their lives, I just want them to be in an environment that is comfortable and to not have to keep uprooting themselves... but also not sure if being away from family is a good idea. They do not have health issues right now thankfully, but there is a history of dementia on my father's side. 

I should also add that for the long term, a retirement/assisted living home is not the norm in our culture and we would prefer them to live with either myself or my sibling if anything should happen to either of them. 

Sorry for the really long post. If you made it to the end, I'd really appreciate any thoughts, ideas, suggestions, sharing of your experiences etc... Thank you!!!"
"Would welcome any guidance about what to do in this scenario (pt = aging parent who has had a severe stroke)

- currently pt needs 1-2 CNAs to do things like transfer between bed and wheelchair, rehab place thinks best case outcome is still going to require 1 person 
- pt will need assistance dressing from waist down
- pt is unable to safely use a commode, even with assistance (at the moment. Goal is that possibly they could with someone there to assist with transfer and keeping them upright on commode during elimination)

Here’s the issue, though. Pt has little to no money, but is just above the Medicaid income guideline due to a pension payment, so doesn’t qualify for a lot of services. 

How do we as a family begin to find help for pt? In home care could be $50-100k/year, we’re told, depending on hours and transfer needs which is just honestly impossible.

Most skilled nursing facilities (for post hospital rehab) are 100 days MAX with Medicare and then to remain at a place, many we’re finding are private pay — which pt cannot, at all — or Medicaid, which pt doesn’t qualify for because of being just slightly above the number. 

Does anyone have experience or hope to share? We are going to talk to places like Elderwerks and Silver Connections as well but welcome ideas and insights to help inform how we proceed with helping pt get safe care that we as a family can afford."
"My (24/F) mother was officially diagnosed with dementia a month ago. She stays at home 24/7. I’m an only child with a job, relationship, and I also love with my mother so I now do all of the chores, cooking, cleaning, groceries, laundry, etc. My mother only makes $1,000 from social security retirement. I am sole breadwinner. The issue that I’m facing is that my mother sleeps about 16 hr all day. She keeps talking about wishing this pandemic were over but she’s waking up in the night and coming to my room to vent and not allowing me to sleep anymore.

Any suggestions? How could I maybe convince her into going to a senior daycare? I’m in the process of using the dementia diagnosis to the fullest so resources are coming but they’re not coming quick enough. I will not go broke for my mother and every day I’m close to disappearing and letting her get evicted and living on the hard streets of NYC. My patience is growing thin and I want to live my 20’s to the fullest without her in my life."
"Hi all. Like the title says, my parents (divorced) and my mother in law are all in their mid 70s and were pretty irresponsible with their money and are getting close to the time where they won't be able to  care for themselves anymore and I have no clue on what to do on what to do after that.  My brother and I make a decent living and have been helping my parents financially and my wife and I have been sending my mother in law a few hundred dollars every month to help with bills, but I'm not sure we are going to deal with the situation when things get worse.

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks.  


Edit to add more info:  


My mom lives in Charlotte, NC in a house that is paid off. My brother and I pay her property taxes and send her $300 a month to help with other expenses. She is overweight, has heart issues and has lots of other pain.  


My dad lives in Asheville NC and is a veteran. He is still completely independent, but his mother had dementia and his memory is going as well.  


My mother in law currently lives in Portland but my wife and I will be helping her with a downpayment for a house near us when we move to upstate NY this year. We send her $300/month. She has an annuity and a bit left over from the sale of her condo a few years ago."
"TL;DR: Does anyone know if their is a checklist of what to do or consider moving a somewhat mentally ill / depressive parent who owns a home worth $120k-$180k with maybe $60k in cash / other assests from Florida to New Jersey to a 55+ community?  Would she have to continue to work?  Or what to consider if she stays in Florida?  Is it better for old folks without a real retirement down in Florida, or up in New Jersey?  Am I thinking about this the right way?  What services are there out there to help people figure this stuff out?  I am making an appointment to talk to an estate lawyer.  What else do I need to do?

  The following is the too long stuff.  Even if no one reads it, it feels good to write it down.

  My dad was diagnosed with an aggressive cancer, and is on hospice.  Mom is 72 and lives in Florida.  She worked all her life as a graveyard shift ICU nurse in an inner city, and now a home care nurse for the elderly.  My dad worked as a union carpenter until he got sick, and then went on disability.  He still has a very small pension and supplemental health insurance.  He is currently bed ridden.

  I live in New Jersey.  Eighteen years ago, I helped them sell their house in NJ and move down to Florida to a house they inherited from my grandparents.  They have issues.  They were almost hoarders up here, I had to buy a huge dumpster to remove most of their accumulated stuff.  They are now messy, but I wouldn't call it hoarder level.  Dad has/had a bad prescription pain killer problem somewhat as a result of an earlier disease, and somewhat as a result of just who he was.  I kept them at an arms distance these past few years for fear of what it might do to my kids.

  Mom is depressive.  She gets quiet and introverted.  She had a son when she was young (18ish) with a really bad dude, gave the boy away for adoption, and I think it messed her up.  She had me with my dad a decade later.  That and all the death and night shifts working.  In the past two decades, my Mom and I never talked on the phone or in person for more than a minute to three minutes usually when my dad will force her on the phone.  It's not that I wouldn't, she just stops the conversation.  She has never been nice to any of my friends or family.  I don't know if it was working so much in city ICU on the night shifts, or if her personality drew her to that environment.  When I was younger, she would get episodes where she went crazy and write on the walls of our house or go screaming down the streets at night.  When my then-girlfriend now-wife went to visit with me down to Florida my mom introduced her to the neighbor as ""one of my son's girlfriends.""  No name.  We had been dating a year, and I dated maybe 7 girls over 7 years with long breaks in between and never more than one at a time.

  I have many such stories... but it wasn't all bad.  I remember some nice moments growing up.  Bobbing for apples at Halloween or her rubbing my stomach when I felt sick.  And mom put up the bulk of the money to pay for me to go to a private high school, and helped dad start a business that I worked at during high school.  It never made much and closed after I stopped working there, but I learned a lot which helped me later.  My parents paid for myself and friends of mine to go on nice vacations to Disney World, the grand canyon, and the Florida keys.  Dad would take in people down on their luck and they would live with us.  He had good friends and did scouts with me, and took me to lots of places.  But he had a selfish streak too.

  I joined the national guard at 18 and was pretty much self sufficient after age 22 living on my own, paying for college and grad school, and my own place.  Around that time I helped them move.  I almost feel like I moved them because I found a buyer, rented the van, packed them up, got them down there, and unpacked them.  Part of the disease he had made him sensitive to temperature swings.  I noticed the change in him down there.  He took fewer pills for a little while.

  My parents have trouble managing their money.  When I moved them, they had the proceeds of their house, and another house from my grandparents free and clear.  Later, they got a few tens of thousands of dollars from my other grandparents inheritance.  

  They would get in these wars with each other where my dad would buy anything he wanted to buy (a fishing boat or a motorcycle), and then my mom would say well if he can spend then why can't I?  Then a few months later they would switch who started it.  It would be like an angry game between them where they both lost.  After all these years, I don't know what they actually have aside from what they say.  My wife would hear all that and warn me to never get our finances mixed up in theirs.  I warned my dad that I didn't want to be in their will, I just wanted them to have enough to be happy for the rest of their days.  I guess he just heard his days.

  I am going down there in two weeks.  I am going to look at their expenses and assets, and help them sell things and ask my mom what she wants to do moving forward.  I think they are signed up for medicare and social security, but my mom maybe takes partial payments because she has always wanted to work.  I need to see the statements to really understand.

  She can't come live with me.  She is incredibly cold and emotionally distant.  She hasn't blown up for a while, but I know what she's capable of.  I won't put my kids (age 5 and 8) thru that.  I can't.  But without my dad, I don't think if my mom can function down there alone.  I know that she will either shut down or have episodes down there.

  From what my dad says, it sounds like they might have some positive assets.  Everything I know is from my dad and anecdotal, ""I think I have"" and ""I'm sure there is"".  They have multiple bank accounts, and nothing is organized.

 One time before I had kids he got into a motor cycle accident going cross country in Pennsylvania basically because he had taken too many pain killers.  I got to see him get intubated (fun) and almost die, and the doc came to me with his bags and bags of medications and said to me, ""Your dad has a serious problem.""  He came to the razors edge of death, and I was nearly broken by the experience.  Into the second month, mom came up from Florida with a trash bag full of bank account statements and bills.  At least now he's awake to help me answer questions and get them set up.  We became so much more distant after that experience.  I've been dreading this for years.  It kills me to think they may suffer, and I want to help.

  The house is maybe worth $120-140k.  That's not a professional opinion, just my guess, zillow says $188k.  They own two cars, and a small boat.  They paid for a large solar panel system and solar hot water heater.  They have $40k spread out over different bank accounts.  But I don't know if they have credit card debt.  Knowing their history, they do.

  My wife and I save a lot.  She comes from a family that also saves a lot.  Her mom and dad worked hard for years and years.  Her dad worked as a contractor 6 days a week, 12 hour days.  He's a very honorable, hard working dude who would lose sleep at night if something wasn't done right.  Her mom worked for years and years as a respiratory therapist.  When I met her dad, he slowed down to 5 days a week 10 hour days.  

  My wife and I don't take vacations except for camping in the woods with the kids or once and a while trip to nearby amusement parks.  We paid off our house.  We maximize our contributions to our retirement, and otherwise invest.  We told her parents spend all your money or leave it to our kids for their education if they feel like they must.  Or help her sister out who doesn't have as much.  I don't feel like it's fair to my wife to ask her to support my mother financially.  Maybe to some extent, but I can't ask her to go into debt for her.  I guess the question is what's the extent?

  My mom won't talk to me very long, so it's hard to get a concurring sense from her what things are like.  She asked me for money.  I asked her how much?  She said a few thousand.  I said, ""How many?""  $2000.  I don't think she actually knows, and I don't want her to think I'm an open checkbook.  I know that sounds horrible.  But I'd rather first see what their finances look like, and then figure out what their shortfalls look like on the month to month.  If I knew, okay Mom needs $Xk to get her set up, and that will last her years and years.  But it's hard to understand it, and what the future looks like.  I'm not trying to be greedy.

  Not that it would be ideal, but there are a few 55+ communities around me where houses are in the $85k to $150k range.  I could visit her a few times a week.  If she had an episode or trouble, I could help her transition.  Some of the communities are 12 minutes away.  Maybe help her go to therapy if her insurance covers it?  Maybe if I knew what she would need and what the real financial ask was I could help her?

  Is it better for old folks without a real retirement down in Florida, or up in New Jersey?

  Am I thinking about this the right way?  What services are there out there?  I am making an appointment to talk to an estate lawyer."
"Is there a very simply way to enable video calls to an aging parent who has never used the internet and who cannot even navigate a computer mouse or a mobile phone?  


I was thinking about getting her an tablet with a sim card but whatsapp has no official app for it and it requires a phone number. When using the web version it requires you to scan a QR Code and I feel like that is already too complicated. Also I'm not sure if topping up a prepaid card for the mobile data will be too complicated too but my mother is mentally ill, lonely and I live a considerably distance away from her and I can't spend too much time with her to maintain my own mental and physical health but I feel like it would be nice for her if she could atleast do some video calls."
"I’m looking to move out of state for greater stability and job prospects but I’m worried about what that would mean for my parents. I plan on overseeing their care and have been thinking about the limitations that entails- not being able to drive them to appointments, not being able to check in on them at a moment’s notice, not doing their grocery shopping, etc. 

On one hand, I need to build my own life (currently live with them in a high cost area, just finished my certifications and looking for work). I think leaving is good for me personally, but what happens when I build my home out of state and can’t help them maintain basic care and stability. 

They’re not at the point of needing help yet but 10 or so years down the line they will be. I plan on saving and looking into programs to subsidize their care. Just wondering if leaving would cause more issues for me down the line, or if it’s dumb for me to build my life around (probable) hypotheticals/outcomes?

Just looking for perspective I guess

*edit* Thanks everyone for your advice, support, and perspectives. Reading through the comments quelled a lot of anxiety for me and I feel a lot better over the prospect of leaving. 

For context, I’m in my 20s, living in California but looking to move to Oregon. I will start looking deeper into the resources that were noted and begin the process of educating myself on the matter but also live my own life. Thanks everyone!"
"MIL with dementia gets up in the middle of the night and wakes up FIL. Both are tired the next day. Been going on for a while. Has anyone had to deal with this? I wonder if the doctor would approve a cup of Nyquil or  Benadryl, etc. to try to break the cycle and get them a good night sleep."
New here and I hope someone can give me some suggestions. I live across the country (Canada) from my mother and she lives in a very small town. She is very cautious about interactions due to Covid but her smoke alarm battery changed. Does anyone know if there is a resource for things like this? Would the fire department do this?
"Hoping someone has experience with this. My mom has corticobasal syndrome and has almost no use of her legs. My 72 year old dad is her primary caretaker but can not lift her to get her into the bedside commode.

He is resistant to getting in home help and I am going to be returning to the office so I will not be teleworking to help move her to the bathroom when she needs. I am trying to get them to move on getting some in home help but I though something worth looking into was possibly diapers?

Are there any adult diapers which might be easy to change if the person is sitting down and can only lift their hips slightly? Or possibly any diapers that are absorbent enough that just urinating a small amount they can still be worn for a few hours?

We are worried about rashes and I don't want her to just be uncomfortable all day but time is limited and they are refusing other options. Hoping someone might have experience with this or a possible recommendation."
"My dad passed last October and Mom four years previous. Afterwards I think some things seem more clear yet many questions and regrets remain.

Mom had some stomach/intestinal issues. One night she even had to go to the ER, but was ok. All the docs ever did was tell her to take fiber etc. Dad, had issues with very urgent BM once or twice a month. We tried changing his diet, lactose intolerant maybe, went to his doc several times. And all they ever did was tell him to take fiber etc. When he was in the hospital that last time they discovered he had bleeding ulcers. he had been in a different hospital twice previously that year and they didnt find it. Doubt they even checked.

So im wondering if perhaps Mom had bleeding ulcers also. Im wondering if the medication they took was causing that. The BP meds maybe? At one point Mom stopped taking hers cold turkey.

Other thing I wonder about. My dad was 94 when he passed. He was one of those old guys who would never let on when he was sick or didnt feel good or had problems. there were days when I could tell by the look on his face he was struggling a bit mentally but he never let on. Everything was always fine. He had PD and dementia.  One effect was he had trouble making decisions. He loved music and had a ton of old cassettes and CDs but he never played them. maybe his tremors made him not want to try. he had stopped doing just about everything and I never knew why. he had audible books but he listened once. I didnt want to force him to listen to a book or a CD. But I would wonder why he didnt.

I dont think im looking for closure because that will never happen. maybe thoughts. maybe to tell the small tales and someone is helped by them.

&#x200B;

edit-It seems that afterwards things become much more clear. Perhaps with all the emotion etc we get too close and dont see whats right in front of us."
"Had anyone tried those ""hands free"" shoes that you slid you foot into and the back pops up? They look too good to be true! Despite my best efforts, my elder takes off their shoes to use the toilet and two nap twice a day and they also cannot be without the shoes on their feet for any time other than the toliet and naps due to foot sensitivity. Also they also can't put their shoes on by them selves any more so I am starting to loose my mind. I have seen ads for two different brands and I just wonder if they really work?"
"So as auntie who raised me up as her own, she's like a mom and we're all we have, and damn am I a fck up as a care giver

Lived with her for a decade + and as I worked she handled the bills & big decisions regarding the house. This includes big decisions for repairs which is key. 

After some health setbacks she still maintained great independence from waking. driving locally to small errands. 

Then COVID hit her. Thankfully after a month & a half she pulled through. However during her recovery is where I start fkn up (edit: or at least more immediate mess up to the situation)

I was lax on the big decision stuff which was to our long term demise as the home has been in epic need of repairs which,  isn't cheap yet needed for keeping the place more livable. 

However the sources of funding was never followed up on by her as I found out finally taking the wheel of the situation which has at least turned out positive in terms of ""gonna happen when it happens"". Unfortunately I found out through the last week of her stay in senior rehab recovery which wouldn't be so bad, except she's way below her mobility. 

Seems the insurance just made sure she was gonna live and not look to get her back to independence before this thing hit her.  Thus her discharge (guess what epic genius signed off on that) back to a place that's weeks/ months away from being a comfort is now a nightmare as my dumbass signed off on it only to immediately see she isn't at a point of even taking care of herself (contrary to talks with her physical therapists there).

I'm pissed mainly at myself on the too little, too lax, too late efforts which may make things finally resolved, yet that's weeks away. And living here in the meantime instead of at recovery assisted living, I'm not sure if she can even see these things finally take place.

TL:DR - A motherly figure has degraded due to a shitty health system and a lax nephew who took her for granted with no immediate clue as to wtf to do until things get better."
"One of my In-laws is struggling with mental health, currently in a psych ward (temporarily), and is wanting us to sign a power of attorney to help sort out their affairs.

This person is manipulative and desperate.

What can we do to help without becoming directly responsible for things like: dispersing money ('allowance'). 

Does signing POA make us legally liable for them?"
"Hi all,

New to this community but our family is really struggling right now... As a bit of backstory, my in laws are aging and my father in law specifically has had a lot of health issues. In 2013, before I met my husband, my FIL had a mysterious autoimmune disorder, it's extremely rare and there are 10's of cases worldwide. He recovered completely and has been fine since. In 2019 and 2020, he was dealing with a large blood clot that wouldn't go away. That then lead to a lymphoma diagnosis in early 2021. He is in remission now but was in treatment for most of 2021. At the same time, my MIL's parents were having major health issues throughout 2020 and unfortunately in 2021 they both passed away. I believe my MIL has some unresolved trauma over both her parents passing and my FIL's illnesses.

On top of this, my husband and I live 2.5-3 hours from our in laws and my SIL and her wife live across the countries. My in laws asked us about 5 years ago if we were ok with them moving close to us to help care for them as they age. We said yes of course. When my FIL was diagnosed with cancer, we told them we wanted them to prioritize moving and they were receptive, however, they have not made much progress on that front to date, despite having ample funds for purchasing a home.

So now we're at a bit of a crossroads. My MIL is now emotionally unstable and has apparently lashed out at my SIL's wife when they visited last month. It was nasty and my SIL is very upset. MIL has yet to discuss it with my SIL. SIL asked to talk and MIL said she's ""not in a place"" to have that conversation. It's really hard for us to help them right now as we are physically far away (plus COVID) but my MIL clearly needs some mental health support and we worry about future health issues with my FIL's cancer.

How can we get them to let us help? We're so lost since they ASKED us if they could move here yet now are dragging their feet. We've suggested renting while they decide on neighborhoods/towns but they don't seem to like that idea. They also seem to be in denial about their health/age. They act like everything is totally fine but my SIL literally had to call us tonight to ask us what's wrong with my MIL. They are very conflict averse and don't share a lot of feelings so we're really struggling. Any input on how to have a productive conversation about this would be helpful!! We're really at a loss and it's taking a toll on all of us."
"I've posted a few times asking for help and wanted to share some good news for once. 

We had moved my mother to a nursing facility and she went downhill pretty quick. Assumed it was the dementia/alzheimer's progressing, she was ornery and never got out of bed or spoke with anyone really. Tho she was talking with dead people.

After 4 months we moved her to another facility and within 3 days, she's almost back to being my mother again. The previous facility apparently had her on 3 different anti-depressants, so not a good thing. Today (4th day), she's actually going to eat lunch in the dining room, sounds simple, but I'm in tears. So happy she's getting out of bed and trying to live again. 

Amazing how a high rated facility can be so bad. Just glad we moved her and didn't keep believing the BS we were being told."
"I’m dealing with a parent who refused to go to the doctor about their knee issues and was obese. His obesity did not help matters. Idk why or if the doctors ever said diet and exercise, but he kept getting worse. I grew up seeing him need help getting up off the floor and bending down to get things when I was a little girl. His walking was bad. It would not get better without changes. Then all his issues compounded in a matter of a few years in the last few years. He had these issues for decades. He would always tell me he is afraid of falling. He held on to the railing with all his strength, and would go up the stairs with the same foot at times, never bending his knee. He would drop his weight to go down steps. He asked me as a kid to help him up. Now he is extremely depressed because it has gone so bad he can’t get off the bed without rocking longer. He takes a while to get up. He feels it was never like this. I see it as it was bound to be this with not addressing it or figuring it out. He wouldn’t go to the doctors about it. I told him it is not good or normal to ask your elementary school kid to help you up from the floor. 

He misses going anywhere. I can’t cheer him up because he refuses to do any exercises without the fear he’s had for more than half a century now. He gets crying and depressed when I try to get him to walk to places. He prefers to say and imagine him going to places he used to without doing the work. I tell him work on your leg muscles in bed, learn to lift them up, and move them there. He never wants to do anything on the floor since he was in his thirties because he has always been afraid of not being able to get up. He is getting pills for possible arthritis and expects to be able to run when they work. I want him to get to a better place and walk more and bend more. I want to get his strength up as he lost any he had. He says the pills will do all the work. He will be able to walk like he used to. The way he used to was not a good place."
"I’m mostly looking for affirmation in my decision as I think I’ve made up my mind.  My father passed away four years ago and to make a long story short, I am the sole caregiver for my nearly 87 year old mother.  She had Covid a year ago and since then has needed to use a walker and can no longer complete daily tasks by herself.  Her mental abilities have also declined.  For 11 months, I have been taking care of her 24/7 and all of her affairs.  I actually live in Germany (I’m a permanent resident and it’s been my home for 33 years and my only child is here). My mom lives in a depressing town in Georgia (they moved there 6 years ago after 35 years in Florida to be near my eldest sister and her family, who no longer have contact with my mother). This is not my former home and I have nobody and nothing there besides my mother.

My mother is currently in respite care at a really nice assisted living place so I could come home for a few weeks and see my son and deal with my own affairs.  I can see that she is doing really well there but she always says “it’s a nice place but I don’t want to stay here for good.”  

When she is home, she sleeps 15-16 hours a day and sits in her chair watching tv the rest of the time.  She has one friend who comes to visit a few times a week and who visits her in assisted living too. 

This time at home has made it clear that staying there indefinitely is just something I cannot do anymore.  It’s a living death for both of us.  I can get her showered and dressed and provide meals and turn on the tv but I can’t provide mental or physical stimulation or even be good company as I am utterly miserable myself.

What I need to figure out is how to sell her on the idea of moving to assisted living for good without it being all about me.  I know if I tell her this situation is killing me and her too she won’t care."
"I'm REALLY trying. I mean REALLY. But my situation is difficult. My very elderly mother who has always been negative and nasty has gotten significantly more so. I make her dinner, do her shopping, make and take her to appointments and provide a multitude of other services (move this, open that, order this, etc). She has gotten very frail and ever more isolated since Covid so I am her primary social interaction everyday. She complains constantly about her treatment - we don't treat her as part of the family, we are lying to her, no one visits her, etc. As my husband says, it's like she has a tape running in her head of the complaints of the day. The alternate tape is the grudges and grievances of who has wronged her (mostly me). Once the ""tape"" gets going if you interrupt it just goes back to the beginning. Lately I see some signs of cognitive impairment but she is still able to ""keep it together"" in front of her doctor, neighbors, etc. She would be so much better with an antidepressant but trust me, that is not going to happen. She absolutely wouldn't consider it because ""there's nothing wrong with her"". I have made a vow not to argue when she starts up with false accusations and the endless list of complaints. I stopped trying to correct her or justify my own behavior. It's hard to argue when no one is arguing back, right? Except it seems to be ramping her up more. Classic case of a toddler wanting attention. Negative attention is better than no attention. I'm not looking for advice to change her. We all know you can't change other people, only your reaction to them. So I'm looking for two pieces of advice. How do I cut off the barrage of accusations (false) and nasty, nasty comments? I can't take walking in the door and immediately being lit into. Also, she is talking massive shit about me behind my back to my husband and kids (and everyone else I'm sure). Frankly, I don't care about what she says to anyone else but it does really matter to me that she starts in with my family. They absolutely can't stand it but don't say anything because they don't want to keep the discussion going and frankly they are able to limit their contact with her and just figure taking her crap for limited amounts of time are easier than getting into it with her.  As far as giving her more attention, it would require huge amounts with a modest payback. And it's killing me to spend a half an hour with her as it is and not lose my temper. Of course the worse she behaves, the more everyone pulls away. My husband and my adult children dread interacting with her and do the best they can - occasional phone calls and visits but are not going to do more and I don't blame them. She's my problem, no one else's. She's too frail and too afraid of Covid to go anywhere (senior center, etc). so as I said before, I can't change her or her situation. I can only change my behavior. Thanks community for your support."
"Hi everyone!

My grandpa is in a nursing facility and they stopped putting adult diapers on him because they said he was allergic to traditional adult diapers. They didn’t offer me any substitutions. 

My grandpa can pee into one of the hand held bottles but he can’t walk so pooping is pretty terrible and the CNAs don’t always clean him right away. 

Does anyone know of any hypoallergenic adult diaper options or anyone who’s had the same issues, what did you do??"
"Basically my dad would like to change his medical power of attorney to me vs my brother (older brother, but not stable, addicted to drugs, etc.). 

He wants to make sure I can make executive medical decisions for him. He also needs his will tweaked but I believe he needs to contact a lawyer for that.

How can we get this set up if I live in Kansas and they live in Michigan?"
"I started staying with my dad on Wednesday because he has COVID and he asked me to stay to help him while he is ill. 

He quit taking his medications weeks ago. I have tried and failed to get him into his doctor's office three times. He refused to go. Since he has quit taking his medications, his mobility and cognition has declined. 

He has polycythemia Vera. He has had multiple strokes and has brain damage diagnosed by his doctor. He often talks about memories that never happen and has outright delusions. He is often paranoid. 

He is an alcoholic and has been drinking heavily since my mother died 12 years ago. 

He was a caretaker for my grandmother, his mother, in the last two years of her life and when she died, he became depressed and started on a downward spiral. He refuses therapy (whenever I bring it up, his words are ""get fucked."")

On Wednesday, I took him to the ER. He tested positive for COVID. They sent him home. 

Yesterday, I called an ambulance on him. He started to refuse to eat, to drink liquids, and he soiled himself in the night, refusing to change clothes or get in the bath. He became delirious and agitated, screaming and cursing at me me the ambulance came. He was dehydrated. They ER gave him fluids, cleaned him up, called APS and sent him home. 

I am thankful they called APS. I know that their mission is to help vulnerable adults, which describes my dad right now. An agent of APS left a business card with her phone number, and my dad is refusing to call. It is 8pm here right now but he says he will not call her tomorrow or any other day. I am planning on calling her and handing him the phone. 

What can I do to help my dad care for himself? My dad's roommate and I have been taking shifts caring for him. All three of us have COVID. Can APS help my dad? Can I do anything to get him to eat, to drink liquids, to bathe when he's soiled himself?"
"Mom and Dad have moved on, but this is not the end by any means. For those approaching this stage in dealing with your aging parents, I'd like to document what I've done since my mom passed on December 24.

Since she died on Christmas Eve, although I notified immediate family and gave people options, we all knew that Mom would have wanted us to go ahead and celebrate the holidays, so that's what we did. Some might consider that disrespectful, but you didn't know my mother. She couldn't have stood for a silent, tear-filled night and sobbing on Christmas.

Instead, since Christmas Eve had always been celebrated at my parents' house, we needed a new tradition and my daughter and granddaughter supplied that by hosting us for a wonderful assortment of snacks and a great time of opening gifts. I sincerely wanted the distraction and my daughter provided it in an excellent way.

The next morning we hosted everyone. Some people gently probed to see if it was going to be ok to say anything about their lost Nana, and while I did talk privately with a couple of people, my mantra was ""Christmas!! Christmas!!"" and that's what we did. Good food, good company, great creative gifts, and even some laughter filled our house.

Afterwards, there was time for some somber talk for those who wanted to stick around a bit; we'll all need to check in with one another from time to time and we've been doing that this week.

On the 26th I began the phone calls to more distant family and friends. Down the list I went, and while the news I conveyed was sad, many had been expecting it and many chose to share some of their favorite stories about things my mother had said or done. I found it cathartic to hear the high regard people had for my mom and all the nice things they had to say. Some conversations went on for half an hour or more as people essentially thanked me for having such a wonderful mom.

The next day was Monday. Businesses reopened and it was time to start calling them. Mostly I handled communication with them via email, but in some cases I felt a phone call would be better. Cancel the newspaper, call the elections office to remove Mom's name from the voter list, notify the doctors' offices, stop the autopay on health insurance, notify Social Security, call the company that holds an IRA, and of course notify the assisted living facility that we won't need the apartment any longer and that once the holidays have passed we'll get out of there as quickly as we can.

One number was missing, that of one of my mother's best friends. They go back all the way to high school; I really, really needed to call her but I didn't know her number. I needed to go to the apartment and see if I could find Mom's phone list. I entered the facility and I was greeted by several caregivers and administrators who stopped to offer me words of consolation. They liked my mom, they said, and they're sorry for our loss. The receptionist, probably my favorite staff member there, gave me a hug. It feels nice to know that even though they never saw my mother at her best, they still found things about her to like. I easily located the phone list, grabbed some photo albums, and was out of there; there will be time enough to move everything else later on.

I made the remaining phone calls, and then began writing a list of things for which I'll still need money. I provide this just so readers can see some of the things I've needed to think about:

 1--First one's actually a refund:  The January health insurance premium should be  refunded back to us. Not sure when that will happen, but probably not  soon.  
 2--If there's a  January Social Security payment made because the death notification was  too late, that will need to be refunded to SSA.

3--There will  be rent owed on Mom's apartment for days in January. No care costs, though, so it won't be nearly as much as it had been.

3--The funeral home has already been in touch and there have already been some costs. I think they're paid off, but there might be other things to come from them.  
 4--The  pharmacy might have some charges for meds that cannot be returned unopened to them. We were using a mail order through the assisted living facility so  they'll need to monitor and return anything that has arrived since December 21, but if anything was opened we will get a bill.  
 5--There are  costs for the church, the officiant, the music, flowers, food, and so on  depending on what we decide about a funeral and whether we want a public  or a family-only observation/memorial  
 6--It's  possible that taxes will be owed on my parents' income for 2021, and I'll need to  pay accountants for their services on top of any money that might be owed. Also if there's a refund, I'll need to keep an account open to  receive it, but that's really easy.  
 7--When my parents moved we opened a storage unit in their names. Now we'll have to deal with the bills for that until we have time to liquidate the contents in whatever way we think best.

8--My local newspaper will, I hope, cooperate with me in getting an obituary published, but it's hard to know because it was recently bought by a national chain and they made it so difficult when my dad died that I never got one done. I'm hoping they'll allow me to do one that covers both parents. Obituaries aren't cheap; in July I was quoted over $300, so I fully expect if they let me do both parents it will be somewhat more than that.

My brother was here (Oregon) from Texas in June, July, November, and December, early in the month, and cannot be expected to drop everything and come again, especially with the newest strain of COVID seeming to relish being in airplanes. We'll wait. Maybe he'll come later this month, but maybe not until February or even later. By then we'll have decided what kind of service we want. We are co-executors and co-heirs in my parents' will, and his presence will be helpful when it's time to deal with the remaining estate.

So that's how I've spent my week. When someone dies, certain things related to care giving are over, but a lot of other things need to happen. I hope this post has provided some thoughts for people to consider, and if readers see things I seem to have neglected or forgotten, please let me know.

Thanks to everyone for the support you've expressed. I truly appreciate all the kind words and good wishes."
"Hello all!

I tried to search this sub before because I KNOW it's likely been asked but have come up blank. 

Suggestions for an appropriate gift for neighbors who have been invaluable during the past two years?

The situation. My mom lives alone in the house we grew up in. She's in her mid 70's doing fine with only some mild age related things and a knee issue she's getting take care of next month. My sister and I do not live nearby (across the country for me and around the world (Australia) for my sister). One of our neighbors has been a godsend over the last two years. Going to get groceries for my mom at the height of the pandemic, snowblowing the walkways during the winter, checking in on her when weather things happen...etc. They've been great, and my mom is very grateful. I unfortunately don't know them super well, they moved in after I moved away for college so it's a pretty surface hello and how are you doing, type relationship vs they've been next door forever and I've known them since I was two.

I bought a card and have been writing a thank you note for them but wanted to get something as well...suggestions? I don't know if they have a favorite restaurant or similar to get something more tailored for them. To top it off I can't really go over and ask subtly for ideas, they all caught COVID (we're in NYC where omnicron is having a right field day) so they're hardcore isolating even though they're slowly getting better. Their own family has been helping out with food drops etc during the holiday so that's kind of already taken.

Open to any thoughts. I was considering like a generic visa gift card or similar but I'm always leery of data being compromised on them since they get hacked on the semi regular unfortunately."
"My mom (66 yo) just broke her ankle and is coming home today.  I live on the other side of the county and just so happened to be home for the holidays and able to extend my stay.  I will be with her for a week to help her settle in and figure out how to navigate the house (luckily 1 story).  Any tips of things I can do to help her get acclimated?  She will have a walker and wheelchair.  After I leave there will be someone who is at the house most of the time but might be alone of short periods.  

Also she has a great support system in her small town but they are all in the 70s/80s and while very ready and willing to help are not very tech savvy for organizing.  So far I’ve been fielding a lot of phone calls and visitors popping by  with soup and concern but have just been saying that when she gets home we will get a plan in place.  Any ideas what that plan should look like?  

Thank you!"
"I’m desperate for any advice since my dad is slowly falling apart and taking mine and my brother’s life with him.

The short version: My dad, almost 70. Lives alone since divorce when I was kid. Doesn’t exercise, doesn’t eat very well. Barely leaves the house, except to shop (though it’s getting hard), no hobbies. 

Major social anxiety, major fear of change.

Smokes like a chimney. Has his whole life. 

His health is in freefall. More and more chest and breathing problems. Constant hospital visits. No sign of the big C, But I can’t help feel like it’s only a matter of time. Less and less mobility. Multiple collapses and ambulance calls.

He wheezes just sitting in his chair. A rasping gasp that I hate with every part of me. 

But here’s the hard part; he won’t change. Not for himself, not for my brother and I. Not for anyone. 

My brother and I have spent 10+ years trying to help him. Trying to help him quit smoking, to eat better, or just seek professional help. But he won’t. We’ve tried softly, firmly, logically and every other approach. His answer?

*Don’t worry about me struggling. Just live your life.*

Yep, he plays the martyr. Every. Single. Time. 

It’s the most infuriating BS that makes me want to scream.

We can't *live our life* **because of him**.  


He *must* know he is directly making everything hard for my brother and I but won’t admit it, instead spouting that fake selfless cop-out: *Don’t worry about me. Just live your life.* 

It must be his way of sweeping all responsibility aside and convincing himself he is still being a considerate father.

He’s not. I’ve lost count of the amount of times we have had to rush to a hospital, attend a doctors or drive to him after sudden breathing problems, but he won’t make any changes, or accept any help. Not to mention the grinding, constant stress of his health on us.

If we push him, he sulks like a teenager, says maybe he will die quickly to make it easy for us and we shouldn't worry about him.

No amount of pleading or logic gets past his faux-victim/father-of-the-year card.

He is ruining my life and my brother’s life. 

I'm tired and just don't know what to do any more.

I welcome any thoughts at this point."
"My dad sold his condo in a neighboring state and moved in with my family (myself, husband, two young children) in August 2020. He spent about 5 months in Florida over the winter and moved back in to an addition we built for him (he provided a substantial financial contribution). It’s not a full in-law suite but is a decent sized room with a full bath and closet. The addition and him moving in was our idea given his declining health and to be closer to family.

It is not going well. I’ve been working from home since COVID and have a demanding career. My dad does little to help out around the house and makes more of a mess than he contributes to keeping things up. He is increasingly selfish. He spends almost all of his time in our living room and not in the space we built for him. He has a Parkinsons-symptoms (has some other neuro issue) but is still independent, and has no conditions or limitations that would prohibit him from cleaning up after himself. My husband cooks every meal for the family, including him. I question his cognitive health occasionally but it’s something we will keep an eye on.

My stress levels and frustrations are through the roof. I’ve talked to him multiple times about contributing and expectations, but to no avail. A few days ago there were two incidents and I basically had a breakdown and decided he needs to move out. I used to have a close, nice relationship with my dad but it has deteriorated quickly since he’s moved in. I feel like some separation is the only way to repair and preserve our relationship.

I do feel badly and haven’t talked to him about it yet. I need time to talk to my therapist and do some research for him for senior living spots that might have components for if/when he needs more care. I don’t know how he’s comfortable living here with the tension and my (and frankly, my husband’s too) stress levels as high as they are. I know he enjoys being with my kids. I would be happy to have him over for dinner every night and he could be a constant guest, if only he doesn’t live here. Ideally we’d find a community close by, but we live in New England and everything is so expensive so that will be hard to navigate as I’m sure he doesn’t want to shell out 400k for a 1 br condo. We would and are prepared to repay him for his contributions toward the addition, but it would take a couple of years. 

Has anyone gone through the process of moving a parent out because of dynamics and compatibility? I do genuinely see this as the only option to preserve my relationship with him, but is that more important than giving him a room and full time access to his grand kids?"
"My future mother in law has been struggling with depression, and we don't believe that she knows it and/or will admit it. She has been a widow for 4 years and retired in March 2020. She does not attend any social clubs or church and doesn't think there are any out there that she would like. She does not see many people at all, besides talking to her neighbor once a day. We live about half an hour away, see her in person about once a week and call her at least 2 or 3 times a week. Her adult son also lives with her, but he is not able to understand her emotional needs; his maturity level is very low and he has some social/emotional disabilities. He can take care of himself for the most part, but doesn't do well with emotional or social matters.

She enjoys quilting and gardening by herself. She loses gardening during the winter, and in the month of December, she says her wedding anniversary and the anniversary of a loved one's death are what cause her to get ""grouchy."" We understand this, but the problem is not limited to just December. 

She's had so many life changes in the last 5 years, the emotional distress is completely understandable. But she doesn't believe it's anything that can be fixed, she's just accepted it as the way things will always be. It is difficult to see her so miserable when we believe that just having someone safe, neutral, and non-judgmental to talk to could really help her process her emotions. She just can't find the positive in anything anymore, and more and more often, it gets directed at us and the rest of our family.

She is very much of the old fashioned mindset that only crazy people go to see a therapist; in the past, her primary care doctor has suggested therapy to her, and she flat out refused multiple times and said the doctor didn't know what he was talking about. 
We cannot think of anybody who could convince her to try a therapist, just to talk, not even to diagnose her or take any medications.

So to go back to my original question...are there any mental health resources out there (for seniors or otherwise) that aren't going to look like mental health resources? She still has such a stigma about therapy and depression that if it even seems similar to any of that, it will get immediately rejected. We keep reminding ourselves that we cannot force her to do anything if she does not want to solve the problem, but thought that there might be some ""gateway"" mental health resources that aren't full on therapy but can still provide help for those who need it. 

If you made it to the bottom, thank you! I appreciate any help you have."
"I’m not complaining about this situation; I’m just curious.

My father is suddenly a widower and in poor health.  He needs care, so my sibling has pretty much taken over planning every aspect of his life, from ensuring that he has 24/7 home caregivers to ensuring that all bills are paid.  My sibling has been fantastic about all of that.

My sibling and I each live several hours away from our father, by plane.  My father has made it clear that we are welcome, and so I’ve been spending weeks at a time in his home.  I can work remotely, so it’s fine.  I don’t spend that much time with him, but I moved into his home and visited him almost every single day when he was a nursing home for a few months, and I have meals with him.

My sibling flies into town for various events- sometimes for business but mainly to go to medical appointments with our father, or to see the sibling’s friends. 

When my sibling comes to town, he just swoops in, ensures that our father’s affairs are in order, and then spends time with the sibling’s friends.  This week my sibling has been in town for three days and has spent a total of 90 minutes with our father.  My sibling even stayed in a hotel, although our father’s house is huge and beautiful.

Again, not complaining.  I’m just curious: if you have an aging parent, do you spend only a minimal amount of time just hanging out with them?"
Thank you all for being a place of solace in these difficult times. God bless you all for being that one thing between a sad death and a somewhat fulfilling one.
"My husband's mother almost certainly has late-onset schizophrenia (hallucinations, delusions of persecution, social withdrawal, suspicion of others, etc.). We live across the country. Husband's sister recently visited her and told us that her extreme hoarding, which has been going on for about 10 years, has now led to a rat infestation.

We have tried to help her in the past, but without any success. She doesn't understand that she's sick. My husband once gave her an ultimatum to see a doctor, threatening to cut contact. She went but instead of getting a psych referral, she got blood tests (one of her delusions is that she thinks she is being poisoned). According to my sister-in-law, she denied that the rodent feces were actually feces, and got upset when sister-in-law tried to clean.

Does anyone know how to get social services involved when the aging parent refuses to seek help and is not in immediate danger, but her living conditions are unsafe to her health? I tried to get someone involved a few years ago (after her neighbors called my husband to tell him that she was crawling around the roof at night), but they said there was nothing they could do."
"I am going to try to make this as brief as I can.

My mom is 55. She stopped working 7 years ago because she tore her rotator cuff on the job (had surgery twice) and has been living with me since. It has been a rough 7 years. She has been trying to get disability but has been denied 2 or 3 times. My mom hasn't tried to get a job because 1) her arm/rotator cuff gives her problems 2) she now has severe arthritis in one of her knees and 3) she has an intellectual disability (she hasn't been officially diagnosed but my mom has always struggled with learning, memory and comprehending) I'm not her only child. I have a younger brother but he can't stay out of jail and no family members are willing and or able to take her in. It's hard to deal with her. She is extremely lazy (always have been) and because of her mental issues I have to constantly remind her to do stuff likes she's a child. We went from a 2 bedroom to now a 1 bedroom and it sucks. Next semester will be my last semester of college so I am trying to better myself. I know I will always have to help her with things because of her mental limitations but I'll be damned if I always have to live with her! By the way, she has been getting an SSI check since April of this year but she only gets $530 a month, not a lot to get her own place. I have applied to get her on housing but the waiting lists are extremely long or closed altogether. Any suggestions on this frustrating situation?"
"Sounds easy, right? It's not. 

My dad passed 5 yrs ago. Since then my mom (76) has been on an independent streak. (i.e. paint the tin garage roof, trim the trees, and dig out overgrown, deeply rooted shrubs. She did this herself!)

Yep, I am proud of her!

I get that she has this desire to work outdoors and it helps her both physically and mentally. But it's crazy!

She's a diabetic. Celiac. ""No idea why I got dizzy and passed out. I ate some toast with some jelly before I worked out in the yard.""

She has gotten so angry with me the few times we've been able to be together since 2020 spring. Fix my phone, my iPad and my laptop. I do it and tell her this is how it got messed up. Nope. She didn't do that. Um, ok, well, who else has access? No one. 

Day after Thanksgiving, she got so mad at me she threw her ipad, phone and 2 tv remotes across the room. 

I live 5 hours away and have gone low contact with her for the first time in my life. She sent messages and I've gotten a one word or sentence for three weeks. I sent her a message, ""Can I call you tomorrow after my <time>?"" No response.""

She's making me crazy. 

What does she want? She told me, ""If I need your help <YikesMyMom> I'll ask you for it!."" Mmm okk. She gets mad. Says she will  take care of it. Uh . . . Ok? She said I'm not going to pur
 her in a nursing home. I've never said I would!
 
Last year, I took an online course at my local college about how to deal with Aging Parents. If I do anything suggested, that's going to make her so much angrier.

I'm losing this battle."
"My mom is 65 years old, divorced (and my father has passed) and lives alone after my younger sister finally moved out of the house about a year ago. She smokes cigarettes and drinks every day, is constantly unhappy, hates her job, and is stressed about making ends meet financially 24/7. As she has gotten older, the drinking has gotten worse and she consistently repeats herself, slurs her words, and fires herself up for rants about things she’s complained about for years in a stream of endless negativity (i.e. lamenting over the same crappy story from years ago). Truth be told, I don’t know what to do to keep her spirits up or to keep myself from not wanting to be around her. She’s stuck in her ways and stubborn, has zero technology skills (or desire to learn), and has completely lost all social skills outside of being able to complain like a crabby old lady. She does not really have an understanding of the world any more; I don’t think i could have 80% of the conversations I would with my adult friends simply because my mom “wouldn’t get it”. I am worried that my patience will run out eventually and/or her attitude and outlook toward life will just get worse, and the constant negativity is already staggering. 

Is this common among aging (particularly alone/single) parents? I am looking for advice on how I can accept this mentally so that I can stop the anguish I feel when I see my poor mom alone in a world that she’s so disconnected from. It pains me so much to see but I have no idea what I can do."
"She was supposed to turn the oven off at 7 pm from a dish she was cooking. When I can home at 1 am, I smelled a burnt hamburger smell in the garage and just thought dad cooked something wrong again. 

I was sitting in my room playing Far Cyr 6 for a few minutes to relax my brain and STILL kept smelling the burnt hamburger. 

Went upstairs to the kitchen to see the oven on at 300 degrees and two dishes in the oven cooking. 

I immediately turn off the oven took out the dishes. to see a crispy mess of meatloaf. The banging around woke up my mother and when she saw what had happened, she was visibly distraught. 

I could just see the way she has changed over the years and the ways she had gotten worse.

&#x200B;

What are you doing to protect your elderly parents? 

How can I prevent this oven debacle from happening again?   

Are there any modern gadgets I can attract to the stove?"
"Just want to rant release some negative energy. Like others on here, dealing with helping out my parents who are in their mid-70s. My dad has some health issues and my mom is reasonably ok. My frustration is that there is a seemingly never ending list of medial tasks they want done - every flipping filter under the Sun constantly needs checked/replaced, they have more light bulbs burn out than is believable, one of their eight clocks is off by a minute I need to come set it, check and make sure their water softener has enough salt, Facebook machine not working, etc. Not a single one of these things is a big deal or takes any time at all - it just feels constant and like they just sit around dwelling on them constantly while not acknowledging that I have my normal full-time job, a free lance business I do on the side, and have my own kids (5 ages 16-4) that I have responsibilities with also.  It just seems like it’s been so long since me and my siblings were young that they’ve forgotten the time and energy a family takes. What really drives me crazy is my mom can’t change their furnace filter but I have to fight with her about how I don’t think she should go out in 95+ degree heat to mow, trim, pick up branches, etc. During the summer I swing by weekly and do these things to keep her from over exerting herself when it’s really hot outside.

On top of handling my parents, both of my spouse’s grandparents are deteriorating health wise. So with Set A - her aunts (with grown out of house kids) seem to be trying to guilt all the grandkids (with young kids of their own-like me and my wife) into constantly going out to do, whatever they think needs done that particular week (ie clean out building the grandpa has said he would get to since the 80s, or the grandparents have determine they don’t want a swing set in their yard so it’s a dire situation to get it removed asap) - just seemingly random things like that. 

Set B is completely different, main aunt there is basically handling everything and will gladly take help. 

Anyhow, just wanted to vent. None of this is easy or something you really think about until it hits you. I’m just trying to handle best I can and not let it ruin/impact the last years all this family will be with us."
"Hi, my dad has had an awful month. Two brain surgeries, and diagnosed with aggressive brain cancer.  He is stable and in a rehab working on therapy to get back to his apt. Completely independent and active before this. He was a young 75. 

Problem is I need him to talk to me about some financial issues and what he wants for his care and he refuses. I’ve tried a few approaches. He just closes his eyes tight and pretends to be asleep. He’s never left me any indication of what to do for him, where his money is before this despite me asking he always said everything is good and not to worry about it. Well now the time is here and I know nothing. He did get him to do HPOA and FPOA. We need to make some decisions on what to do if he needs long term care, aides, and we don’t know what the funds are. We also don’t know what kind of treatment he wants for his cancer. I am at a total loss and getting very angry for him putting us through this and I’m ready to say f it. But I don’t really want to do that, I’m frustrated. Im really hurting that he refuses to talk to me about anything. 

Any advice on how to approach? I can’t get into his phone or email, he claims he doesn’t know any passwords, I’ve gone through everything in his apartment and can’t find anything helpful."
"If you have in-home caregivers who fix meals for your elderly parent, do they also cook for any other family members or guests who are there at mealtime?

I figure they’re being paid to look after the elderly person, so there’s no obligation for them to cook for anyone else.

I will have a few family members at home tomorrow with my elderly parent who has a caregiver.  

I figure it’s out of line to even expect the caregiver to cook for more than just the elderly parent, so the polite thing to do would be to have dinner delivered for everyone (including for the caregiver and elderly parent), right?

Thanks."
"I'm in a situation with my 91 year-old mother where her memory and cognition have been declining, pretty much in parallel with the pandemic. She still lives in her house and is financially fairly well-off. However, the burden on me is increasing, and as I'm self-employed, I have had to cut back on the amount of work I accept in order to manage things for my mother. So I am essentially turning down paid work in favor of unpaid work. My sister moved last year and now lives a six hour drive away, so she is basically out of the picture. She has a new granddaughter to focus on. I understand her priorities, but she has left as things are getting tougher. 

My mother could go to a nursing home, but she's in good physical health and had an aunt who lived to 101. As one friend put it to me, ""If you want any inheritance, you're going to have to look after her because going into assisted living could easily burn through everything she has."" I don't want to sound mercenary, but here we get to the crux of my question: How can siblings handle inheritance fairly if one sibling is doing all the work and the other does nothing? My mother's current will splits everything 50/50, and my sister is, frankly, not a very nice person. She won't suggest a more equitable split out of the goodness of her heart. 

Should I just find some way to value the price of my providing daily in-home care for my mother and keep a running account of it? 

Has anyone else has to handle compensation when you're doing all the work?"
"Hey all ! My mom was hospitalized for over a month due to  experiencing severe complications in what should have been a routine biopsy. She is currently recovering and now is using a walker as she regains her strength.

The problem, however, is that I regularly catch her walking around without a walker. She has fallen five times in the past ten weeks, and three of those times it was because she was not using her walker.  and as she is on blood thinners, the stakes are extremely high if she falls. When I catch her, she claims that her physical therapist told her to ""walk""; this of course is not true. After each physical therapy session, I ask ""is it safe for her to walk around without the walker"" and the physical therapist, in front of my mom, says ""no, she still needs the walker. She will also say that she doesn't do it if she feels steady, she needs to do it so she pushes herself to get better, etc. And every time it happens, I respond differently in hopes of getting through.

I've pleaded, yelled, cried, given the silent treatment - but she just says she won't do it again...and a week later she does.

 As many of you surely know, the risk is not just to her health, it's to my mental health and also to the trajectory of my life for the next six months. If she is injured, I will have to extend my caregiver duties, remain living in her home (I have dropped everything to move in and care give for now), and experience continued disruptions to my life.  She is going to assisted living in two weeks but I'm concerned she is going to hurt herself before then. 

&#x200B;

Any advice would be appreciated - do any of you have aging parents who refuse to use canes or walkers, and risk serious injury as a result?"
"I searched this sub but didn't see a straight answer, so apologies if this is answered elsewhere. 

My elderly mother has no technology skills. She doesn't own a smartphone, or even have email. Her husband died recently, so she's home alone. She does OK (she enjoys being alone and is surrounded by helpful neighbors), but I would like her to have a device to call me in case of an emergency, if she can't get to or use the phone (I live about 45 minutes away, and am the sole family member). Teaching her a new device, like a smartphone or watch, is **NOT** an option (bummer, I'd love fall detection). LifeAlert only works if the senior is actually wearing it. I was afraid she'd be reluctant, but I was happily surprised that she's open to having Echo devices in the house, which, if she gets used to using Alexa, would be great for her to have help with other things at home, and even enjoy easily listening to the music she loves. I thought I'd just start with a few Dots in the house. (If I could get her interested in a Show, I think she'd love that too, but, baby steps.)

My question is:

Do I add more devices to my Prime account, or do I set her up with her own Amazon account (Prime, for the music I know she'll want to hear) for her Echo devices? Even though it might be a pain to have to log out/log in to the Alexa app on my phone when I need to change settings or something - that's a minor inconvenience. My gut tells me that she needs her own account so our timers, alerts, etc., don't interfere with each other's. (Cost is not a problem, and I believe seniors can get a discount, too.) Also, I think she needs her own account so she can have her own emergency contact (me). Am I right here? 

Also, does [Alexa Together](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwjeztW9tIT1AhVa_uMHHc53AXoYABAAGgJ5bQ&ae=2&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESQeD28ky0qor5MAuwKzHB--eM6xVSsxGATaNF1JUGA7YLjI2ZVODOyLH9Aff4mN0NFyPSQVeq1sZsUAX2RSGO5XZn&sig=AOD64_2N_rmrWxNZ3cdQvd0isqmfu2Bdow&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjz2sq9tIT1AhX6kIkEHY3JByoQ0Qx6BAgCEAM&dct=1) provide any additional benefit? For the life of me, I couldn't find any. 24/7 Urgent Response is nice, but not necessary. And considering I'll be the one having the app on my phone, I can send reminders and so-on to her Echo devices, if that's ever needed. 

I'll set her up with a list of commands with when it's installed, for features she would use right away, to others she might be interested in, so I'm good there. But I'd love to hear of any features that came in handy for you that were unexpected. 

Any advice or anecdotes from personal experience is much appreciated."
"Hello, my mother recently started living with us due to having dementia. We’ve been taking care of her for the past 6 months (mainly my wife). My wife had to quit her job to take care of my mom since I’m gone for work 5 days a week and travel. We sold her house 6 months ago and she has about 110k in cash and about 1900 a month from survivor benefits from my dads social security. 

My question is, she has too much for Medicaid currently. I wanted to put her in assisted living in a state next to us so her family would be closer to her. My wife isn’t able to take care of my mom anymore due to her sanity. My wife and I plan on moving within the next year or two and we won’t be able to take care of my mom anymore. What are our options? I’m worried the area we want to put her in won’t accept her, and we will have to put her somewhere else where no one will come see her. Where should I start?"
"Hi, I’m looking for a little support. My mom is 76 and lives alone. I’m the nearest family member and I have small kids, so we have spent a lot of time together. She’s been generally a good grandmother to the kids and I believe we have tried to support each other, especially through the pandemic. She has taken an anti-depressant/anxiety (from her family doctor) for many years. At times her anxiety has strained our relationship. But hateful, belittling, cursing, aggressive and even physical outbursts toward me are a new behavior of the past year and a half. The last occurred when I raised the subject of her seeing a psychiatrist to see if any medicine would help her cope with perhaps pandemic stress or another cause of her worrying behavior. The last outburst was so traumatizing to me I can barely even call or see her and am scared for my kids to be around her. I don’t think she realizes the extent of the things she said and did to me, because she is sad we don’t visit and is waiting for me to get over it. (Hasn’t acknowledged or apologized except for some vague— “let’s not have conflict” and “did I say something that upset you?”) I discussed this with my sister who hasn’t experienced any of this. Sister isn’t concerned and thinks I should “talk to mom.” So…there are a few things. I really think she should see a psychiatrist, neurologist and/or gerontologist about the behaviors and whether they relate to a aging, health and or mental condition. (Obviously I can’t make this happen.) Secondly, I feel a lot of guilt and sadness that I am not seeing or helping her…even though the thought of doing so is almost unbearable. I tell myself she’s ill, her behavior towards me isn’t personal, but why is she fine to everyone else? So, that’s it, I’m at a real impasse. Thanks for reading this."
"Hello, I'm new here but I'll be starting to lurk and comment now that this all feels so relevant.

Dad is 73, lives 3.5 hours away and has zero support network. He visits about once a month but has to drive over the mountain pass (major freeway, but still). Winter weather trapped him here while the pass is closed, and his medicine started running low. He has been rationing it instead of talking to my brother or I to come up with a solution. And then he had a seizure in his hotel room this morning.

My brother and I went into alert mode when he hasn't answered his phone for about an hour or two. Thankfully he didn't die in the hotel room, but it certainly crossed our minds. He's refusing seeing a doctor (Pride? Embarrassment? Both.) but agreed to ask a pharmacist for a temporary refill for the next few days.

He looked better tonight than he did this morning, but he looked... Old.

I've accepted this is the reality now, I'm just looking for resources and community wisdom. And *of course* there's a subreddit for it!"
"I’m in my early 30s and it’s been a struggle watching my mom age. She lives alone in another state and constantly wants me to visit; we try to talk daily. She and my dad divorced when I was 7 and she never remarried (immigrated to the US in her 30s)

Part of me feels like it’s a burden taking care of her emotional needs, then I feel horribly guilty about feeling like it’s a burden. I’m deathly afraid that she is lonely and there’s all this research saying that loneliness has negative health outcomes; covid hasn’t made this any easier. She doesn’t have a lot of friends in Houston and spends most of her time watching TV, going on walks.

I don’t want to move back home and live with her - I’m single and enjoy living in San Francisco, not back in Houston. I just don’t want to compromise my own independence just yet; maybe I could consider this if I settle down but I’m not at that stage in life yet.

Has anyone else been in this situation before? How do you deal with it?"
"The health of my in-laws have taken a turn south over 2021 and lately, the daily communications we receive contain mostly bad news (minor issues health-related). It is taking a large toll on my wife's mental composure so I want to actively engage in improving their living conditions and prepare for even more challenging times ahead.

My wife has three siblings living in her home country but they all have their own young families to attend to and personal/family circumstances which render their involvement more focused on extinguishing fires and less to plan for the longer-term challenges. 

My goal with this post is to document my progress and hopefully get insights into how to handle this complex situation and my objectives are to:

* Upgrade their ""setup"" so they can continue to use the computer despite their sight loss. Similarly get elderly proof cellphones, keyboards, etc. Recommendations welcome. 
* Make sure they have internet banking and all the relevant services connected to their computers. What else?
* Get a carer involved so he/she can be our eyes and in-situ problem solver and errand person. We'll be visiting them soon for a couple of days so I hope we can arrange interviews to choose someone with their involvement. 
* Hopefully, this carer will help us prepare their house for when they can't do things by themselves - while also making them feel comfortable about receiving help/support.
* I'm still struggling with how to keep them active as per some articles' recommendations. They currently watch the news and go swimming in their pool and my wife talks with my MIL every day. Recommendations and experiences welcome. 

A couple of things about my wife and me:

* We live in a different country from our inlaws. This means that we have a different time zone (+5 hours from them) and will have limited options when dealing with in-situ situations.
* We are kind of well off as one of us could afford to stop working - but I think this would seriously affect our mental health as we are stimulated by the ""corporate"" life. 
* We are both early thirties and plan to have our first child in 2023.
* We are both from different countries, so going to live with my inlaws is off the table. 
* Our families are living in different ""stages"" right now. My inlways are soon to be in their eighties while my parents are in their sixties. My wife was a late pregnancy."
"My frail widower father is in poor shape; he can’t (or won’t) do anything himself.  He can’t even get himself out of a chair without help.

He has 24/7 caregivers at home, but otherwise he does not want visitors (other than his children) and declines invitations to do anything or see anything.  All he does his sit in his chair, watching TV.

Question: if you’ve had an elderly parent who is in poor shape and does nothing other than sit in a chair, watching TV, how long has that gone on?

In my case, he’s never been interested in doing anything other than piddling around the house and watching TV.  But now he’s a widower and in very poor health.

I’m just curious how similar situations have played out.  We want our father around for as long as possible, and happy, but spending a life parked in front of a TV, without human contact (other than children and caregivers), does not seem to create happiness and a long life.

Thanks."
"My widower father has 24/7 in-home caregivers.  We gave each regular a $100 gift card.

On Christmas Day and the Sunday after Christmas, two substitute caregivers came.  They don’t regularly come.

Should I give them a tip (a gift card); if so, is $25 or $50 reasonable?

My father lives in a beautiful, large home in an expensive neighborhood and the caregivers must know that he’s not poor, so I don’t want to come across as cheap, as these caregivers are all wonderful and at some point I expect to see them again.

Thanks."
"Preface: My wife's parents are her biological grandparents. Her biological parents were removed at age 2. Mother (""Susan"") is on oxygen, has difficulty seeing and hearing, cannot travel. Father (""Bob"") is stubborn and is possibly developing alzheimers. Both over 80. 

While saying goodbye tonight, Susan expresses to my wife that she feels trapped under Bob's assistance. Susan feels unsafe/uncared for, and that Bob is getting aggressive when he gets frustrated with her requests. Not physical. Wife speculates caregiver fatigue. Susan does not feel like she can communicate this all to Bob. Susan feels like she is at her wits end. Wife is so close to them both, that it tears her up. Wife is also at wits end. 


Wife and I decided that we had ""car trouble"" and are now in  Susan and Bob's house tonight and tomorrow

What do I do? Reach out to Hospice? Try to get Wife power of attorney? Guardianship? Do I find wife alawyer? 

I just want to help my wife. Help."
"Yesterday I arrived at the hospice house at around 6:30 in the morning and went directly to the room where my mother was, unresponsive, breathing, but just barely, it seemed.

I stayed with her through the day. I talked to her, I played some music, even sang to her a little bit. She didn't even do as much as flicker an eyelid in return, but I stayed nearby, wanting to be there when her moment came.

Hour by hour, I sat in the darkened room, listening for a change in the rhythm of her breathing.

At about three in the afternoon, there was a sudden stop. I sat for a bit, and then I stood over her, my hand above her mouth, but I didn't sense anything. I called the nurse, and just as the nurse arrived Mom gasped loudly and the breathing resumed. ""It's ok,"" the nurse said, ""this is normal.""

Although it might be normal, it didn't happen again. The hours continued to pass. Four o'clock, five, six, seven, eight. I was feeling the weight of the stress of the day, and finally I had to admit I was doing no one any good by sitting there.

I made an arrangement with the nurse on duty to call me if anything changed and at 8:40 I went home.

At 9:20, I was called back. Mom's breathing had shallowed, perhaps it was time. My wife, practically crawling out from under a pile of unwrapped Christmas gifts, joined me as we returned to the hospice house. 

Less than an hour after I had left, we were back by her side, but the breathing had steadied. Now it was 10 o'clock, now 11. Nothing was changing and I had reached the limit of my endurance. I wanted so badly to see things through, but I had no more energy, and those packages were still waiting for attention. We agreed that Mom might go on like this for quite some time, and that we chose to devote our time to the living.

I spoke to the nurse, saying, ""We need to go. I'm going to say my goodbyes and tell Mom I love her, and kiss her cheek and look at her one more time, but then I'm going home. I'll call you again early in the morning. If she's still alive, I'll come back, but if she's not, please follow our instructions and just tell me when I call.""

I woke up slightly before 4:30. I called, and learned that Mom had slipped away just after midnight and had been transported.

I called my brother and when he picked up, I could muster no words. There was just this long silence and he understood. She's gone. Finally I found the ability to speak and was able to give him the facts. We exchanged condolences and shared our sorrow.

I spent 2021 caring for my parents, and now they're gone. Although I would have liked to be by my mother's side when she passed, as I was with my dad, I think Mom was waiting to be alone. She truly would have disliked anyone carrying on over her.

Now, I believe, she has been restored to my father's side. High school sweethearts in 1948, they married in 1951, then Dad was drafted and Mom went to live with her sister while Dad served in Korea. After that, they were never apart for longer than a few days until Dad passed in July.

The past few months were horrible for my mother. Despite my efforts, she was miserable without Dad. She carried on sometimes, and sometimes not, but now the struggle of loneliness has passed.

Because of the season and the current travel challenges we will not have a service immediately. Instead, we'll see if we can wait for a better time.

I'll post here another time or two as I deal with the wrap-up. After that, in a way, it's ""graduation day"" for me. I'll write more about that, too.

Thank you all for your prayers and good wishes. It's time to go be with family, to reflect on God's gift during this holiday season, to turn to lights and colors and good food and, I hope, laughter, despite our enormous losses. It's time for a new birth for our family. It's time for Christmas."
"My parents adopted me when they were in their late 40's from the moment I was born. As I got older in my teenage years, I knew that I would have to see and accept early on that my parents' age was catching up to them and that I would hear about more medical conditions they needed to take care of. Now I'm 25 years old and my dad's going to have his second kidney operation and has to go through another treatment for clogged blood vessels delivering blood to his brain. 

Seeing my parents get weaker at a young age was something I had a hard time accepting and I wish I was more mature to talk to them about it, but just thinking of it makes me cry. I wish my parents were younger so I could have more time to achieve things they could witness; so that I could work and earn money to treat them to nice things; so that maybe they could attend my future wedding and perhaps even see their grandchildren. I pray for this all the time. 

I still live with my parents but in a month I'll be doing my masters and work abroad in the long term. I don't know if I'm making the right decision to leave or if I'll regret this move later on. I don't know if I'm being selfish but I really think by studying and working abroad, I'll be able to grow independently, earn more money, and be able to have emergency funds just in case my parents have any medical needs in the future. The salary in the Philippines is really not much, to be honest. 

I'll be gone for 2+ years before I can visit. I don't want to say this, but seeing my dad's condition, I'm really really hoping that he will be ok and that I see him again after my studies when I can visit."
"Mom has a spinal cord compression that is caused by cancer. She was placed on hospice care but we were unaware of the fact that someone needs to live with her in order to start the hospice visits. We thought assisted living would be the best option but we were denied. She's mobile and able to dress bathe and feed herself, but we understand things will progress. She's been dealing with cancer for about 12 years now and we're not sure if moving in with her is our best option. Are there any other options that are more accommodating? I know it's a stressful time for anyone going through this no matter what option is chosen. Just trying to determine what the best route for her care and everyone's stress level could be."
"I heard horror stories online about home caregivers for senior citizens.  But I’ve been staying with an elderly parent at his home and the caregivers are wonderful people, a million times better than the typical staff member at his nursing home before.  They’re nice, seem tuned into him and are just kind, caring people.

What am I missing?  Maybe they’re nice and helpful because I’m here, too?  

When I return to my own home and it’s a parent and the caregivers all by themselves, then things change?

Or are some- perhaps many- home caregivers just wonderful?"
"I feel like a terrible person, but here we go. My mom is 66, widowed, and in poor health (COPD and CHF). She has *always* been bad with money,. Long story short: since my dad (sole provider) died 16 years ago, it’s just been a rollercoaster of my mom coming into large sums of money, burning through them, then having periods of very low income compounded by medical debt. Then someone/something miraculously bails her out and she starts living large again. She owns her house outright but it’s falling apart around her because she’s done zero upkeep on it and lets things like leaking toilets or an uncaulked shower just go on and on without intervening. 

I’m in my thirties and have a family. I personally (separate from my shared finances with my spouse ) have some savings I could use to help. We live less than an hour from my mom. I have two siblings, one near with little financial ability to help, and one far away who has more money.

This week the boiler in my moms house went out and can’t be replaced without asbestos abatement. She spent one night there with no heat in 30 degree weather (refused to go to a hotel, refused to spend the night at my house or my siblings because of various excuses), but thankfully her HVAC guy got a temporary fix going for her. Eventually though we’re looking at $20k minimum to keep the house livable or else just selling it as is for probably very little. I don’t know where my mom could afford to live if she sells, because I don’t trust her assessment of her own finances or her ability to stick to an established budget.

I know if I invited her to live with me even temporarily she’d be pleased to spend that time with her grandkid, but…..I just don’t want her here. I get along with her decently but frankly have no desire to be any closer with her emotionally or physically than I already am. I’m uncomfortable and irritated just thinking about it. And I also don’t want to use my money to bail her out and support  her. 

She is a well meaning person and wasn’t abusive or anything, but I just can’t seem to muster a sense of concern or obligation toward her. I just feel frustrated and resentful. Am I the only one?"
"Mom is in rehab after a broken pelvis and medical issue hospitalization. The ""best in the area"" rehab center is good for the actual rehab but severely lacking with everything else. 

I'd like to figure out what issues are unpleasant, but within standard of care and what issues are Medicare or State regulation -reportable. I cannot find the right magic words to make the search algorithm gods work in my favor. Perhaps y'all have some ideas? 

South Carolina, USA, if it matters. Thanks for any help"
"We got married a decade ago. We knew that we'd end up in this situation sooner rather than later. She has been diagnoses with white matter disease and she is exhibiting signs of dementia. Her mobility is a critical issue as she falls a lot and cannot walk unassisted without serious risk. Going to the bathroom also requires some assistance.

I legitimately can't focus at work because I'm always worried about her. I have cameras at the house but that doesn't do anything for prevention and I can't always be looking at the feed. We adopted a child years ago who is now 17 and does school from home, but he is mentally disabled and unable to assist with anything other than walking her to where she needs to go.

We are in Iowa and I know that IA Health Link through AmeriGroup (Managed Care Organization) can compensate family members to care for elderly family members, but this is through Medicaid. My wife does not have Medicaid, she has Medicare and she is a veteran. I'm not sure where to start. Does anything know of programs designed for this? Do I just apply for Medicaid for her? We do alright financially but if I quit my job to care for her, it wouldn't be the case anymore.

Thank you to anyone willing to provide information that might help."
"I don’t even know who else to ask. My dad used to be an executive making a good amount of money. Then he was forced to retire early from his company. He decided to move to a tiny town to spend time with his aging mother who has dementia, because doctors thought she only had a few months left. That was 3-ish years ago and she’s still going. Since then, he has burned through so much money to the point where he couldn’t pay his phone bill and the utilities got shut off in his house. We have no clue where the money went. He has struggled to hold onto any kind of job. He was fired from his last job because he just stopped working in the middle of the day (he was a kind of delivery driver), left his car in a pharmacy parking lot, and walked a few miles home. He left important packages in his locked car and his boss apparently had to hire a locksmith to get them. We’re learning this through the grapevine, because we live 15 hours away. He won’t tell us the truth about anything. He told my sister he abandoned his car because he saw a mouse in the engine(????). We thought it was drugs, but my sister visited for a few days and said she didn’t find anything that would indicate a drug habit (I’m not ruling it out though). If he needs to drive somewhere that’s an hour away, it takes him 5 hours. We don’t know why. He sleeps for hours at a time during random points in the day. He has sleep apnea, is bipolar, and has a host of other health issues. He had a history of drug use 20 years ago. I was talking to him on the phone last night and he said he was sitting in his driveway in his car and he saw a man in his kitchen window. I told him to call the cops. He said he would. He didn’t sound super freaked out either. Then he said there was a cow. And they were drinking beer. I asked if a cow was drinking beer? He said, “no, the people in my kitchen are.” He says a few more sentences and then mid sentence asks me “what did the radiologist say?” I asked him to clarify. He said “what did the radiologist say when you dropped the fabric?” I asked what he meant and he snapped back to reality and said he must’ve dozed off or something. The people being in his house makes sense because apparently there’s been random people breaking in because he adopts these “rehabbed” drug addicts and they take advantage of him, but I’m wondering if he’s just hallucinating now. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do with this. Sleep talking/spouting gibberish in the middle of a conversation is new to me. He isn’t even 60 yet and this has spiraled so fast. He used to wear $400 dress shoes and now he can’t even keep the lights on. I can’t get honest answers from him and our distant relatives that live near him aren’t super helpful either. My sister and I can’t take him in, and we don’t have a ton of money either. How do I handle this when he lives so far away? Just feeling worried and a bit lost."
"any suggestions about how to encourage him to go out on his own. he is fit and has strong bones,"
"My mother-in-law is declining fast, and we've realized that having Power of Attorney would make it much easier to make decisions. However, we live on opposite coasts so getting documents signed in person will be difficult (especially with the holidays and Omicron). I've been scouring for resources but everything seems contradictory. Has anyone here managed PoA without being in the same state?"
"Today my mom visited after her doctor's appointment. She smelled very bad, like it's been months since she bathed or washed her clothes. I could smell her across the house. She usually only showers once every two weeks, and that's never been enough, but this was worse than usual.

She's stubborn and won't take advice from anyone. She says her body stopped producing odors after menopause, but she's mistaken. I felt like I needed to say something to her, especially if she's going to doctor's appointments smelling like that, but I chickened out. She was already mad that my teenagers wouldn't sing Christmas carols for her (songs they don't know, from a religion they don't believe in), and that I hadn't picked the perfect gift for her.

I don't even know how to bring up the odor thing. Any time I've ever tried to tell her something she doesn't like, she flails her arms and screams at the top of her lungs and runs out of my house. She doesn't have dementia, she's always acted like this."
"Backstory: mom had a stroke/car accident last year, i dropped everything to move into her home despite my own while putting up with her partner. she is barely able to stand some days, cannot walk nor use the bathroom on her own. in the last 2 months, she has fallen due to her partner's negligence  


But this time it was my fault she fell hard, landing her sternum on the wheelchair arm rest then dropping to the floor. normally, i have her stand up with help/guidance from a gait belt, pivot her butt to the left since she has no use of her right arm, then sit. i got her to stand while i stood behind the wheelchair, no gait belt and she swiveled right. i should have done better! we managed to get her up into the wheelchair but my heart sank. i don't know what'll happen if something goes wrong. she may end up in a nursing place sooner than we'd like....."
"Today my mom left the beautiful sunny apartment for the last time, transported on a gurney to an ambulance and then to an even more beautiful hospice house, where upon examination, the extremely kind doctor advised me that Mom has five to fourteen days to live. She explains that sometimes things just shut down, but sometimes people like my Mom who fall and break hips develop pneumonia because they can't roll over well and fluid builds in the lungs. Only time will tell, but to me I'd say it's likely she'll go faster than two weeks.

This particular hospice house is only a few years old. Each room is private and very comfortable, and around the resident rooms are lounges and little nooks where people can sit, and wonderful outdoor gardens, places for contemplation. 

My dad was there when he passed in July, and I paused and looked into that room, now vacant, to remember Dad's final days and the last time I held his hand.

Mom's room is across the hall from that vacant room. She's under heavy medication, including morphine. I sit and gaze into her face. Her eyes slowly open, and I'm not sure if she perceives she's in a different place, so I tell her because I don't want her to be disoriented or afraid. I say, ""Hi, Mom, we've moved. This is a very nice place with really good nurses who will give you the best care you can get."" She seems to understand, or to be so sedated that she doesn't care. She closes her eyes again.

A clergyperson of her faith is called in to give her the last rites. She opens her eyes briefly and seems to perceive what's happening. When it's over, she falls back asleep.

The doctor discontinues all meds except for morphine and some cognition-related ones. No point in heart medicine, certainly no point in controlling cholesterol or in taking multivitamins.

Because of Mom's hip injury, she cannot be raised up to be taken to the bathroom, and she cannot easily roll over to be changed, so pull-ups don't do the job. Instead, they tell me, a catheter is better. I authorize the catheter. She falls asleep after that's placed.

During her sleepy periods I'm on the phone, advising family members, relating what the doctor has told me and what's going on. Mom still has one living sibling, a brother, two years older than she is. He lives in Idaho. I call him with the news and this Korean War veteran Marine with three purple hearts breaks down.

My brother, who was just here from another state up until last week, volunteers to return if there's anything he can do. There isn't, and it's Christmas, so no, we've got it covered. We'll have a service in early February, maybe. We won't do that without him.

Then she wakes up. I see her pale blue eyes again. She reaches her hand toward me and I take it in mine. That same hand delivered some pretty convincing swats to my behind years ago, but I never doubted for a minute that they were earned and that I was loved. Now, it's frail and tiny. She whispers, ""Going soon."" I say, ""Yes, Mom, but not for a while yet."" She grimaces as if disappointed that it can't be right now.

She falls back asleep. She's gone two days now with only a few spoons of soup. No more eating, just sleep. Things are shutting down.

I sit in silence with her for a while longer, then, convinced that I can do nothing more for her this evening, make my way home. I'll be back early tomorrow."
"Of your elderly parent?

I’m not sure how to cope with the unknown one day to the next. 

She’s not yet on hospice. But it wouldn’t be unreasonable to put her on it.

Also, is there another sub i could ask this sub in?


Edit: now I think about it, terminal is 6 months or less and she could theoretically live a few more years. Which is part of the problem - they don’t know and the not knowing part is what is hard to cope with."
"He just got out of a surprise week-long stay in the hospital after a sudden surgery. I received a piece of mail from his insurance company today stating that they've denied covering any and all hospital stay/surgery expenses. The reason they've given makes zero sense. I'm so angry because I know my recovering elderly father wouldn't even understand what to do with this information if I wasn't here. I cannot believe just how greedy this insurance company is, trying to dupe my elderly father into paying for something they clearly should cover. We've both been through so much and right now we need to focus on his recovery, not figuring out how to jump through hoops to appeal a decision that has no substance. 

I hope they rot it hell."
"My dad is feeling very lonely these days, I get that. He was *always* a miserable shit on Christmas, and I don't honestly enjoy spending a lot of time with him. But, he is asking if he came come over here for Christmas day. I wasn't planning on having anyone, but okay.  My biggest concern, however, is how reliant he is on his walker, and how immobile he is without it. We live in a raised ranch house, with a tiny entry way. When he used to come over, when he was much more mobile and only used canes, he was terrifying on our stairs. I really don't believe he could do it. It's only 7 steps, but he wont even be able to make it up the front 2 steps to get into the house. He has always struggled the most with those. 

I'm trying to figure out how else to have him over and wondering if anyone has any suggestions? We do have a garage that is flat to the ground, obviously, but there won't be a washroom accessible for him, plus, it's currently forecasted to be -4C and snowing. We could set up some electric heaters, but again, doesn't solve a washroom (he's been suffering from recurrent UTI's, so an accessible washroom nearby is mandatory.)

We can't go to his place for several reasons. 1) he's a hoarder. Not a filthy one, it's just that there's junk every where and my husband can't handle being in that kind of environment  it makes me really sour, too. 2) he has a cat, to which we are all very, very allergic. 

So how can I safely support him in getting up and down the stairs? Or can you suggest something else?? 

Adding a note to say, we live in Canada, and do not have Amazon Prime - I won't be able to order anything in time for Christmas day from there, if someone was doing to suggest any type of harness from there.

Thanks in advance, I'm stumped."
"Today my poor, widower father…kept bugging me about returning an Amazon purchase RIGHT. NOW. so that he’d get his money back.  

Even though the return date is February.

Even though I was in the middle of work meetings (online).

Even though I told him that I would get it done by the end of the day.

He has his home health aide wheel himself into my home office so he could watch me until I left to go to the return center.

We love our aging parents: I am spending a week with my father to make sure he’s not alone, and in good care.

But dealing with misbehavior, or even annoying behavior, still shouldn’t be necessary.

I told him that if I was creating problems with the return, then I would be better off at my own home, 600 miles away.

How do you keep your cool?"
"Hello,

This is my first post here, and I am feeling totally lost. My mother is in her early seventies and was forced to retire a few years ago. Work was her entire life, but she was showing up late/in the middle of the night/missing meetings and half the time they couldn’t understand the work she turned in. She denies all of it.

My mother has always been a very angry person, who is extremely defensive and has always been messy - since her retirement these behaviors have increased tenfold. I don’t even know what to call her. She isn’t really hoarding so much as she throws her trash directly on the ground and leaves it to rot. The showers and sinks are filled with trash. She sleeps on a mattress surrounded by trash, I’m talking a year old take out. She basically only gets out of bed to get more take out food. The garbage is several feet high in some places despite several cleaning attempts and it is hard to breathe. 

We have confronted her multiple times that she needs help. We have even gone to the doctor with her, but she says we are exaggerating and kicks us out. She is able to act normal when necessary. She says therapy is for weak people and cleaners are too expensive (she has the money for it and we have offered to pay).

She fell and broke her leg last week and my sister and I are at our wits end. I don’t even know who to contact. Neither of us want to keep cleaning up after her with no thanks, but we also do not want to find our mother dead in a pile of garbage. 

Has anyone experienced something like this? We don’t know how to get power of attorney or force her into assisted living because she puts on such a good show in front of any professionals. 

Any advice would be super appreciated."
"What the title says. I don’t know if our home would be considered acceptable or not for a senior with walker mobility. I want to put in a stair lift for my aunt so she could stay in an upstairs bedroom next to mine, and right near a bathroom with a walk in shower and grab bars."
"Myself and my siblings are so frustrated and yes mad. My mother has what seems to be dementia /beginning alzheimer. She knows she has issues. My dad (who isn't in the best of health) does everything for her and the house. And he too has tried to convince her to go to the doctor's office. 

She makes him cancel any doctor appointment she has.

What have any of you done in this situation? We can't force her to get help as she still has some mental capabilities"
"My father has 24/7 home caregivers. He and I will be at home on Christmas Day.

Question: do you give your home heath aides or other home caregivers a day off on Christmas?  

I feel badly making them work on Christmas Day, if they want to be with their family.

But maybe they are used to it and plan around it?"
"Mom fell Saturday and again on Sunday. She apparently re-injured her hip (see my posts from March this year) and is in enough pain that the hospice allowed her to be given morphine. She can no longer stand, she cannot roll over in bed. There will be no hospitalization because at her age and in her condition the only thing they could do for her there would be surgery, and in her demented and weakened state that is not a feasible or wise option.

The current plan is for her to be transported to a hospice house on Tuesday, not for end of life necessarily but for a five day respite period where she'll be attended by nurses with much more expertise than the caregivers have in the assisted living facility.

After that we will make a new determination as to whether she should stay at the hospice house, enter a skilled nursing facility, or perhaps move from her current apartment into the facility's memory care wing. The one thing we can be certain of seems to be that she will not move back into the assisted living apartment, so this is the end of the beautiful dream I had for my parents when in March we moved them into a sunny 700 foot apartment, surrounding them with their pictures and possessions. Tonight, my wife sits up with Mom; I'll have the day shift tomorrow. 

There's so much uncertainty right now. All we can do is wait to see what direction things go from here."
"You readers are likely of an age to understand the nuances, that’s why I’m asking here. 

My brother was in a serious car accident and almost died. He survived. My 72 y/o mom was at the hospital every day she was allowed. 

My mother, a week after my brother’s surgery, had a heart attack. She also survived, with a stent, and was released today.

( It appears she had a rare reaction to her vaccines that played into it. In our province, the booster was only available to her group as of last week, she did not take it anyhow as she was in hospital.)

COVID  case numbers (esp the new, massively more infectious  variant) are going up here like everywhere. Apparently 2 vax is not enough. 

My brother is feeling a little better and decided to go to a *child’s birthday  party* where there were “lots of kids” - who attend daycare, school etc -  because his partner wanted them to and “it’s been planned for weeks”. There is a 0% chance anyone wore masks at this party. 

 In our area, there are caps on private gatherings (10 people) as of tonight. Party was yesterday.

My brother intends to attend other Christmas functions. His partner’s sister’s party on the 24th. Planning   is tight because of his partner’s relative’s partners. He wanted to see our Mom on the 25th. 

So it is now too late for him to get a PCR test before the 25th. He refuses to swap days. It is apparently also too late to do rapid tests to see our mom early, on the 23rd (they’re ineffective until symptoms would show up apparently? And that would be ~ 5 days after exposure?) 

So now they are saying they would do Jan 7 (another holiday for our family) instead. 

Bear in mind he almost died, my mom almost died, and all she will want to do is see him and his kids (unfortunately the only grandkids). 

I asked him why in the fuck  he went to the party yesterday when our mom is vulnerable (lung and heart function being intimately related). He’s furious, wants to cut me off his family, etc."
"My mom recently had an accident, one which resulted her in the hospital. Due to complications, her condition worsened which sent her into the ICU on life support. She thankfully is now out of the ICU but she had a serious case of delirium. 

The doctors don't know how much she will recover...it's just a wait and see situation apparently. She's only in her 60s but due to problems with alcohol and various types of abuse over the years she has ended up where she is unfortunately.

What I'm doing:
I'm currently visiting her everyday (including when she was in the ICU). I'm talking with her, holding her hand, consoling her, etc. We even had a heart to heart today where it seemed like she had a brief moment of clarity. She still remembers who she is, who I am, but many other details are lost to her right now.

What is the best thing that I can do to help her? I don't know if I can be a full time care giver... especially with my house being a 2 story house. I honestly feel lost and don't know what to do. 

I'm praying my Mom gets better...it feels like I've lost a part of myself so quickly...its a tough reminder of how precious life truly is.

What do I do Reddit? Continue visiting her? Anyone have any experience on potentially becoming a care giver (specifically in this case of when she can be discharged from the hospital)?"
"Anyone else filled with extreme sadness over the situation of your aging parent?

For my whole life, until this year, I was afraid of my father; he was hard to live with and we never had a relationship at all.  He had exploded one time when I planned to come home for Thanksgiving and he had charged me for visiting.  So I figured that he hated me.

This year, my parents’ beloved Standard Poodle died.  Then my father fell, broke bones and was in a nursing home for months.  Shortly after he fell, my mother suddenly dropped over dead.

Now my father is all alone, largely immobile and a widower.  

I feel horribly for him.

I moved to his town and visited him every day in his nursing home, and my brother and I have gotten 24/7 home care for him.  And we travel 600-900 miles every week or two to visit him and go to doctors’ appointments with him.

A senior care agency said that they were surprised how involved my brother and I are.  But that’s what one should do for a father. 

But I feel so sorry for him.

I’m somewhat sorry that we had no relationship until this year but that’s in the past and there’s no benefit to thinking about that.

Anyone else feel the same towards a parent?"
"My grandmother has total urinary incontinence. She currently uses Depends, but still has leaks almost every time she stands because of the amount. She says it is no longer just with standing though, and will also ""go"" just whenever, out of her control. I've bought washable cloth pads to put on seats instead of chucks. What products, whether other briefs brands, or just different types of products in general, do you recommend to help someone with urinary incontinence have more dignity and less noticeable accidents? She also says she wants something to help with the smell.   
We do not live nearby (like, across the country, but not for too much longer, as we will be moving to them soon), and she is rewearing clothes for a few days and just drying the urine with a blowdryer until she has the energy to change clothes. I know changing clothes would help with the smell, and washing the seat pads more often would help, but she cannot do those things right now.   


This is my first post in this group, and I was so thankful to come across it yesterday!"
"A little background she has had a lifetime of heart problems, valve replacements and a pacemaker, pulmonary hypertension so she’s on oxygen, as well has Multiple myeloma and uses a walker

She lives alone and I live 30 miles away so i’ve been on her all year that she needs help to no avail 

The Monday after thanksgiving she fell out of bed in the middle of the night and had to get taken to the emergency room, she was in the hospital for 2 days while they made sure she didn’t have a cardiac related episode and all she did was kick and scream that she wanted to go home

So they let her go home but she was in no way ready, I got her 5 steps through the front door and she just fell right over like she had no strength whatsoever. So back into the ambulance she goes and right back to the emergency room. 

She fractured her pelvis and had bleeding in her brain so she’s been in intensive care for the last 2 weeks

Initially it was supposed to be for a weekend and they started talking about rehab centers, but she is NOT getting better

Thankfully the brain bleeding has stopped and cleared up, But beyond that shes weak, is refusing to eat (luckily one saint of a nurse keeps on her all day trying to get food in her) and now she’s starting to be really confused and not making sense. Visiting her doesn’t seem to perk her up at all (sadly it’s just me, there is no one else) i’ve brought her favorite foods and she eats a small bite and won’t take more. They try and sit her up in a chair but all she does is cry that it hurts and all she wants to do is lay in bed all day

I’m scared she’s not getting better, and I’m REALLY scared they are going to push her off to a nursing home/rehab where she won’t get any care and will just languish in agony all day 

I’m reaching my limits and i’m mentally exhausted and i simply do not know what I should be doing to make this better 

Any help/advice/encouragement is appreciated"
"Hi everyone,

My grandma passed away earlier this year leaving my grandpa, who recently turned 97, all alone in their house which they had lived in for 70 years. It was clear to the family that he needed more and more help. I always thought of aging as being linear but it is not. It's gradual and then there are sudden drops to some new level, then gradual, then a drop again.

I have been astounded at the amount of attention and time it takes to take care of such a small guy (as he's shrinking every day!).

First of all, there's essentially becoming CFO and getting control of all of the finances. Then there is the management of different doctor appointments, house calls, upkeep, pills, etc. And it's so expensive. 

We tried this for a while but eventually it was too much and we are now moving him into an assisted living facility and are selling the house.

I see all these issues as becoming more and more pronounced over the next 10+ years as there are going to be more elderly, more people to take care of, and as it gets more expensive to do so.

So I had a number of questions (and sorry for length but once I started typing I realized I had way more to say). I would like to find ways to make this process easier and more manageable. Luckily my parent was one of five kids so there were lots of people around to help but for others:

1) Were there any software tools you used that made managing finances easier?

2) Were there any software tools you used that made managing care easier?

3) Were there any software tools you used that made managing communication with the family easier?

4) Was there anything you used or anything you really wished you had?

5) Anything that was really helpful for community resources? I.e. we had so many questions as we went through this process. Even in selling the house and how that affects medicare/medicaid, etc.

I feel like this is an area where some stuff could be built to really help people out. If anyone would like to get in touch people comment here or message me.

Thank you!"
"My dad (72) has had Parkinson's for over 20 years. He was able to stay at home up until recently, thanks to my mom taking care of him full-time. But a few years ago his health really started taking a turn. Earlier this year, he fell and broke his femur. After going in and out of hospitals and rehabs, my mom and I decided it's not safe for him to be at home anymore. He's currently in an assisted living with enhanced care and seems to like it enough, though I think he's lonely and grieving the transition.

I'm 24 and have two siblings in their 30s and 40s from my dad's first marriage. They have a somewhat rocky history with our dad and my mom so there's always been some tension, but up until a few years ago they would regularly come visit. But once dad's health took a turn, I feel like they disappeared. Maybe their visits just felt so much more sparse because of how intense it was. Plus, then the pandemic hit and one of my siblings lives across the country. It's been me and my mom taking care of him with no help from them and they barely even call dad (and never my mom, for that matter).

I understand not wanting to give up your own life to take of someone else and I get that they have a complicated relationship. But I wish they would be a LITTLE more supportive. I have brought it up a couple times now but nothing has really changed. I know my mom has tried talking to them too. Sometimes I think I need to have a serious conversation with them for my own mental health (and to preserve our relationship), but then I'm not sure if it's my right to ask them to do something they're clearly not willing to do. And to be honest I feel like it shouldn't be my responsibility, though that doesn't change anything.

Has anyone else gone through this? Do you have any suggestions for how to handle it? Or suggestions for how I can process my feelings on this? I can feel that I'm also carrying some of their complicated history with my mom and am not sure how to release it. TIA."
"My grandfather is 77, he raised me like a dad when my parents couldn’t. He lives with us in our house (I have two kids and a husband). He was helping me pick up my youngest from daycare so I could get some extra time to finish course work for university, until one day he didn’t come back on time and instead a cop car showed up at my house instead. Turns out he got in a minor accident while picking up my daughter (no one injured) and when he tried to get out of the car, he said he couldn’t move his legs and fell/rolled out of the car. They had to take him in an ambulance to the hospital because he couldn’t walk and wasn’t making much sense (insisted he didn’t need to go to the hospital, for example). They ran some inconclusive tests and he got his license taken away until he can pass a driving test and get an all clear from his doctor. So far the doctor has only diagnosed him with minor cognitive impairment and nothing physical. 
He says he is worried he had some kind of stroke because it was like he blacked out and then when he came to he was temporarily paralyzed in his legs. But they said he didn’t have a stroke. He is upset that the doctor doesn’t seem determined to get to the bottom of it and he’s scared that it will happen again. 
I don’t know what to think. A part of me thinks he just hasn’t come to terms with getting weaker and having his senses decline (he is almost completely deaf now and has typical vision problems for someone his age). He was feeling under the weather the day the accident happened, but as he has throughout his whole life, he just wanted to ignore it and do things normally. Maybe he was just weak from having a cold and pushed himself too far, got dizzy, no crazy explanation needed. But on the other hand, maybe there is something else going on and I should be pushing harder for answers somehow. I don’t know what I should do. Even if he does get his license back, I’m worried I won’t feel safe with him driving the kids ever again until I have a clearer answer. I tried to talk with his doctor, or the hospital, but no one will talk to me because of doctor patient privileges. Need some advice, please!"
"TL;DR My grandmother has been hearing my voice in the middle of the night when I’m asleep. It’s not me talking, it’s not my wife, there’s no one else in the house. What do we do?

This has been a point of contention for about two weeks now. 

I live with my grandmother, and act as her caregiver in a lot of ways - I make all the meals, I do laundry and other chores, I drive her to appointments and anywhere she wants to go. 

The routine at night is pretty much this: she goes to bed about 9pm. I bring her water, close her bedroom door, take the dog on a last walk and then go to bed. Sometimes I do a little picking up around the house, but pretty consistently, I am in bed by 10 or 10:30.   I read a little before going to bed. Usually, I am asleep by midnight. My wife works most nights, but on the nights she is not working, she is usually in bed with me about the same time. We talk at little in bed, but we try to keep it quiet, and mostly I read while she plays a game on her Switch. 

My grandmother has been hearing my voice in the middle of the night. She says that she recognizes my voice though she can’t make out any of the words. (Though, maybe it’s just a case where she won’t tell me what she heard, because she did tell my wife that she heard me say that I have needs, and those needs aren’t being met.) I keep telling her that it’s not me she’s hearing, that I’m usually asleep by midnight, that I don’t take late night phone calls or visitors, but she just shakes her head at me, in that “I know you’re lying to me” kind of way. It doesn’t help matters any that she is paranoid and constantly convinced that my wife and I (and everyone else around her) are lying to her and keeping secrets from her. 

I do think it’s a good idea to set up some cameras in the house. There is an attic that no one goes into, so it’s not totally unreasonable that someone is living up there and that’s what she’s hearing. Additionally, we had discussed setting up cameras a few years ago when a bizarre series of events happened in our driveway. (I’m making it sound more dramatic than it actually was. We found some items no one recognized pretty far up our driveway, and one time I found a stranger’s phone in my car.)

I’m typing this at five in the morning because we just finished having a talk where she had gotten up because she heard me talking. I only woke up because her stairlift beeps as it gets to the bottom of the stairs. I once again had to tell her that I had not been awake, that I hadn’t been talking to anyone. She brought up the idea of her hallucinating, only in the “I’m not hallucinating and I’m not making this up!” kind of way. She did add that she knows she’s not hallucinating because she can feel that she has total mental clarity, and her doctors sometimes comment on how sharp and clearheaded she is for her age.

We don’t know what to do here. How do we convince her to maybe get a mental evaluation or her ears checked or something? What’s the next step? Where do we go from here?"
"I don’t know what to get my father in law for Christmas.  They are in assisted living, so it’s a small residence.   he was just diagnosed with Parkinson’s this year.  He’s still got his hearing and eyesight, and his mind is sharp.  Any suggestions appreciated!"
"I've thought about it. What she needs is a light that flashes in her living room when the phone rings in the other room. A wireless, bright, flashing light. And another light for her bedroom.

Anyone heard of this? Or have I just invented something wonderful?  :)"
"I don’t know what to do, I feel so broken.  She’s the only parent I’ve ever had.  I was with her until the end, and stayed with her until the funeral home came. 

How do I got to sleep tonight knowing she’s there all alone.  

 I miss her so damn much."
"This feels really silly to ask but here we go. My grandparents are starting to lose their memories and are rapidly declining. My mom is their primary caregiver right now and it’s becoming too much. My family has been trying to talk to her about getting them more professional help or taking them to an assisted living facility. However her argument is that there’s no place they can do and stay together. They live in Florida and I’m wondering if anyone can tell me if that’s true?

She said that if they need different care then they can’t stay together. One is showing more signs of dementia than the other and she claims that no place will allow them two different levels of care under the same roof. I have no idea if that’s true or not and am wondering if that’s a real thing?"
My parents are early 70s. My mom is reasonably healthy but my dad is functionally disabled. Let me explaine. He is a terminal alcoholic and has utterly decided to give up on life. He is never really there but does in deed have his faculties. He refuses to take care of himself and sits all day on the couch drinking.  He will not shower nor do the bare minimum to facilitate my mother. This is a slow torture for my mom who is now defacto care taker. I don't even know the first place to turn.  Caring for him is impossible but he is not really disabled nor mentally impared

"My mom (75/F) lives alone in a rural area and she's asked about being able to wear her phone on a lanyard for when she doesn't have pockets. The big concern is falling. I think a phone would be too heavy to wear on her neck.

I've looked at those medical alert bracelets/etc. and they all seem to charge $30+ a month.

Are there any non-subscription watches that just have the ability to call 911?

Or a very simple to use smart watch where she could call 911. 

She has tracphone right now, so I'm looking to switch her to a monthly cell provider and get her a new cell phone, too."
"Hello. I’m looking for some help or advice. My elderly mother had three strokes back to back and is being admitted to assisted living. In the midst of all this, her wallet went missing and someone bought a few thousand worth of gift cards at Best Buy which drained her deposit funds for the assisted living place. I’ve stopped the cards and we’ve gotten the funds together elsewhere. I started the paperwork for POA but I feel so frazzled like I am going to forget something important. Does anyone know of a list I could find somewhere of things I need to get in order?"
"Mom forgot to take a Tupperware box with some cookies in it out of the oven and turned on the stove. Tupperware melts and burns too. Dad was there first and said it was actually flaming a bit. Was out by the time I came down from my office. So, no more storing things in the oven. Really have to watch her now I guess as there was an incident awhile ago with a dish cloth on a burner. Nothing bad happened in either case but she is slipping mentally and knows it. That is the worst part, she is taking it hard. 

Looking at those special switches for stoves now to cut the power. Hardest part is telling her we need to do this sort of thing. 

Just needed to vent. I know you all understand."
"We plan to move back to Metro Vancouver to take care of my aging parents. They are relatively independent now, in their late 70s and middle of 80s. I do have a 2bed small apartment in East Vancouver. I am looking at my options of purchasing another housing:

1. sell the apartment and buy a house with two suites - quite a hassle of selling, buying with crazy house price - good for taking care of my parents, raise little kids with grandparents - potential conflicts from daily life (I will be working from home) - hard to draw a boundary.
2. keep my apartment for my family of 3, buy a ground-level townhouse/apartment for my parents. maybe in the future buy another townhouse for us with more area - either sell the small apartment or keep it for rental- easier to maintain the boundary between two households,   
 \- down the road, I may need to visit them daily or leave them when extensive care is needed - some travel time for weekly visits. The kid may not have a  strong connection with grandparents.

Any thoughts? TIA"
"She turned 77.  I am ill and will not be with the family today.  I did call her and she supports me not coming but I do miss her.  I will see her when I can.  

I am grateful she is still in decent health and glad she can be with family members.

My dad is 82 and still with us.  Both my parents can be on their own.

I have seen a doctor, I don’t have Covid, and am being treated for bronchitis.  I am hoping to see the family for Christmas.

I wonder if anyone else feels sad when their parents get older.  I  am 54. Thanks"
"My 87 old mother pretty much self sufficiente has a person who helps her with shopping, errands, medical receipts and sometimes drives her somewhere. I recently discovered that due to medical reason this persone is not vaccinated against Covid. She regularly perforrm swabs and always wear a ffp2 mask. My mother has already got the third dose of the vaccine. I am worried about that situation but as my mother refuses every other help I don't think I can find another persona she will accept"
"UPDATE: Dad passed around 3:40 this afternoon. Thank you all for your kind words. Though I am sad, I am relieved that he is no longer suffering. And, as I thought, I wouldn’t have made it in time.

I posted a while back about my dads condition. Things have deteriorated and his wife just informed me that his liver has shut down and it will be maybe minutes, maybe hours after they unhook him from everything he’s currently hooked to. I last saw him Tuesday. 
I don’t know what to do. I am currently about 3.5 hours away with my husband. My husband cannot leave right now, and I cannot leave him with no transportation. I could try to rent a car, but considering all the time that takes, plus the 3.5 hour drive (if there are no delays), I doubt I would make it before he passed anyway.
Knowing all this, I still feel like I’m supposed to be there. Like I will be judged if I can’t make it right now. 
My dad and I were not close, but I just want his suffering to end."
"Today my wife and I, my brother and his wife from out of state, my mother's hospice nurse, and the director of the memory care facility within her assisted living had a meeting.

With the greatest degree of reluctance, but with a sense of love and protection for our mom, we made the decision that it was in Mom's best interest to move her to the memory care unit at some point after Christmas. We'd move faster but the unit is currently under Executive Order because of one positive COVID test.

Regular readers of these posts know how hard my wife and I worked to get my parents into their assisted living apartment back in March. When they moved in, we envisioned them there for years, making friends, joining in the fun activities, living out their lives together with dignity and joy.

We didn't see how quickly dementia would rob them of the joy of life, and in my dad's case, of life itself. 

Now, the pleasant, sunny, cheery apartment will be emptied out, the remaining possessions of their lifetimes put or given away, except for a final few that will make the move along with Mom. 

There will be no notice to her about this; the way it's done is she's taken on an outing, things are moved, and when she returns, instead of going back to her apartment, she is introduced to the memory care unit. We're told it might take up to three weeks for acclimation, but after that, the new place will be as much accepted as can be. This sounds cruel, but it appears to be the way the industry handles these things. For many, they don't even know they've moved, but Mom will know, and having already lost her house and her husband, we believe she will be plunged into depression. Hospice and the facility staff deal with this sort of thing all the time and reassure us that all will be well. We have a hard time believing it, but we cannot go on with her in assisted living, as she continuously requires more and more attention and they have a harder and harder time meeting her needs.

She has called 911 to report a delusion; she has wandered from her room without a walker or wheelchair, she just called to ask why we were late picking her up for her trip to Disneyland. Her behaviors, the hospice nurse says, are not consistent with the average resident of assisted living, but do align with the behaviors of people in memory care. We fought it for several months but it's obvious that it's time.

The story of my parents' move to assisted living is coming to an end. 

The optimism of March unraveled in June, became tragedy in July, and since then has been a downward spiral that's moving faster and faster towards finality.

Many readers have commented to me that they find these posts helpful. The decision to place a loved one in a memory care unit is perhaps the most emotionally challenging decision I've ever made in my life. I can't remember a time when my heart cried out one thing so strongly, wanted something so much, but my mind knew something else was right. So desperately I want my mom to be ok in that apartment, to be able to sit in the sunshine and be at peace, but that just isn't happening. Instead, she's distressed, depressed, delusional, and unsafe. Today, unanimously and with love, our family made a hard, hard decision we all believe is in Mom's best interest.

But it still hurts."
"She looks in my eyes and asks me my name
Every five minutes I tell her the same
She smiles but it's cold and dead
And I'm screaming out loud in my head

I dont know where to share but here right now. I miss my mom so much, even though she’s still alive. But I’m losing her, month by month. I’m dreading Christmas. Thanks for reading ❤️"
"Mom came home from rehab Tuesday. She lives alone as me as her only caretaker. She fell that night and was in the ER. Nothing broken, discharged home. I took care of what she said made her fall. Next day she was back in the ER after horrific diarrhea everywhere, confused a a little dehydrated. Part of going to the ER was to talk to social work because she isn't safe at home. All they could do was hand me a pamphlet for a service that helps find placements and told me she is being discharged home.

Thankfully that man on the pamphlet is a miracle worker, and we found respite care that can take her today. I slept on her sofa and she is currently sleeping on a full brief because she won't let me do anything and she is unwilling to even try to get up. Fun.

I understand where the hospital is coming from on this. They are at 94% capaitiy.  She had no medical reason to be kept overnight, but the system yet again fails her and me for there being nothing to keep her safe for one night.

Shoutout to our Community Mental Health for talking me down off a metaphorical cliff in the middle of this. I am lucky that that is something that is mostly working where I live. Also some great staff at the hospital that expedited paperwork to get this going - I made sure to thank many people, because they didn't make this broken-ass system"
" 

Hello all. Just wanted to post and tell you Mom died. How is it such a shock? She's been sick 20 years, I knew it was coming. Guess the shock is in the fact she's not here any more and it feels so strange!

Anyway, wanted to say thank you for your support and just the knowledge that I was among people who know what it's like. Just that was a great bolster to my mood and endurance.

Y'all keep the faith. One foot in front of the other, just keep swimming. You can make it. <3 <3 <3"
"My Dad has had problems using his laptop since forever. I can clean it up for him, and two days later he's filled it with toolbars, and random unknown software. He inevitably fried his computer a few weeks ago, and just purchased a new one last week. He took his hard drive to somebody to get his old information put onto a USB drive for him, and when I went to show him how to plug the USB into his new computer I realized that his BRAND NEW laptop is once again already filled with toolbars and software that he never knows how it got there. 

Is there ANYTHING I can do to prevent this from happening? How do I dumb down his laptop so he can only do the very basics."
"Since my last post, November 22, Mom fell (again) and hit the back of her head. In the week that has gone by since then, there has been another serious decline in her mental/cognitive state. Tonight, for the first time in my life, my mother didn't know me.

Well let's back up a bit. As regular readers of these posts know, my dad passed away in July, but my mom has never accepted this as fact, at least not for long. Sometimes she cries because he's dead, but other times she cries because she thinks he's alive but has abandoned her, or worse, that at 90 years of age, he's taken another woman and they're up to no good.

For example, for several nights since her fall she refused to sleep in her own bed, choosing the couch instead because ""THEY are in there,"" or ""they WERE in there and who wants to sleep there after THAT?"" She's amazed, she says, at how quietly they come and go. ""I never hear them; they're so tricky, they wait until I'm asleep.""

One night, she says, she waited in her wheelchair by the entry door, so she'd be sure to catch them. ""They didn't come that night,"" she reported, ""I think they heard the television and it scared them off.""

Well this in itself can be distressing to her, but recently it escalated. By refusing to sleep in bed she got a sore back, so there was a physical consequence, which isn't good, but here's the capper:

On Monday morning my wife and I were hoping to leave town for the day but before doing that we chose to stop in and check on Mom. Good thing we did, because she was on the telephone to the real 9-1-1, alerting local authorities to the fact that my poor deceased father and his imaginary girlfriend had stolen her nightgown and bathrobe and that, despite it all being right there in her sight, they had also stolen her furniture and were evidently going to bury it in a hole in the lawn outside her window!  Fortunately she lacked the ability to tell the authorities where she was, so she handed the phone to me. I apologized to the dispatcher and told her I'd do whatever I could to avoid this happening again. The dispatcher was friendly about it; evidently this kind of thing is common. I notified hospice and they decided that some Haldol (an anti-psychotic drug) was called for.

More Haldol was given Tuesday morning. Mom was angry and aggressive. Neither one of these reactions can be found on the list of Haldol's side-effects, so it likely wasn't the drug. She told me that if she caught Dad she would hit him as hard as she could ""in the b----s"" (ouch!) This is totally out of character for her.

Later in the day, she looked again at my dad's funeral card and saw the death date, and began to grieve. She said,""why have you not told me he died? Why did you keep it a secret?"" I didn't defend myself; I knew the truth and she wouldn't understand that it was never a secret, and sure enough, by this morning she was back ranting about Dad being out all the time, and wondering where he was getting the money to carry on as he was.

I do my best to follow along and help her, but because of being there for her, I still haven't really completely grieved over losing my dad, and it pains me that Mom thinks and says such horrible things about him. He loved her to the end, they had a happy 70 year marriage, and yet each one of them in their dementia has accused the other of awful behaviors.

So finally to this afternoon. I found Mom going through her dresser in search of something. She was just talking along, when she mentioned a woman's name and said, ""she talks all the time, just like your mother does.""

""What? You're my mother!""

""I certainly am not!""

Remembering the Teepa Snow training, I don't just tell her my name: ""Do I look familiar to you?""

""No.""

""How about my voice? Does that sound familiar? Does anything about me at all feel familiar?""

""Well, you look like your father.""

""Yes Mom, everyone always says I look like Dad.""

""OK, yes I know who you are.""

So it was just for a few seconds, but there it was. Ironically, tomorrow will be the one-year anniversary of the day my father didn't know me.

Later, Mom was mumbling. I moved closer and said, ""I'm sorry, what did you say?"" She said, ""I was talking to the cat."" (There is no cat.) ""I told him he was lucky that he wasn't there.""

My brother and his wife come in from out of state tomorrow. On Friday we have a meeting with the facility and with hospice. The topic will be moving Mom out of the beautiful apartment my wife and I had set up for my parents in March, and into the confines of the memory care wing. On the one hand, from everything I've written tonight, it's obviously past time. On the other, she'll have to leave her things behind and move to much smaller and darker quarters where I predict she'll be safer but miserable.

I don't see any winners here.

Those who have read my posts all this year can see the progression from guarded optimism to getting my parents all set up in the nice apartment, to my father's rapid decline and passing, and now to my mother's failure. Two weeks before Dad died, I watched him try to eat a sandwich with a fork. Tonight I watched my mother try to eat a sandwich with a fork.

I don't know how much longer she has, but for now I'll be there several hours a day, doing what I can to assist her and just be together with her, savoring and cherishing each moment, even if she doesn't remember who I am."
"Facts: 

Mom was hospitalized after 3rd fall in 4 months; now in rehab. 

Mom wants to age in place, but has been extremely slow at getting her home safe and appropriate to age in place. 

Mom is a high functioning hoarder (no trash, lots of furniture and stuff all in its ""place"" and enough room to move, but not safe with a walker and no room for people to get her into and out of her bed, for example). Lots of tight turns and needed things tucked in small corners. 

We'd like to fairly assess if her home is still an option for her. 

Rehab will only send out someone for a safety assessment within 48 hours *after* discharge. We don't want to get a ramp built if the home is totally inappropriate for her. We will need the ramp to get her in the house. 

The place who were sending aides a few hours a day does not provide a safety inspection service. 

What do we look up or what type of place should we call to figure out if it is even possible to d/c her home? 

Location: USA, SC if it matters
Thanks for ideas."
"My mom, who has had a long history of persistent comorbidities, has been in the hospital for 6 days now (and counting.) Accompanying my mom to the ER is not a novel thing for me and, in fact, some of my earliest childhood memories consist of late night visits to the ER. But this time it all feels different.  

I'm an emotional wreck and I'm not sure how long I can hold it all together. I feel ridiculous that I'm still coming into work during all of this, pretending as if I care about any of these work emails and e-vites; it's not like I can concentrate on anything for more than 3 minutes anyway. And I feel guilt and shame when I try to hang out with friends and find some reprieve for my restless soul. It's all hanging over me, this tremendous cloud of sadness and frustration and guilt. 

 Thanks for letting me vent."
"Hello all,

I'm glad to have found this subreddit, my family is in the middle of planning for aging parents much sooner than expected.

My parents had tentatively planned on moving to a retirement home together in the coming year or two, knowing that they'd each need different levels of care as they age. Dad recently had a stroke and is now facing significant mobility, memory and cognition issues. It is clear than dad will need skilled nursing and will not be able to move back home with mom. Dad is still in the hospital but will likely be discharged in a week or two. Mom is in pretty good health and can likely live independently for another 5-10 years. Of course, we'll also start to think about a long term plan for her, but for now, the more pressing issue is getting a place for my dad to land.

I have been encouraging mom to reach out to an elder lawyer or financial planner. In the meantime, I wanted to reach out to you all with some questions just so I can start to understand the system better. 

We'll likely be finding a skilled nursing facility that also has Medicaid beds. The likely scenario is that we'll apply for Medicaid long term care for dad, and rely on Community Spouse Resource Allowance (CSRA) and Monthly Maintenance Needs Allowance (MMMNA) for my mom. It's likely that we'd blow through my parent's savings in a year or two paying for skilled nursing for my dad.

My parents currently rent an apartment, so unfortunately, they don't currently have a house as a 'non countable asset' that my mom can hang on to.

I understand the importance of the 5 year lookback period (and again, will be encouraging my mom to find professional advice). However, I'm wondering about what is allowed *after* snapshot date (which my understanding is when my dad first was hospitalized). Specifically, I'm wondering if it might make sense to work on finding a small 1-bedroom condo for my mom to buy once we get my dad moved in to skilled nursing. The goal would be to have her live somewhere nearby the nursing home and be able to visit my dad often. I'm hoping that the purchase of a home could come out of my parent's savings and not my mom's Community Spouse Resource Allowance, and that the purchase of a home could be done as part of a 'spend down'. I've found very little online about this:

[https://www.elderlawanswers.com/spending-down-assets-to-qualify-for-medicaid-12003](https://www.elderlawanswers.com/spending-down-assets-to-qualify-for-medicaid-12003) says:

>""Applicants for Medicaid and their spouses may protect savings by spending them on non-countable assets. .... A Medicaid applicant can spend down money on anything that would benefit the applicant. Following are examples of what a Medicaid applicant may be able to spend money on:

I can't find much more information about this aside from the two links posted above. I'd love to hear if any of you went through similar scenario and whether you've been able to purchase a home for your 'community spouse' parent."

"TLDR: my grandma doesn’t want to leave the house, can only walk short distances with a walker, doesn’t use computer/smart phone. Lives with my dad who works part-time. What can be set up to enrich her environment or activities she can do in her own?

Context: She didn’t socialize much pre-pandemic, but she used to enjoy going out to restaurants with family. Post-pandemic she almost got in a fight when we tried to take her out for ice cream. She only leaves for doctors appointments. She reads the newspaper, watches the news on blasting volume (bad hearing but won’t wear hearing aids), sometimes crossword puzzles, and smokes. Online activities/apps won’t work due to not understanding technology and lack of hearing aids. Doesn’t like math games. Likely won’t want to learn a new craft. 

My ideas so far: *1. a raised garden bed in a 4 ft tall box. She can be wheeled out to it, and weed/prune/watch it while sitting in her walker-chair. I’ve already made this and she seems to genuinely like it.
    
  *2. Outdoor measuring tools so she can see what the day is like even on days she stays inside. (Giant thermometer/rain gauge/garden stake weather vane/moon phase tracker).
    
 *3. Volunteering from home. At the start of each month see if she’s interested in writing a few letters to troops/hospitalized kids/etc. In November she can make paper snowflakes for a children’s hospital/ charity. Might give a sense of purpose. 
     
*4. Backyard citizen science. Have a journal chart where she can record weather/flower changes/etc. Would require some assistance from someone else to digitize/email in her recordings. 
     
*5. Write-in book club. She refuses to go to the local senior center activities. But I talked to the director who said she could get a copy of their book club’s book, read it on her own, and send in a letter of her opinion. The book club would read it and send a letter back to her of what they thought of the book. She could interact with people without actually interacting with them. 
    
 *6. Butterfly kit each spring. She can handle this level of cleaning, and even if she doesn’t, it’s simple enough that my dad shouldn’t feel stressed about cleaning it (he’s busy and wouldn’t want the responsibilities/time involved of a normal pet). 

Any brand new ideas or extensions to what I listed? The environment enrichment (flower box, weather instruments) might go over better than activity ideas (crafts, book clubs, etc) because she can elect to completely ignore the activities. I’ll take any ideas regardless! Thanks for any feedback. (Edit: we also have 2 regular bird feeders)"
"I am an only child.  My mother was a stay-at-home mom, so we are very close.  Now, my parents are in their 70s and 80s.

I moved clear across the country to California about ten years ago, for work.  I got married, have been working hard at my career (which is pretty location-specific -- I have to live where I do) and I have really established my life here in CA.  Between work and also allocating time to visit my wife's family out of the country, I get about a week, *sometimes* two, per year to come home to visit my parents.

I feel incredibly guilty about that.  My parents have never made me feel bad; they say they are happy to see me living so independently.  But I feel envious of other people with their parents in their lives, and I feel like maybe I made a bad decision, putting so much distance between us just for my career.  Every time I do come home, they are a bit older, and I always find things I could have been helping them with if I was around more.

They don't want to relocate closer to me, and if my wife and I moved closer to them, I wouldn't really be able to work in my industry, and I'm getting a bit old myself to drop something I've been building success with and start over (and honestly, there's not much work I can do there).  Neither of them are very good with technology, so we don't really text or Facetime or anything like that.

So... that's the situation.  My parents poured their whole lives into me, and now I worry I am not there for them as much as I should be.  I'd appreciate any advice or your thoughts on my predicament."
"My mother (78) has no long-term care insurance. Between a pension, SS, and an anuity (no cash value)  she earns about $3,400 / month. That is not anywhere near enough for even the lowest level for assisted living let alone skilled nursing. She will continue to get about this amount for the rest of her life.

I (51F) am her only caretaker, and I am facing serious diabetes and kidney failure. She is coming home from rehab today after yet another hospitalization, and the doctors really want her in assisted living. She has enough saved for a few months of private pay, but what then? There is no family who would be able to help, and she drove off her friends years ago.

What are the options? Does it change any if her palliative care team or doctor call APS, which they have said they might do soon? She is insistent that she will not go. I am wondering what other people have done on this situation.

Edit: I am in Michigan

Edit: she went home and fell in the night. We are back in the ER, so that us why I have been away. I guess this is coming at us fast now."
"Could I get a sanity check here?  Am I being reasonable?

A few months ago, my father fell and broke some bones, my parents’ dog died and my mother died.  All at around the same time.

My father was then in the hospital and then in a nursing home.  I live 600 miles away b it moved to my parents’ house (as it was empty) and visited my father every single day in the nursing home.  My brother lives 900 miles away and he also visited frequently.

My father is now back home, with 24/7 caregivers.  So I’ve returned to my home and for the next few weeks am flying down on weekend. My brother is also flying to visit once every two weeks.  My job is really busy now, and so I need to be in the office for the next few weeks (except weekends).  Once work slows down, I’ll move back to my parents’ house for most of the time.

Question: My father is begging me to visit more.  I feel terribly for him, being a widower in poor health.  But I can’t really do more right now.

My brother refuses to do a Zoom get-together, and my father refuses to move and he refuses to have visitors (except his 24/7 caregivers and my brother and me).

So none of them will do more to have more human contact.  

Is my current approach- visiting on weekends and calling every day- reasonable and enough?  

I blew off my mother during the year before she died and now that she’s gone (she died without any warning and was in fine shape until she dropped over dead), I am haunted by my behavior.  I don’t want to blow off my father, even though we never had a relationship at all before.

Thanks."
"My father (81) has had multiple falls. The latest one resulted in stitches on his leg and a possible infection which would’ve required hospitalization (that was avoided & he is now on the mend).
His leg strength has diminished to the point he can barely get out of a chair. Watching him go up stairs is excruciating since he is always in pain & I’m wondering when he’s going to fall again. 
My mom who was always the take control one seems to be depressed and refuses to get help - either for herself or any in home help for my dad, including putting in grab bars for him or having him use a cane or walker. 
To complicate matters, they both refuse to move out of their house. All of us live in different states too so they are basically alone. 
My mom had breast cancer surgery last week. We are waiting for results but it was caught very early. 
My dad has always worked and owned his business for over 50 years. It’s time to close it. He can’t handle it cognitively anymore. He owes the bank a lot of money which my parents will have to pay from their savings. This is making my dad depressed, as he no longer has a sense of purpose and physically is unable to do things he used to enjoy. He really shouldn’t be driving anymore either which I’ve brought up multiple times to my mom. She’s in denial about everything & doesn’t want anything else on her plate (she literally does everything at home). Suggestions to hire a driver for dad or look into free or low cost transportation options are refused. And he’s still driving. 
My siblings and I are helping as much as we can - taking turns going in, taking my dad to his appointments, making phone calls, trying to set up help which they refuse, encouraging my mom to seek out a psychologist, having someone come out to assess their house & make recommendations for safety..
I feel there is a crisis coming and we are unable to stop it."
My mom is getting a knee replacement in January. I was thinking of giving her a holiday gift that’s a pre-care basket. I have no idea what specific things might be helpful after knee replacement surgery. Any ideas? I will try to bring her a meal if I can but we have a new baby and live almost an hour away so it might be a little challenging. She is married (step dad) so she won’t be totally helpless.
"This might go better in r/askdocs, I’m not sure. But hoping someone here has faced something similar. 

My mom (79), who lives with me, has been reporting a nearly constant headache and lightheaded ness for 5 weeks now.  She’s always been a relatively healthy woman, but has run into some bad luck in the past year. Had COVID in January (not hospitalized), fell in our driveway and hit her head and fractured a rib in September (no brain trauma was found by a CT scan), and at the beginning of November, she told me that when I was on vacation, her hemorrhoid busted while using the bathroom and she “filled up the bowl” with blood. 

Since then, she has been consistently lightheaded, weak, and complains of a headache. She always has had low pain tolerance and doesn’t respond well to medications, so this makes her a bit unbearable to deal with lately, as I’m not entirely sure if she’s just being over dramatic and heightening her pain, or if it’s truly to the point where she is resting most of the day while crying or moaning. She does suffer from anxiety as well. 

She had a tele-health visit with her primary doctor maybe 3 weeks ago, who directed her to have blood work done. No abnormalities were found (ex no low blood sugar, hemoglobin ok). Doctor prescribed steroids in case it was an infection. 

Then last week she was referred to an ENT. ENT physician examined her and thinks the blood loss back at the onset of the symptoms has something to do with the pain and she should recover naturally. 

Next day she wakes up in enough pain (and probably massive frustration) that she wants to go to the ER.  They work her up, look at her recent blood work and CT scans and, due to her history of a fall, believe she could be suffering from effects of a possible concussion from September.  Prescribe Topamax for the headaches. Refer her to a neurologist for an MRI, but she can’t get in until March.

This was Thursday of last week. She is reporting that the headaches are declining, but she is extremely weak and still suffering from having a brain fog or wooziness. She won’t ever exactly describe her pain so I have to drill it out of her as best I can. “Sickly” is the best I can get, she describes no nausea, but loss of appetite. 

I have no idea at this point how to handle it. I feel terrible that she feels consistently poor, but I want to throttle her for being so helpless and whiny. 

She is drinking 2 Ensures per day, drinking a good amount of water, eating small meals regardless of appetite, trying to get up and move around when possible. She does report feeling better at night after dinner, but then wakes up the next day and the symptoms get worse all over again.

I’m not sure of the answer. She wants to call her doctor and see if they can get her an MRI sooner somewhere else to figure this thing out. Internet research makes me guess that it could be the effects of a concussion or long COVID-19. Her test results tell me there is nothing wrong on the blood work path. 

I’m basically at a loss and hoping for someone with a similar story."
"My sister and I recently moved our elderly mother to an independent living facility near us. I set her up with cable and streaming services, which she had back in her apartment in New York, but she's having more and more difficulty figuring out how to use the remotes. I'm now getting up to three calls a day asking for instructions. And I know it's going to get worse. So I'd love to get some advice from people who've experienced this. I'd like my mom to be able to enjoy TV and streaming services but what have you found is the easiest way to make those accessible to someone who is cognition is slipping?"
"We're in the hospital. He had a surprise exploratory surgery yesterday. Recovery is not going smoothly. BUT thankfully we finally got him on the right meds to manage his pain. They also make him sleep talk/sleep orchestrate (my dad is a musician). Right now my dad is directing and conducting a show with me in his dreams. After everything that has happened this week, I feel incredibly happy to see my dad resting and doing something he loves, even if it is just in his dreams.

Unsolicited advice: don't be afraid to ask the doctors or nurses if there are other medication options. Everyone reacts differently to medication and sometimes the go-to meds just aren't what's right for you/your loved one.

Hoping everyone is well. ❤"
"My mom's got the dizzy's, and anxiety is making it much, much worse. What do I do?!?

My Mom is in her 80s, and has been anxious as long as I've known her. She's had dizziness, heart palpitations, sweating, and other symptoms for over a year. She's had a pacemaker put in, been to the E.R. half a dozen times, and seen countless specialists looking for a ""definitive diagnosis"". I'm sure she's got these symptoms, but it seems clear to me her anxiety is amping up whatever issue she has.

Any thoughts about how to address the anxiety? 

How about the vertigo?"
"My dad is getting ready to leave the hospital after a fall. He wasn't injured, but had some medical issues to check out, so has been there over the weekend. He fell getting out of bed, so we're looking at bed options. His current one makes it hard to place railings and I think it sits up too high. 

He's 87 and lives in the States. He might need help getting out of bed, but he's ambulatory. No IVs or oxygen, etc. 

What has worked best for you?"
"I'm fairly certain at a minimum my mom (72) needs in-home care. After reading about early signs of dementia, she meets many criteria, but she has met those criteria as long as I've been alive (33). Forgetful, repetitive, loses phone/glasses/purse/misc all the time, lack of concentration, apathy, unable (technically has ability but not the executive functioning) to do everyday tasks like laundry/cleaning and cooking, eats minimally (that's a new symptom though). 

She is/was also a hoarder; both parents were but dad has been deceased for many years. I have found the Children of Hoarders subreddit to be helpful. We have done a large clean out of her home so I no longer am concerned about the hoarding making her home unsafe, and she's become immobile enough now that she can't bring in as much into her home, plus she also sleeps at a relative's home and only visits her home during the daylight hours to visit her pets. 

She has a dog and a cat at her home; she has never (all my life; we kids have had to learn how to adult after moving out) been able to regularly clean out the litterbox; she has been unable to train the dog (dog is trainable, mom is not trainable) and it goes potty in the house and has for years. Through therapy, I am learning now that I and my siblings for the last decade have been enabling her by cleaning up the house and animal messes. It has gotten much worse now and she no longer picks up the animal messes due to having foot surgery about 18 months ago, which considerably aged her and made her less mobile; she can gain her mobility back but is unable to exercise alone or go to a gym. That is because she has extreme learned helplessness, all of those around her have enabled her including me; she also does not like responsibility (she told me once she isn't sure women should have the right to vote but I believe she only said that because she personally does not want the responsibility of voting). She can do things but needs constant hand-holding. 

She refuses to have a cleaning person when we kids have all pleaded for her to get one or to even pay for it ourselves. I am definitely upset that she can accept us kids cleaning the messes up but she doesn't think a cleaning person would want to clean it up and is embarrassed of the messes enough that she refuses the help of a cleaning person. I now refuse to continue enabling/being co-dependent.

I initially worked on in therapy setting boundaries that I could no longer be in her home with other people/family as it hurts me too much to see her live/breathe in that filth but I also refuse to keep cleaning it. However since setting those boundaries, my siblings have brought to my/our attention some issues that lead us to believe she HAS to have in-home care -- toilet clogged for who knows how long and she's unable to ask for help unclogging it, soiled underwear lying around the house even though people are in her home (construction work being done). You can tell she's just not well if you go into her home but if you talk to her outside of her home she's just a sweet, old lady that you feel you absolutely have to help because she's a sweet, old lady. She's good at learned helplessness.

What my therapist has told me about in-home care is that if my mom refuses to be assessed for it that I can reach out to her doctor and pass on my concerns to see if an assessment would be doctor-recommended. I do think she would be receptive to it if it were ""doctor-recommended"" so I would emphasize that to her...""I have these concerns, Mom, so let's just see if the doctor thinks some weekly home assistance would be beneficial and it would give us kids so much peace of mind to know you're being taken care of."" We kids have discussed her needing a cleaning person, in-home care, and maybe a pet helper of sorts; we think the best outcome is she moves into assisted living but she's unopen to that currently. 

My questions to you all lovely readers: how does this situation sound to you, and/or how have you gone about obtaining in-home care? Thank you in advance for reading my lengthy post, thank you extra in advance for commenting, and thank you even EXTRA if you send internet hugs as I could use them!"
"I’m at a loss here:

My elderly, frail and widower father lives at home.  He has 24/7 caregivers, plus other household help (housekeeper, lawn care, etc.) and there is an elder care service that is a backup resource.

My brother lives 900 miles away and flies in to visit every 2 weeks, for a day or two.

I live 600 miles away and fly in on weekends.

My father says he’s lonely and wants us to visit more.

I feel terribly for him; our mother died this fall, so he’s suddenly a widower and was already in poor health.

I spent 10 weeks living in his house when he was in a nearby nursing home, and the house was empty.  I was able to work well (my job consists of 12 hour days).  But with so many people in the house now, it’s loud and I can’t work from there.

So my father says he’s lonely but doesn’t want visitors except my brother and me.  But my brother says that if we visit more than once per week, that’s too much; specifically, it’s not “normal or expected”. My brother doesn’t want to do Zoom.  

Any suggestions, other than calling my father every day?

Thanks."
"Hi everyone. I (38f) have my Grandma (82f) recently diagnosed with dementia. There have been signs the past two years but the past couple months it has gotten worse. She is forgetting a lot of basic things and needs a lot of help. She got her license taken away at the doctor and flipped out. She told me she hated that doctor and that he doesn’t know what he’s doing. She’s extremely angry all the time (not like her) and takes a lot of anger on me. She will call family members and say I’m against her and that I’m plotting with my Grandpa (80m) to put her in a rest home. Lately my grandpa has been guilt tripping me because I don’t go over enough or do enough for her. I work a full time
Job in the ER of a hospital In addition to being a single mom to my son (12m) he says she took care of you when you were little now it’s your turn. I literally don’t have the time to be there more than once maybe twice a week. He does the same thing to my brother. My brother is married with two small kids and works full time as well. We are 15 grandkids total. Some of my cousins take turns taking her to eat and spending time with her. My Grandpa constantly makes comments that too bad her daughter isn’t around to take care of her. He’s talking about my mom who passed away 20 years ago. I know the hospital got my grandma a social worker but she refuses to go back to the doctor and even the mention of a caregiver pisses her off. I’m not sure what to do in my situation. I want to help her but feel like I’m in a lose lose situation. For context my grandpa is in good health and lives with her in the home they have shared for 60 years."
"My dad is 65 years old and has leukemia. When we found out about his sickness, he was told he only had a year to live. It's been more than 5 years and fortunately my dad is still alive.

His didn't get chemotherapy in fear it would make him weaker and instead drank maintenance medicine. This worked out though, I know he bared through the pain brought by his sickness. 

At his age I want him to retire and in turn take care of him financially but I haven't graduated and in my country graduating from college is a huge thing if you want to have a secured future.  Because of this he still working to make ends meet at his age and condition. 

Signs of aging are getting to him and in this pandemic. I see it more and more clearly. Having difficulty chewing, having a hard time holding his pee and recently accidently defecating in his pants. It's happened two times. Yesterday and today. 

His still well of mind but his body betrays him. I think we might need to put him on adult diapers. 

It hurts seeing your parents grow old and in pain and there's nothing you can do about it. 

I feel horrible but do not show it. The last thing he needs is pity. 

I hope that it's just diarrhea but it feels unlikely. 
I see my father growing older and older everyday and I hate it. 

I hate seeing him grow thin. I hate that he can't chew well. I hate that he walks slow. I hate that I can't do anything about it.

To anyone who's going through the same or who've gone through the same thing. What is your advice? Or what source or books can you recommend about handling aging parents?"
"We get along well. Potential points of conflict are that we are all plant based, she is not. We are raising kiddo without any screentime, she watches TV. We like in a small house. We have only one bathroom.

"My father died 3 years ago, grandma died last year. Mom is not handling it well. She sits around her house all day alone unless I go see her. Most days she doesn't get dressed. I have really been struggling to try and get her interested in her old hobbies, get her in contact with her friends, go to church, etc. I have been having to clean her house, maintain her yard, and I am exhausted from trying to get her to... Well, TRY. I know she's an adult and her own person, but I also don't want her to fall apart. She gets worse when I don't carry everything for her. I've begged her to get grief counseling but she refused. She was given anti depressants but was not taking them as prescribed so they just ended up making everything worse. Any advice on ways to handle this would be welcome because I am burned out."
"My dad (71) has a degenerative autoimmune disease and is now home after a long stay in a recovery facility. He’s in a wheelchair and off of his feeding tube but he’s miserable and taking it out on my mom. My mom (70) is in great health. She still runs her own law practice and does yoga multiple times a week. They’ve been together for 50 years.

My mom is putting on a good face, but I think that she would leave him if she didn’t see him as her responsibility.

I am located close to them so I try to visit often and take my mom out to lunch/happy hour, but I’d really like to see my dad treat her with more kindness and patience. There’s a lot of love still there, but his attitude is wearing on all of us.

Any suggestions?"
Write out the entire FIVE hour phone ordeal with my father's health supplemental provider today. I cannot tell you the hell that is my life as I care for this man alone.

"My elderly and frail father now has 24/7 caregivers, which my brother arranged.

It’s a spacious house with multiple bedrooms, and my father either sleeps or watches TV.  So there’s not much for the caregiver to do.

Yet I am told that the caregivers generally stay in the kitchen and stay up all night.

Is that how they usually work: no sleep and no privacy?

It seems odd and painful to make them stay up all night; I’d be fine if they take one of the bedrooms and sleep and have time and space to themselves.

Thanks."
"I have a loved one that has been recently diagnosed with dementia. It’s still early stage but Their day to day life is dull, no schedule, no interest in hobbies anymore. I have found a fun watch that I think would bring them joy just to look at. However, I am concerned about the reminder of time. Is it ok and maybe help them through their day or will it be a stressful reminder of how they are losing track of their day ? I want to do something for them that brings them joy"
"My father (a frail, elderly widower) now has 24/7 at-home caregivers.

I’m curious as to what they are typically expected to do.  I would assume:

1.  Cook (we are using an online meal-delivery service to make that easy)

2.  Help the elderly person get up, get dressed and move around.

3.  Help the elderly person with random things.

Anything else?

Is there anything above that’s off-limits and shouldn’t be requested?

Thanks."
"I am not anywhere near the caregiver stage yet, but have had to take my dad to several appointments this year. Thankfully I was laid off from work at the time, but am now back to work.

I also have two special needs kids, one in high school and one in preschool. I do have a sister who lives four hours away, but she is bound by her divorce decree to live there until her pre-teen graduates high school down the road.

Just thinking about the future gives me anxiety. It feels like someone or something is going to get neglected."
"Hi folks. I'm looking for a book about aging. My grandma is very active and health-conscious, she always has been. But she's nearing 80 now and inevitably is getting the signs of aging, but she can't accept  it. She hasn't accepted mortality, nor her body changing.  She's always loved being busy but can't handle the same kind of work day she used to and that bothers her a lot. Hopefully someone has a good book suggestion. Thank you x"
"My wife and I frequently get called upon to help her parents solve various technology issues, usually minor stuff like forgotten passwords and software upgrades, and occasionally more serious malware problems. We have been able to teach them to recognize phishing attempts, and to be suspicious of emails and popups that ask for information. Recently, while helping my FiL with an issue, and doing some routine clearing of cookies and such we happened upon his browsing history, which showed quite a bit of traffic on “adult” sites, enough to explain where the malware on his computer is coming from. My in-laws are old hippies in their late 70s, and don’t seem too uptight about sex or whatever, and my MiL, doesn’t seem stressed about what he looks at. We’re all grownups, we know that most people masturbate, and he doesn’t see too obsessive about it.

I think my real question/concern has more to do with making him aware of the danger that some sketchy port sites on the internet pose to his computer. The responsibility for “having the chat” with him about this is landing on my shoulders, and I want to be able to broach the subject of safe porn browsing, without shaming or embarrassing him. He currently has some pretty serious health and mobility issues, and I know he’s struggled to accept his current state, as he was always very active and athletic, so I don’t want to come across as trying to “take away” some small pleasure that he still has.

I’m inclined to just mention that some of the sites he’s been looking at, without calling out the subject matter too specifically, are notorious for infecting computers with malware, and maybe trying to direct him to more legitimate sources. I'll even set him up with an account somewhere if it keeps him away from the hackers.

On a related note, we have been trying to get him to move his computer out of his dank home office, which is reached via a steep staircase, to a more accessible part of the house, and he is resistant, partly because I think he still dreams about running the business he used to operate from it, but also because (we now understand), he likes the privacy."
"2.5 months ago my uncle had his first stroke and we discovered his stage 4 cancer. His life could have been extended with chemo but his subsequent strokes left him too weak to receive treatment so we started end of life care. Due to his limited resources my family had to step in as caregivers and this community really helped me come up with ways to comfort and care for him, so thank you! Now that my road of caregiving is over I am reflecting and realizing that this experience has really affected who I am as a person. It was the worst thing I have been through this far in my short 31 years on this hunk of rock called Earth. The things I experienced with my uncle and family were just so heartbreaking, maddening, and just so very hard. I usually am the type to reach out to friends to cope but this experience has turned me into an introvert. How could I possibly talk to friends who have never changed an adults diaper, administered morphine, comforted a hysterical man who was certain bugs were crawling on his tv, and more. I am trying to practice healthy self care by working out, baking, and cooking but I wonder if this is a permanent change. How have you all “moved on” or tried to reconcile with who you were and now are? I don’t necessarily hate the new me as I have been reading lots of fantasy but it still feels weird to be the new(?) me and I am wondering if it’s just a coping phase."
"No real context here because I’m in the middle of this with my parent and need to calm down. Trying to figure out if this is some kind of pandemic forgetfulness, mental illness or symptom of a physical illness I might be missing."
"My parents are in their mid 70s and are in poor health, and on top of that, are not very organized. I'm an only child, and trying to make sure I know what accounts they have, etc. so when the time comes that one of them is incapacitated or dies, I can help out. 

Has anyone come across or created a template for listing out their affairs? Sor of like a checklist to make sure I don't miss anything (insurances, financial accounts, wills, medical directives, etc.)?"
"This is a throw away account.

My dad flew out to my grandparents over the weekend because my grandpa is fading quickly. He walked into a really gnarly situation. My grandparents live with my aunt and uncle, and suffice it to say, there is plenty of straight-forward abuse going on. I am not sure how specific I should be, but it is in the form of isolation and exploitation, not physical or violent.

I want very badly to call APS and have my grandparents protected from this abuse. My question is, will that really happen? Or will APS show up, rile everyone up, and then leave my grandparents even more vulnerable? I hate that I have to ask this question.

If it matters, I live in a state where all people are mandatory reporters, but it is not the same state my grandparents live in."
"I (34 female) desperately need advice on how to cope/help with the constant decline of the already bad relationship of my elderly parents. 

So my father (69 male) and my mother (72 female) have been married for 37yrs. Their marriage has never been a very happy one, and we were never short of fights and arguments in our household. I have always been used by both of them as a mediator and a referee since an awfully young age - I'm an only child. Thankfully there has never been physical violence, but my father has always been verbally mistreating my mother, putting her down, belittling her, telling her to leave if she doesn't like things etc, and my mother has always been passive aggressive towards him and basically the cover girl for martyr mother/housewife complex. Needles to say, they both came to me with their personal woes and problems, as if I were their friend and not their underage daughter who could hardly comprehend stuff.

Very long story short, now I'm married myself and live in a different region for the past 5 years, and I have both kept my distance and drawn some much needed boundaries with my parents. I don't visit very often since it causes me too much stress, but I speak daily on the phone mostly with my mum, but also with my dad too. Time and again my mother complains to me in tears about their fights - usually that when things break down at home he isn't willing to fix them/buy new things, that he's name-calling her (she does that too), that he starts yelling at her when she argues with him in public, and today she told me he shoved her away in public when she reprimanded him about something he said to someone in a funeral for goodness' sake...

These are not new incidents, they've always happened more or less, and I know to fill in the blanks and how most of these scenarios truly play out even without me being present. Now me, I'm a fighter and a fixer. I've often suggested she leaves him since she's been unhappy for years - she could afford a small apartment on her pension and her daily expenses - but she's adamant she will not as she's too ""old"" for that.  I've suggested I confront my father on her behalf - like I said, I have some bitter experience with being the mediator, and I don't mind calling out the ugly truths, plus great loud vocal cords - but she says it makes no difference and I shouldn't intervene in ""their"" affairs. I've suggested she at the very least comes visit and stay with us for some of the weekends and I'll pay the cost, again she will not leave the house because ""she will be the one cleaning the mess afterwards"". Well, color me frustrated.

I've discussed the situation with my therapist and her opinion was that I focus on myself and my own mental health, keep my distance, and only get truly involved if the arguments escalate into for example physical violence. But this just doesn't sit well with me. I've asked my mum again today after her long rant if she wants sympathy or solutions, and it seems she only wants to vent and do nothing practical about the situation. But I worry a lot, and it takes a big toll on my own emotional state as well since the whole affair makes me both afraid and resentful.

To summarize. Yes, my father is an asshole. Yes, my mother is a victim that ""chooses"" her own misery - it's actually called trauma bond. Yes, all of us are adults and responsible for our own decisions, but I love them and I just want to help somehow. So any insight on how to handle this mess?"
"It's like some people can't wrap their head around a millennial with a parent/parents that didn't age well. If I say ""I need to leave this place early to go pick up meds for my mom,"" don't then turn around and ask, incredulously, ""How old is she?"" That's not cool. End rant."
"My mom went into the hospital 2 weeks ago in DKA (Diabetic ketoasidosis) and a had a bad UTI and acute kidney injury. She is now on kidney dialysis, she is very weak and cannot get up on her own. They are ready to move her to a rehab. We didn't have much of a choice I told the social worker the top 3 that were close to her house so my dad could visit easily and only 1 was available to her (mainly due to transporting her to dialysis.) Before I can even check them out they told my mom at 9:30 tonight they are moving her tomorrow. Of course there are some terrible reviews especially in the last 4 months, which I'm sure is due to staffing shortages. I know all rehabs have some bad reviews but it's so terrifying to put her somewhere that may not take care of her. The hospital she is at has Covid patients on her floor now so I need to get her out of the hospital quick. But I am so scared. I live an hour away and cannot pop in to check on her easily. My dad is facing a cancer diagnosis we are waiting for results on biopsies and scans next week. He may have a difficult road ahead too and may be unable to take care of her. So many unknowns. So many things out of my control and I am so scared. I am their only caregiver my brother passed away 7 years ago, all of this is on me. Anyone else facing this?"
"My 87-year old mother is having trouble hearing her phone. She's had a hearing evaluation and we're working on getting her some hearing aids. In the meantime, she needs something to help her with phone calls. I’m looking for a device that:

\- is easy to use and connect with a cellphone (docking station?)

\- rings loudly for incoming calls

\- speaker for ongoing calls and voicemails

I've done some online searching but not coming up with much. Does anyone have anything they would recommend?"
"My dad sustained a traumatic brain injury and is now mentally impaired. Unfortunately, because of the brain damage he lacks insight on his condition no matter how it's explained to him and is convinced he's fine. He lives with my mom, who's easily swayed by him and generally enables him. For example, she let him drive the car again before they got the go-ahead from anyone.

After being discharged from rehab he was scheduled for outpatient therapy, but after the first couple therapy sessions, he became convinced he didn't need them any more and canceled them. The discharge notes from the hospital say he's still impaired and his recovery goals were not met. I'm frustrated and scared. Is there anything I can do to convince him to continue therapy when he's so unwilling to believe he's impaired? Should I contact his physician and therapists for their opinions on whether it's safe for him to drive again? I'm very worried he's going to put himself and others at risk."
Looking for an app or website to support with handling care of my father. I ran into Wellthy – but the price tag is $350. Anyone use this service and find it valuable? Is it worth the pricetag? Are there other apps or services that you use that are helpful?
"Hello - This is my first post on here.

To make a long story short,

* I (24) moved in with my grandfather (87) 4 years ago, because I wanted to live close to the college I attended, and he needed some help taking care of the house, so it worked out.
* I was planning on moving back to my hometown when I graduated, but then COVID19 happened and I ended up staying.
* My mom (his daughter) lives 1 hour away, and my aunt (his daughter) lives 10 minutes away.
* Neither of them really come to visit or help out at all, unless there is an emergency (i.e. fall or car accident).
* He needs help doing some household tasks i.e. yard work, laundry, cleaning because of balance issues and not being able to extend his arms, but does most things himself (i.e. gets the newspaper, makes coffee, eating).
* I am the one who is here helping him every day, before I leave for work (8AM), and when I get home (7PM). I make sure doors are closed and locked, make sure things aren't on fire in the kitchen (they have been), pick up things that he threw on the floor to prevent him from falling, turn lights on before he walks down steps, etc., damage control stuff.
* The issues we are having now is
   * Driving.
   * Using the chainsaw.
* Of course myself and my family have told him over and over again we do not want him using the chainsaw, but he continues to. There have been so many near misses.
* Of course, myself and my family have told him we do not want him driving for hours at a time, (he will be out of the house for 4-14 hours at a time driving around his friend who is blind and her son with medical issues, acting as a chauffeur of sorts). (He got into a major car accident around this time of year in 2019 with said friend).

So I need help being assertive and taking some action. I cannot mentally handle taking care of him after another near miss with the chainsaw or another car accident. I feel that we, as a family, need to take action and take things away. My mom and my aunt just tell me not to worry about it because its ""not my responsibility"", but I've been the one hearing and seeing it every day, so if it's not my responsibility, and no one else is doing anything, then whose responsibility is it? It all falls on me. My mom and my aunt have not talked in over 6 years because my mom refused to do anything to help my aunt and my grandfather when my grandmother was passing. So that gives some context...

My first steps, I think are going to be removing the chainsaw from the home, and asking the friend and her son to please stop asking him for rides, especially at night.

Please don't be mean in the comments, I'm doing the best that I can, just need some support/advice on how to deal with this."
"So...I'm on the fence about this because he's maybe a bit too old. I (26F) currently live with my grand-uncle (92M) and uncle (65M).  
  
Both my uncle and I are out of the house all day for work, leaving my grand-uncle with little to do. He used do oil paints/clay (too messy now he says), used to read/watch television (eyes and ears are too bad and our remote setup was too complicated for him to navigate), low mobility so no walking or driving. All he does now is read the newspaper, eat, nap...stare at the yard...stare at the wall...😔  

Maybe I can get the kid-durable case so he can get a good grip and not worry about dropping it. I don't mind sitting down to try to teach him to use it...I just worry he'll give up on it and discard it like the books I've given him. And I'm at a loss at what apps might be good for him.
  
Has anyone had any success gifting a tablet to an aging parent/relative?  
Or any success at different gifts for a similarly aged relative?  
  
Edit: Thank you for the award! Also thank you for the thoughtful responses. They are incredibly helpful,  thank you."
"Hello, as the title states my dad has some swallowing issues, some times he has good days and other times not.
Do you guys have any tips or things that might help him swallow any exercises, food that might be good?

He likes tomatoe soup aswell but the thing is that does not have a lot of calories, do you have any ingredients that I could add to the soup that will be good in calories and vitamins and being easy to swallow?

Thank you! And have a good day."
"I went to visit my parents for thanksgiving. My dad had fallen 10 days earlier and my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer around the same time. 
So - I got off the plane and ended up going straight to the hospital where they said they needed to admit my dad since his wound was infected. I waited for about 5 hours with him in the ER as there were no beds anywhere. They said it could take up to 20 hours or more for a bed. 
After a CT scan, they let him go home with a prescription for stronger antibiotics. 
Meanwhile, the rest of my family showed up for thanksgiving and my mom was a mess (we all live out of town). She told me to cancel the turkey so I did. We ended up with Chinese food since it was too late to reorder! 
My mom is having her lumpectomy on Wednesday and my dad’s leg still looks to be infected and may need surgery. 
They insist on living in the house we grew up in. Watching my dad try to go up and down the stairs is truly frightening. It’s another disaster waiting to happen. 
I fear I will be back and forth on airplanes more often. And when home just waiting for another emergency. 
My sister wants to set up an appointment with someone who can make suggestions about grab bars and a chair lift for the stairs. I know my parents will balk as they refuse to admit they are getting old/need help. 
Here’s the other problem: mom yells at us that nobody lives there, she has no help. When we offer to help she says no! It’s so annoying."
"I’ve been carrying this question/issue in my heart for years, and want to throw it out to the Reddit community. 

I’m almost 40, divorced/remarried, and a happy, full time working mom to a 7 and 9 year old. One brother lives 6 hours away, the other in a very distant country. I live 15 minutes away from mom. 

My mom is 71, divorced, an alcoholic, and judging by her increasingly faulty memory, I suspect has dementia coming down the road (her dad passed of Alzheimer’s).  She lives alone in a pretty crappy apartment because the COL is atrociously high here.  We’ve tried living together, but it’s impossible, due to her drinking. She has made friends but dislikes them. She goes to bingo but complains about it. 

A few years ago I read a book on mom/daughter boundaries, which changed my life. I installed boundaries, and things got better - for me. Mom is constantly unhappy, and to be frank, I don’t want to take care of her as things continue to decline. I don’t want POA for anything. I spent years succumbing to her emotional abuse and don’t feel like I owe her anything. I assist when I can, but don’t want to be a caretaker to her. 

Am I as heartless as I feel?"
We like [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08F11FZNM/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_CVQH7ZZ089P65C83A0F3) but prefer a bracelet or watch alternative so it doesn’t get misplaced. Anyone have recommendations? Thanks!
"I posted [a couple days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/r2iqih/dad_didnt_join_us_for_thanksgiving/) about my dad's stubborn refusal to seek any kind of medical care or deal with his health issues in any way. I really appreciate everyone who offered their advice and wanted to give a little update.

I've had a couple of very long, very difficult conversations with Dad since then. Long story short, I think missing Thanksgiving dinner with the family was kind of a wake-up call for him. We talked a lot about how he's been feeling. I tried to get him to explain why he was ... well, being the way he's been about all of it. At first I was met with more stubbornness, but this time I tried really hard not to let that get in the way and derail the conversation. 

After calmly telling him that I accepted and would support his decision about not wanting any major medical procedures, I just couldn't comprehend why he was allowing himself to be more miserable than he needed to be, it kind of just took the wind out of his sails. He started talking about missing dinner with us and how he hated being a burden to my step-mom, etc. and finally came around on his own to a decision about where to go from here. 

In the end, he decided he would go to the doctor and have tests to at least figure out what's going on, and to decide what to do from there. He would talk to the doctors, listen to all his options and then decide on treatment vs. no treatment. And if his choice is no treatment,  he would get things in order, and do things the right way, when he can make actual informed decisions. 

It's been a huge relief for the rest of it, and in fact he even immediately seemed more at ease, himself.

Now I just hope he doesn't change his mind again before the actual appointment."
"Will try to keep this to the point. My father is 70 and recently broke both hips in a fall at his home. He was hospitalized and received hip replacements for both. He was then moved to a “rehabilitation center” for rehab…it’s nothing more than a nursing home, and a shitty one at that. He has been gotten out of bed 3 times in the past 7 days for ‘therapy.’ He cannot stand or walk unassisted. Last night around 7:30 he lost control of his bowels in his bed. He rang the bell and a staff member came and told him he would have to wait until morning. They did not come to clean him until 8 am. THEY MADE HIS LIE IN HIS OWN EXCREMENT FOR OVER 12 HOURS. He is a disabled veteran and receives VA benefits. I would gladly take him into my home if we could get some sort of home health aides to help. My husband and I both work full time and can’t be here 24/7 with him."
"We (my husband, son, mother, and me) are in France for Thanksgiving.  My mother is driving me insane.

She’s 83 and in reasonably good physical health, but something is “off” mentally.

My issues are nothing like what a lot of you are dealing with, but I’m probably headed there.

My mother is definitely losing her hearing, but it’s complicated by the fact that she spent the last 20 years of her life “tuning out” my father, who NEVER stopped talking. He’s since passed away, and she is content and competent living alone.

Bottom line: I can’t communicate with her, both literally and figuratively. I’ll say something to her, and get no response. When I repeat myself, she either says “I heard you” (but doesn’t react or respond), or she says “I didn’t hear you”. Same room, same tone of voice.

Conversationally, she is infuriating. I can tell there’s some memory loss, but often she’ll come right out and say “I don’t remember because it’s not important to me”. The thing is, there are some things that she NEEDS to remember because they are objectively important - like getting her COVID pass ready when we go in a restaurant or store.

Finally, we had a fight last night because earlier in the day, she uncharacteristically jumped up and took a shower. Turns out she has some kind of intestinal issue that causes sudden “accidents”. After her shower, as she was carrying her dirty clothes to her room, they were literally dripping blobs of poop across the floor. She had no idea. I had no intention of cleaning it up, so I pointed it out to her, asked her what was going on, and told her to put her clothes in the washer. She refused and said she had a plastic bag in her suitcase. She also has adult diapers.

From reading this subreddit, I know that stubbornness and embarrassment are a big deal with older people. So is dealing with cognitive decline, hearing issues, etc.

I just need help with my own feelings. Right now I’m angry, disgusted, disappointed, and frustrated, and I’m trapped with her for eight more days. I have no idea how she feels, and I don’t plan on asking. I’ll only get some kind of vapid response. She’s an intelligent woman, but she just acts oblivious half the time.

I’m not dealing well."
"This is the 5th or 6th time my mom (78) has fallen since July. Third ambulance call (one was just for assist to get her off the floor, no hospital). In each case she has taken unwise steps without hanging on to her walker (or slid off her bed). Today she finally cracked her head open on the wooden arm of the sofa. Blood everywhere but was surprisingly alert. She is still in the ER getting sutures and x rayed and with the state of the hospitals, she will be there all night if they don’t actually admit her.

It seems inevitable that she will keep falling and falling until one day she has the last fall where she never recovers enough to come home. She still thinks she’s doing fine!  

Even if she had someone watching her 24/7 she still would do these stupid moves sans walker. What can you actually do with a senior who won’t listen to anyone and refuses to change their lifestyle?

I just feel like this was an inevitable signpost on the road she is going to go down. There’s nothing I can do except wait for the “final fall.”"
"I truly appreciate any and all advice, even if critical of me. I'm not sure how to make this brief but will try.

Backstory: My father is early 70's, divorced from my mom for 30 years. Has lived alone since. Had always been very healthy (active, non smoker, rare drinker, lean) until about 3 years ago when balance issues started, along with questionable very slight personality shift (doing things out of character, some small questionable decisions and behavior).

Today: My family (me, husband, two young children) is very stable. Both my husband and I have full-time demanding jobs. We live in a nice community and added on to our previously small (1200 sq foot) cape house so that my father could move in. The idea was that he was living alone out of state and had no reason to be anchored to that residence any more. He also bought a condo in FL so he does 6ish months down there. My brother and his family live out of state but only 2 hours away. He and my father get along.

My father moved in August '20. Then he spent 4 months in Florida over the winter and moved back in to our renovated house (in May '21), where he has his own living space and bathroom (no kitchen). 

His health has deteriorated in the past year such that he falls with some frequency, is unsteady/has a frozen gait, and has been diagnosed with Parkinsonian-like symptoms. He recently started a dopamine medication but it does not appear to be fully resolving the balance issues. I do not think the doctor is convinced he has Parkinsons and that it may be another neurodegenerative issue.

Our living situation is not working out. My father has been challenging to live with, can be selfish and inconsiderate of my family's needs, and makes more work for me around the house. I have attempted to help him with his medical appointments and attended a virtual neuro appointment with him, only for him to dismiss and mock my attempts at attending any future appointments. I threw my hands up and am done. I am constantly irritable and low on patience. Occasionally I will reflect and vow to be more patient, but then something will happen almost immediately to send me back to my cold-hearted self.

I used to be very close with my father and had a really strong relationship with him. Since he's moved in, it has deteriorated rapidly. I can't find empathy even when I try. I am burned out. I \*think\* it would be different if he had a cognitive issue or some excuse (for the lack of a better word) for his behavior or lack of behavior at times. But he doesn't, and it's challenging for me to continue making concessions for behavior that is contrary to expectations in a somewhat able-bodied historically rationale, stable and productive man in his 70's.

I feel trapped - we can't ask him to move out. He contributed towards our renovation in exchange for living here. We could pay him back, but that doesn't feel like an option morally. He can't move in with my brother for reasons I won't get into. But this feels unsustainable for me, mentally.  It isn't going to magically get better when he returns from Florida in the spring. We don't even think he should be going for safety reasons (falls), and we told him he shouldn't go, but we are so exhausted from his being here that we aren't going to fight it. What do people do? Just grind it out? At the expense of your relationship with your parent, while also being in their best interest? We know it is good for him to be with his grandkids and important that he has a set of eyes on him (at least until he is unable to use stairs and may need other arrangements). I'm in therapy but nothing seems to be helping because I am so stuck.

What do people do?!"
"My first post here.... boy, this is *fun.* I'll start with a little backstory.

My dad's 75, smoker since his early teens, unhealthy diet, chronic worrier. He had a stroke 5yrs ago which he mostly recovered from. Physically, he was unaffected. Mentally, he was left with some dysphagia that has improved/stabilized over time. His mental capacity doesn't seem to be diminished, really, just a bit slower to access on the communication front. His memory (both long term and short term) is, I would say, good for his age. 

But there is something major going on with his health. I didn't realize how bad it had gotten, because I haven't seen him in person in a while and on the phone calls we've had, he's seemed fine and not mentioned anything. However, recently I learned that my dad has lost a ton of weight, barely eats, has constant diarrhea, loss of bowel and bladder control, and often has blood in his stool. It's now become a daily occurrence for him to be crying in agony over his abdominal pain. 

But dad 100% absolutely refuses any kind of medical treatment or to even see a doctor. He has made it clear to everyone that he would rather be in pain and miserable than go to a doctor - that he would rather die than go to the hospital. Beyond that, he stubbornly refuses to discuss it. He doesn't act like a person who's not capable of making informed decisions about their care. He's making bad decisions, but they seem to be the ones he wants to make. 

I get it. He's almost 76 years old. If he's got some serious medical problem and doesn't want to undergo invasive or exhausting treatments, that's fine. I understand. I'd probably feel the same way. But the refusal to seek palliative care to at least even be comfortable is completely baffling and it's starting to have a big impact on the rest of the family, particularly my step-mom.

Today my dad and step-mom were going to come over for Thanksgiving dinner. About 20 minutes before they were due to leave, dad decided he wasn't going to come. We offered to pack up the entire dinner and drive to his house and have Thanksgiving there so he could join us and he refused, saying he didn't want anyone over. Again, step-mom mentioned seeing a doctor - NO. 

I love my dad. We've always been close, but this is approaching a mind-blowing level of ridiculousness. I've tried to talk to him to understand why he's so adamant about this, to understand it so I could either a) help him see a different point of view, or b) accept it better myself, but the answer I keep getting is ""because it's my decision and it's what I want to do.""

I keep reminding myself that he's an adult and these are his decisions and he will have to live with any consequences of them, to his health or his relationships. I'm trying to establish and hold to healthy boundaries while still being supportive and attempting to guide him to better choices without him feeling like I'm pressuring too hard. Not that I haven't tried the ""tough love"" approach either, but it didn't work and if dad is going to die soon I'd rather our time together be enjoyable rather than be spent arguing. 

But it's hard."
"I went to the assisted living center to visit my mother today and have Thanksgiving dinner with her. Visitors aren't permitted in the dining room so I arranged to have two turkey dinners delivered to us in her apartment. The food was delicious and we had a nice visit, although much of it indicated she was having a pretty bad day confusion-wise. She wondered, for example, why her mother (d. 1992) and my father (d. July this year) weren't present. I just changed the subject but she mentally drifted away even more. Now it was the 1940's and she spoke about her neighbors from 1947 as though they were all around and what they were up to. It's ok, it's harmless, I don't correct her.

After the dessert, she thanked me very much for the invitation and the lovely dinner and announced it was time for her to go home. I escorted her from the table to the couch and she seemed just fine with that. I gave her a hug goodbye and told her I loved her and would see her tomorrow. 

I will cherish today forever."
"Sorry if this has been asked and answered before. My 58 year old mother is, I think, showing signs of Alzheimer’s. I think she has been for awhile now, actually, but it’s getting worse. I’m not sure if she notices a change in herself, but I know she’s aware that other people notice it. However, she refuses to go to a doctor to talk about it or undergo any sort of testing. She’s historically refused to see doctors for any reason, but I think this is especially scary and shameful for her, which I understand. She’s not at a point where she can’t live independently, but I know in an ideal world she should seek out help as early as possible before it gets to a more severe point. I’ve tried reasoning with her on this a million times, but it only serves to make her defensive and feel like everyone is sick of her. Unfortunately we also live halfway across the country from each other. Is there anything I can do here to force her to get help?"
"Just back from a week-long visit to my mum (recently widowed, Parkinsons, always been difficult). Phew! Arguments every day, things to solve (queueing for hours) every day, helped her buy a new phone (she didn't want the model I recommended, despite asking for my opinion, but chose a new model from a new brand), helped her buy shoes (we went shopping for a winter coat), argued some more, took her to a birthday party, etc. She also wails in her sleep, so I got on average 4 hours sleep every day. Everything is a crisis/point of conflict, so you fall into that lethargy of just saying yes to everything to avoid it (Kobayashi Maru scenario). Exhausting!

And as soon as I arrive back home, I get frantic calls daily: she's activated some accessibility feature on her phone that means she can't use it, that the visa process we've been waiting for for months has failed (and we now have to pay a solicitor if we want to try again), and my sister now insists she mustn't spend Christmas and her birthday alone.  Ok sis, why don't you take her for a few weeks then? Oh yeah, she'll be accusing you of being under some literal witchcraft, and will hound you, your children and your domestic help until you lock her in her room again and she stops eating. Like she did last time... I may let her come here for New Year, but she's not allowed to come for Christmas and ruin that - especially as we never celebrated Christmas as kids!

But after a year of dealing with this, it felt SO GOOD to be back home with my husband again! Just going to do some Christmas shopping with him, sitting opposite this lovely man and enjoying a peaceful meal in good company - I felt like a Sim with an energised plumbob. 

Wishing you all a very peaceful holiday season... <3"
That's all :D
"As an only child, my mom and I have always been close, but I’ll admit to getting frustrated with her in more recent years. 

Ever since I had my children, she’s just gotten so much angrier and crankier - basically, her worst personality traits have gotten more apparent to me. She insists on hating my in-laws for a short list of very minor, stupid (imo) perceived slights to the point of a “look at that bitch eating crackers” situation where everything they do is THE WORST[TM]. They are perfectly normal, fine people and I get along with them easily, but I’ve found myself just avoiding acknowledging their existence around my mom and it always gives me a great deal of stress and anxiety to have to “admit” to her that we are doing something with them and to organize holidays in a way that my mom won’t be offended etc etc…

However, of course I still love my mom and she has babysat my kids a ton and that’s basically all she wants to do. I’ll admit it can be both helpful but also a lot of pressure that my children and I are all she has and cares about in life.

Cut to 2021 - she had a stroke in February and mostly recovered (even though docs initially said she wouldn’t survive) but then had another in august and has been on a trach and, to my eyes, mostly out of it and in hospitals and a rehab nursing home since.

I feel guilty, but a big part of me is relieved that I don’t even have to deal with managing her and the holidays this year … I have felt like it has been a tap dance to ensure she’s happy and not feeling offended every year since my kids have been born and it’s such a relief to have an excuse(?) not to have to do that.

Yes, there are a million other things for me to deal with and be stressed about (how long does she have? How should I handle money and her properties and Medicare and Medicaid etc? Managing her bills and everything. The nursing home constantly opening and closing due to Covid etc etc) but I’m realizing just how stressful it was to manage her emotions and opinions about things when she was well. Like I have this weird feeling of freedom like “oh we could get a dog” or “we could plan a vacation” without me getting that gut twisting sinking feeling worrying about if she would approve and having to listen to her opinions on it.

Yes, I’m nearly 40 and an adult and know I can do what I want and make my own  decisions, but we all know how much the parental guilt trips and anxiety feels I’m sure … and it wasn’t ever like she was abusive or so terrible I would disown her or anything. We really were close and got along great most of the time (perfectly I’d say until I had kids and the in-laws became a point of contention ugh).

Just feeling weird about it all and needed a place to get it all off my chest as we head into the holiday season. It feels awful to admit, but the times when her nursing home have been locked down were a relief to me since I didn’t feel pressured to go visit and sit there awkwardly while trying to tell her things and show her pics with her staring at me with creepy eyes and I can’t tell if she’s understanding any of it. I do feel like she’s in a good place with people who care and take good care of their residents so that helps."
"I tried reaching out to my mom's case manager and to my mom's volunteer aide. There is very little services available for someone in my mom's situation, who has some savings, which is what she lives on.  She doesn't really qualify for anything. And she won't get Medicaid, I guess until she's forced to. So I called her to apologize for losing my temper. I did tell her that I would not be able to do everything for her but we would talk about it another time. I'm going to hire some help and she will have to accept it or not. I can only afford one person 4 hours a week but that is the best I can do and that will have to give me a break. She was very receptive to my apology and she just said yes you were very angry. I told her I loved her and she said she loved me too. I found some support groups for caregivers (their virtual), that I'm going to avail myself of these resources, because I do need help. I hate being in this position. This was nice, but I have to build some resiliency for those tough days."
"Hi everyone,

It's been around a year now since I lost my mom to cancer, and I decided to use what I experienced to help others.

For those of us who have experienced it, we all know how difficult palliative care can be for everyone involved. So I am exploring whether a digital tool can alleviate some of these challenges, and make sure palliative care recipients receive the best possible care at home.

I'd really appreciate it if you could tell me more about your experience as a palliative caregiver through [this form](https://3ir3y62pou1.typeform.com/to/YgeMlQA0?utm_source=reddit_agingparents). This may include family members, friends, neighbors, volunteers or other informal caregivers - irrespective of care setting.

Your insights will shape the solution and help create a better tool for palliative care recipients, and caregivers everywhere - so thank you so much for taking a role in this."
"My mother in her mid-70s has been staying with me temporarily to finalise a real estate purchase.  She is expected to move to her property early next year.


She has been frequently asking the same questions about members of the household, and loves to tell us the same stories frequently.  She still seems mostly clear of mind though and had no issues dealing with the property purchase apart from IT-related stuff that I helped her with.


I had thought her memory is starting to decay a little but an incident today has made me wonder if there might be something more sinister to it.


She had an argument with my wife this evening over something seemingly trivial.  She bought a packet of prepackaged salad, which she had left on the kitchen bench for 2 nights, and apparently put in the fridge some time today while almost everyone was out of the house.  We thought it was odd that she had not put the salad in the fridge but did not want to touch her stuff out of respect.


This evening, she came into the kitchen while we were all there and went to the fridge for her salad.  It is a fridge that also has a ""flex drawer"" in addition to the regular vegie crisper drawers.  She could not find her salad in the crisper drawers but it was in the flex drawer.


She said she was shocked that someone had moved her vegies inside the fridge, as though someone had done it to mess with her.  She asked my wife if she or anyone had moved it, to which she said no.  She also suggested the harmless possibility that my mum had put it in the other draw inadvertantly.

*In my case, where something of mine has not been where I thought it was but within easy reach, it has never occurred to me to take it as some kind of personal attack.  I have just thought whoops I must have put it there or my wife moved it.*

There was a little to and fro but she replied back ""I'm old but I'm not stupid.""  My wife can be a little stubborn but said ""Well then it must have been a ghost.""  My mum then walked to her room, plate in hand and closed the door louder than was probably necessary.


She also seemed to insist that she had not left the salad out on the bench at all, which I find concerning because male domestic blindness aside, I clearly remember noticing the package and mentioning it to my wife and we agreed **not** to touch it.


The salad had been removed from the package and put with a plastic container but had otherwise not been touched.  It was intact.  Nobody had taken any of it.  Everybody insists that they did not touch it.  I certainly did not touch it.  Nobody had anything to gain from moving it.  It makes no sense.


I can think of the following possibilities:


1. My mother actually does remember putting the salad where she did and is trying to force my loyalty away from my wife onto her for some reason by claiming harrassment.  I hope this is not it.

2.  My mother has somehow 'misremembered' what she did with the salad and/or her paranoid reaction to it is a symptom of something worse to come.  This seems the most likely, sadly.


3.  My wife or someone else in the house really did move the salad to harass her and/or cause a conflict.  I really really doubt it.


Is this familiar to anyone here?"
"Hi there, my mom (divorced, 58) lives in Kentucky. I am wondering if anyone (especially in Kentucky) has ever assumed guardianship of their parent?

My mom has a history of benzodiazepine and opiate abuse. It's to the point where she has had several falls and a few car accidents under the influence. Even at her best, her mind isn't as sharp as it has been. She recently had another drug episode, and she has been in the hospital detoxing for a few weeks. A social worker we are acquainted with recommended we - as in her children - could potentially get guardianship of our mom. That way we could keep her from driving, etc.

The thing is, because of her not being there for us for decades and lying to us about her addiction, none of her kids really want to have a relationship with her. She was kind of a crappy mom! She has enough money to live on for now, but the addiction is draining her nest egg, and she could very well kill someone if she keeps driving. The doctor told her not to drive, but she is going to drive herself unless someone takes her car away. And if we do that, she will just get a ride to the car dealer and get herself another one...

I feel like a terrible person, but being her guardian seems like way more than I want to handle. I live in a different state about a 10-hour drive away, but my siblings who live in her town have both flat said they won't be her guardian. Bringing her to my town would not only upend my life, it would reset her progress and relationships with the doctors she has in that town, and she would have to start from scratch here.

I guess these are my questions:

* Can an out-of-state resident be a guardian to an adult?
* What powers does a guardian have?
* What responsibility does a guardian have to a ward?
* What liability does a guardian have if their ward drives under the influence and kills someone?
* What would you do in my situation?"
"Mom (91) is happy and content in her room in assisted living. She’s been there for 8 months after moving from her home where she lived alone after my dad died 30 years ago. She washes her breakfast dishes in the kitchenette. She steps outside to water the plants on her patio. She strolls up and down the hallways. But the brand new care director told us they’re going to give her a cognitive assessment and will more than likely move her to their memory care wing. If we refuse then we’ve been told she will need to move from the facility. Yes she has memory loss, but she’s able to hold a conversation and handle all ADLs herself. I was told by the salesperson that she could stay where she is unless she starts to wander. Unfortunately I have no proof of that statement. 

It took a long time to convince her to move to a senior residence. She’s quite a homebody. Never had friends. Close to family. Enjoyed just fiddle farting in and around her house. Being surrounded by people all day long did not and still does not appeal to her. But when she saw the spaciousness of the room she is now in with direct access to the outside she was sold. She likes to just hang out in her room on her own. Takes meals there most often. She will go down to the dining room and chit chat with the other residents but more often than not she’s just content to be in her own room. 

The memory care wing is not the right fit for her. Did a casual walk through and most folks were non responsive and plunked in front of tvs in the common room. Rooms fit a bed and not much else. There would be nothing to occupy her in her own space. We don’t know what to do. We just feel sick about it. 

Any advice?"
"My father recently passed. My mom is blind and mobility dramatically declined over the past 2 months.  She wants to stay in her home.  I live 2 hours from her and my home is NOT an option.  There is NO physical space in my home and I have an adult child with special need.

24 hour care in the home is $14k/month.   Her money will run out in 6 months.  Her monthly income is too high to qualify for Medicaid and not ever sure Medicaid would pay for 24 hour care in her home..

How do people in her situation survive?"
"I don't know if this is the best place to ask but I thought I'd give it a shot! My parents really enjoy playing dice games with their friends, but are having trouble reading them since the dots are so tiny. I'd like to get them a set they can see better for Christmas, but large-print dice don't really seem to exist. I'm considering casino dice, but they have such sharp edges - does anyone have any recommendations?"
"Dad passed away on July 2. He and my mother had a wonderful marriage that lasted just over 70 years. Dad's dying wish was that Mom would be cared for, and I promised him as he took his last breaths that I would do my best to fulfill that wish.

For the whole month of September, though, I was unable to visit Mom due to an order of closure by the governor of Oregon due to a COVID outbreak ""in the building."" Even though everyone who tested positive was removed from the facility, (so there was no COVID in the building) it had to be shut down according to the order, and during this time my mother, growing less able because of dementia, lost weight to the point where she was on the very edge of malnutrition.

She'd call me, despondent, depressed, in tears, sometimes grieving alone for Dad and sometimes unaware that he had passed away.

Finally on October 10 Mom qualified for hospice, and that meant I could return to be with her despite the Executive Order. I started visiting every day at lunch and dinner in order to be certain she was fed, that the meals were appropriately warmed up (since the dining room was closed) and cut up because she was having trouble doing that. Eventually she regained just over five pounds.

Her mood got better, but her mind did not.

Our training has told us not to correct Mom when, in her dementia, she begins to talk about hallucinations and delusions. Instead, we just change the subject or deflect questions with ""I don't know,"" and so on, but today was the hardest one of all.

Today she was grumpy, and she told me so as soon as I arrived. I asked, ""why, Mom?"" and she unleashed a barrage against the love of her life, my dad. ""He came in here and told me he wanted a divorce. He said he wants to marry someone named Carol. Well she can have him. She'll be in for a surprise or two, I'll tell you. Look what he's done. He sold our car. He sold our house. He moved us into this place and now he's leaving me. I can't believe he could ever treat me like this.""

It broke my heart to see her so upset, but also that this is the way she thinks about the man who loved her more truly than anyone else ever did. Deep down, she knows he died, and she's told me that several times, but she just can't process that and make it real, and now her mind is conjuring up images of Dad doing and saying things that would absolutely never happen.

I wanted so badly to defend him, to remind her that he's gone and innocent, but as I said, it wouldn't matter; tomorrow she'd be right back with more delusions. ""Oh, he thinks he's fooling me, coming in at all hours and sometimes even getting in bed, but always gone when I wake up. I know he's sleeping downstairs"" (there is no downstairs in that building) ""and I guess Carol is with him."" How sad and how painful it is to hear her talk like this and to know that she's feeling emotional agony over how far her life has turned in just a few months.

Last week I asked the hospice nurse if by gaining the lost weight Mom would disqualify for hospice, and the guy looked at me like I was crazy. ""Um, no, while the weight loss qualified her, we now have data that shows she's weakening physically and mentally to the point that this is not going to get better, and she won't be disqualified for the rest of her life.""

Oh. I guess I should have known that, but there is inside me a great big blob of denial. I had it for my dad, and now for my mom as well. 

So now it's time, and some would say it's way, way past time, to face the fact that Mom is dying. It's not happening quickly. In fact, as I see her every day, it's imperceptible. If someone would have asked me how she's been recently, I would have said, ""I think she's stabilizing, sort of at a plateau. She's gained a few pounds, looks and sounds better, I think she's going to be ok for a while."" 

But no, says the hospice nurse, a very nice man probably in his 40's: ""I've been doing this for a long time, and trust me, she isn't stable, and she's not getting better.""

Oh. Again. *But she still sews and repairs her clothes.* ""Mike, no.""

*But she reads the newspaper every day.* ""No.""

*But she said she rearranged her dresser drawers.* ""No, Mike.""

*But, but, but.....*""No, she's not getting better, she's not stable.""

And so now, following so closely upon the death and loss of my father, I begin to grieve for my mother, Even though she isn't gone, she is going.

But knowing this, I take a special joy in each visit. I ask her to sing once more the songs she sang when we were younger. I remind her of funny things that happened decades ago so I can hear her laugh. Sometimes I just sit and hold her hand in silence, knowing that the day is approaching when I won't be able to hear the songs or the laughter anymore, or to hold that hand that has been such a comfort to me.

I remember those times when as a youth I was hit hard by the world, that she was there for me, reassuring, encouraging, reminding me that there was a safe place in my world where I was loved unconditionally. I remember her singing and dancing, using a big step into the family room as a stage. I recall how in 1966 when I got a new bicycle for Christmas, she presented it by riding it down the hallway of the house and into the living room where the family was gathered. I remember how she cried one year when the sweater she had worked feverishly to hand knit for me wasn't quite finished yet and had to be wrapped with the knitting needles still in it. I remember when as a teenager my house was the most popular among our friends because of her hospitality and warmth, and how they presented her with a certificate for ""best baker"" in honor of the cookies, cakes, and pies that seemed always to be on hand. We've talked about all these things, and she knows how grateful I am to her for this and more.

And now it's my role to comfort and reassure her, to make sure she's well cared-for, that she can maintain a semblance of dignity, that any need is met, that she feels safe and comfortable, so it's extra troubling when she creates pain that isn't really there, such as her heartbreaking notion that Dad is alive and wants a divorce. 

But we know that this will eventually pass as well, and by tomorrow it will likely be replaced with something else.

Officially, the countdown has begun. I wish I knew how long we had, but for now, I'll do my best to enjoy whatever time is left."
"Need some help deciding how to help my mom, who is both getting to the point where she cannot help herself, refuses to consider changing her circumstances, and is verbally and emotionally abusive (and has been for decades). 

Some background: My mom raised me alone, as an academic with very little money. While some of her choices when I was young were questionable, she also gave me a really interesting childhood and lots of experiences I appreciate (we lived abroad for a long time, etc). However, she did not prepare \*at all\* for her old age or for the future. When I was in high school, she got her father to buy her a house, so she is housed, which is good, but since I was in college, she has relied on me for money for everything. Her pattern is to demand money, and then use abusive language and/ or lie (""I cannot eat! you are starving me!"") until I gave her money. She was always nice for a short period of time after I sent her money, and I didn't have any other models of relationships in my life, so for a long time I went along with this - meaning that I did not have any savings at all well into my 30s (I'm in my early 40s now). My very rough estimate is that over the years I gave her about 100K. Asking her to do things like make a budget, or setting parameters around her spending, etc always resulted in a slew of attacks telling me that I was a disgusting person for trying to control and manipulate her, and that I would not be alive if it wasn't for her, etc, etc. She has never once apologized for her words. 

Here's an example that might shed some light: My grandfather left me my mom's house in his will (because he did not trust her with it). This was a major issue to my mom, and over the years she constantly pressured me to give it to her. Honestly, it was in such disarray that I didn't want to have legal obligations over it, and she was constantly demanding money to repair it (she lived rent free and I paid all taxes), so I agreed she could have the house with with the stipulation that she use a city program to pay the property taxes (she was eligible for this because she is elderly and disabled), and that she use a Home Equity Line of Credit for home repairs (I agreed to pay the monthly payment for that). She did sign up for the property tax loan.... but she got the HELOC and spent all of it on an international trip (partially for her \[unpaid\] work, partially to the Mediterranean for fun). So... no house for me, no repairs done, everything a mess. 

I've done a lot of work over the years to distance myself from this relationship, and overall, my life right now is really good (I am married, just was able to buy my first home, and have a 3 year old, etc). I've done lots of therapy, I live very far away from her, we see each other only every few years, I filter all her emails into their own folder so I don't see them until I want to look, etc.... while also wanting to make sure she has what she needs to live and is okay. She has no friends or other family -- literally everyone she knows that could support her has written her off because she treats them as she treats me. Every therapist I've ever has has told me that cutting off contact would be the best solution for me... but I'm literally the only person she has and I just can't make the decision to do that. 

Our dynamic changed a few years ago when I found out I was pregnant, and I knew I could not keep on financially supporting her, and afford to take care of my kid. I am now sending her a small amount of money ($250/month) for her to do what she wants with, but not sending any other money. This was when I worked with her on the HELOC and loans for the house repairs (see above) and she used it on a trip abroad. Setting that boundary was a horrific process, but at least it means I am saving now.

The issue right now is that she is getting to a point where she well and truly cannot take care of herself. She cannot walk without crutches or a walker, she's basically not able to drive any more, her house is a disaster. She has no social support network. I also cannot trust her assessment of her situation (for example: she'll tell me she's cold and dying cause she doesn't have not water in her house.... but when I offer to buy her a hot water heater, she says she prefers to boil water for baths and doesn't want a hot water heater). Basically, if things go on as they are right now, I imagine she'll just continue to live in a house that is falling apart, taking care of herself less and less, until she dies. It's miserable, and even with how much she's hurt me over the years, I don't want this for her. 

I've called Aging Services in her town, but basically she has to ask for the help with them -- I can't get them to step in without her asking for it. I suppose I could petition for her to be deemed incompetent - but for her, I honestly think she would be \*much happier\* dying in her home, even alone and through neglect, than being forced from her home, or having me take over her affairs. I am trying to prioritize her happiness over having a miserable life... so this doesn't seem like a good option. I could call Adult Protective Services... but I am afraid that would also just be an option that would force her from her home and make her much more miserable. It would be a huge financial stretch, but we could afford some assisted living situations, but again... she would never agree to move, and forcing her to move would make her far more miserable than she is now. 

So! There it is. Every couple of years I try again... right now she's visiting for Thanksgiving (I paid for her plane ticket, of course), so she could have some semblance of a relationship with my daughter (she's nice to people she cannot yet demand things of). And of course... I get called a ""fucking bitch who doesn't care about anyone"" because I forgot to grab a pair of gloves for her when we left the house. In front of my toddler. And when I tell her it's not okay to call me that -- her response is to tell ""then you need to stop being a bitch"".

Is the best solution honestly to let her die alone in a falling apart house? I think it might be, but that's horrible. Help please."
"Yesterday was the third time this week that my mom has called the ambulance for a panic attack. She has suffered a lot of challenging life situations lately. Her dog died, then her mother, and she had to have major eye surgery recently. She has become increasingly angry and frustrated and has frequent outbursts of screaming and laying blame on others. She has a history of anxiety and unhealthy coping skills. She’s been using sleeping medication and lying about the dosage to the doctor. She’s drinking and smoking a lot more too. She flat out refuses anxiety medication and every time it’s brought up to her she gets angry. Her husband is at the end of his rope and I don’t know what we as children can do for her anymore. She definitely needs something to help her with her stress. 

I just don’t know how I can phrase it to her anymore. She has told me never in this lifetime is it going to happen to her to be put on medication. Both my sister and I are on medication. Her aversion to anxiety and depression meds has been so strong our entire lives. I think that if we would’ve been open to excepting help earlier our problems wouldn’t have become so complex as they are now. I just don’t understand how she thinks that she is above it all and she can’t acknowledge toxic behavior."
"I live in Washington State. I am looking for advice regarding a TEFRA lien that was placed on my mother's home in 2012. Prior to this, we were both living in the home, along with my two kids, and I was her sole caretaker for about 10 years. She has MS and now resides in a nursing home.

I understand that if she is discharged from the nursing home and returns to the house before her passing the lien would be voided. She would like to be returned home if she is given a terminal diagnosis and I intend to honor that wish. As far as the nursing staff is concerned, she is in good health with slight onset dementia.

In the unfortunate event that she passes away in the nursing home, I will lose my house. My name is not on the title, but I have lived here since she bought the house in 2002, paid yearly taxes, all upkeep on the house, utilities, etc. This is my sole residence and my son still lives here too.

Has anyone had experience with a TEFRA lien placed on their home? I would appreciate any advice."
"My grandmother needs 24/7 care. She is in a wheelchair that she can not get in and out of on her own after hurting her hip. She’s been in a nursing home of her choosing for about two years now doing physical therapy off and on but has not improved and will need continued 24/7 care.

She really wants to go home. She doesn’t have a home because her apartment was let go while she has been in the nursing home. She wants a new home. A 24 hour nurse will be too expensive for our family. Is there some type of facility that is like an apartment complex and provides 24/7 care for patients? Just looking for something less facility like and more homey feeling.

She is on Medicare or Medicaid I believe and they pay for her nursing home care."
"Hello,  I suppose I am hoping to get some advice and support on this sub.  I (34F) am originally from the UK but live in Canada now, my mother (67, F) still lives in England.  Our relationship has been up and down over the years, she has had a hard life and is a poor communicator.  The 5 years before retirement were spent on sickness leave because she was recovering from some trauma that was very hard on her mental health.  

She refuses to have a landline and often lets her cellphone run down to no battery and/or no credit to make calls.  She has some hearing damage so doesn't like to talk on the phone.  We stay in touch via Facebook messenger 99% of the time.  She doesn't have any other friends or family around (entirely due to her own abrasive attitude) and the majority of her lockdown has been spent indoors self-isolating, reading books and watching TV.  I have lived in Canada for 7 years and can count on two hands the number of times she has called me in that time, it is always up to me to stay in contact with her.  When we do speak, she never asks me about my life - the conversation is always about her and her TV shows and her food that she is cooking.   I realize she doesn't have anyone else to speak to, but I worry for her mental health.  It would be nice to just have one or two questions about my life though.  I think she sees my relationship with my partner as being what keeps me away from her, when in actual fact, it is her attitude (now, but mainly in the past, she has been verbally and emotionally abusive previously) that keeps me away from her.  

Even after lockdown was lifted, or she was eligible to go out, it seems like she doesn't want to.  There were (are?) food shortages a few months ago in the UK and she was talking about how she doesn't buy any fresh food, even when it's available because she ""can manage without it.""  She has no money issues, and is fairly comfortable cash-wise so it's not that.   She has been telling me she is clearing out her flat so I won't have to clear it out when she dies.  It almost seems like she is exerting some kind of control over her situation through isolating herself. We had a minor disagreement in facebook messenger 5 weeks ago and I was very upset with the things she said to me and took a week to formulate a measured response.  She now hasn't replied to that message in over 4 weeks, but is active on facebook otherwise.  

I am finally sorting out my own alcohol dependence and addressing some trauma that caused my depression, while she is adding a whole other layer of stress onto my life that I just don't need.  I have high blood pressure, anxiety and off/on depression myself and I feel like outside of my relationship with her, I am finally making good progress on those. But then I think about her again and I feel my heart racing and palpitations and depression come flooding back.  On the other hand, I know how hard living with depression can be, and want to help her.  But how? 

I'm worried she had some bad medical news and doesn't want to tell me.  She might have depression, she might have early stage Alzheimers which I read can show up as depression.  She could be planning some outlandish scheme to avenge her previous traumas, I have no idea but I am worried for her (as well as trying to care for my wellbeing).  I read online that you can write to someone's GP and let them know you are worried about certain behaviors, so I am trying to find which practice her doctor is at.  

Any advice for dealing with her, or looking after myself would be much appreciated.  My partner is incredibly supportive but his family is a world away from my own and our emotionally stunted way of dealing with each other."
"
My parents had me when they were 49 and 51, and without getting to much into it, I was raised as an only child. Always thought it was cool having older parents since you you could ask them about historical events and you’d have a first person retell, until my mom passed from health issues when I was 14. My dad lives a couple hundred miles away, alone, and without much of a social life. His health issues and situation cause immense worry as to what would happen if he was hurt and alone. 

I’m torn between living out my 20’s or moving back home to a situation that I really hate (for various reasons) but potentially seeing out my dads remaining years. I feel that it’s either feel guilty about loosing time with my dad or feel guilt loosing my youth. This issue is hard to bring up with my friends and relatives because I feel a lot of resentment towards them for having more time and being closer in age to their parents. I also feel that they won’t ever truly understand the constant worry I have, since I already lost a parent. 

Is anyone else struggling with this dilemma or gone through it themselves? Looking for advice but mainly to feel like I’m not alone. Most people I have met my age that have an older parent have maybe one younger and one older, or at least have both parents. Thanks :’)"
"I posted awhile ago about how to comfort my uncle in a rehab facility. Update is that he was brought home to die. He cannot recover from his strokes enough to receive cancer treatment, stage 4 in his lungs, localized lymph-nodes, and brain. Sometimes he accepts death as a fact. Sometimes he forgets he is dying and asks when rehab is starting. Sometimes he just cries because he is so sad that he is dying and life is so unfair. Sometimes he is so angry he yells and wants to break things (obviously won’t grant the breaking things wish but I wanted to convey the span of emotions). I am wondering if it’s best to always try get him to be positive when he is angry or sad or if I should go with it and say yeah, this Does Suck! Normally when rehab is mentioned I’ll say we are just going to make you feel better at home and that’s enough. Idk, this is my first palliative care for anyone and I just want to make him feel as peaceful and comfortable as possible"
"Hi!

My mother is currently in a rehab center in the US. At the moment, my 60 year old uncle is pretty much camping there during the day and my mother will not encourage him to go. My uncle holds a lot of sway over my mother since she had her strokes and she is quite intimidated by him. He can be very charming to the staff but become violent if provoked. My mother pays all his bils and he lives in a house rent-free that she owns.  Is there anything that can be done to limit his time with her during the day? Only two visitors are allowed per day due to Corona and he will go there from the morning and camp out there the entire day. I have POA but I do not live in the area. Currently, my attorney is drawing up papers so that my cousins can take over POA (my mother has agreed to this as my attorney says that POA should be local and I live overseas). My entire family is very against my uncle due to how he has treated his family and my mother so it is causing a huge amount of strife. He has also put a digital lock on her house so that we cannot get it professionally cleaned and refuses to give out the code (she seems too initimidated to ask and is quite sick)."
"Just have to get this out to people who understand.

Dad (76) had a vertebroplasty today. The doctors were running behind and his procedure was done 2 and a half hours later than scheduled. This was especially bad because my dad is diabetic and was told not to eat anything past midnight last night. So by the end of his hour long procedure, he was in rough shape plus messed up from the sedatives. But we got him out of the office and into the car. He has mobility problems and uses a combination of walker and wheelchair, but the nurse said he was standing just fine, got off the table on his own and then he stood from the wheelchair on his own and got into the car to go home.

We got food at a drive through and after the hour and a half drive home in Friday rush hour, he was feeling better and less drowsy from the sedatives. We pull into his driveway, I get out and start getting his wheelchair out of the trunk. I hear him yelling at his friend who's helping us that he doesn't want the wheelchair and wants to walk inside. I yell no, you're going in the wheelchair. I get it out, get the wheelchair set up, and pull it around to find he's already standing there with his walker that his friend gave him. He tells me to take the wheelchair inside, he doesn't want it. I tell him no, but he argues with me, so I start taking the wheelchair toward the house, but turn around and tell him I'm at least going to follow him with the wheelchair. As soon as I say that and start toward him, he falls straight backwards. Smashed his head on the cement and blood was pouring out. He's yelling for us to get him up, he wants to go inside, but I'm already on with 911. They of course just tell us to keep pressure on it, keep him still and keep him talking. The ambulance showed up fast and he starts arguing with the paramedics because he wants to go inside, doesn't want to go to the hospital. But obviously they get him in the ambulance and off to the hospital.

I came home because I've been on the go since noon and it was 8:30pm when the ambulance pulled away. Gonna call the hospital in a couple minutes to get an update. 

So yeah, a combination of him being completely worn out from an all afternoon thing that wasn't supposed to be an all afternoon thing and him not fucking listening to me.

I'm not doing this again. I tell him to get medical transport, but he doesn't want to spend the $150. Next time, I'm just gonna lie, tell him I'm driving him and pay for medical transport myself."
"Hey there,

My father suffered bike injury from several months ago which may make it very difficult for at least the next year or so to participate in any significant physical activity (and his life has always been about that with skiing, biking, exercise, hiking, etc.)

He seems very down and I am having a hard time figuring out how to help him adjust to his circumstances. With respect to this specific situation, is there anything you have tried with your parents to help them adjust to these circumstances, or ideas you have? It would be sincerely appreciated. Thanks!

&#x200B;

Update: thank you everyone for your wise and excellent ideas! Esp. pool-based activities!!"
"My dad's been sick for awhile now. My mother has barely any love for him as he did not care for her anytime when she was depressed for almost a decade. He had Patience with her but zero sympathy. I cannot blame her. 

For me, he cared and loved me every step of my way. He did misguide me. He would use me, teach me to hate and hurt my mother. He was the reason I was the same with my girlfriend. I loved her dearly but then when I hurt her and kept hurting her I realized, I was wrong, he was wrong.

 He tried to be a good man. But he was an extremely flawed human. Extremely. 

I loved him like he was my god and savior till my twenties. Now I have a mix of anger/sadness/disbelief towards him. How can the one you love turn you into the man you never ever wanted to be. 

But I try everyday to change. To not be like him. And now I have to care for him everyday. He cannot walk, he falls down the moment I take my eyes off of him. 

Just today I needed a rest so I told my sister to look after him and I took some meds to have a good sleep. I needed the rest. He was in the hospital a week prior and I was there with him with barely any sleep. 

He still craves cigarettes. So I wake up today and I find he has a huge huge bump on his left eye because he woke up at 6 and tried to get some smokes and maybe fell again. I just tried to shut him off. I couldn't look at him.  I told my sister to get some ice and hold it there. 

But just now I went there to hold the ice again and I just got inhumanely angry and frustrated I couldn't hold it. I just had to cry so I went to the other room and let it out. I don't really have anyone I can share this with. I have great friends but you can't always be a downer with your sob stories. 

I just wanted to share this with someone. 

It's not easy when you love them. It's not easy when you don't."
"Hi all, Looking for some advice. My 82 year old father continues to get scam messages on his cell phone (AT&T) (and clicks on the link, just finished locking down all of his credit reports/ability to open new accounts with the credit agencies).  Despite me stating and restating that he should delete any message (w/o clicking anything in the message) that comes from someone he doesn't know or didn't request service from, he continues to do this occasionally. I am going insane from the stress of what financial dangers he is putting himself in.  He enjoys texting with family, so I don't want to take that away completely, but if there was a way to block text messages from numbers NOT in his contacts, that might be helpful.  Does anyone know if there is a way to do this thru AT&T?"
"There’s a lot going on here, and I might be in the wrong place for this, so, apologies in advance. My mom and dad are 68 and 72, respectively. 

My father’s memory has been noticeably declining since 2015 when he (mom and I both believe) he tried to drink himself to death. He had a horrible episode and has never been the same since. We’re fairly sure he did some serious brain damage but he’s a big guy, and we can’t get him to go to the doctor. We can’t get him to participate in ADL’s, and we’ve gotten to the point of occasional cyclical conversation. 
We got his driver’s license away from him in 2016 but we can’t get him to a doctor to have him declared, or even get him a checkup. When he still had all of his faculties he was afraid of doctors, but now he’s just a stubborn confused old man. 
For my own mental health I moved out almost 4 years ago. He responds fairly well to me, or at least better than my mom. 
He’s been a drinker since he was 15 and he’s been verbally and emotionally abusive as a result for as long as I can remember. 

My mother is still raising her grandkids (my half sister’s sons). Half sister is a drug addict and not in the picture. The kids are 12 and 21. My older brother just moved back home (again) but he’s less than helpful and doesn’t really care for our father (understandably). Dad was a royal bastard to big brother. 


My questions in all of this: 
How can we get dad cleaned up? 
How do we get him to a doctor? 
We cannot afford in home care or a nursing home. It’s not an option for us without making my mother homeless. 

I do as much as I’m capable of, taking care of the 12 y/o mostly, but my mom is still emotionally abusive and starting to show some signs of slow cognitive decline (her social skills are slipping, and she’s always been a stickler for these things). 
I want to help but it’s really hard."
"My widower father is in a nursing home.  This is our first Thanksgiving in this situation.

Do nursing homes allow family members to dine with nursing home residents on Thanksgiving Day, in the dining room?  Or will I be allowed to bring Thanksgiving dinner for him or for both of us so that we can dine together?

Thanksgiving dinner by yourself in a nursing home seems miserable,  and surely families are allowed to dine together,  right?

Thanks."
"Update
They made it! 

Thank you everybody for your help.   There was a poster (who has since deleted their posts) that really gave some helpful advice, especially regarding the aisle wheelchair for the plane. 








Now that the border from Europe has reopened my parents are planning on visiting, after not seeing the grandkids for nearly two years. 

In that time my dad (late 80s) got covid and was hospitalized for two months.   This led to a near complete loss of mobility.  He previously walked with a cane, but did his daily constitutional where he walked nearly a mile.

Does anyone have experience/ advice to make the plane journey more manageable?   They are expecting to have an airport wheelchair at each end.   But I'm concerned about 1) the jetway, 2)maneuvering to their seats in the plane and 3)bathroom use. 

Any help appreciated. 

Thanks."
"I've ended up the primary caretaker my my 91 year-old mother and have been doing it pretty much single handedly for the past 7 years. My older sister currently lives two states away, and she arrived for a two-night stay at my mother's house (which I maintain) yesterday. My sister and I have never gotten along well, but she shows up like she's performing an inspection. In particular, she confronted me because I hadn't called to tell her my mother had had a dizzy spell. Instead, I mentioned this to my niece, her daughter, whom I get along with. Then, my sister starts looking around for an old diamond watch that doesn't work that my mother wants to give to my niece, and my sister starts asking me if I know where it is -- as though I've hidden it or something. (I couldn't care less about jewelry, so if my mother wants to give it to my niece, that's fine.) Locating it becomes a big drama. She and my mother eventually find it, right in the drawer where my mother thought it was. 

I'm at my mother's house at least twice a day, 365 days a year, looking out for her, taking care of her house, her yard, getting her groceries and prescriptions, taking her cat to the vet. Everything. She's basically in assisted living with me as the unpaid assistant. My mother's neighbors compliment me regularly on what good care I take of her. Then my sister shows up and acts like I'm her fucking employee and haven't reported to her like I should. 

In reality, I know my sister really doesn't care that much about our mother. If my mother didn't have a nice house, some financial assets, and stuff she wants, she probably wouldn't bother to visit at all. I know that's a harsh thing to say, but I have 50 years of evidence. She just shows up, performs a big act, and then finds fault with me wherever she can. I've understood for years that my sister is a pathological narcissist, so I know why she does these things, but I still have to deal with her for now. After our mother dies and everything is dealt with (which is guaranteed to be a horrible experience), I plan on simply dropping contact, no dramatic gestures, just letting this bad relationship go. 

Does anyone else caring for elderly parents have a sibling or other family member who does this?"
"My widower father, who is in very poor health, will be returning home from his nursing home in about two weeks.

My brother and each live about two hours away (by plane).  

We plan to visit on alternate weeks so at least one or two days per week, one of us will be at our father’s house with him.

We have 24/7 caregivers lined up.

We also have an elder care service lined up to oversee everything by and to be our “feet on the ground” when we’re not there.

We plan to call our father every day.

For the past few weeks, either my brother or I have been living in my father’s house so that one of us could drop in at the nursing home once per day.  We’ve also gone with him to medical appointments.

Does this all seem normal and reasonable?

I am told that this level of involvement by children is rare borderline excessive and that going forward, I should come visit only if convenient for me.  So I’m confused.  I thought anyone would do whatever it took to ensure that an elderly parent in poor health would be looked after."
"Hello all, I'm new here. I'm in my late 30s and my mom is in her mid 60s. She has always refused to see a doctor for any type of medical maintenance and has been a heavy smoker my entire life. She kept saying she was doing ok....as ok as she could be as she also refuses to be medicated for her mental illness. She got to the point where she couldn't hide that she was very weak and had lost a lot of weight. She passed out and could not get up off the floor. When she didn't answer my phone calls like she does every week, I traveled to her house and found her, it was a sight that will haunt me for the rest of my life. 

We've had an amicable relationship, but we haven't been close since I was in middle school due to her illness. In some ways I've already grieved a loss of her, but I'm still upset to see her going through this.

I feel so guilty that I didn't push harder as she got older, her house is not in good shape and it's 100 miles from me, so she's not going back there when she gets out of the hospital (but she can't stay with us, neither my husband or I have the ability to be caretakers as harsh as that may sound). She has kidney damage and we're waiting for test results that she may also have cancer to see what courses of action to take.

I found that someone posted on here a Google Doc that was extremely helpful, I had a lot of that information put together. Fortunately, I am her medical and financial POA and have been managing her money for a few years. I'm her only child, but she does not have a will; is it going to be problematic when she passes to close out her accounts and sell her house? Would it be easier to sell her house before she passes?

She is on social security/SSI and has medicare, but there's no way she can afford any of these medical bills or a long-term care facility. The hospital is putting me in contact with an application for low-income people. Am I responsible for her medical debts?

Any advice or recommendations are welcomed, especially if you made it through my wall of text."
"Sad story ahead, but also heartwarming. My mom developed dementia after a major surgery 10 years ago when she was barely over 60 (and was still fully active and normal/high functioning) and has deteriorated to the point where, about a year ago, she broke her leg, was admitted and then transferred to a memory care center where she will be forevermore. 

TLDR: How would you 'celebrate' a 50th wedding anniversary for parents when one of them is in late-stage dementia? 

My mom remembers nothing and no one except — sometimes — Dad. The only names she ever says are her own and his. My dad visits her at least once a day. I visit 1-2 times a week because I work a lot, but my siblings and the grandkids, well, they cannot handle seeing my mom that way so they don't go. 

When I am there and Dad is not, the staff at the nursing home always tells me that seeing my dad with my mom literally makes them cry. They say they have never seen a resident whose husband is there so often and who is so loving and involved. The situation has actually brought my dad and I closer. I had no idea how unique his love for my mom was before this. I have genuinely come to enjoy sitting at the home on Saturday afternoons, talking with my dad as my mom sits by us, holding our hands and stuff. 

Anyway, he's mentioned a couple times that their 50th wedding anniversary is coming up. (I was not sure he would want to mark it, but the fact that he's mentioned it makes me think he does). I explain the whole situation because 1. The family is not into coming to the nursing home and I don't like to force it or pressure them (so having a ""party"" would not be cool). My mom would never have wanted that. 2. The staff has gotten to know and love my parents, so I am wondering if I can somehow involve them. 

I think of having a little pseudo party, making a slideshow, I don't know ... but I do not want it to be sad or seem like I am using my mom as a prop, because she will have no idea what's going on. Any ideas are appreciated."
"**TLDR: just scroll through the post and see all the sentences in bold.** 

Like the title suggest, I am really scared of losing my dad. He is 84 years old with high blood pressure and some heart conditions. For the past 5-6 years he has grown old so drastically and so quickly. I had no idea what was happening to him until recently. Now that he has no energy to do everyday tasks and cannot eat/drink more than a high school girl. 

**Concern 1: my dad's long term abuse of caffeine products and sleeping medications**

The reason why I am very concerned is because of his heart and his caffeine abuse. For the past 20+ years that I know him, he drinks **at least** 10 cups of coffee a day (and do NOT drink any water under any circumstances because he thinks ""water tastes bad"") and constantly take sleeping pills to sleep. In order to fall asleep, he also takes more and more sleeping pills and stronger dosage too without listening to doctors' advice (it's not the doctor's fault, when the doctor refuses to prescribe him sleeping pills he would ask my mom or other people to see their doctors and get the meds he wanted). For the record, he is a very hard-working man and provides for the family. He was the only income source of the family. He was running several companies and is a successful business before he retired (he's someone I aspire to be and look up to as well); but still I dont think this justify his relationship with caffeine and sleeping aids. 

Now that he has retired (though he still keeps overseeing a lot of stuff and cant/dont want to let go the businesses understandably), he does NOT take sleeping pills anymore; he only takes 1 tablet of 5mg melatonin daily which is a huge step for my dad. He also decreases the cups of coffee to maximum 2 cups, which is good. However he is still drinking a shit tone of tea

**Concern 2: he does NOT drink water, like at all**

He does NOT drink water because he thinks it tastes bad. He drinks 1-2 cups of coffee every morning and drinks black/green tea for the rest of the day. He would even drink strong tea right before bed while taking melatonin. I have talked to him countless times about this: I asked him to drink less coffee which he promises he will do and has kept his promises. But he just doesnt seem to want to drink water at all. I've asked him why, he just kept repeating that he dislikes the tastes. He tries to substitute substitutes with liquids like milk/chocolate milk/juices/pepsi. 

He drinks around 4-6 cups of tea + other drinks which is very very low considering these are not actually water and might dehydrate him even further. 

**Like how does someone not like the taste of water? Is there anything I can do or tell?** 

**Concern 3: not eating enough**

My dad believes an old guy can't get fat; it would increase his risk of getting heart attacks. I can't say he is wrong, but I think he is eating way too little.

But I don't know when/how exactly it begins, he eats around 800-1200 calories daily (I am fairly experienced at tracking calories and I believe this is accurate). A good example of his daily food consumption would be: one bagel and some PJ for breakfast + 200g of beef and some vegetables for dinner (+extra 300 calories for sauces, oil etc) + some sweet snacks and fruits. **I believe that for a male like him (84 y/o, 70kg, 170cm, male), he should eat at least 1800-2000. Is this correct?** 

I dont expect him to track calories, but I just ask him to eat 3 meals a day (instead of 2 meals) plus 2 snacks (maybe one in the afternoon and one in the evening). **Is that really hard to do at his age? Would I be forcing food down his throat?**

In terms of physical strength, he can still walk without assistance (he doesn't need a crane or a walker or anything like that). But I can tell he is losing a lot of strength on his arms and legs. He is not able to carry a shopping bag and walk for a short distance (like from garage to the kitchen) without having to rest for 2 hours afterwards. I tried setting up a workout routine for him this summer too. It is nothing hard or anything special; everything was under ACSM guideline includes: aerobic exercises (walking around 30min 3 times a week) and 40 min of training including balance training, resistance training and static stretches. We started from 1 exercise + 1 walking session and builds up from that. I can see him improving and getting better. But he gave up after 2 month. 

**Concern 4: Sedentary behaviour all day long**

Like I said he is no longer actively working, and has nothing else to do or talk to. He does not have any friends at where we are living now. All he does everyday is sitting in front of the TV and play on his phone on the same game and sometimes read the news on his phone. Taking a walk is not possible since it's always rainy where we live (at least for the winter). Like this is bad for both cognitive and physical reasons. **Is there anything he can do instead?**

**A little more about me, but it's more like a rant and my confession so feel free to skip this**

I am a 23 y/o male. My father had me at a pretty late age (at 61 ish) and I'm his only child so he precious me and treats me very well.  He also taught me everything that he knows. But for some reasons, I just don't feel like I am as good as what he expects and I also feel like I am slower than my peers. Like I said previously, he is a very successful business man, and so is everyone else in my family: all very successful in their own fields and rich too. So it just gives a feeling that everyone in the family could already have achieved so many great things at my age while I am still a nobody that lives with his parent. Obviously no one has said that to me, in fact everyone in the family especially my father encourages me and give me real life advices and sets up opportunities for me. My father, my uncles and aunts, my gf, my best friend all believe that one day I might do something great and have a great life but I just don't see that image and dont think I will ever be able to do anything that they say, which makes me even more depressed. I just feel like I am the only person that's not advancing in life (career-wise, personality-wise, or even just intellectually); or at least takes many years to achieve what people usually gets at the same age. 

I also don't want to bring shame to my father's name, like what would my relatives think of my dad when they realize I am really not going anywhere in life. Like right now I am still ""young"", just graduated university (with an absolutely shit GPA and no good work experience on the resume) and I am currently enrolled in master's; like what happens when im no longer young and in school? What's my excuse gonna be at that time?

For those exact reasons above, I've been depressed for many years and have sought medical help and therapies. But nothing have worked, I've also realized my ability to deal with stress has decreased and my sleep is getting worse (not surprisingly I am kind of like my dad now: abuse coffee during the day and sleeping aids at night; like father like son). 

I would like to see my father live as long and as happy as possible and that's the main goal for this post; but this whole thing is making me more depressed and anxious, so anything on this would be much appreciated as well."
"My 64 year old mother has had mental illness forever. It used to be fairly well controlled by lithium, but she has seen a quack psychiatrist for years that never tested her levels and ran her kidneys into the ground… an icu visit a few years ago revealed that she effectively has one kidney left that was (at last appt) functioning in stage 3 kidney failure.
The last year she has been spiraling. Four trips to the mental hospital. Every evening she gets anxiety, delusions, and paranoia. To the point where she refused to stay at her apartment and would come to my brother’s one bedroom apartment. That has been untenable. He woke up to her sitting on his bedroom floor with a knife (in a defensive posture… not aggressive) due to her paranoia. I have a four year old and have told her it is not possible for me to let her stay with me when she is actively battling paranoia.

We broke her lease to get her into an independent living community (I at least want to start the process of moving her toward an assisted living arrangement… we toured one together but she doesn’t need help with bathing/dressing … and she is at least 20 years younger than all the other residents)… so I thought independent living would be more of a step toward that direction. 

The day before the move she got in a car wreck (shouldn’t have been driving in the first place) and totaled her car. That may have been a blessing in disguise because no one got hurt and she is essentially not insurable now.

My brother and uncle got her into the new place because my father had a cardiac emergency in Holland while on business there and I flew over to be with him for the surgery. The night she moved in she wandered the halls for hours because she forgot her apartment number until a cleaning lady called me in Europe to ask for her apartment number.

It all culminated in a crisis where my brother had to leave town for one night and I was out of the country. The police called saying she had walked to the grocery store concerned because she got a phishing email asking for ID to issue a death certificate for my brother. They took her home. Then a few hours later they called back to say that 7-11 had called them because she walked there. She told the police she had been stalked because someone from her old apt had moved to her new place on the same day. She agreed to go to the hospital. She spent a day in the ER which found a UTI and her kidneys out of whack. She’s been in the mental hospital for a week. 

I have no pOA and she is always reluctant to list us as able to receive info, so there might be no way to discuss discharge planning (again). At least they’ve kept her for a week this time and not kicked her out after three days like every other time. 

My ideas are:
1. Attend a primary care doctor appointment with her the day after Thanksgiving to lay all of this out
2. Make a nephrologist appointment
3. Try to persuade her to see a new psychiatrist
4. Get home health workers for at least a couple of weeks to start to come check on her at night and remind her to take medication hoping that it will create a good pattern (in the past in her Paranoia she has resisted the medication because she wants to be able to protect her self if something were to happen)
5. If the above does not help pursue guardianship

Would assisted living places take someone like her who is mentally ill but has not been diagnosed with dementia and does not have issues with mobility or bathing or dressing? What do people do with theaging mentally ill?

I am concerned about her finances I believe she has about $325,000 and I have no idea how long she will live. I i’m not expecting to inherit anything but I don’t know how I will support my own home and pay for assisted-living for her as well"
"It looks like we (my western husband, my 6y son, and I) will need to find a residence to live with my aging Chinese parents. Most likely, in the same house.  I am scared, period.

My parents are micromanaging and self pitty (mostly my mom). They give their opinions on things I don't need their opinions. I see no way to change them and no way to confront them (because of the culture). 

What kind of mindset I should prepare for 24/7/365 with them commenting on my life, my husband's behaviors (bc culture difference and different grow-up background), and how we parent/feed our son?"
My dad [70] has started very uncharacteristically a couple years ago started screaming and swearing in his sleep. Now its very common most nights to overhear. Is this a common occurrence? My mom also mentioned he has tried to choke her once. Is this a sign of something else developing? I have read sometimes Lewy Body Dementia?
"My father can’t walk easily, and he has a bunch of medical appointments coming up.  Going to them is a hassle and he wants to cancel all non-essential ones (such as an upcoming one that is a review of some lab results).

If I call the doctors’ offices and say, “my father wants to cancel the appointment but can keep the appointment if it can be done online”, is that the way to get the appointment moved to being online?  Or is there anything else needed from me to get appointments to be done online?

All the doctor needs to do is set up a Zoom meeting, but I figure that there is probably more involved due to security issues, staff inertia, etc.

Thanks."
"What happens then?  What have your experiences been?  It’s like a black hole to me, and if you’ve done it, I’d like to hear what happens after the call, if there are no relatives."
"She lives alone. She always was anxious and slightly paranoid. She had a stroke 4 years ago and since then I've seen her twice a week, and spoke to her every night I didn't see her. I took care of her laundry, banking, food shopping, etc. She is housebound. She refuses to pay down her dwindling savings to get medicaid. She won't quit smoking. She won't take all her meds. She won't go to her PT. She wont give me POA or complete a healthcare proxy. She won't let me hire someone to clean her mess of a house. She just relies on me for a sense of normalcy. She has very few friends. Well, today she screamed at me for picking up her medicine, she blamed me for the bitter taste of the medicine, and then accused me of telling people she was a drug addict. This is part of her paranoia. I am not a mental health professional and that was too much for me. I told her she needs more help than I can provide and that she better get some other help and to call her doctor and her case manager at the senior center. I've had a pretty good relationship with her and I am not an impulsive person. But I am done. I never wanted to be a parent or a nurse or caregiver ever. If she would let me, I'd pay a pro to do the dirty work while she and I have fun together, which we used to do. She has a lot of medical problems and probably the beginning of dementia but I am just done. It's too much for one person. There is no other family. I feel scared and worried about her but I feel like I was shielding her from reality in a way. I am not sure she can take care of herself. I hope she calls for some help. She is resourceful- I know because I don't buy her cigarettes but she gets them some how. I am done. I don't want to do this anymore."
"Hi! My own parents are long gone. My husband’s father also gone. His mother and are elderly. Step mother is 84. Her husband, my husbands father, asked his sons to care for her. She is not an easy person to be around. She doesn’t ask for much, but we try. We’ve suggested many times she could move a bit closer and we would help a lot more, but she says she will eventually move to a retirement home in her current town, about an hour away. Every year she asks for a ride to Thanksgiving at my husband’s brothers house. It’s an hour out of our way then another hour to get there. She is wealthy (she has no kids of her own and her husbands kids will likely inherit). I feel like she could Uber there, she takes BART everywhere. I think she’d be hurt if we suggested that. I honestly can’t figure out if this is a big ask. I know it’ll feel easier when we retire in a little over a year. Really interested in your thoughts!"
"How do you handle caring for aging parents who have plenty of money but complain about the expense of caring for them?

Do you just never let them know how much things cost and keep getting good care for them?

My father had a medical appointment.  He claims to be in pain if he has to walk, so I used a senior transportation service to take him and his wheelchair in a van.  The cost was $150.  He can afford that, and I’d rather pay $150 and free myself up to work for an additional hour as I charge more than $150 per hour in my day job.

When he found out that it cost something, he got mad and said that he’d have gone in the car if he had known.  But taking him in the car would have taken more of my time and he would have been in pain.

How would you handle these situations going forward?

Thanks.

EDITED TO ADD: Even in retirement, my father earns $150 every two hours from his investments.  Even every two hours while he’s asleep.  He can afford $150.  As can I."
"I would appreciate advice, especially books and online sources of advice, in dealing with 85+ you old parents who live alone in a big house they owned for 40 years.  Mother is extremely stubborn and rarely gets out of bed or leaves the bedroom area.  Father is thoroughly hen-pecked and does all house and medical care.  The house is very dirty and they eat mostly junk food.

They have plenty of money (over $1 million) but they refuse to hire any housecleaning or nursing care.  Occasionally they go to the doctor who always advises changing eating habits but they never follow the advice.  They barely spend any money, even having bad TVs and an old bed (non-medical grade).  

The holidays are dreadful for me because the Mother wants to control everything by orders, but as often as not will change the plans at the last minute by complaining that she ""doesn't feel well"" to get her way.  Father just always caves in and demands that we do what she wants.  Of course there is Mother-Daughter in law tensions too.

I hate the holidays and dread the daily phone calls in which they don't listen to anything I say anyway.  I know I can't fix them, but I need a place to get to a better frame of mind in dealing with them.  Any suggestions would be appreciated."
"My mother is diagnosed with dementia but is one of the higher functioning in her current memory care facility. She is unhappy with this facility. She is in California near my sisters but says she wants to move back to Oregon where she had spent the previous 25 years. There are practical reasons to have her near my sisters, one of whom is a nurse and handles taking her to doctor's appointments and the like. If she goes back to Oregon it would be a 2 hour drive from where I live and not practical for helping her or being able to take her out as frequently as my sisters are currently able to do.

I want her to be happy, but she would still be in a memory care facility in Oregon with less frequent visits from family. I wonder if she is just frustrated with her situation and going to all the trouble and expense of moving her could end up just bringing her back to the same place of not living the free independent life she once knew."
"I’m trying to figure out some options to help my father. He’s early 70s, has zero savings and makes just a little too much from SS to qualify for Medicaid and other assistance. Each month he is in the hole by about $200. He has tried finding work but either his poor health gets in the way or potential jobs don’t pan out. He has been in a terrible cycle of “living off his credit card” on and off for a number of years. Covid unemployment carried him for the last year or so, but that has now ended. 

One option is to help financially, which I’m a little reluctant to do as he is pretty bad with money. At the same time, if chipping in a little every month is what it takes for him to not be in such a terrible situation then I can live with that. My concern is what happens next. What happens when/if he needs some care. Or additional support? 

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."
"Hello, thank you in advance for reading this and passing on any thoughts.  My mom has ALZ and her native language is Korean.  She recently moved to be closer my sister and I.   Sadly we don’t speak Korean, and there aren’t many Koreans in my area.   I’ve been searching but haven’t found any options for a virtual pen pal or conversation pal in her language. I’d love to hear any suggestions on how to keep my mom socialized in Korean.  Thanks!"
"

My dad goes for routine check-ups each year.  Last year his PSA was 7, and it shot up to 15 a couple months ago.  His doctor understandably wants MRI, biopsy, rectal exam, etc.  My dad was hesitant but agreed that he should have it done.  Now all of a sudden he cancelled appointments and wants to wait until after the holidays but I don’t think he’ll have it done then either.  My sister and me told him he’s playing with fire, and that it can be the difference between catching it early now or if he waits, it could become advanced.  He said he’s tired of being poked and prodded (had full right knee replacement this past June).  It’s beyond frustrating, not sure what to do.   Do I respect his choice or be a nag until he relents and has it done?"
"I am having a hell of a time lately trying to take care of my 96 year old grandmother. She had been living on her own up until a few months ago when she fell and broke her ankle. Due to that she had to be moved to a care facility for rehab, albeit she seemingly came out of the hospital completely downhill and I do not feel she could live on her own again. 

My biggest problem(s) is this particular care facility SUCKED. They neglected her, didn't come to her aid light for 30 minutes and got pissed at my family when raising our concerns. So pissed in fact that they started limiting visits to 2 hours a day as my family noticed a lot of mistreatment signs. So with that being said we moved her out to a better facility, at least one that we all felt more comfortable with. She has been there for about a month and all of a sudden the place told us she had to be out of there in 48 hours. As medicare is now denying coverage. Oh and this was already after 24 hours had passed...

I am sick and have no idea what to do now, this facility said if she wanted to stay it would cost 12,000 a month. So now the question is what are we supposed to do... yesterday we filed an appeal but our time obviously ran out. 

The idea all along was to get her 24 hour nursing care at home once her ankle got better. The problem with that is that we can't find anyone. A few places tried is short nurses it seems and at most we could ONLY get one for part of a day. But due to her mobility now and decline she really needs full care. 

Does anyone have any advice on what I should do, where I should look etc? Everyone is devastated and in a panic right now."
"My dad has needed hearing aids for a while now. Getting mad that you were speaking too soft. Now that has them, he’s mad cuz we’re yelling at him. We can’t win."
"Many of you may not know that if you have a very hard of hearing parent that won't use their hearing aides (my father)  There is a FREE phone service called   [https://captioncall.com/](https://captioncall.com/)My phone is stone deaf and has not been able to use a phone for years,  now he can.  The volume is very loud so he can hear it ring, but the most important part is every word being said is on the screen (decent size screen) so they can read it.  They can also save the conversation (like doctors appointments etc)  They will come out and set it up and show you how to use it and it is FREE paid for by the government.  It has helped change my father's life :)"
"My mom is 66 and still working a physically demanding job. Under everything that I've researched, she falls under the banner of disabled. She's been told by at least one if not more of her doctors that she has to stop working but according to her, that's not possible. Her finances are in a bad place. I found out that she's fallen at least four times due to her neuropathy and has a wound on her foot that won't heal. She needs to get off her feet.

I told her she needed to look into disability and she said she can either get disability or social security, not both. I can't figure out if that's really the case or not. 

I know I need to speak with an elder law attorney but at this point I don't have enough info from my mom. I'm working on that."
"Evening everyone, well tonight my family and I had to drive around the city to find my grandma at the greyhound station. She has a history of blaming people from stealing from her, damaging her property, or more commonly planting drugs in her home. This of course isn't true and after her rant enough times, it becomes cumbersome. Her two daughters (my mom and aunt) have not been on speaking terms for some time. I know this is really their problem to figure out, but I fear I will be a middleman between the two. The family doesn't have enough resources to pay for an ALF and the daughters can't handle sharing there home with her. Which ultimately leaves us doing more of the same, pretty much throwing her in her house. She isn't on any medication currently and has a dog, though I'm pretty sure that is subject to change. I'm open to any suggestions or advice I could share with my mom and aunt.
Thank you

TLDR: Grandma's schizophrenia drove her to nearly get on a bus out of town. Her daughters won't come together to figure out a solution. Need advice."
"Scenario: 
Dad: Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Epilepsy, recent fall with massive decline in functionality (basically cannot do anything for himself) 

Mom: crippling depression, physically handicapped, able to handle all her ADLs but that’s about it 

Assets: house they have lived in forever with some mortgage left on it. Nothing else. 

Plan: sell their house, get what we can from it, buy new house in DC where I live and move them in with me. 

Needs: Medicaid for Dad for as much in home care as possible, possible nursing home in future.

I talked to an Elder Law attorney today who said he could do it all (protect House proceeds, get dad on Medicaid in DC, etc) for 25k. Does that sound right? (Remember it’s DC) 

Thanks in advance. This all sucks so bad.

EDIT: thanks all for your responses and advice. Seems like no matter the metropolis, 25k is steep af. I’ll look around and hope I can get help soon."
"My parents are in their 70s. Pretty damn healthy in terms of what they eat and they get outside to walk a few miles every day. My mom definitely has memory issues, and it's been a big deal to me. I've tried to bring it up many times, but neither of them seem to want to do much about it

I can sort of understand why. I've been advised by therapists why they would not want to deal with it. But what is SO HARD for me is that I'll say things like, ""why don't you start your morning with water instead of coffee?"" or ""why don't you limit the amount of gluten you eat"" as both of these things could benefit them

These are not huge requests, or hard. But they literally just seem to ignore me. It's SO hard for me. And I'm about to move closer to them and probably spend more time with them

I love them, but the anxiety I have around them and their behavior sometimes is eating me up inside. I'd been advised to work on letting go... but how do you do that? 

PS: I don't need medical advice. I have done a LOT on my own and I work in healthcare so I'm very aware. I'm just looking for others who are maybe in the same situation. Just to feel less alone. Thank you!"
"My mom did knee replacement surgery a month ago. After the surgery she was doing great for the first two weeks; She would walk the next day and then she didn't need any pain medicines after two weeks and started to walk well with a walker. But then one night when she moved herself from a chair to bed, she heard a several loud clunking sounds from her knee and felt pain; the next day the pain got worse and she would not put any pressure on that leg and could not move. Her doctor said it is normal to feel pain sometime and the pain will be going away soon. The doctor asked her to try to walk. However it has been like that for almost 2 weeks now and the situation is not getting any better. She could barely stand now. Her physical therapist said this is not normal. Does anyone have a similar experience or any suggestions."
"We moved in with my father to help him, but a couple of months ago, we noticed he stopped washing his hands after using the bathroom. We struggled for last couple of months on how to address it with him because he's the type who will get angry if you embarrass him. I was able to to tactfully bring it up this past Saturday and he pretended to wash his hands the rest of the day by simply running the water for us to hear. As of yesterday and this morning he no longer is even pretending. It's gross and unhealthy not only for him but also for my wife and I. He'll use the bathroom and then plunge his hands right into the ice bin (even though it's automatic in the fridge door), we have to watch everything he touches now. Such an awkward situation to be in. I'm curious to know why he doesn't anymore and how to get him to return to the practice of just doing it. We don't think he has dementia yet. "
"I know its not her fault (Alzheimers), and I know birthdays aren’t that big of a deal - i turned 33, not 12, afterall. Also my friends were there for me, so I do count my blessings. 

But damn. This hurts. With a dead dad, no siblings, going to bed at the end of the day I have never felt more alone. 

Just needed to get this off my chest somewhere, and just throw it into the void thats the Internet - thank you for reading!"
"My dad is having his knee replaced and the recovery is arduous at his age. I want to replace their tubs with walk-in showers, and since dad is injured it would come in handy sooner. So I’m thinking window of opportunity! the perfect time to install those showers my parents have been talking about for years. They won’t let us. 
Us=2 sisters and I 

Also, they live on a winding road in rural SW Virginia - the drive to nearest ER is at least 40 minutes. Years from now I’m going to have to get them to move - they are staunchly against it off. Any suggestions on how to convince your parents that this is a prudent move?"
"My widower father is in a nursing home.  I’ve been visiting him every day, and as he’s seemed uninterested, recent visits have been under 30 minutes: I give him the newspaper, help with hygiene (such as giving him a shave), and then going home.

Today he left me a voicemail, first thing in the morning: he has a TV show that he wants to watch at 8pm, so he said that if I’m coming out, I should come at 7:30pm.  Clearly I’m not invited to watch TV with him.

My father isn’t the smoothest person socially.  At least he didn’t say “don’t come”.

If you’re caring for an aging parent do you ask before visiting and do you visit only if invited?  

I figure it’s my duty as a child to ensure that my father is OK, and he’s in poor health physically, and declining mentally, so I ought to go out for even 15 minutes, wanted or not.

Thanks."
"My dad had a stroke at 56 and did not do the necessary things to prevent more so I’ve been mentally preparing myself for his end of life care and death for years. I joined this sub to try and get tips on how to help/prepare. 
About a month ago my uncle, who doesn’t have a partner or children, had his first stroke (yep, it runs in the family) and to this date he has had 3 more. Turns out he has stage 4 cancer that started in his lungs and spread to his lymph-nodes and brain. His last stroke occurred in the night so they didn’t catch it during the 2 hour period and now he is about 90% paralyzed on his right side. Rehabs are packed in my state of Michigan so he couldn’t stay in his home city and was moved closer to me about two hours from home. I was the first person that could see him and it was just heartbreaking. He was scared, confused, sad, etc. I talked to him after his second stroke and he was so optimistic to beat the cancer and now he is just a broken man. He wanted to use the restroom but he needs max assist so they basically told him he has to soil himself and they will clean him to go to the bathroom. It is so hard explaining to an adult that they just need to wet themselves when they just want to sit on the John. 
Idk if I’m looking for anything in particular right now. Maybe just some advice on how to talk and comfort stroke victims? I think I did an alright job of letting him know the timeline he had been there, 2 days instead of his perceived 3 weeks, but he forgets. He forgot how to use his phone so should I write something down to explain where he is and why? Thanks for your advice"
"Not sure if this is the right community to ask, but anyways:

Any suggestions for a digital picture frame that is bare bones, almost impossible to ""mess up"", and can have new pics sent to it via wifi? The key part for me is that pics are NOT stored on the cloud. I want to basically remote upload to the picture frame itself.

I'd like to get one as an Xmas gift for my mum so I can upload pics of my kids. She's pretty tech illiterate though and terrified of ""messing something up"" with any/all tech she touches. I can set it up for her and walk her through connecting it to her wifi. 

With a baby and a toddler, my kids change and grow so fast and just updating the pics for her when we visit wouldn't keep her very up to date. I don't want to upload to a cloud storage service either, just for privacy's sake."
"Has anyone else faced this?

All of my older family members who I loved being around- including a parent who I was the closest to- have all passed away.

The family members who are left are all ones who I didn’t care for.  But they’re all I have.  They’ve been very nice to me (for a change).  

But I was expecting at least one aging relative who I was close to to live a long time, but that didn’t happen.

Anyone else face this?  It’s like twice the nightmare: losing your favorite relatives AND    having to face the others."
"Hi everyone,

I'm hoping to get your opinion on medical alert devices for my grandparents. They are very independent, but live 30 minutes away and don't always carry their cell phones.

The company Lively has a wristband option that looks promising and easy to use. We're also not opposed to ones worn on lanyards or belt loops. Are there any others you recommend?

Thanks!"
"My father's in Assisted Living with the beginnings of dementia.  I receive all his mail, pay the few bills he has, but I cannot seem to figure out how to cancel his subscriptions without wasting a couple of hours with each one.

He has one credit card left, which I don't want to cancel.  He can't remember how to get on-line, let alone his subscriptions.  So I have no idea what's coming down the pike.

Lately he's had charges for Amazon Prime and Microsoft Suite, neither of which he will use.  I tried to cancel Microsoft, but since he'd paid the previous year, the credit card said to contact the vendor.  Microsoft was actually very sympathetic, said they'd leave notes in the case that would allow the credit card to cancel charges, but when we got the letter later, the cc told us that the charge had been scrutinized and authorized.

Short of canceling the last credit card, is there a better way?"
"He's 74 and the first in our family to get it. We are on day 5 with him and his oxygen is 95 and his symptoms (cough headache) have stayed the same. However he is very weak and trembling (he already had tremors prior). I am worried because I don't know what to look out for.  I don't want him to go to the hospital unless and until absolutely necessary. Yes he was vaxxed but I'm not going to assume that means he'll be ok because the friend he got it from was vaxxed and doing terribly and another man (54) in the neighborhood who was double vaxxed died from it last week. Maybe I am over reacting but the docs seem to brush it off. Told him to take zinc, vitamin d and C. Which he has been doing.

UPDATE: He ended up being admitted for dehydration on Friday night. Saturday was rough. Doing alot better today (Monday)"
"My parents have long made it clear that they think that I’m as dumb as dirt and know nothing, and they have long ignored what I say.  Conversely, they have made it clear that they think that my brother is brilliant and they have long done everything he says.

Even though I am the one person in the family who has a degree from a reputable program in a top-3 Ivy League school (think Yale Law School, Princeton for college or Harvard Medical School) and am an owner of a successful business, ranked globally in its field.

This continues; my widower father tells me basic things that any 8-year old knows and then says, “Did you know that?”  

Most importantly, my brother and I are looking after our widower father, who ignores everything I say but follows my brother’s instructions to the letter.

Example: “please get up from your bed today and at least get in your wheelchair so that you won’t get bed sores.”  If I say it, my father says “no!” If my brother (who lives far away) calls and says it, our father immediately complies.

Any tips on how to deal with this?  Just let my brother be the one to give any instructions and ignore the insulting assumptions that I am stupid?

Thanks."
"My 83-yr-old father lives alone in our old split-level house. His balance is bad, and he says his feet are numb. He gets up the stairs slowly, and because he knows where to lean on the wall, where to grab a door handle, etc. 
I am going to drive the 500 miles to get home tomorrow, since he fell and blew out his knee. I had no idea things were so bad. I need to get him an alert bracelet or necklace, and would appreciate any help.
Money isn't an issue. Keeping him safe until I can move him is.
Thanks in advance!"
"I have 2 sisters. None of us live in the same state as our parents. 
Yesterday, my 77 year old mom called me crying because the doctor told her she needs a biopsy due to a mass found on her mammogram. 
My dad has chronic pain, can barely walk, should no longer be driving (a whole other issue), & will definitely need help if my mom is unable to do things for him. He cannot help my mom. 
I’m praying this isn’t cancer but it doesn’t look good. 
They still live in the house we grew up in. We’ve been trying to get them to move for years. Too many stairs for my dad and too much to take care of. 
I’m very anxious about this. 
Thanks for reading and any support/suggestions."
"I haven't lived in the US for a long time and never had to deal with medical when I was there. 

Recently mom went to a nursing facility. Something is wrong (well many things imo). I don't trust the facility in any way atm. How do I find someone to go in and do a medical checkup? 

Honestly feel she is being neglected and probably has a bad uti. I can't get anything real from the facility or any help from them.

No POA or Guardianship yet, so my hands are somewhat tied."
"As the title says, my dad was recently diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. We find out more on Friday. As of now we know that at least there are drs willing to try treatment, and he will be undergoing chemo. 

18 years ago, my mom was diagnosed with leukemia. We were very lucky in that she beat the odds. I’m so grateful for that. However, life has never been the same. She’s had constant mobility problems. She’s often in and out of the hospital / rehab facility. We know them all here very well. 

Last summer she went into septic shock as a result of a UTI. She had just gotten out of the hospital for a surgery, and 3 days later she was back. I was by her side in the ICU for 11 days. during the height of COVID and the riots (which were bad in my city). And again, she beat the odds. She’s a miracle. She has more lives than a cat. 

While my brother and I are both close with my parents, my dad has been her primary caretaker. Over the last 3 years he has had kidney cancer, with a kidney removal, prostate cancer and his prostate removed. Now he has a very rare form of at least one type of cancer and maybe two. 

My mom has very limited mobility. My dad cannot be a caretaker and a patient. He straight up told me tonight that he was more stressed about mom’s situation than his own. We had to go to a visitation of an old family friend tonight and afterwards we wanted to go out to eat. My mom was in too much pain and we just couldn’t figure out logistics. I could tell my dad was bummer to not go. 

I love both of my parents so much. And this may sound awful, but I’ve been preparing for mom to go first for almost 20 years. I don’t know what the future has in store for my dad. But realistically, I don’t want his remaining time here being spent worrying about her. I want him to be able to do the things he feels like doing, and that make him happy. Not worrying about everything for mom. 

I live close by and I have taken a leave of absence from work to help them. I feel awful because I get so frustrated with mom. She’s been dependent on him for so long and she does have more ability than she thinks. But it’s like this is the pattern they have become. 

It breaks my heart. They’re such incredible people  My mom is now a shell of who she was. And if cancer doesn’t take my dad, I’m afraid she will just by being so needy. 

And I’m tired. And I can’t help but feel this resentment towards her. 

I know she’s trying but it’s like all of this time in hospitals and other facilities plus being on painkillers for so long have destroyed her ability to empathize or allow others to have conversations that don’t involve her. 

I’m not sure why I’m writing this. Mostly to get it out I guess. I feel like I’m a burden to others talking about these things. I recently started dating a great guy right before dads diagnosis, but I’m feeling like I need to break it off. I don’t want to be a burden or just a constant ball of depression. I just am overwhelmed and scared shitless. 

Any resources for dealing with 2 sick parents who are so dependent on each other but drive each other crazy too? Or is that just what we all become lol? How can I work to not feel so guilty? I need to be more patient, but I also know they don’t want me to rearrange my entire life for them, but I feel like I should be there all the time. Thank you for reading if you did 💜"
"If I now have to prompt my mum for a phone click, every time I log on to her google account (to pay bills in her name, check her email, etc), things are going to get very annoying, very fast. Am I worrying about nothing?"
How do i deal with a parent who refuses to eat a decent meal and is only eating sandwiches and ice cream? This same parent is in credit card debt and refuses to let me see any of their financials to help them figure out a plan. This parent just won’t listen and I’m at my wits end!!!
"Hey folks!

My mom has some steadily declining cognitive issues lately, and a few times she's gotten lost in her own neighborhood just going on walks, etc.   She's not willing to take someone with her on her walks, but she is willing to wear a med alert pendant that she can use to alert my dad (and maybe others) to where she is.  I'm not necessarily looking for something with a service where she calls paramedics, etc, just something so when she's lost she can get friends & family to help.

She takes her phone with her usually so we can do a find my phone thing but in case she ever forgets or drops it, we'd like the necklace.

I've done the usual googling but I'm not finding reviews or anything that I trust, so I'm hoping some of you have personal experience with this.

Thanks in advance!

ETA: I appreciate the thoughts about an Apple watch, but she doesn't have apple products in general, and we'd like to keep it very simple for her -- seems like it'd be too many options, too many settings, too much.    


A pendant with a long-life battery she doesn't need to regularly charge is going to be a much better fit."
"My dad has had a chronic cough for years. It is the sort of thing like when you get a tickle in your throat cough. Just this little cough but it is at least once minute for hours. He is losing sleep because it keeps him up and it makes it hard to eat. Drives everybody nuts with the noise and then he stands and coughs in the fridge. Doesn’t want to go anywhere in public because of it. 

Docs did all sorts of tests, scoped his throat many times, removed a small growth, did some fancy lung tests and finally said it was probably just GERD. He has been taking Pepcid and Nexium every day for 5 years. None of his other meds show a chronic cough as a side effect. 

Long shot but has anybody seen anything like this? Ideas on what to push the doc for? 

Thanks."
"Lss. Mom wanted  to move from a nice place in Tx where she stayed to another in Indiana where most of her family is, she's went 1000% downhill in the 2 moths there, but I can't find another place because the current homes referral is horrible. 

Such a catch 22. Have a month left to pay out of her account. She has 60k in her ira, but I have no access to it. The home is not helping get access to it and the lawyers can't help without her consent. 

The reason she's so lost is because of a UTI (95% sure), but I can't get the home to help her. They are writing checks for her and just having her sign them. 

They decided to increase the cost by 25% last month, charging an extra $20 a week for gloves ect. 

There is enough money left in her account to hire a proper person, but another month or 2 there won't be."
"Several weeks ago, my 81 year old father had a bad fall where he broke his hip, wrist, elbow & shoulder. After being stabilized in the hospital, he was moved to a facility I chose based upon their reviews & their rigid a Covid protocols. 

This place has been problematic from the get go. 

First, when he was moved over from the hospital, the rehab facility was already in Covid lockdown. Because of this, I had to drop off his clothing. At drop off, I was assured that his clothing would be labeled with his name & brought to him. This never happened. His clothes ended up apparently being distributed to other patients. Dad even ended up with other people’s clothing. At that point, I took over any collection & laundering of his clothing. I also provided my own labels. 

Second, there was a screw up with his levothyroxine dosage. Several years ago, my father’s thyroid was removed due to cancer. This means he relies on his medication to do the work of the missing thyroid. Well, the rehab center was giving him an absurdly low dose, leading him to be hospitalized with low blood pressure & a pulse that kept dipping into the 30’s. This is HUGE. He could’ve died. 

Third. During dad’s hospitalization, he was extremely concerned about his belongings back at the rehab, understandably. I spoke to his care coordinator, who assured me that he would not be moved from the room he had been in, nor would he belonging be touched. 

Guess what happened

I went this afternoon to the rehab with some clean laundry, and also to ease dad’s mind about his belongings, only to find new occupants in his room & his belongings nowhere to be found. 

The nursing staff was completely unaware that he would be returning & had to scramble to find even a temporary room. Being that it’s Sunday after business hours, NOONE can tell me a thing about where his belongings might have gone. 

I am beyond done with this place. Does anyone know the best way to approach moving him to a different facility? What is the best way to go about this? Do I need a lawyer? Do I speak with his insurance? This is just a huge mess, and I have no idea where to begin. 

Please and thank you for any advice. I am so angry & I feel so helpless."
"My father is suddenly a widower and is suddenly in a nursing home, recovering from a fall.  As my father has no friends and doesn’t or won’t do anything to take care of himself, I’ve relocated to his city for now, and my brother flies in regularly, so that he will have immediate family nearby.

He’s seemed to be OK with me visiting him, as I’ve been coming for 30-60 minutes per day (other than days when my brother is in town, when I fly home). 

But yesterday, when I went to visit, he was watching TV and his eyes did not leave the TV screen except for perhaps 2 minutes total, although he kept talking to me.  So after 45 minutes, I left.

Question: if your aging parents don’t seem to be tuned in when you visit or otherwise don’t seem to enjoy the visit, do you still go, but just for a very short period, such as 5-10 minutes?  Or do you treat them as you would a normal adult who doesn’t welcome your company and not go?

Thanks."
"My mom was diagnosed with Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) earlier this year after around 4 years of progressing symptoms.  Prognosis is 6-10 years after symptom onset. She is now using a walker full time and has finally admitted she needs to move out of her house into something smaller and more manageable with no stairs (but she's making no moves to do so, see below).

Here's the thing, my relationship with my mother is okay but only because I don't have to see her more than once or twice a year. I have a lot of childhood trauma that I am working through in therapy and a significant portion was from my mother, though I did have an alcoholic father as well, which didn't help. I honestly I am on the verge of a nervous breakdown trying to figure out what to do with her. On one hand I feel like I have an obligation to take care of her because she's my mother but on the other hand I feel like I'm not going to survive if I have to take care of her. She's very self-centered and entitled and shows a lot of symptoms of covert narcissism and having grown up with her I just can't do it. I have two younger sisters who feel exactly the same way. And yet I know that she will manipulate and guilt trip one of us (likely me as I am the oldest) into putting our lives aside and taking care of her. She's already trying to force my youngest sister and I to make the decision as to who ""gets"" to take her in (my other sister has health problems of her own and is not my mom's first choice to cater to her at any rate).  

The funny thing is that my mother keeps saying she needs to move out of her house, but she's taking absolutely no steps to actually do that, preferring to heap it on to our shoulders to make the decision. And yet ...we have both told her she needs to go into assisted living but anytime that gets brought up she freaks out about being ""institutionalized"" and refuses to discuss it or gets all weepy and hurt that we ""want to get rid of her"". I have repeatedly told her to hire somebody to clean out her house (oh yeah she's a hoarder too),  pack her stuff and move her to wherever the heck she wants to go but she won't listen. I think she fully expects that one of us is going to come do it for her so that she doesn't have to pay somebody (she is also ridiculously frugal to the point of it actually being a problem). I truly don't have the mental capacity for this anymore.

I honestly am at a loss on what to do about this."
"My (35F) dad (67M) is my person, my rock. He was my stable parent when my mother was terrorizing the house and family with mental illness and addiction. We are Americans but he was in the Netherlands on a business trip when he experienced ventricular fibrillation and passed out in a meeting.[ventricular fibrillation](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ventricular-fibrillation/symptoms-causes/syc-20364523) 

He was diagnosed with [hypertrophic cardiomyopathy](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17116-hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy)

Thank god he survived. 

I flew out to Holland to be with him and we are here now. He is not allowed to fly or leave the hospital until he gets a defibrillator implanted in his chest, which will likely happen next week. We have a lot of time together in the hospital, and I want to make the most of it and have real and meaningful conversations with him. I sense that he wants the same. 

What do you all suggest to open the door? What topics would/did/ do you want to have with your parents in a time like this?"
"Hello. My dad is 95 years old. He’s relatively healthy for his age, however I noticed that his health has declined rapidly over the past year. He gets tired from walking for a few minutes and needs to take a break, due to his heart racing.

Mentally, he’s fine, except for occasional forgetfulness.


He also has trouble sleeping, from what I suspect to be anxiety.

I’m wondering if I get him to do some geriatric exercises that I found on Youtube, maybe he can get back into the shape he was a year ago. 

So has anyone personally tried this and been successful?

Thank you"
"My Mom is 87 and deals with significant memory loss.  My siblings and I all feel it's no longer safe for her to live alone.  I am planning on her moving in with me.  She feels she is handling things just fine but forgets to eat, forgets meds, can't seem to start her fires (yes, she still mainly heats home with wood), her checkbook is a mess, housekeeping was never her strong suit.  She has agreed to come visit me ""for a few days"".  How do I start the discussion that I/we feel she should not return home to live?  I feel like I'm tricking her and I know she will be upset that it has come to this.  Am I going about this the right way?  I know she would dig in her heels if I outright told her she needs to move in with me.  Please share your thoughts and insights."
"After viewing several invoices, we found a few discrepancies and discussed the matter with our Home Health aid. We discovered that the agency is pocketing part of his wages. For instance, if he worked for 2 hours ,and we all agreed that he could leave early, we understood that we would be charged for the 4 hour minimum. We were also aware that the agency received a portion of his hourly rate.  However, we were unaware that the agency was pocketing the remaining 2 hours.  We assumed that HE was being paid for the entire 4 hours. Is this a normal business practice."
"Seeking ideas for how to handle all the spam phone calls my loved one (fiercely independent and living alone) is getting.  Id remove the phone but she needs to talk to distant family. She is not capable of learning anything complicated, has poor vision. 
I have put her on do not call lists but this kind of caller doesnt care about that. 

Thanks!"
"Are there any veteran-centric resources when dealing with senior abuse?

My sister and brother-in-law are abusive to my mother and stepfather, a retired navy master chief.  Verbally, emotionally, monetarily, and more.  My hope is that such a group could offer some solutions in how to get them to stop.  My parents have a trove of abusive texts and other communications and I like a group to hear my folks out and offer support.  

Thank you  
  
 
-----------
Background:

My sister and her husband are about 50 years old, my folks are close to 70.  Stepdad is a veteran - retired Navy Master Chief.  

My mother nearly died over Xmas 2020 and stepdad falls had been getting worse.  We had been under auspices that my sister's bad behaviors were possibly behind her.  My stepdad's family, my household, and them all worked to find a nice retirement community.  I sold my home to be closer to my sister and help take care of my folks.  

My sister wanted it to be the place that was literally 3/8ths of a mile away from her home.  Her husband, my BIL, is a 747 pilot that travels 2 weeks a month all over the world.   My folks couldn't afford it without going bankrupt -- and my sister has unleashed hell on them ever since.   

I know when people have stories of abuse, one wonders if the other party is simply painted negatively but my god that could not be farther from the truth.  My mother is really the sweetest person.  My stepfather is great guy .  All she wants is to see her grandson and my sister is using the ability to see him as a means of manipulating my mom.

The abuse toward my mom goes back to 1998, where my sister punched my mother in the face over not buying extra set of college graduation photos.  Since then shes:

*  Kidnapped their dog - folks were too afraid to try to get it back so she kept it for all it's natural life.
*  Snooped into mom's ipad to read her emails and FB chats.  
*  Demanded my mom write a fake story.  My sister claims CPS were called on her but hasn't proven it's happened.  Just demanded my mom write a note saying she, my gf and i, were terrible people.  Mom was going to send it but told her not to bc no court would take hearsay like that. 
*  Broken my stepfather down to outright bawling, and even threatening to divorce my mom.
*  Wished death upon them, saying she doesn't care stepdad served our country, that he should drop dead.

This evening my mom got an ultimatum from my stepbrother to give into all of my sisters delusional demands.  I've implored my mom to block them but the only thing she wants is just to see photos of her grandson.

All of it is completely unwarranted.  Stepfather paid for sister's first wedding to my BIL.  They got divorced and remarried later.  Mom funded sister's college education in California.  She even bought her a brand new car - and when mom hit on hard times, the car got repossesed and my sister still brings this up to this day.  That was in 1996.  

My stepdad is a standup guy and to see him in tears over my damn sister boils my blood.  I've not spoken a word to my BIL or sister since we first got to TX earlier this year.  He's a well respect guy and my mother has supported him through thick and thin.  All of it is completely unwarranted and I need it to stop now.  My mother is in pieces and it's taking a toll on their health."
"My gran recently took very poorly and after 14 weeks in hospital she’s returned home on end of life care. Her kidneys are failing and so is her heart. She’s totally bed bound, has bed sores and constant runny bms which she wears a pad for. 
She lives with my granddad and my aunt and mum have been staying durning the day to help with her car even though carers come in 4 times a day. They don’t come out durning the night to turn or change her as the care system deem her able to turn on her own, however she’s up most of the night needing help to turn and to be cleaned up.

I’m 22 I’ve taken the news of my gran having little time left hard and am really struggling to see her the way she is even just for a visit. My mum had asked me recently to start staying over night to help my grandad out who’s tired having to be up through the night, but I feel it’s a lot of pressure to stay the night, I’m worried incase something happens I’ve never done her personal care yet so I don’t know how bad the bed sores are etc I’m worried I won’t wake up or something like that plus there isn’t any bed so I’d spend the night on the sofa. 

I love my gran to pieces she more or less raised me as a kid, but I’m having a hard time coming to terms with everything im okay staying durning the day and stuff I guess, I feel if I say I don’t want to stay the night my mum will be pissed and kick me out for being selfish."
"One last post and then im through. Thank you all for putting up with me.

If anyone remembers my Dad had digestive issues and we kept changing his diet. his doctor just had him take fiber and stop taking Pepto Bismol. From his descriptions and answers to my questions all i could ever gather was it was sometimes watery, happened 1 or 2 times and month and was always very urgent. his descriptions didnt sound like blood or anything else. 

But

when he was in the hospital for pneumonia and didnt eat for 9 days he had a BM. the doc said the look of it prompted them to scope his stomach. they found he had bleeding ulcers. I have been over and over many would have and should haves and found my failings. But maybe the lesson here is to ask the doctor what can be done to look further instead of just adding fiber and leaving it at that. or them just saying he's old and his system is wearing out. 

dad always said he didnt hurt. no idea if true or just bravado. My other thought is dont always believe what they say. look closer. If any doubt take em in to be checked. 

The doc said they would fix his stomach with meds. No one offered how his stomach got in the shape it was in. i wonder now if his meds didnt do a number on him. But im not a doctor. 

Aight, hope this helps someone. Thank you again and take care."
"My mother had a stroke in January of this year. Because it was treated in time, she has regained what the doctors describe as normal vision, memory, and movement capabilities. However, she has diagnosed heart failure and she's much more unbalanced and disoriented more frequently. She doesn't always think clearly and often describes a brain fog. She lives alone, has little to no friends/support, and is the stubborn, independent type. I live across the country and worry that she'll have an accident or do something stupid because she won't address that her capabilities have changed. On top of it all, she's basically living at poverty level income and tells me how she doesn't buy food to save money. 

I do what I can to send her money every month, will help pay for and move her into a cheaper apartment soon, and advise where I can, but I'm so overwhelmed and fearful about the future. I don't want to be a caregiver. I'm not cut out for it emotionally. My mother and I have a difficult relationship where she suffers from severe depression and mental health issues, and I feel frustrated because I feel like I am often parenting my parent. Though we will soon be moving my mother to the same city as one of my sisters, my sister is not financially capable of supporting my mother or providing regular/daily care. My mother has also said she will never go into assisted living because she worked in those facilities and saw how terrible they were. She's stated that she will commit suicide or shoot herself before she'd be put into one of those places. 

I am at a loss for what to do to make both her life and my life better. I feel angry, and I resent that she burned all of her bridges with friends and other people who could provide support. I feel like (outside of the stroke) she created this lonely life for herself (even though I know that's not true). I feel like a bad child. I feel like a bad adult. I know that most of us owe our parents something for raising us, but I'm only 30 years old and I didn't ask for this. It feels terrible to say that. 

I don't know if there's any advice out there to make things easier. I know I'm not alone in this, but I feel so alone.

EDIT to say that I’ve even had strangers reach out to me on social media to tell me that she didn’t seem well and was doing things they considered dangerous when they came by to pick up an item she was selling online. Like, what do I do with that??"
"Dad is 77, living on his own, but on the grounds of an AL facility (in his own townhouse.) He has gone downhill significantly in the past several months. Clearly has dementia of some form. Had a lot of testing done while in hospital, rehabbing from hip replacement in January this year, although for some reason the neuropsychiatrist could not/would not give a final diagnosis. Talked to his GP in late August, who agreed he has something, he suggested cardiac origins. Dad definitely has soectrum-idicitive issues as well, if not suffering from fetal alcohol syndrome. 

Last week a mental health nurse went to visit him at his home to start an assessment, and this week, the new neuropsch will come. They have asked me to be present for this second appointment. I know it's coming. He really cannot live alone - he has had at least five falls since he moved in last August. The most recent of which he couldn't understand that he just needed to grab the handles of his walker to stop it from moving. 

All this comes down to one question - how did you prepare both yourself and your elderly person for the diagnosis? The manager of his AL facility reached out to me last week because the volunteers he relies on to bring in his groceries are getting concerned for him. He's taking 45 minutes to place an order. His place is a mess (he is a hoarder who has limited executive functioning skills.) She wants to see him move into the main building. I think it would be wonderful if he did. Home-cooked meals 3x a day, housekeeping, meds administration, plus, socializing! All fantastic things. Dad has it in his head that it's a horrible place. He also believes he's fully competent. Likes to say, ""I have been managing alone for 12 years now."" But he's been declining for 12 years since my mom died. It's just happening faster and faster now. So, let's say we get a diagnosis. They could decide he's unfit to live alone and move him, against his wishes. Or, do I push back and say, ""let's arrange in-home care to keep him happy where he is."" 

I'm just a mess of emotions and anxiety right now. What was your experience in this situation?"
"Hoping to get some advice from those who have been through this. My mom had major surgery and now needs supervision whenever she's moving around the house to prevent another fall. She can't do household chores.

She basically lives alone. Her husband is in very poor health (by choice -- he won't go to the doctor, drinks and smokes all day, and has had at least one major heart attack without going to the hospital for it) and isn't able to help her very much. He does try when he can.

She refuses to move in with my sister who lives down the street because it would hurt her relationship with her husband. I realize this makes no sense.

Are our best options a home worker, putting her semi-involuntarily in an assisted living facility, or something else? This is all brand new to us since she was very healthy until recently. She isn't likely to fully recover anytime soon.

Thanks in advance for any input! This situation really sucks."
"This is just a rant but advice is welcome.   Dad was in the hospital for pneumonia and his recovery is SLOW.  He went to rehab then discharged.  He is now incontinent and can barely stand.  My blind mother lives at home and can not help him.   SO my sisters and I put him in assisted living on Friday.  Well they are short staffed, his call bell malfunctioned and he had to call me to get someone at the facility to change his diaper etc over the weekend.  Needless to say it was a 💩 first weekend there.   

So I started researching in home care.  And just as I thought,  hone health is struggling for staff.  

My dad is desperate to go home.  But none of us kids live close enough to provide him care.  

I hate to watch him be unhappy.  I also resent that my parents did not make a better plan."
"My mom and her husband downsized into a small studio apartment in a senior living community. They have very limited space, have meals provided, and no longer have a vehicle. I really don't want to give them slippers again. 

Any ideas for gifts? (Hoping we can make a thread that will help us all.)

Gifts of experiences (museum trips, etc.) and time (spending time together) are always good, but my mom wants to open things under the tree still, and I'm sure she's not the only one.

Thanks in advance!"
"Do your aging parents do this to you?  Is it a sign of deterioration?

My parents constantly repeated the same stories, told me the same things over and acted as though I knew very little. For example, my mother emailed me to tell me that a governor of one state went to the same university that I did.  (I knew that; we were there around the same time.)

Now it’s gotten more frequent.  A few things that my father has told me recently:

“There’s a department store chain called Macy’s.  It has a store in town.” 

When I told him that I had interviewed a relatively famous person: “oh, yes.  She was in the news for X, Y and Z.”  (Yes…exactly the topic of the interview.)

When I was putting food into the microwave: “Microwaves’ power varies.  So if it takes 4 minutes in yours it might take a different amount of time in this one.”

“Richard Nixon ran for president in 1968.  His running mate was…” (After he slowed down, forgetting the name, I said “Spiro Agnew”.)  He responded, “Spiro Agnew was elected Vice President in 1968.”  (You think I don’t know that, as I told you he was Nixon’s running mate?)

Anyone else face this?  Do you just smile, or do you have the parent’s memory and cognition checked?"
"Hi!

What is the best cleaner to get out the urine smell (USA) ? Nature's Miracle?  BioKleen? Does Nature's Miracle (or a like cleaner) work on carpeting/mattresses? My mother has a very strong smell of urine in her house and we are going to deep clean it."
"So many of us are dealing with depressed parents, I'm trying my best to help but I feel like I'm just throwing random stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks....would be nice to have some guidance from people who are more successful."
"Hi, This year has been the year that I have felt the pinch of taking care of my parents. since after covid in 2020, life has gotten expensive than I expected. I just turned 28, I am living with my parents in the same house I was raised in since I was 10, I work, study, take my mom to work and pick her up every day, pay the bills. I also have a sister that helps in taking care of my parents. 

I am thankful that everyone is in good health. even though we are three people in the house earning money its not enough to take care of everything. You see my dad is some how of a hard head. he asks for money from each of us separately and no one knows what he does with the money. no one wants to talk about this because we care about each other as a family and we don't want to be divided by something like money. his responsibilities are simple to make sure the bills in the house are paid for we give him money to pay. now he has fallen behind in on payment on electricity bill, we owe the electricity company a lot of money that we have to pay or we will have no power.

I feel like my dad is not being truthful and the money me and my sister are earning now in our 20's is supposed to help build our lives. He keeps on saying that we have debt to pay for, a never ending debt. I have spoken to him about this, but he seems so sincere, but yet I don't understand how we go through so much money in a month. I have been so stressed out by this for the past four months that I stopped caring. To add to this I am also his personal assistant anything he needs done using a computer I make time during the day and help him.

I also take my mom everyday to work and pick her up. I wait for her on an average of 1 hour everyday just sitting in the car when I pick her up. I feel like I am loosing both time and money. 

They are also hard headed, I tell them to eat healthy, I even went and saw a nutritionist who was not cheap. I had her make a time table for food, a healthy balanced food. that my parents have completely ignored. I have tried to encourage the family to save money every month so that next year wont be so hard, this is also ignored. 

I love my parents and I would give them everything, I am even looking for opportunities to move to other countries with good paying jobs, to help them financially. Because I feel like if they don't take care of themselves I will be the one looked at. I also feel like they are ignorant about both my future and my sister's. 

I am so stressed and I feel like I am living in denial like this is not reality, I have been in denial for the past four months. I am trying to study, work, take care of my parents and the home, but I am falling behind on my studies, I even feel like giving up and I feel like I am not being competent at work.

Any advice is much appreciated. Thank you."
"I'm about to close out day 11 being back in my hometown because my dad has valve endocarditis and has been hospitalized for 12 days. Dad is 73; Mom is about to turn 72. I live farrrr far away from here, have a whole life at age 34 in a city I love. Left home at the age of 18 for college, lived back at home for \~6 months after college, then moved far away to a real city and never turned back. I don't really like where I'm from. For a multitude of reasons. Being here is already triggering for me, and this is the longest trip I've taken home in many many years.

Anyway, my parents are both batshit crazy and I'm slowly losing it. Self-medicating with alcohol and Xanax because otherwise I think I might go fully mental. They live in the same house they bought when they moved to town in the late '70s--same house I grew up in as an only child. Never done any major renovations on the house, barely maintained it throughout the years, and now they're lying in the bed they made: plumbing is failing, basement is flooding, roof is mildewy/moldy/unclear, they have mice/mouse droppings in their kitchen cabinet, roots are growing up through driveway causing cracks and bumps (one of which tripped my mom about a month ago and caused a head wound--which I only just learned about 11 days ago when I got to town and saw a giant red scar on her forehead). They live in a one-story with a basement, and still take a giant staircase to get in the house even though there's a sidewalk with a small porch in the front that has only a few steps. A serious fall has already occurred (unbeknownst to me) and more are pending, I am certain. 

Since I've been here I've taken over a lot of the tasks my mom simply seems incapable of doing: grocery shopping, laundry, calling the plumber, cleaning out her kitchen (**so much** old/moldy/bad food...), taking the trash/recycling out, getting Dad's car washed. On and on. And she and I split the time visiting with Dad in the hospital. And really, I wouldn't mind doing this all if it didn't feel so Sisyphean. Like no matter what I do, the house is still falling down around their ears and they're doing nothing to change it. My dad for obvious reasons--he's very sick and simply **can't.** My mom--because she lives in a deeeeeeep hole of denial and is well beyond the point of being ""stuck in her ways."" She's buried in her ways. And  she will stay there 'til she's dead.

Good news is my dad's heart muscle is in excellent health, it's just a faulty infected valve that's caused his illness. He's on IV antibiotics and as long as they can get the fluid off his lungs, replace the valve with a fresh one, and clear the infection, he *should* eventually be able to build back his strength and recover. But right now, he's very sick. And **very fucking grumpy about it.** He's turned into such an asshole, he's someone I barely recognize anymore. Once the most positive, optimistic people you'd ever met, almost to a fault--he now is filled mostly with curse words and slurs and negativity. And I can hardly blame him, really.

My mom's mind is going. You tell her something, she forgets it almost immediately. Dad's not much better, to be honest, and his illness has made it worse--not enough oxygen to the brain, etc. But my mom... it's nearly impossible to make anything stick. Example: in the hospital room one morning together with Dad, she offered to go get coffee downstairs, and I told her my order. A simple order. Three words: ""black cold brew."" She walked to the hospital room door and I said, ""Mom, do you remember my order?"" She said no. I ended up having to text it to her so she would be able to see it and say it. 

When I raise this issue to her, of her waning mental acuity, mostly as a practical matter re: Dad's medical care, she becomes extremely defensive and angry and accuses me of being a know-it-all. Every time. So far, my solution is simply to talk to her as little as possible because I end up so frustrated trying to communicate with her, she ends up defensive, and then we just fight. And it honestly seems like it overwhelms her, too, so wouldn't it just be better for both of us to speak as little as possible...?

This is on top of a looooooad of other issues she has: hoarding (hence the food waste), poverty mindset, severe anxiety, negative thinking. And on top of all of this, my dad was **very** sick for about 8-10 weeks before they finally fucking called 911 and had him admitted to the hospital. He should have gone in MUCH SOONER, and although I blame them **both** for this potentially life-threatening oversight, I mostly blame HER. She's watched him be so sick, unable to even walk around the house, unable to do ANYTHING, constantly winded... and essentially just let him be that way. Sure, she took him to countless doctors' appts, and his doctors IMO should have pulled the trigger on hospitalization a lot sooner, but ultimately I blame her for letting it get to this point. My dad is so weak and sick that he cannot stand up from his hospital bed. At all.

This is really just a vent/rant, and if you've made it this far, Goddess bless you. I just have no fucking idea how to deal with any of this \^\^ if my mom were in better mental shape, that would be really helpful, but unfortunately that's not the case. I am just so over it and want to go back to my life and leave them to theirs, but the crushing guilt that would produce--when  one of them is inevitably severely injured or dies--is not worth it to me.

I hate this so much and I resent them for letting it get to this point. I just want to scream all the time. To be totally clear, they never asked me to come, and in fact it seems like they both would prefer if I go back to my home. So I'm here of my own volition, in a hell of my own making I guess you could say. But it was already hell before I got here, with constant texts and phone calls about how sick my dad was... and I felt extremely guilty not being here. The hospitalization was the turning point. 

IDK. I just hate this all so much... it's almost Xanny and bedtime for me. Thanks for reading."
"Many of us deal with problems getting parents to eat. 

Many of us deal with stingy parents who want to pinch every penny. 

With this in mind. Just make them some food and put it in front of them. 

They will eat it just to not waste money."
"My father is constantly fighting with the staff members in his nursing home.  He doesn’t like them, and he very vocal and critical of them when he talks to me…and they can surely hear every word.  He says that they’re mean to him.  I don’t doubt that but when he says unkind things about them, their response is human nature.

I figure that giving them small bags of Lindt chocolate (from the grocery store) or cookies (from the grocery store) might help.

Good idea?

Thanks."
"First off, my dad has always been a rather difficult man. He would rather stay home than travel or spend time with people. He feels rejected by people easily. He also has chronic neuropathy and may be in early stages of dementia. He was recently rather forced into retirement since he cannot remember things as easily anymore even though he was going to retire at the beginning of 2022 due to pain and discomfort anyway. However now he is getting really depressed and tired of watching TV all day. I live across the country and cannot go spend time with him to force him out of his comfort zone. He lives in a small town with little to do and no friends. I am worried about his mental health. Does anyone have any advice on how to get him out of the house or how he can maybe make some friends?"
"I’m not saying that mine is, but what do you do if an elderly person who you’re caring for clearly dislikes members of one ethnic group, and the caregivers for the elderly person are largely members of that group?"
"I need some advice on how to handle my father (67m), who is for the most part still young enough and has the majority of his wits about him.  He is an engineer and by default “right” about almost everything (or so his ego tells him) and as a result is incredibly difficult when faced with an opinion that is not his own.  The issue:  my parents have not had their chimney cleaned or inspected in over 20 years, because my dad thinks burning a hot fire in the (open hearth) fireplace is good enough to avoid creosote buildup.  Any chimney or fire professional would obviously say otherwise - and I believe that his “old fashioned method” has been de-bunked as unsafe.   
I took it upon myself to book a chimney cleaning and inspection for them ahead of this winter season, as they use that fireplace almost daily.   My mistake was likely that I didn’t tell him, or clear this with him ahead of time (because I knew he’d take issue with it regardless) and now he’s incredulous that I “overstepped” and is telling me to cancel the service.  
WTF DO I DO ABOUT THIS?! it’s a real safety risk - and he cannot be convinced that this is necessary even for his family’s peace of mind.  I’m at a total loss….."
"This isn't quite my parent, but I've helped give care to my grandmother for years now and my parents are caring for my grandmother full time so I figured close enough.

Grandmother is 91, has advancing alzheimer's, probably around stage 6 I'd guess. She's incontinent and unable to eat any more. She had a GTube installed about two or three months ago and she hates it and hates that she can't eat anymore and has pulled it out about half a dozen times. This last time they put a clothing barrier on her to keep her from pulling it out and it's made her furious for the past week or so. We're trying to find some daycare to have other people to interact with because she refuses to interact with anyone in the house other than to beg/demand to go to the emergency room and it seems like a part of this is that she's bored. That happens Monday.

Anyway she's a lot of work and depressed and angry and has always been unbelievably stubborn. But this is the first year that she couldn't participate in holidays like she used to.

Which brings us to Thanksgiving. The Food Holiday. And she can't eat. And hates that she can't eat and hates it when we eat, either around her or in another room. I don't know how to get through this without a meltdown. I don't think my parents will cancel the dinner, it's a big holiday for them. It's hard to have my grandmother at table because she'll like... defecate to ruin the dinner. Maybe socializing more will help take the edge off of things but does anyone have any ideas on how to get through Turkey day? Christmas is a (lesser) food holiday too but if we can figure out how not to be cruel but get through Thanksgiving then Christmas is something we can do. 

I was thinking maybe baby food-ify some turkey and green beans and mashed potatoes but the problem is that she has kind of forgotten how to swallow. Any ideas would be deeply appreciated."
"I've read symptoms online but do they have to have them all or just some? My grandmother is mostly aware and has an appetite. She doesn't eat much though because she having trouble swallowing and I also think she hallucinates every now and then. She's got pressure sores that are very large, aren't healing, and look very terrible (rehab facility didn't realize they were there even though they should have been in her paperwork and we told them in the beginning so they've gotten really bad in the course of almost 2 weeks.) She's very weak but can talk a bit. She's so weak though she doesn't even say she's in pain anymore and she's got to be in pain because she has a foot long pressure sore on her butt."
"Its been a week since my Dad passed unexpectedly. I laid him to rest today and for 7 days ive been trying to understand. As ive been cleaning through the house ive come across things that make me think he was alot worse than I thought. now all the things I wondered at and didnt understand make sense and it breaks my heart. I wished I had understood and could go back and do better. But you can never go back. After the funeral I found some peace. Its over and hes gone. theres no going back. 

My next impulse was to write out my heart hoping it would help others. It doesnt work that way. that was an attempt for me to go back and change things. Doesnt work. You are left with nothing but an empty house and knowing that you did what you thought was best at the time. It strikes me that to move on maybe I should just drop it. 

thanks again to everyone for everything. One last thing, in caring for someone at all times and in all things do not be frsutrated or angry...you dont understand them. be only love and compassion, feel only love. lose your ego and surrender to love."
"At the beginning of the year my dad was telling me it's time for him to find a retirement community. I was really happy about that as his house if HUGE for 1 person. We live across country, I'm in CA and he's in PA. It was his idea to ask me to check out places in CA. I didn't think he'd ever come to CA becasue he pretty much lived to take care of my handicapped brother.

My brother passed away in May and my dad at that time was saying now he really wants to go to CA, great. But He has a surgery he wanted to get done first. This surgery was for a sciatic nerve and it got rid of one pain, however has left in in a whole level of new pain and he's currently walking worse than before the surgery. He has had a shitty experience in assisted living after surgery so I kept telling him to come here and see places and he can start the application process becasue these things take forever. He finally comes here and he's so disinterested. Whenever I ask him a question like ""how did you like this place."" He just says he's not making a decision right now, when that wasn't my question at all. The last place he didn't even bother going to see the apartment because he didn't feel like walking.

That's great, but this is the man that's leaving me in 2 days and going back to live in his HUGE house. He complains about my 1 step to my house when he has 2 and these are larger than mine. His walkway to his house is also 4 times mine as is his whole house. I'm beyond frustrated and pissed. He refuses to use a walker cause he feels like he's an invalid using it and just uses his cane and grabs onto the nearest furniture or wall whenever he walks. I don't see it ending in another way than him falling and ending up in a wheelchair or worse and then he won't have a choice he'll 100% going to nursing or assisted living.

In the past few years I think I average going to the east coast like 4 times a year. Whenever something happens he's crying on the phone that he needs me and I need to save him and when he's ""ok"" like now it's like I'm talking to a brick wall. He doesn't say anything when I tell this to him. I can't keep going east every time he has a thing, becasue he has a thing like all the bloody time.

I got him home care for 4 hours a day during the week, but in a way I think this is the end. He does nothing all day but sit. He just shits and pees himself becasue he's too lazy to go to the toilet and wears a diaper instead but is also too lazy to change the diaper. He's not going to improve from his surgery becasue he's literally going to sit in his chair and stare at his feet.

I get it he's been through far too much but he has this opportunity to change his life but it seems like he'd rather just waste away into nothing. 

Anyway just needed to rant. It is what it is and I just need to let go. Clearly my dad doesn't care about my feelings. It's time to stop caring about him."
"Hoping for some advice from anyone who has been In a similar situation. The in laws. We’re in a different country. There’s a lot of stress since the passing of FIL last year and MIL deterioration. Care has been organised as much as we can but the family is now all fighting. The eldest sister who promised FIL that MIL would stay at home and who is the executor of the Will seems to be overreacting. Accusing the others of wanting to kill MIL by feeding her sugar (diabetes) to get the inheritance. Got the court involved to takeover all bank accounts so niece won’t steal $ and property. (News to niece that she is a thief...) screams that no one else is looking after MIL but her when in reality they’ve been driven away because each time they try to visit they get accused of stealing things or trying to kill MIL with sugar. Trouble is with all the fighting we can’t get answers on MIL condition or talk about treatment let alone discuss possible nursing home option. We can’t ask questions or challenge the strange beliefs. We try asking or writing but get ignored. We are finding all the negativity and misinformation exhausting and draining. Suggested to husband that we try to establish boundaries and try to get her to focus on facts but still ended up being dumped on and ignoring questions. I realise it is difficult and stressful but it’s really starting to impact on us. We worry that in her delusions she might put a restraining order on the others. Also worry that we may lose all contact with her if we try to stand up. I’m already in trouble for suggesting she might be overreacting and she won’t talk or respond to me. It worries me that she is trying to control everything herself and not allowing any discussion with her two siblings. We’re resigned to the fact that there will be an accident for MIL and she’ll have to go into a home...
It’s v sad that she honestly thinks the others don’t care about MIL (of course they do) and only want to kill her to get $. (They don’t) it’s not even 12 months since FIL passed and it’s a huge mess. When husband was there last year she accused him also of trying to kill MIL with sugar (he bought her a croissant) and spending all the money (on a handrail for toilet after MIL got stuck on toilet) and that there would be no $ for FIL gravestone...
I think we are beyond trying to support or reason with her but we have to deal with her as she has assumed charge (poorly imho)
What we want and need is simple clear communication  and the chance to ask questions or make suggestions."
"Wondering if anyone's found a good app for making email *really* simple on an Android tablet?

The main problem I'm finding is that they've all stopped using words and just use icons.  We need buttons that say ""reply"" and ""forward"", not little arrows that you have remember which way means which.  It's one of those things that seems so simple to those of us who grew up with this technology and don't have fuzzy heads yet, but remembering to look for a little bin icon or exclamation mark when they want to delete or spam an email is so much harder for my oldies.

TBH, for the tablet I don't really need them to be able to much else beyond just read their various newsletters and stuff.  Would be nice if they could delete/archive too, but that's secondary.  It just feels like all the apps have too many functions and it's easy for them to tap themselves into places they don't need to be and can't get out of.

As a side note, I'd highly recommend [Simplify for Gmail](https://simpl.fyi/) to make the desktop experience much cleaner.  But that's desktop only."
"My folks were fine, until, suddenly they weren’t. I hear this so often from people with aging parents. The “downfall” is swift, unexpected and has no mercy.

Where to start? I think many elders try to “hang on” too long, and put up a good front for us, their children. Often it takes a hospitalization, illness or injury for us to find out where things really stand. They need help, they need it yesterday, and we are left scrambling.

If I had a do over, I would pay more attention to the small things to really see how functional they are. Are they cooking? Are they managing the grocery trips okay? Is the house in disarray, or in need of repairs? Are their clothes clean and matched? Are they paying the bills? I was with them a lot, but still unaware things had gotten so hard for them. It took a serious illness to force the issue.

Their physician will be your best friend, seeing them and you  through this.  Their physician will be able to make recommendations for Hospice if needed, validate paperwork, and keep you updated. Make sure you are on the list of people approved to see their medical info, and be sure to go to several doctors visits with them, so you are a familiar face. Check in with the physician periodically, and ask their opinion on how things are going. Make sure neighbors have your phone number, and ask them to call if they see anything out of the norm.

In my fictional “do over”, I would start looking at options way earlier. Check out assisted living facilities in your area. Find out about agencies that provide various levels of care. Check on resources that may be available to them, such as through the VA.  

Introduce Mom and Dad to the idea of help early on. Our focus was assisted living. Drop the brochures on their table. “Hey, look, this place in brand new! It has a pool, and it’s own park”. Drive by some of the sites “Just a look, for maybe sometime down the road”. You might ask their physician to bring it up casually in a positive light.

We always said we would have them stay at home, and get help for them, but it turns out that wasn’t the ideal situation.  Mom didn’t want to cook. Planning meals put a lot of pressure on her. Keeping up with, well, upkeep, gets harder, even with family help. Not to mention the isolation of being at home - just the two of you - as an older couple (Covid!). 

As I said, assisted living was the answer for us, but it took three tries. Yes, we actually moved my folks three times in their nineties
for various reasons. The last move was to a brand new facility, that wasn’t even open when we first started looking. The staff are amazing, it is filled with light, and doesn’t smell like old people. 

If anyone is interested, I can make a post regarding money, and on things we learned by trial and error about assisted living.   Hang in there, caretakers, you got this!"
"My dad (76) has a nurse that visits twice a week. He has congestive heart failure, bladders issues, diabetes and is obese. He mind is starting to go and shows signs of vascular dementia for which he is being seen for next week. Problem is, he keeps canceling his nurse. He claims he doesn’t need the care. My sister and I are at wits end with him because of his desire to be completely independent and the fact that he feels he doesn’t need the nurse for which we believe is more due to embarrassment than anything. 

When do you draw the line? We’ve both talked with him, argued with him and tried to find middle ground and he continues to push over the line and we’re fed up. Do we just cancel care and let him wallow in his own filth? The caregiver is more to clean, make sure he’s taking his daily meds, cook, clean etc, that hes has trouble with. And to give some kind of social stimulation. 

My sister and I are both unable to give him daily care as we both work full time."
"My father is in a nursing home for a few weeks and has a few doctors’ appointments during that period.  He can’t walk, so he needs to be taken in a van to them.

When I asked the nursing home to coordinate transportation to them, the nurse did so for one appointment but refused for the others and says that the others will need to be rescheduled to after his stay since they are unrelated to the skilled nursing that Medicare pays for.

Is this how it works: when you’re in a Medicare-paid nursing home, you can’t go to any doctor’s appointment that is unrelated to your stay in the home?  

Or is it just that Medicare won’t pay for unrelated doctor’s appointments (and transportation), so the patient has to pay for transportation, but can go to the appointment?

It seems risky to force an elderly patient to delay medical appointments that are unrelated to the patient’s nursing home stay.  I’ll gladly pay for transportation to the doctor during the stay.

Thanks."
"Hi all, my dad (77, early stages dementia, NOT tech savvy, lives alone) has been discovering all the joys of YouTube. And now, he's discovered YouTube premium. I think it's brutally expensive/a total rip off, but from what he's telling me he wants to watch, it sounds like the BBC iPlayer app (with a VPN as we are not in the uk) might be a better fit for him. However, it only sounds like it works intermittently with VPNs, which is the only way I could get him set up to watch it. 

Has anyone else managed to set up a VPN with a streaming app and be able to be hands-off from then on? My dad is a master at pressing random buttons when things don't work, so perhaps this is not the best option at all. In that case, have any other suggestions?"
"Is there a list of paperwork you wish you had in order before you parents passed? 

they have a will - their house will go to me

is there something good to have for if something happens and you need to take over for them, like one gets dementia?

any advice you wish you had?

thank you!!!!!!!!!!"
"My mother is losing loads of money she cant afford to lose by not doing anything with a property my dad left her when he died that he rented out as a source of income. 

she has left it empty for a year and  hasn't understood what the situation from the organisation renting it is.  she also seems determined to discourage me to get it sorted and has been basically mocking me for doing something she hasn't done that i'm happy to sort out in the memory of my dad with no strings. ( and have done single handedly despite asking for help from family with full transparency) .  she's always been a bully but now its at the expense of her financial security.

she won't file taxes either - i do them, try to make them easy for her to do and she still doesn't understand how and why she has to do them. 

nothing she says has any logic or emotional intelligence. she doesn't seem able to have an objective conversation about anything and i honestly didn't realise she was this out of touch with reality and her own affairs.

given that she's addicted to abusing me - is there an organisation  that can help her not needlessly  flush my dads entire life's work down the pan and get into financial difficulty because of her refusal to do anything or engage meaningfully with reality.. i think she might have a ""pathological demand avoidant"" type autism"
"She has difficulty walking and her executive functioning and planning abilities have taken a plunge. 

While the symptoms have been gradual over 3-5 years, The diagnosis came over the past couple years. It’s been a perfect storm of Parkinson’s and very high pandemic anxiety. 

I feel like she’s slowly vanishing .  I think it may be the anxiety but she has always been somewhat quiet. Sometimes it’s like she’s lost inside her head.  She is still sharp and doesn’t have dementia, but I don’t like seeing her this way.  

My dad is doing a pretty good job taking care of her. He’s a doctor and knows his shit. he’s prescribing Xanax for her which isn’t great.  At the same time he’s also in denial. He’s always been very independent in I think it’s hard for him not to be able to fix this. 

I think his own anxiety manifests as somewhat controlling.  For example when you ask my mom a question he often talks for her or over her.  Which adds to my fears about her “vanishing”

My parents have Always been actively engaged in life, typically went on one or two vacations a year. They’ve been to Vietnam, safaris in Africa, Spain, Argentina, and Denmark to name a few. When not traveling they’d go to museums and concerts. 

My mom would usually be the one who would do all the heavy planning for this. But with Parkinson’s her executive functioning is shot. As a result, they haven’t gone anywhere since before Covid, and they’re not doing much of anything outside the house.   

I don’t think they’re doing terrible, but it scares me and breaks my heart to watch them get old.

I’m scared.

I’ve started to do research and it looks like there are many resources and support groups for Parkinson’s patients and caregivers. There might be some psychotherapy for Parkinson’s out there. 

I’m going to set up meal delivery for them and I really would like to plan some kind of getaway for them. Just because mom isn’t the planner that she used to be, it doesn’t mean they can’t have adventure. Unsure how open they’ll be to this or even how to bring it up. 

I’d love to hear from some of you who have been through this before.  Any suggestions, resources or recommendations would be super appreciated.

Thanks so much"
"I’m in a tough situation with my in-laws and the future looks terrifying to me. My in-laws are in their late 70’s and currently live independently with their oldest son. My father in law was given 6 months to live as he has water on the brain from alcoholism. Up until recently my mother in law was still buying him alcohol despite his diagnosis. I understand the grips of alcoholism as I’m in recovery myself with 9 years of sobriety. If he wants to drink himself to death it’s his choice. The main problem is their finances and the possibility of them being homeless. They have never managed their finances well. I’ve been married to my husband 21 years and they have been a mess financially the whole time. They were a mess when my husband was a child so much that he lived in a tent when he was 10 years old and often went hungry. It’s put a huge strain us. They never put a penny away for emergencies and buy hundreds of dollars worth of booze, cigarettes, and weed a month. My husband’s older deadbeat brother has lived with them on and off for his whole life and he drains them financially as well. In the past 10 years they had 2 major windfalls of money. First 10 years ago his dad had a bad surgery and was awarded 125k in compensation. 2 years later they filed bankruptcy and were broke again. Than 7 years ago they won the lottery worth 250k. 4 years after it was gone with not a penny in savings. They showered friends and relatives with loans and money acting like they were big shot millionaires; never even treated us to dinner. Now his mom calls us whenever something breaks and asks for help… even though they have 4 social security checks coming in (my husband’s mentally ill brother also lives with them and pays some rent and the deadbeat brother’s disability check). I know life is expensive and SS checks are not large, but their lot rent in their trailer park is 500$ and that is their only bill besides utilities and copays; their 4 checks combined equal about 3500 “I’m confident all their excess money goes to cigarettes, booze, and weed. In the past we have helped them sporadically with 200$ here 500$ there, but we do not give them money monthly as we can’t afford to and honestly if if we could afford it I can’t in good conscience give them are hard earned money for vices. When his dad passes they will loose his check and have 1k less monthly. His mother is 74 but still healthy enough to not qualify for any assistance such as a nursing home. She doesn’t qualify for food stamps because they make too much. If they can barely afford their bills now how will they do with 1000 less when his dad passes. I have struggled with anxiety my whole life having grown up in an abusive home. I have to handle my life gently because of my own tendencies towards addictions. If we are forced to take my mother in law in I feel it will jeopardize my own mental health. I’m a stay at home mom and don’t want to spend my days with her. I know this may sound harsh and I know it’s my husband’s mother, but I don’t think I have it in me. Our daughter and our marriage would suffer. At the same time what happens if she becomes homeless? My husband feels like we will never be forced to take her in but I know he will never allow her to be homeless. At the same time we can’t supplement her income. We have a nice home and life but we also have our own retirement to think about and I haven’t even started my daughter’s college fund. I didn’t go into how they never ask about their grandchild, never come to see her, and often forget holidays. His mother is calling him almost daily as a person to vent to. I feel so bad for my husband. She doesn’t care that using him as a place to vent puts him in a horrible place. They now have rats, last week the AC broke. Any situation they face that involves money they call us first just to see if we will cover it for them. I’m so depressed as my own parents are a mess too. Just need some advice."
"I wanted to write a quick review on something I got for my mom that our population would be interested in. She's had the same landline phone number for \~30 years and while moving her out of the house, she did not qualify to keep the phone number for the new area's landline due to whatever landline regulations. She could only keep it if it within x miles to her old house or if we transferred the number to a cell phone. I was part of the generation that got to see the cell phone turn from a giant brick to tiny computers and my mom wanted no part of it. She never learned how to use a cell phone. From the times I have patiently attempted to teach her, she only learned how to swipe to answer calls but not perfectly. However, she only knew how to use the cordless landline phones well enough to make and receive calls. After looking for something to match her abilities, I got her one of these [https://telephones.att.com/telephones/cordless-telephones/bluetooth](https://telephones.att.com/telephones/cordless-telephones/bluetooth) and transferred the landline number to a cell phone. I set it up for her and it works wonderfully. Granted, it's not as intuitive as her old cordless landline but it's MUCH less of a learning curve and she's able to make and receive phone calls after showing her how to use it. The only downside is that you can't walk too far from the cell phone as Bluetooth has limited range. Of course you don't have to go with this exact brand but if you're in a similar bind, look for a cordless landline phone with connect to cell capabilities."
I'm a little concerned that my folks could make purchases on the internet that they might later regret. Is it possible to put a limit on purchase price for an Amazon account? What are other strategies for limiting purchases?
"Hi there,

I posted something similar on a medical advice sub and was advised to post here too for some other perspectives.

Long story short, my 92 y/o, semi independent grandmother developed shingles at the start of September, which affected her vision, leading to a fall and a broken hip.  After a successful operation, she remained in hospital for 2 weeks or so before being transferred to a specialist xommunity hospital so she could have physiotherapy before going home or into a care home.  

Unfortunately, her entire stay in both hospitals has been beset by a refusal to eat and drink much of the time.  The nurses are at their wits end, and she will only eat when someone is available to visit and feed her.  She'll typically eat a normal portion whevener this happens.

A number of folk on Reddit have intimated that they believe she may be nearing the end.  I can accept this and am prepared for this, although we have yet to receive an indication from her nurses or doctors that they think she might be past the point of recovery.  I am realistic about her prospects, but nonetheless I will continue to help her get better until it comes time to do otherwise.

As I don't live locally, primary visiting responsibility lies with my mum, who has an extremely strained relationship with my grandmother.  Due to incidents during her upbringing, my mum holds a lot of resentment towards my granny and her perceived ""controlling"" behaviour, which has lead to instances of my mum threatening to stop visiting granny if she will not eat and drink, and to raise her voice and leave angrily during visits where she has not done so.  My mum thinks that granny's refusal to eat is simply another act of control.

I am caught in the middle, trying to help my mum help my granny and helping directly when I am with them.  I am burdened with constant worry about whether or not my granny is nearing the end of her life, whilst also having to temper my mums anger and frustration towards granny for her perceived deliberate lack of eating and drinking.  

Sadly, my dad, who would have been a big help, passed away 3 years ago, which lead to an increase in the strain on mum and granny's relationship, as well as removing the person who would have been her key support pillar throughout this.

Does anyone have any ideas of how to help either of them?  I have to assume there is still hope for granny given a lack of information to the contrary from the medical staff.  I'd like my mum to try and be gentler and kinder with granny, but I feel like I will be talking to a brick wall.

Thanks in advance, and sorry for a long and rambling post"
"Hello! So I’m a 24m, currently living at home with my parents. I moved back after college in 2019 and created a game plan to save as much money as possible and move out within two years to pursue and follow my dreams and also focus on my career at Boeing. However at the time I made that game plan my parents were extremely independent. Now due to the pandemic and lockdown last year my father [77 m] has slowed down drastically. He has been in the hospital twice for pulmonary embolisms (due to him not moving around or exercising) and is showing signs of early onset Parkinson’s. He refuses to exercise and at least try to take care of himself so now he’s expecting my mother [69 f] to take care of everything. He has been missing the toilet a lot when he urinates causing my mom to clean the bathrooms everyday. He now needs somebody to help him put his socks, his pants and underwear on due to the stiffness in his back and legs. He’s also been extremely cranky and rude at times. The caretaking is killing my mom, and I’m not home as much because of my job and everything. I am still planning on moving out but I don’t feel comfortable leaving that burden on my mother. Are there any services with Kaiser or any other California programs that can help alleviate this stress off my mom? I have 3 older siblings but they all have lives so the only one of us that’s fully available to help is myself but that would mean I’d have to sacrifice a lot to help out. What should I do?

TLDR;
Father is aging and has become extremely dependent on my mother to be his caretaker. I’m planning on moving out of their home but my mother is in need of some services to help my dad get better and to help out with all the caregiving tasks."
"HI!

&#x200B;

I mainly wanted to just use this place as a sounding board.  My mother and my husband have never gotten along. Mainly because she has done a lot of things that hurt him over the years and has always been quite selfish. She is a rich lady and lords that wealth over my family. She is the type of person that you take to dinner and getting her to pay the check for herself is like russian roulette. When she has visited me in the past, it always put me in debt. But I love her and it has always been like this. Sometimes she is really nice.

Fast forward to today. My husband and I have been together for over 25 years. She has recently had a double stroke and lives alone in the US. I live abroad with my husband. She is currently at home and refuses to get anything that is not Medicaid covered and will not go to any type of assisted living. Right now, she lives at home and has had the help of some cousins who I have always been close with, some Medicaid help from nurses, and my Uncle who is stealing her blind and lives off of her in a house she owns (that is a story onto itself).

Anyways, I have been doing the best I could abroad. Restrictions for visiting the US are being lifted but it still seems quite bad there in terms of Corona. Where I live, my mother-in-law has recently been diagnosed with cancer and my husband and I are getting through this 7work etc. on top of trying to help my mother get help getting her finances together/nursing (which she just keeps refusing or just ignores). I have promised my mother I would come and see her but she is treating herself badly, not getting help, not doing her excercises, not eating right, not doing what the doctors say. Her whole additude towards me is not fun either. I realize she has had two strokes but she is being really horrible right now.

So, honestly, I am really tired right now. I hate having to go on a cross-continental trip with my husband to just be treated like crap but I feel I am obligated as her daughter. I really feel like doing a week max with her if I have to and scheduling my trip so that hubby and I fly through Orlando on the way back for some R and R. If I have to go to the US, I might as well go to Universal while I am at it. Honestly, I don't know what to do. But I know that this trip is really affecting my marrige at the moment ."
"So after they pass, esp when both do. I feel so empty now. I have been utiizing worklists for years and I rewrote them tonight. Most of what was on there pertained to dad and it made my lists much smaller. I also realized the struggles are over. the quests for answers, the researches for solutions. Over. 

Also wanted to ask if you live in your parents home. I cant afford this place anyway. but if nothing else its feeling way too empty and lonely.  Its not like dad could have helped if I fell or something but I now feel so vulnerable. Im guessing that wears off. I have lived alone most of my life and love solitude but dont like this. Will be happier when the estate is settled and i find a nice small apt."
"My mother recently died and my father is dealing with some severe health issues.  

Their friends were her friends, and my father doesn’t want contact with people except family.  (He likes their friends but he thinks he looks bad and is boring.)

Their friends are constantly offering to run errands, visit and help in other ways, and some neighbors have been super helpful (recommending people to work on the house, etc.).

These people are all incredibly nice.  How do I thank them?  It seems weird for me to text them (I’m an unmarried middle-aged guy and they are elderly married women, mostly) or just drop by,  but they are wonderful and I want to make sure they know that I really appreciate everything."
"Mom passed 3 years ago. I didnt help dad much to sort thru her things. Now that dad has passed im sorting through the entire house and it such a big job. I was so damn wrong not to help dad. he was neither physically nor mentally fit to do the job. So I just wanted to say if you lose a parent help the other one sort things and support them emotionally. My dad never asked me how I was or comforted me, I told him if he needed to talk just tell me But he acted like nothing had happened. In any case I should have been of help. i was so hurt losing mom I didnt do my duty as a son. learn from me if you can.

Btw, my Mom saved everything, and I mean everything. The plastic bracelet on my wrist after I was born. Mom day cards I gave her, the crayon drawings I made when i was 5. Im not one to save things and keep memorabilia but some of the older pictures/photos of my parents are pretty cool."
"hello everyone, i live in the us but am visiting my father in the uk for the next two weeks (i’ve already been here a week). i’m here on my own. the last time i saw him before this was 14 years ago, which was the second time he disappeared for 10+ years. he abandoned and was abusive to all of his kids on various continents. i have forgiven him and i love him. most of my siblings want nothing to do with him, or are still kids. i knew he needed help but it’s much worse than i thought. he’s been living in squalor by himself and he can’t even remember to take his pills every day. he has trouble walking and bending, has limited use of one hand, has COPD lung issues (but chain smokes inside...which is really hard on me), has had a stroke, and is extremely anxious about how he will survive in his condition without help. he has nobody here and has been very lonely. he isn’t able to bathe himself or clip his nails/toenails or cook or do laundry. he was wearing dirty clothes with holes in his socks. he lives in a second floor flat with no lift and has to drag himself up the stairs. he was paying acquaintances to bring him food or had one guy staying with him in exchange for running errands but obviously this person wasn’t helping with anything else as the flat was filthy and my dad was in bad shape. i’ve helped him get himself in order and have cleaned the flat and done laundry but i am not able to stay here. there’s some complications around immigration that would make it impossible for me to migrate here or him to migrate to where i am, even if that was feasible in other ways. i’ve been going through his piles of papers to figure out his situation and it’s clear he’s no longer cognitively able to stay on top of paying his bills. i’ve put in a request for a needs assessment with his local council but he’s so scared of what will happen when i leave and while i don’t tell him this, so am i. he can’t be left alone like this. i’m heartbroken and overwhelmed and confused. i’m trying my best to find resources, have taken him to his GP and moved him to a GP that’s closer and have an appointment there where i will ask about his memory issues. he is very against going into a home, i am hoping for some kind of home care solution, but i’m so afraid i won’t be able to figure this out before i have to fly back. i guess i just needed to share with folks who might understand as i feel very alone in this. besides going to the doctor and store i’ve just been sitting here with him in the flat. i’m really grateful to be able to spend this time with him but it doesn’t feel like nearly enough. and it’s all so much trying to figure things out. 

thanks for reading. love & best wishes to you all."
"My 92 year-old, formerly very-active and pretty-sharp, step-father went into the hospital early-September with a UTI that had become severe, and shingles. He had already been having some challenges walking, due to weakness and probably some fear of falling. (Coincidentally, the week he went into the hospital was the week he was finally assigned a physical therapist for which he had been on the waiting list for weeks, ugh.)

We figured they'd pump him full of antibiotics, give him some PT, and send him home. But while the infections did clear up, his mental condition has worsened. There was certainly some sundowning, which I expected, but this is definitely beyond that.

He was transferred to short-term rehab about four weeks ago. The person I knew has checked out. The person who is in his place seems to have little awareness of what is happening, or desire to do the PT work to gain mobility to be able to go home. He just wants to lie in bed and watch sports (which he isn't really watching - it's just TV noise). Every now and then he tries to get up (""I have to go get the mail""), and while most of the time they catch him (they put him in a room directly in front of the nurses station because of this), occasionally he's found on the floor (they have the bed low, there are mats around the bed, he's fine). During the day, they often put him in a wheelchair directly in front of the desk to make sure he doesn't try to get up and hurt himself. He's also just living in a diaper, and will pee on the floor if there's not one on - he's completely incontinent. I also hired an aide this week, to help watch him, get him more engaged, and get some fresh air. I am not opposed to his lying in bed and watching TV - at 92, he's entitled to live how he wants. But I do want to make sure he's safe, and comfortable. I should mention that they gave him a low-dose of Seroquel (lower than what is usually prescribed), and while I was wary, it actually helped a great deal in getting him just a tiny bit more grounded.

Watching the 100-day insurance clock wind down, while seeing little progress, I asked the PT and social worker point-blank if there was any chance of his improving and going home. The answer was basically, no. Even if he did improve a bit, he's still a fall risk, and if he's unaware of his surroundings, he's going to wind up on the floor at home. He and mom live in a small apartment - being wheelchair-bound and having a 24-hour aide with them is not possible. I should also mention that there is no way in God's green earth that mom is going to move, so moving them together into assisted living is not an option.

So, here we are.

We're in the US (don't even get me started on our healthcare system). I need to move him into a facility, and I would like that to be near me because (a) I can keep an eye on things and (b) it is far less expensive than the state they live in (I am in a neighboring state - he's not going far, mom can still visit whenever she wants to). I believe, with his dementia and fall-risk, that he needs to go to memory care (someone correct me if I'm wrong).

I will be talking to the rehab business office about options on Monday, as well as an elder care attorney we have used in the past, but I want to know if  there are questions I should be asking? I don't know what I don't know. He makes too much money (pension plus SS) to qualify for Medicaid. There is no long-term insurance. So, I'll be dinging the assets and savings. Are there any other financial aid options that I do not know about? Are there any challenges with moving him from one state to another? While they do have some money and assets, I would like not to burn through all of it in a few years, so I can also keep my mother comfortable and provide care for her should the time come. I do have POA, so I'm all good there. I appreciate any advice."
"So, my mother is EXTREMELY needy.  This is exacerbated by having not gotten over the death of my father, not speaking English well, the Asian expectation that her children will do all the things for her, etc.  I do all her finances, any paperwork related to anything at all, deal with drs, medicines, etc.  She calls me constantly, if I don't answer or don't talk to her enough, I get the ""i wish i had died not your dad"".  There is ZERO chance she goes to therapy.  At her age and with her issues, getting her into senior living isn't going to happen either.  My brother takes care of her home (all yardwork, maintenance, etc) on top of his own home and children.  IT IS SO AMAZINGLY FRUSTRATING  and I can't see any way out of this.  I'm not looking for answers (unless you have one that isn't get mom more friends, get her into a senior activity, make her do it, etc) just VENTING OMG.  She's called me SEVEN times today because she's having trouble communicating with hr dr - she just called me to tell me she couldn't get it resolved, and they're closed, so I have to call for her tomorrow and deal with this also, while at work."
"I want to thank everyone from my heart for all the help and support. I always say that nothing ever goes as you think it will. yesterday when I saw him Dad was getting nutrition via his feeding tube and his meds again. he was awake, aware and talking, atho still hoarse.

His nurse called me at 5a.m. and asked me to come down. No idea wth happened. But he was on an oxygen mask and breathing very hard, hard time breathing, He was breathing fast. his heart rate was fast and his O2 was in the 70s? His arms were somewhat swollen and they were going to scan for bloodclots. he wheezed when he breathed in and he coughed some, sounded like some congestion. they vacuumed out his throat and did a deep vacuum in case the apple sauce from his swallow test or some water got caught . the only guess was that altho it appeared he was tolerating his feed well, that it didnt take/digest and was coming into his lungs.

His doctor called me and said he had a BM and it appeared there was blood. They had found he had bleeding ulcers when they put his tube in.

Went home at 6 and a couple hours later they called again, be here. he was still out of it/unresponsive and breathing hard , altho the wheez was gone.  His doctor asked to put him on hospice. I know they ease his passing, they dont expect him to last through the day. they noticed the swelling in his arms and are scanning for bloodclots.

Not sure exactly what hospice does. hes not awake and aware, not in any pain. I know they expect he wont make it but what if by some chance his breathing goes to normal and he wakes up.becomes aware. I dont want then to be forcing him into the grave if he doesnt have to go. I want to have hope but the doctor said hes just worn out and im thinking she knoews what she talking about.

Sidenote-Called my brother to let him know and he wanted to talk about dads estate, telling me how things will be done. I will follow my father's wishes and take care of his estate. My bro will be treated fairly and well.

In a way I feel bad im not sitting in dads hospital room. But I cant just sit there and wait, esp when hes not aware. I keep hoping naively he starts to breath normally again and opens his eyes. Sorry if this makes no sense but my world isnt making sense. Thank you again

&#x200B;

quick update...Hospice is in and giving him morphne and atavan. he hasnt changed. laying in bed, eyes closed, non responsive and breathing hard and fast. Hopefully the drugs will relax him. Thyve done chest xrays, scanned for bloodclots and run other tests and nothing shows. Nurse thinks his lungs are just won out. God bless him he doesnt deserve to go out this way. but then we never get to choose.

One thing dad feared was becoming a vegetable and he has a dnr in place. not sure how that rellates if he continues how he is but hoping if it is his time that he go peacefully.

EDIT LAST--the dance is over and the lights have gone down. My dad, the old aviator has climbed into the cockpit and flown off into the sky. The passed peacefully and no pain. God rest his soul. God help me. Thank you one and all."
"I never had a good relationship with my dad because he is a narcissist who is extremely stingy despite being worth millions. I moved in with him Jan 2020 after leaving a bad relationship.
He had a spinal cord injury about 10 years ago leaving him wheelchair bound with paralysis in all limbs. the one thing that has helped him remain semi-independent is a hospital-run warm water therapy pool that closed permanently during the lockdown last year. since losing access to this pool his functioning has greatly declined and a lot of simple tasks he used to do himself he can no longer do.

I am 33 and certainly didn't anticipate becoming my father's caregiver all of a sudden. on top of normal caregiving stress, his personality disorders make him especially difficult to deal with. he never wants to ask for help, never wants to pay for help, and basically resists any kind of change. he is also a diehard Republican and is always--literally always, even while he sleeps--listening to FOX news or conservative talk radio.

as a result he has one part time caregiver who doesn't speak English and is underpaid in cash. when I have gotten physical and occupational therapists for him he sends them away out of pride (""there's nothing they can do that I can't do myself""), and he engages in many risky behaviors such as the way he basically falls into his wheelchair or how he has to jump backwards to get into bed at night (and sometimes he misses).

he has fallen before and also been to the hospital for chronic constipation, which I have tried to get him to manage preventatively without success.

so my question is what do we do with parents who do not listen, who won't spend money on themselves to get the services they need, and who won't acknowledge their own limitations? he always insists he is fine. when something bad happens, I hear about it from his caregiver but he won't tell me directly.

he believes that he is sparing me by pretending not to need me. the truth is that he makes more work for me because I am constantly trying to anticipate his needs and prevent him from doing something stupid.

my uncle also told me today that as a live-in caregiver, if something were to happen to my dad while I am not there, I could be held legally liable as some form of elder negligence or manslaughter. this scares me a lot because my dad is constantly putting him at risk of falls despite my advice. I cannot control him and I am worried he will destroy my life.

he will not pay for more care. he already pinches pennies paying the current caregiver $200-300/week."
"So, I'm filling out the Claimant Statement for my Mom's LTC insurance. 

I did get the forms emailed to me as PDFs. However, they are not able to be filled out with a ""fill and sign"" feature. So print, fill out, scan, forward to my sibling so he can print out and get my mother to sign, then scan back in, then email back to the LTC co. 

There is nowhere actually on the form to fill in email addresses, for claimant, contact person/family, or service provider. 

There is room for the Claimant to have a fax number. I'm not sure when it was ever common for most folks to have a fax machine or number at home, but there it is. 

One line to list condition (there are multiple); 1/2 line to list when symptoms were first noticed; 1/2 line to fill in first date of medical treatment. 

I'm amazed it wasn't suggested to use a typewriter to fill it out. 

One of these days I'll post about my mother herself. That is, however, a very long post. Today, I'll settle for this first world problem vent."
"Because the facility where my mother lives has been under a government-required COVID closure, I was unable to visit her in person for forty days. Finally on October 10 I was permitted to visit because she became eligible for hospice due to weight loss.

What I saw was very troubling. She couldn't cut her food, which would explain why, if this was happening for 40 days, she has lost so much weight. I found meals in the refrigerator and freezer that both contained meats that would have been too hard for her to cut into bite size pieces. I promptly requested that from here on the meals be cut up, and lo and behold she's eating them!

The COVID restrictions had caused the closure of the dining room, so demented residents (and everyone else) were being served meals but not observed eating them. The might have been thrown away, stored away, who knows, but for that length of time no one checked.

Having dealt with that problem, I've arranged either to be there for every lunch and dinner or to have someone else there to make sure the meals were appropriate for her to eat and that she's eating them.

Her delusions continue but again, once I've been able to visit, her delusions are not distressing her like they were before. The current one is that she's supposed to host an engagement party with up to 18 people. Several days I've gone in before dinner to find she has set place mats and napkins out around the table in anticipation of this large group arriving. I figure it's harmless although there is a certain level of distress when you think you have to get ready for a party. Yesterday there were two butter dishes on the table and when I asked why, she said, ""we're having corn on the cob, and everyone will want extra butter."" So at least she thought of that! She starts Seroquel this afternoon.

Last night, she fell and hit her head. She was uninjured on the outside, meaning no cuts, no blood, but on the inside she suffered yet another setback and this time it's serious. A caregiver got her up and dressed for bed, and this morning helped her get dressed and rather than to her walker, moved her into a wheelchair because she continued to report dizziness and balance issues.

It appears that going forward my mom will need increased care. She is, in the words of the head nurse, ""in decline"" and it appears to be happening faster and faster. I don't know how much longer I will have her, but as I did with my dad, rather than try to guess how many days, weeks, or months we might have remaining, I will just enjoy them the best I can."
"Tuesday...

He is so much better today. feeding tube is ok and they say they will feed him and restart meds tonight. Voice still hoarse, awake and aware and talking too much. Yesterday I know he was zonked thx to drugs and surgery but saturday was weird as hell. 

he has had Occ therapy coming in and Dad being an old narcissist doesnt think it does any good. This is why he ended up on a walker, he has never wanted to do PT. But this time he has no choice and we will be having some honest son to dad talks. 

Also want to get him palliative care, the part where a pastor and a nurse come out to talk with him. I think he would really enjoy that. I know that once he gets out of the hospital and esp when he comes home he will want to go back to what he did before, not going to happen. the key now is to avoid the aspiration pneumonia again.

Anyway, so far so good. Hopefully no tripups and he next goes to SNF Rehab to work on his legs. he needs his strength and balance back. But happy with where hes at at this point and we will take it one step at a time. Thanks everyone for your responses, the weekend was scary as hell, and I know not to get too hopeful."
"He wasn't a kind man, not to his loved ones.

I am the remaining loved one. He drifts in and out of reality, and the only thing he seems to remember is me. He says he doesn't understand his phone, but he can call me all hours of the day. ""But, you called me"" ""I don't know how"".

He used to be so stoic. He'd only cry at a dog's funeral.

Now, he calls me from a hospital bed, asking where he is, why, and if I can come and get him. He begs me. He's cold. He's hurting.

I want to disappear. But, I can't. I've promised I won't try again. So, I only answer twice a day."
"I'm sure there's plenty of these. I've never posted here before, but I anticipate in the coming months I will be a bit of a regular. I never got to see how my parents took care of their parents, in 3 of the 4 of them, they died suddenly, in their sleep (they were good and old)... and so there is no internal model of how to handle this.

Reading through this and seeing that I'm not alone (and while I understand that this is obvious, I think many of us can relate to feeling very isolated, very alone and deeply concerned about the people we love so much), has lifted a weight off of my heart.... one that has been getting heavier and heavier these past few months. Some of the things I've noticed, the little stuff, just... all the reminders that they're getting older and won't be young forever.. followed by the dread of not knowing what to do, how it's okay to feel, where the limits are. We're all different, but reading some of this is helping me to build a mental image of what this might look like, things I can do... but most importantly, somewhere I can go to ask questions without judgement, and see what others are going through. 

My dad has been taking care of my mom who was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer 12 years ago, and had managed to... well I don't really understand, but it didn't kill her, it stopped spreading, and they thought they had gotten rid of it. However, it's come back, and has spread to other parts of her body, including her brain. It's been very difficult on my 70 year old dad, not only emotionally, but physically. This last week I could see he was feeling very trapped, like he couldn't even step out of the house, because she has such high fall risk (nephropathy in hands and feet makes balancing a trick), but seems to sometimes misjudge here capability, or strength. Or just silly things, like sliding out of her chair and being stuck (it's one of those power chair things, I genuinely don't understand how she slid out). She'll forget to take her cell phone with her, and he'd come back inside to find her like this. It's breaking his heart to see her dying... But it's also getting much harder for him to care for her. I've hired housekeepers to come once a week so that he doesn't have to worry about laundry and cleaning. On a side note, does anyone know of something that she could wear that would allow her to call him? She can't seem to remember her phone... and the internet connection in the house is akin to dialup. My dad needs to go outside for 1.) Sanity, but also because they're on 15 acres, and the property needs a lot of work. He needs to be able to leave the house. Any thoughts? I'll add that, because of the neuropathy in her hands and feet, anything that requires fine motor control won't work well. This is all compounded by the fact that they live in a rural area, so the things I would sign up for if they lived in, say, Seattle, don't work. My first thought was just to hire in-home care, 5 days a week, so the man could catch some peace. I've not had much luck looking in Northern Idaho.

Anyway, this is already a novella. I just wanted to say thank you to all of you for being here and sharing your experiences. I'm hugely relieved to know that there's somewhere I can go and people I can ask to help me navigate something that most of us will have to face at some point.

Stay healthy and be well!"
"My dad is temporarily unable to drive, and my sibling and I can’t aways take time off to get him to his many appointments. I read an older post from about 6mo ago that recommended a service through Lyft for elder transportation. My dad is savvy enough to order a ride, so I think that will work. 

What I don’t know is - would he have to order two separate rides (there and back)? Or is it possible that he can ask a driver to wait at the medical center and bring him home? 

Although I haven’t seen any hard numbers, it looks like dedicated elder transport services are something like 30-60$)/hr, so we’d be looking at a fair chunk of money if he ends up using this service more over time. 

Open to any suggestions or tips, thanks."
"If you are caring for your aging parents, and they’re just fine financially (i.e., they are certain not to run out of funds, and they are certain that they will be leaving an inheritance to you), do you let them pay for your expenses incurred while caring for them?

For example, if you fly to their city to take care of them; if you have to buy a laptop so that you can work from the nursing home; or even if you buy lunch while rushing to see them, do you let them pay?

I am told by family that costs such as the ones above are fine for aging parents to pay.  Other relatives are telling me to use my father’s credit card for those expenses and my father is fine with that.

It seems odd to me to in effect charge my aging father for my expenses, which are growing as I spend time in his city to be close to him in his nursing home, but I guess it makes sense because those amounts would otherwise be part of an inheritance and who knows what the tax would be then.

I am happy to pay all of those costs myself, but if it’s normal for a parent to pay, I guess I could accept that.

Have you faced this issue?

Thanks."
"Update: 
We moved her to a facility. She was excited about the move, and thought it was the best choice. It is a huge relief for us. Thanks for the support. 


I moved her into my home, with my husband, and we take care of her. My husband is supportive of the situation, and goes above and beyond to help her, make her comfortable and give her anything she may need. We take her places, take her to see family, provide her with means to stay in touch with friends. She tells us that she has everything she needs.  She’s been with us for a little over a year.

She loves to journal, and writes down all the comings and goings of our household. She sometimes embellishes truths, and seems to crave drama. She is also very attached to me, and gets upset when I spend time with my husband or grand kids. She needs my attention constantly, and naturally, this isn’t feasible. 

Recently she went with some friends to church, and told them she isn’t happy. She said she is being mistreated, and doesn’t feel comfortable around my husband. The friends called the police for a well check, and we are beside ourselves with grief over this. There is no mistreatment happening, and are concerned for what the future holds now. My husband refuses to be alone with her now, to avoid any concern that he’s doing anything wrong.  I feel we are at a crossroad, and must possibly put her in an assisted living facility to protect ourselves. We know her well-being will diminish, but are scared to deal with the authorities over false accusations.  

Any advice would be welcome."
"Operation tomorrow to insert a feeding tube. friday he was pretty normal and we chatted for an hour. Saturday he had false memories and was confused. today both times I went out he was aseep and never woke up fully. It was almost like he was drugged. Theyve been holding back his mirtazipine and pramipexole and of course the nurse has no idea why. he hasnt had food for 9 days and I know hes getting weak. being without his meds also hurts him and tbh that pisses me off. Cant talk to a doctor today so asked to talk to one tomorrow.

I was talking to him and his eyes were alll but shut and he fell back asleep, not like him. I feel something happened friday. In any case he has his surgery tomorrow and may or may not have to wait 24 for nutrition and meds. Damnit he needs to be fed and he needs his meds. No idea why theyre holding them back. Im just a passenger on this runaway train. This healthcare system is bullshit. I should at least have reasonable access to his doctors. Granted ive spoken to them twice but something seems wrong. Please pray for my dad they get his operation done and he gets his nutrition and meds and can get better. maybe im just being a worrisome son but when I see problems I want someone to listen.

What is striking me tonight. Ive tried so hard to keep him going and my expectation was that he would get thru this. beat the pneumonia, then get the feeding tube and get to rehab and walk again. but I also need to realise that hes 95 and what he's been through and that he might not make it. Aight imma go silent, thank you.

edit Monday- They are doing surgery at 3. His doctor called me to tell me they are doing a scan to check his brain. She made rounds yesterday morning and saw him as I did, confused and out of it and she wants to make sure there's nothing going on. Really appreciate her. The process leaves me in the dark and to get some info is really good.

edit 4pm- Doctor just called and everything went fine. they found some bleeding ulcers in his stomach and will address those with medication. That may explain the gastro problems Dad has had and which his GP never took seriously. 

Hopefully they can give him a feed and restart his meds in the morning latest. Big sigh of relief and Praise God for watching over him. Will go over later and see if he's awake.

Thank you"
"Hi, my mother recently just turned 62. We have health insurance sponsored by my employer until she is 65. I want to make the most of it. She doesn't have any readily apparent health issues so far. 

What annual checkups would you guys recommend that she be taking so that we can better budget for any necessary health supplements?"
"Lately, what has been frustrating me is my dad's inability to pee in the toilet bowl. His eyes are good enough to read texts on his phone, but without fail, he will pee all over the toilet rim and there will be droplets on the floor. 

Especially frustrating when I've gone in and bleached the whole toilet, only to have him come in and pee over the thing again. 

I feel bad, because what if he actually finds it extremely difficult to aim? But then again im frustrated because we have a 50 year age difference and I didn't expect myself to be cleaning his piss after every use at my age

Is this normal at his age (70s)?

Edit: thanks for your inputs and suggestions, I'll look into them"
"have been wondering, Since Dad cant swallow safely he hasnt had his meds in 8 days. A couple of them are rather important and in the past he has shown bad effects when the dosing was messed up, let alone now interrupted. Im just wondering why they dont have liquid delivery of most meds. He needs his pramipexole and mirtazipine.  Not saying take pills and crush em up for an IV, no. But they can make pills so why cant they make a liquid?"
"Trying to not write too much but todays lunch visit was weird.

Dad since he got on Pramipexole ER and I started managing his meds over a year and a half ago has had a pretty even ride. he hasnt been hallucinating. he forgets things and gets mixed up but hasnt had a big complex of false memories. As of yesterday his mind was as clear as ive seen it in a long time.

Today:

False memories galore. he was convinced my car was broken and we needed to call the guy. I tried to convince him my car is fine. Took a minute to catch on that he thought he was at home. he had walked down the hallway today and saw all these people he didnt know. (dad isnt allowed out of his bed in the hospital)

Again he hasnt had his Pramipexole in 8 days, didnt sleep much last night, hasnt been getting his Mirtazipine which helps sleep as well as brain etc. So i'm guessing he's off his meds completely and it hurts. they also started a new IV with nutrients because he is having a feeding tube inserted surgically monday. So he can finally get decent nutrition and his meds again. I am very curious to see if this present confusion continues and if so if finally getting his meds brings him back to normal.

He does remember me and my brother. He was asking if his wheelchair would be good enough to get him around. I stuck to reality and told him he wasnt allowed out of bed and that he was going to rehab his legs and walk again.

I think when they get like this they just ignore anything that is different than their fantasy. before today he was fine, today an abrupt change. I know his brain must really be struggling trying to make sense of it all.

So best case I think is get the operation done and get nutrients and meds in him and see where he stands. he really needs his strength back before he can do any meaningful rehab.

Thats the venting part, if anyone has any advice or thoughts on whats going on feel free. he hasnt been like this in a year and a half and wasnt like this at all last night when I left.

Questions:

* has anyone seen this mental confusion after not getting their meds and does the resumption of meds get em back to 'normal'.
* Might the addition of a nutrient IV cause a problem, sorry I dont know exactly what kind. he was getting glucose and all the nurse told me was extra nutrients to get him ready for the operation Monday.
* When they surgically insert the feeding tube, how long generally before they start using it? I know they have to make sure everything is fine.

Oh, he is a lifelong aviator. I think he keeps tugging on his condom catheter and he told me his fuel line came loose. Nurse fixed him up. Im wondering if he makes the connection to asking his nurse. he kept commenting on all the tubes and wires he's hooked up to and I explained those. But I got the impression he doesnt really understand he's in the hospital.

One last question. Should he not be able to get his legs back. I cant lift him. I know you can get people to come in. And you can get a Hoyer lift and a portapotty and a wheelchair. He would also need a hospital bed im thinking. I know some people do take care of a chair and bedbound person at home. How feasible to do this alone. Understand that I want him to be able to spend whatever time he have left at home. I also have to be honest and say that if he goes into a home I will no longer have one. My job these past 4 years was taking care of him. So I would be out of luck in a bad way.

Going to try and make that the last post until we get some steps.

Thank you

&#x200B;

edit:evening visit and a bit more subdued but still gone. he fixated on picking at things. his tubes and wires and his sheets. he was picking at the sheet with a blanket on top. It was twirled around and he couldnt figure out the seam bwteen the two, what it was. So i took it apart and showed him. he had been wanting water or ice chips at every chance, not today. He just seems lost. When I went to leave he asked if I wasnt staying with 'them', I guess the medicos. maybe he still thinks he's at home, maybe he doesnt remember his home. I explained all thats been going on and what we're doing to get him back together. I dont know if he understands. Hoping tomorrow is better.

It makes me angry that they havent been giving him his mirtazipine and Pramipexole thru the IV, these effect his cognition and thats what was blown away yesterday. maybe theres a good reason why they didnt or they just overlooked it. Will see if I can get some answers today, thank you everyone.

Sunday noon...dad was fast asleep. He always does have trouble waking up but I got in a couple words before he went back to sleep. usually he stays up so no idea. No idea if hes still far out in left field or not. Doctors not doing rounds today and his nurse had just gone to lunch so will check on him after dinner. Really want to talk to his doctor. But that seldom happens. "
"I’ve been visiting my elderly widower father every day in the nursing home, for several weeks.  He’s there temporarily and I plan to visit him every day until he’s out.  I have been going for an hour minimum, up to 7 hours on weekends.  On weekends, I take work to do; we don’t talk for 7 hours.

My father and I have never had a close relationship so I am surprised when he thanks me for visiting, says that I am welcome and seems to appreciate the visits.

On the one hand, I appreciate being able to have a relationship with him and be appreciated as a child.

Anyone in this kind of situation get tired of caregiving and tired of visiting aging parents?"
"I saw a tv news report last night that doctors were advising people to take both the Covid booster AND their annual flu shot. I’m here to say for your parents, take that with a HUGE grain of salt. 

My father and mother live in the most-independent tier of a retirement/care facility. My dad is pretty sharp, but has diabetes and hypertension. My mother has memory issues and needs someone to cook and keep house for her; he rarely leaves her alone. They have Medicare with Kaiser insurance. They received the two Pfizer Covid vaccines back in February/March, as soon as it was offered. 

They both had a brief and thankfully mild breakthrough case of Covid about a week or two ago. The facility they live in offered them the booster shot just a few days after they recovered. And the day after the booster, my parents happened to be at a Kaiser facility that offered them a flu vaccine, and they took it without mentioning the Covid booster. 

Well. 

Mom was fine, but all of this crashed Dad’s system. He suffered diarrhea for about three days before my brother or I knew about it, and when I talked to him on the phone he was clearly disoriented and weak. He went into urgent care for about 24hrs for dehydration. I still don’t quite understand the timeline of all of the test results, but his his kidneys failed  to process, his blood sugar dropped, his blood pressure dropped, and he had a low fever and indications (white blood cells) of an infection. He had indications of heart or lung congestion, and many of his prescribed medicines were working against what the drs/NPs were trying to do to to get him back to normal. He may have permanent kidney damage (and his kidneys already weren’t great) and possibly heart problems now.

Once he stabilized and his stats came up above certain thresholds, they discharged him so that he could rest at home, and over the past few days his vitals have been concerning but stable (VERY high glucose, VERY low bp and temp); we’ve been in communication with advice nurses and docs. He is slowly improving and he has a bunch of follow-up appointments next week, so I’m no longer too worried. 

When I heard that news report I really wish the reporter had given a caveat that people with co-morbidities should take caution with taking too many vaccines at once. They really made it sound like people should take them together and there was no cause for concern. 

The fault here lies in no communication between the facility, my parents, or their doctor, and I realize that obviously he should have told Kaiser he got the booster (the ED nurse said they would never have given it had they known). Remind your parents to never assume that their docs/nurses know everything, or that what they hear on tv might not apply to them…"
"I'm looking to find the right place. Somewhere affordable, somewhere with certain amenities, somewhere with a community. Unfortunately I haven't found a Zillow-esque website where I can put the criteria and parameters and explore options. My mother has issues with ADHD, anxiety, and memory. She's only 71, in my opinion too young to be in a care facility, but incapable of being in a fully independent living situation.

How did you find a place? Where did you look?"
" Hi all, my dad is currently 64 and we recently had a stressful conversation about the state of his living when he's older. I'm an only child, and I would ideally love for my parents to live in the same household as I do. In our conversation, I'll be in my late 40s with a family when he turns 90, and I don't think it's safe or feasible for him to stay at home unattended when I go to work, etc. Assisted living by a professional at home is an option that I consider when he is a little older, and I would 100% support my dad financially for that.

That being said, it appears to me that he does not have a realistic view of home-care when he gets older. Maybe it's a cultural thing since he was not born in America, but he expects a child to be the main caregiver. In his case with the grandparents before they passed away in another country, however, he never bathed them nor cooked for them either, but utilized a CNA/aide to help. My grandparents lived with my aunt (my dad's side) but my aunt would also cook/care for them as her main job (while my dad and other uncles/aunts supported her).

Obviously if I had siblings, the task of being main caregivers may be more ideal and closer to what my grandparents had, with us rotating, but in my situation I just don't know how to explain to him."
"Ive spent plenty of time in hospitals. i used to work delivering medical supplies as well. Ive seen things that broke my heart.

dad has been in the hospital for 3 weeks now and hasnt had solid food for 8 days. He's a trooper but its wearing him thin. I go visit him twice a day for an hour or hour and a half. Not alot to talk about really so we watch golf and just talk about small stuff. i know he hates it when I go. But I always ask if he needs anything and remind him ill be back the next day.

he doesnt want anything. I brought him a couple of his books to read, offered the paper, comics, crosswords. he just doesnt want anything. Tonight when I went in I had a really hard time waking him up and it scared me. He is waiting to have a feeding tube inserted into his stomach so he can not starve but I wonder what all this is doing to him. His voice is better and I give him sponges of water and ice.

Duh, he cant have water straight because of swallowing issues. So they give him ice that he chews up and swallows. If ice is safe then lets get him something with nourishment. How about brothcicles?

Anyway, I know he's probably scared and depressed.

What about palliative care? The part where someone just comes in once or twice a week and chats with him. Like a minister comes in and maybe a nurse comes in and chats. I think he would like that.

Any ideas on how I can bighten things up?

he wanted a haircut so I brought in my beardtrimmer and gave him a close haircut and shave. I dont see me in a new career anytime soon.

&#x200B;

while talking to dad the other hospital he was in for his previous pneumonia texted me a survey link. I was very honest and ripped em a new one. The nurses except for one were lazy as shit, never could get any info on dad or his condition. they didnt do a damn thing for his throat or why he kept getting aspirated pneumonia. they never addressed his swallow issues. he would buzz the nurse and no one would ever show up. One time I went to check and they were all playing on their cell phones. be damned if he ever goes to that hospital again. yes I know surveys dont matter, they dont care and it wont change anything."
"Hi,

I am so stressed and lost. I am an only child and my father passed away years ago. My mother was a very well planned person, financially, long term health care, and a budgeter.

She retired to the southwest , not knowing anyone and has been there for over 25 years enjoying the sun and low cost of living. We moved to be close to her, but realized the area is focused on retired people and our child needed medical care (and we had to drive over 400 miles each way for doctors visits and worried about emergencies). My husband took a job on the East coast in August and offered on a home and we packed to move. 

Of course nothing goes as planned. A few weeks before we were set to move,  my mom said she was going blind? I the said to rush her to the ER, that she needed surgery. She had this same surgery 7 years ago and was in and out in 2 days and back to herself. This time no beds in the hospital so they took her 300 miles away and operated. She woke up her old self, they said the surgery was fine and she would be home the next day and moving was fine for us. Then radio slience for 4 days. I panicked. She had some endocrine issues (which were solved with meds) and then developed menigitis. While I 100% appreaciate the hospital keeping my mom safe from covid, she was in a room with no windows, and the door closed for 3 weeks and she started to have delirum (she would not know where she was or time of day). They assured me this would get better. 

So now she has been transferred to somewhere I can visit. She has taken a few steps back physically but I feel with PT she will be fine. 3 weeks in bed was not good but I feel fixable. It is her memeory, she obviously is having some sort of trauma from being in that room 3 weeks. She can remember most long term information perfect (like when I lost my library book or was late coming home 30 years ago) but she has problems remembering where she and some complex thoughts are hard for her. She had no issues after the surgery, these came on after the infection and be isolated. 

The care center says it is 50/50 if she will come back mentally all the way (love how the surgeon said 100% and discharged her). I'm confused. I sold my home , my husband is cross country and I am sleeping on a couch trying to figure out what to do with my mom. Her wishes (in an ideal world) were to stay in her southwest home and have in home care (which she assumed at some point would be self help, bathing, shopping, cleaning) and she has long term health care for this. She said if she ever had to be in a facility long term, she wanted to be in a religious one, A catholic one,  (which the area she lives in does not have). Right now she hopes to go back home but says she wants to live with us (which she never wanted to do before and we never thought it would be a good idea, hence the long term health care) . My husband is closing on a home that will not accomidate her living with us (lots of stairs, smaller home. My husband and I have always been homeowners, me sleeping on a couch in someone's home near my mom and him trying to work and pushing off a closing and staying in a hotel is stressful and getting expensive.  

I have tried very hard to follow my mom's wishes. I have been in charge of her medical choices the last month. I;m tired and kind of scary feeling of being homeless . I just want to get into a home and get my child medical care and get a good nights sleep but I also want to make sure my mom is okay. I don;t want to move and then 2 weeks later she needs or wants to come be with us and it is 2700 miles away and not an easy trip for her (she would need an RV or Van or something other than a plane or car trip). 

&#x200B;

Any advice would be appreciated or if there is a better forum for this. I just am so tired and I want to wake up and have everything somewhat normal again."
"I need ideas.  So far these 4 are super helpful:
1. Having siblings to share the duties
2. Blink cameras for monitoring
3. Alexa Show for dropping in
4. Parents’ being able to afford paid caregivers"
"My mid-70s dad just returned home after 6 weeks of illness and rehab. My parents live in a 3 storey house, with bedrooms on the 2nd floor as well as a claw foot tub (high lift of the foot to step into an uneven surface) and separate, small, stand up shower.

Petrifying as all that is, my true fear is the stairs.

From the first to second floor, there are 12 stairs, a small landing, then 3 stairs doubling back to the 2nd floor bedrooms. The first 7 stairs have a railing for my dad to help pull himself and balance as he walks up. The next 5 stairs, the landing and 3 stairs after have NO railing or anything to grab onto at all. Just smooth wall.

When he went up the stairs tonight (the first time in 6 weeks) he did fine with the railing, definitely struggled on the remaining 5 steps, and nearly fell on the last 3 stairs.

There's a lot of things I need to do, but I need to have a railing installed *yesterday*, so if you have experience, PLEASE tell me what you did and how helpful it was (or not).

Thank you. God, I'm so tired.

24 hours later, UPDATE ADDENDUM:

I went to their house this morning, showed my dad several railing options I found and told him I was completing this project TODAY.

He nonchalantly asked for untreated wood so he could stain it to match the existing woodwork once he felt up to it.

""Uh, I... yeah, of course I can find that, Dad. You understand I'm coming back with tools and installing it within 12 hours? Completely done before you go to bed?""

""Yes. It sounds like a good time for it, don't you think?""

I was floored. My parents have taken wonderful care of their house for decades, and for my dad to calmly accept me drilling into the original woodwork after 10 minutes of talking....

Just, WOW. Anyways, that railing is *SOLID*. Both my parents need the extra support on the stairs and not much else, so all in all, this was a roaring success."

"money wise, career wise, life wise?  At work and think about being with my parents often as they go through their issues.  Right now i don't think its the right thing to do...but I just feel like i'm waiting for the next health issue to come along and eventually I'll really have some thinking to do."
"Aspiration pneumonia number 2 beat and they're working on swallowing issues. Been a week no food. Today I talked to his doctor, a speech therapist and then head dietician. Dad hasnt had any improvement in his throat. Im asking questions because what I do is research and brainstorm. I dont do a narrow thinking process until it absolutely gets narrowed. Since theyre not that way im sure they think me an idiot lol. I dont care, but what we found out.

Its not that everytime he swallows its going into his respiratory tract. Its catching in the back of his throat and bits dribble in and/or that trapped bit makes infection that goes into his lungs. The nose tube Dad didnt want. he is cognizant enough to make an informed decision. I help as needed but its his body as long as he is cognizant and hes doing fine.

So he didnt like the tube through the nose but wants the feeding tube in his stomach. I agree. It doesnt look like his swallowing will get better but they will keep trying. His doctor will talk to the surgeon who will talk to me and dad and get it scheduled. I think once they are convinced that went well they wil kick him out to rehab. So i will need to talk to rehab and make sure they know how to feed him and can get the product. As I understand it theres a special foodpack? the ST was saying you just mix food in a blender and use that but wouldnt think thats true. 

So at least dad will get nourishment. he can still aspirate from spit and water so theres always that chance.  He is very unhappy he will be giving up eating.

Have never met his PT nor been told progress so no one knows. he has to be able to walk again if he's ever coming home. I cant lift him and he cant afford live in help. But first things first and step by step. I know this is really hard on him and he is facing it bravely. He gets mad at me everytime I leave the hospital. Unfortunately I cant sit in there for very long.  But I see him twice a day.

Thank you everyone for the help and prayers and wishes. If this feeding tube works well that will make him much safer I think. Then he has to survive rehab and walk again."
"My Grandmother has been diagnosed with dementia. She has been having a rough time emotionally either sad or angry. My uncle has been a nightmare and conducted financial abuse on my grandfather, now targeting my Grandmother. My grandmother won't  believe what my uncle did or will do to her and is turning angry against our warnings, thinking we are trying to control her life. How can we stop my uncle from doing this to her? We don't know how to prevent her from seeing him. He is is very intimidating and we don't even feel comfortable being around him to be able to continue helping grandma. My mom has guardianship of grandma but feels helpless right now. 

This is a lengthy story about what went down with my grandfather... logic and reason never worked.... legal system's safeguards were ignored or failed.

I was appointed my grandfather's enduring power of attorney but only had financial not medical/personal decision making. About 1 year after my grandfather was declared not mentally capable of making his own decisions my uncle started the drama. I had my grandpa in a nursing home and was cleaning out his house. My uncle squatted in my grandfather's house, police wouldn't remove him because my grandfather said it was ok. My uncle took my grandfather to the bank and started having him take cash out. My uncle took my grandfather to every lawyer in town to get the power of attorney changed to him, they succeeded in taking me out of my position despite the mental capacity issue. They also changed the will at the same time, guess who the sole benefactor is?  Ya totally elder abuse. I was told I had to go to court to reverse it, I did not have the resources at that time to fight it. Don't worry I am fully planning to go after him for fraud now I'm a few years detached, wiser, and in a better situation myself. There was a lot more detail to this story but that was the short version. 

Regardless facing the same thing with grandma now... not sure how I can make it go differently this time."
"Hi, New here, husband and I need your thoughts on his increasingly difficult 76-in December diabetic mother. It’s a handful, I’ll try to be as succinct as possible

* 76-in-December mother (of husband). Medical includes diabetes, heart, thyroid. She is wildly noncompliant w/ diabetes nutrition (blood sugar daily in the 200s to 300s - she’s constantly eating fruit, bananas, enormous amounts of bread)

* multigenerational household in São Paulo Brazil -husband essentially has lived with her his entire life - very weird for me/American, but very customary Brazil)

* when I moved from US to Brazil two years ago, she was already difficult/weird (e.g. she never eats a meal except in her room with her TV, decades long habit apparently), but it’s gotten much worse.  She’s argumentative, demanding, has no sense of boundaries (a closed door means nothing to her), isolated (leaves house only for doctors appts essentially). There is literally not a moment of pleasure to be had with this woman. 

* confusion for her has increasingly entered the picture - husband was taking new puppy for walk around 730 pm (dark outside), and she asked him why we were both up so early, that the sun hadn’t come up yet). 

* on a bunch of meds - no idea if she’s compliant, but highly doubtful

* she has no friends. She has a slew of brothers and sisters, like nine, but only one sister will ever actually call her (no one would visit her, certain extended family will come over pre COVID, but to see us and each other, not her exactly. She has no interests or hobbies whatsoever

* my husband is a saint, singularly kind/patient/caretaker extraordinaire, but his boundless patience is wearing very thin, as literally every single interaction with her is a fight of varying proportions. (She has never been a supportive mother, I’ve never heard her say thank you for anything)

* she’s part of an aging persons health program, but COVID dramatically curtailed those visits and help. Now they won’t take her to doctors appts as before because she had left one of her diabetes needles or tester needles in a bag of something for a med visit and a health care got pricked

* she has recently scared us by not being able to properly use new gas stove (turns gas on, waits, and then pushes ignite button, big whoosh of flames kind of thing)

* she is not incapacitated, but my husband and I do virtually everything for her - all bills (ie we pay for everything), shopping, cooking, laundry, dishes, cleaning, medication runs, all drs visits with her. She literally does nothing but watch TV, eat everything wrong for her (we cook every day but she’s more interested in the daily loaf of bread, and complain/criticize/fight. I readily admit we haveallowed this to happen - if you treat someone like they can’t do anything for themselves, they don’t And won’t. She is perfectly capable of walking to the corner store herself for yet more bread but we were very protective of her throughout the dire COVID numbers here, and now it’s a pattern

*she’s aggressive with new puppy (hitting him - with broom etc. she recently was hitting him in the face with feather duster, he was yelping, I stopped that…)

* there have been psych consults, but brief/perfunctory. Plus she blithely lies about everything to all doctors. Geriatric psychologist recently tried to get her to do a zoom like weekly conference call with the psychologist and some other elderly women, but as we expected, she lasted ten minutes, declared it boring and stupid, and went back to her TV

SÓ…..what can we be doing to make everyone’s life less miserable? I don’t know the lingo - consult for someone to look at all her medicines? A serious psych evaluation, for dementia/depression/Alzheimer’s?"
"Bit frustrated tonight. dads current hospital is better than the last. he is in for aspirated pneumonia, twice in two weeks. he's had some issues for awhile and he always passed it off as sinus drainage. He was in a diff hospital in april and they didnt do anything to address the cause. he was in that same one week and a half ago and they didnt do anything to address the cause, nor did they tell me what they were doing or what was going on. This current one at least ive talked to a doctor twice and two speech therapists and his nurses generally have been great. they did swallow tests and they said water and ice slivers. today its ice. he chews the ice. Ok, if he can chew and swallow ice then why dont they make something similar with nutritien in it? he hasnt eaten for a week, just ice/water and glucose. One nurse said they will need to feed him, one option being a feeding tube in the nose.

Why has no one said anything to me officially? This is why I advocate for him, when do they intend to feed him? I trust them or he wouldnt be there. But I dont ultimately trust them.

he feels weak, chews his ice instead of it melting in his mouth, and yes I explained that to him. He is getting breathing treatments which have helped but the gist of helping his throat is three hard swallows. he wont do these on his own and he doesnt eat ice slivers on his own. he has dementia and has trouble initiating. i tell em this but....

They were using a condom catheter on him. this way he doesnt just pee on a pad and sit in it for awhile. But they removed it, nurse thinks he kept pulling it off. One thing about dad is he forgets what things are, has to play with everything, wants to remove everything. he did keep playing with the catheter, wanted to remove an IV....just so frustrating, i feel like im the only sane person and the only one who cares.

Maybe thats the root or a big part is seeing the days pass and little done it seems. Seeing ways to improve, and knowing dad has been a week without food, he needs nourishment, and not knowing that they have any idea."
"My mom has been having increasing memory issues over the last year. We’ve convinced her to get the ball moving on the medical side in terms of diagnosis etc but haven’t yet been able to get her to talk to a lawyer about updating her will, setting up POAs, and preserving assets re Medicaid rules. We’re worried now that she may no longer be competent to sign any legal docs even if we can get her to meet with a lawyer (the one that we talked to several months ago said they would require a statement of competency from her doc).

Has anyone here gone through the process of doing all the elder care legal docs once a parent is no longer competent. How hard is it? What’s involved?"
"I'm concerned about his susceptibility to conspiracy theories if he's fed them regularly via the housekeeper. I'm also concerned she'd not be truthful about being vaccinated. 

She comes with a third-hand recommendation. I asked his nurse for a referral, she had a client with this housekeeper, the client passed, so the housekeeper has a spot open. She'd be coming in for six hours or so once a month.

Other than the nurse, who comes twice a month, I've never hired a caregiver for my dad, so I'm being cautious."
"Exactly seven months ago this morning, I went to visit my parents in their home of 55 years. We happily noted that the governor had removed some restrictions and that restaurants in our town were reopening after many months of closure related to COVID.

We visited enthusiastically as we talked about returning to a favorite spot where my parents were known by name. When we left that day, we had no idea at all that life would change dramatically and that my mother would never spend another night of her life in that house.

We got to the restaurant that March 6 and, excited to eat a meal out for the first time in nearly a year, my mom left the car and started walking to the restaurant.  I called after her, ""wait, Mom, let's get your walker."" She said, ""I don't need it."" ""Mom, please!!""  ""No, I'm almost there.""

We all got inside the restaurant but the door got stuck open and I turned to close it. In that instant, everything changed; when I turned back around, there was my mother on the floor. Instead of a nice lunch, we called 9-1-1.

For the next 18 days I lived with my father. I found out he didn't know how to make coffee, and that he got upset by things happening in the street outside his home, but that in reality nothing was happening, he was hallucinating.  I had already been searching for an assisted living facility for him and Mom, but had not found one.  Now I knew I *had* to find one. What would he do if Mom were released? How could he help her? I redoubled my efforts and found for my parents the ""perfect"" spot, 6 minutes from my house instead of 25, right across the street from an ambulance, lots of loving, kind people. Dad had the presence of mind to realize he couldn't care for mom, who had cracked the femoral neck, what we call a broken hip. She was calling me, hysterical, claiming she was being held hostage in a gas station, a Mexican restaurant, a gymnasium, or an art school. Never again would they be ok in their house. This move had to happen.

On March 25 the move was made. My wife spent many hours decorating the new place with their prize possessions and did her best to make it warm and welcoming.

But things didn't go the way we hoped.  Only three weeks after moving in, my dad fell in the shower and hit his head. Ultimately this led to a deeper dementia, a harmful variety in which he became very suspicious and even finally accused my mother, then 90, of wanting to have an affair with her young male med tech. It got so bad that ultimately he threatened her physically and had to be removed.

After a series of events, he passed away early in July. All this is documented in my previous posts that were written as things happened.

Almost immediately my mother began ""seeing"" him, still hostile, still scary to her, still distressing.

She called me in tears, ""he's here and he's scaring me."" When it was permissible for me to go in, I did so, but for the entire month of September there was a COVID-related shutdown and I was  not permitted to go to her. We went from daily visits to nothing overnight. I'd call the front desk and ask them to send her someone to provide her some comfort and emotional support, but even then I wasn't permitted to go to her. Recently there has been a decision to start her on medication that is supposed to help with the hallucinations, but that hasn't begun yet.

During the past month, my mother has lost enough weight that today she became eligible for hospice. After discussing it with my family, we agreed. It doesn't mean she will die soon, but it does mean that she'll get a lot more support with weekly nursing visits and also that I will have unlimited access to see her whenever I want. If a medical situation exists where hospice is somehow in the way of desired treatment, we can ""suspend"" it for a time and then resume it later on. All of this is paid for by Medicare. I'm writing this so that people who don't understand hospice or who didn't know who paid for it might know that it's very possibly an option for them and would provide them with added assistance and visiting privileges in elder care facilities.

Seven months ago, we left for lunch, and look what happened. Dad's gone and Mom's going on hospice. I had no idea, and even today when I reflect on what a year 2021 has been I can't quite grasp that all of this happened within such a short period.

The good news, of course, is that once it's official, I'll be in to see Mom daily, to provide her with some stability and comfort, to be there when food is served to make sure she's eating, and of course I hope that if I am or other family members are there, maybe my poor deceased dad won't ""show up"" and cause her such distress.

What a difference seven months can make."
"My immobile widower father can’t do anything for himself.  He is in a nursing home; recovering from a fall.  

He asks me to shave his face and cut his fingernails and he wears a diaper instead of using the restroom. I am happy to give him a shave and cut his fingernails; he’s near the end of his life and it’s a minor thing to do.

My brother blew up and tells me that we can’t enable him since he needs to do these things himself.  Or at least he needs to learn how to.  My father and brother fought about this for 15 minutes today.

My brother is right in that being self-reliant is better. But my father will always have a caregiver in the nursing home or when he returns home.  And my father has never lifted a finger before (I doubt he could even boil water.). It’s too late to change him.  And why fight with him about a minor thing?

He has NEVER been self-reliant.  He grew up with servants and then had our mother who did everything for him.

Question: how hard do you push an elderly parent to be self-reliant?  How hard would you push my father to shave himself, for example?"
"Just wondering and brainstorming. my dad has had 3 bouts of aspiration pneumonia this year. ive been told it can be food or drink or even saliva. he is in the hospital and theyve done two swallow tests . This last one was the Barium test and he is only taking water. He is getting breathing treatments ...a short term broncho-dialator, a longterm one and a steroid. Doc thinks perhaps the nerve has been irritated. his voice was so hoarse at first and is better today but not normal. 

My question is what else might they do to help his swallowing. he had some issues before of course. I dont know if how he is today is near his old self or far below it. Can they help train his muscles? Like a PT? Is there an implant to help his muscles? He told me today that he really cant feel the water on his throat ro swallow it, hes just guessing. He gets alot of drainage so maybe going a few days w/out water really gummed it up. Or nerve damage took away the feeling or the Parkinsons did.

Just trying to understand and brainstorm what can help him. Its almost to the point of feeding him thru a tube and its breaking his heart."
"My mom is 86 and had been doing pretty well until contracting Covid last deck.  I’ve been taking care of her full time since then.  My specific issue is that when she watches travel shows, which she enjoys, she talks about all these places that she’s never been:  visiting Nelson Mandela’s house in South Africa, seeing the turtles on the Galápagos Islands, seeing volcanoes on Hawaii…I live in Germany and she and my Dad traveled all over Europe with us, so she is well traveled in that respect.  But she never went anywhere I didn’t take her.  I don’t know how to react.  Sometimes I just ignore but sometimes I tell her she never went to wherever and then she gets huffy with me.  I really don’t know if this is really alarming or just harmless."
"I'm a female in her 20s and my parents are in their 50s, fully functional...but thinking ahead, I know that when they age, I'll be the one taking care of them. And I'm honestly very happy to do so and to give back to them.

But one thing does worry me, and I was wondering if anyone here has faced this too. Did your parents get more impatient/rude as they aged?

It's one thing I've noticed with both my parents. They tend to get annoyed at little, tiny things, and ruminate over it for days and days. It's at the point where I'm on literal egg shells around them. For example, I was one day very stressed about work (I'm a physician and came off a very busy, hectic ICU shift) and when my parents were talking to me, I listened, I replied etc, but I wasn't some cheery person who was voluntarily making conversation. It's the human condition, people get stressed-and I can only imagine that moments like this will increase when I'm say, in my 30s or 40s juggling multiple responsibilities. I dont take out my stress on them...but, they literally exploded because I wasn't being my usual, cheery self-they got mad at me. This is just one example. Another example, if I'm holding a piece of paper and drop it on the ground they yell at me and call me a clutz. Or, my mom will want the dishes at home organized a very certain way-if they come to my home and see me doing it differently, they yell and scream.

Their excuse, with everything, is that they are getting older, and being older means being more impatient, and that I have to deal with it, that it's their right. This terrifies me because, they're only in their 50s and this means it'll get worse as they get older. But, the thing is my grandparents were NEVER like this. They were all the sweetest people not just with me but with everyone.

Tomorrow, if they're even worse than this, I dont know how to tolerate it, much less if they act that way with my SO or kids..

Anyone have any ways they dealt with this?"
"For everyone that posts on here - thank you! It definitely makes me feel less alone. Right now, I’m in need of advice - mostly on how to keep my own sanity.

My father is going to be 77 soon. He has type 2 diabetes, had triple bypass surgery decades ago and has had other health issues. 

On top of that, he is an alcoholic and takes terrible care of his health. I mean, over the years, he would decide he knows better than doctors and would just stop taking medicine. He eats so much sugar and junk on top of drinking. His neuropathy from diabetes got so severe, he no longer has feeling in his feet and is no longer allowed to drive. He kept falling over all of the time. The kitchen would look like a crime scene every-time he fell from the blood. He fractured his clavicle and needed stitches in his head and had to get multiple MRIs. 

Even though my mom and I would ask him to use a cane and Walker, he would be stubborn about it. And every time he is stubborn and careless like this, it falls onto me, my mom, other family and friends. Basically, everyone is jumping through hoops for him right now. And has been, just to care for him. 

I live at home. I can’t afford to move out right now. And my parents act like they’re helpless at times. I have my own mental health issues. And it kills me to watch my dad drink himself to death. 

He just got out of the hospital today, after having one of his toes amputated, last week. He got really lucky because originally it was supposed to be two toes and instead they only amputated one. And it’s not a toe that will effect his balance. 

My mom was all confused about aftercare instructions and it wasn’t until the nurse came tonight that they realized he needed antibiotics for tonight, so I ran out and got them ASAP despite an insurance issue which had to be resurrected. I made sure it all got sorted out because I don’t want him back on the hospital while Covid is going on. I think part of the problem may be my mom's hearing as well. I feel like the doctors may have mentioned things at the time of discharge that she missed but she doesn’t tell that to people often enough about her hearing loss and is bad about wearing her hearing aids. and I wasn't able to be there myself for it today. 

I don’t even know if I’m articulating this well. But, my family is dysfunctional af. My brother lives far away and told me he has no sympathy for my dad. He believes 80 percent of my dads amputation is a result of his drinking and not caring for himself. I feel bad my dad lost his toe, but also know how careless he is about his health.  It also does not help that my dad can flip out over small things or not getting his way. He is difficult to begin with. 

I go to Al-Anon behind my parents back. Other family members know I go, but my parents live in denial and wouldn’t want people in the community to know such things. I only recently told my dad I will not be driving him to get alcohol anymore. Today. My moms friends brought a bed to the house so my dad can sleep on the first floor. One of them told my dad to get “sh*tfaced drunk” and another said “take ambien and have a drink.” I was fuming inside as he’s an alcoholic on blood thinner and of course that would be terrible for his diabetes and healing. I just kept saying “that’s not a good idea”. I feel like the parent!!!!!


Finally, the nurse came for the IV setup… and of course,my dad asked her if he could drink. She said “only if you want to get violently ill or violently vomit” (due to the interaction with the meds). He didn’t drink tonight, but I don’t know how long he will be able to resist. He’s acted like he’s actually going to listen to doctors this time but it has never lasted in the past.

I know I’m leaving out a lot of details. I’m there as much as I can be, but I’m also worried about my own emotional and mental health during this. Especially with his mood swings or lashing out. My mom said if he starts screaming at me to just start screaming back. But, I feel that will make things worse. i have mentioned the idea of having an aide come in to my mom, but feel like they're going to keep putting that off.    

Anyway, if you actually read this, thank you and if you have any advice - thank you in advance."
"Lss, dad's gone, mom went down real quick since being in a nursing home. I'm a bit confused and lost.

1. Had to take mom from her house in Texas up to a nursing facility in Indiana. She was basically competent on the 3 day drive and before, now 2 months later, she's gone. Realize some go down quick \*, but do some nursing facilities try to make them worse? It's a huge difference for no obvious reasoning. 
2. She stayed at a couple facilites in Texas before going north, the price was the price, now I'm seeing almost $1k extra in med bills a month, gloves ect. Is that normal?
3. I need to get guardianship from my understanding. To deal with the house sale/ira/bills and getting a lawyer to keep some of her monies out of the govt hands (she's not rich, but has enough). The facility isn't helping even though they said they would. Any direction on what to do?
4. Bills, which should I pay? She has limited funds in her bank account and obviously credit doesn't matter anymore. My thought is just the bills from the facility and her on-going external pharmacy bills coming from her facility. 

\* As far as her going downhill. A few months ago, we could have a decent conversation most days. Since being in the latest nursing home, It's been over a month since anyone has had a proper conversation with her. Nothing has really changed other than where she's staying and nothing degenerative diagnosed that should cause it.

Overall, I have no control of anything atm, don't care about the money as much as making sure there's some to make her happy."
"dad, two aspiration pneumonia in two weeks. It made him so weak he cant stand. Can move his legs just fine theyre toow eak tho. He has had swalowing issues and now he had also lost his voice. It sounds like laryngitis. Doc thinks maybe irritated nerves and may also ne affecting his swallowing. He passed his first swallow test and started getting water. the barium swallow test this morning didnt go well. hes allowed only water. Pudding got stuck in his throat and anything thicker was a no go as well. the doc thinks he has lost feeling in his throat so he doesnt know when to swallow. 

So, hes spent two weeks in a hospital. the first one was the one he and Mom used for decades. This current one is so much better. The old one never tried to find out why he wasnt swallowing properly They just cured the pneumonia and sent him to rehab.  In his present hospital theyre trying to fix his swallowing so he doesnt keep aspirating. 

he is bored, a bit depressed. Its very hard to understand him. But he is better cognitively than ive seen in awhile, certainly better than when he came in. We need to solve the swallowing and get his strength back in his legs so he can come home.  I am somewhat afraid of him having any kind of feeding tube and going to rehab. Praying things get better this week. He does get chatty, even tho I tell him I cant understand him so thats a very good sign. 

Thank you for your good wishes. Will get him through and bring him home."
"Hello everyone. I am brand new to this sub and am wondering how many of you have opted to have an aging parent move in? 

My mom, 84yo, is recovering from a broken T11 vertebrae after falling July 5th. She is mostly wheelchair bound now but can walk a few steps with her walker. She is otherwise in good health. We get along fine. 

My husband is supportive, my twin 16 yo sons are as well. I am absolutely freaking out. I want to see this as an opportunity to give back and deliver on the promise I made to my dad before he passed last year. I am more panicked over the loss of privacy in my home, the constant stream of visitors that will be here, the return to caring for someone who can’t help themselves, total loss of freedom, etc. 

Ugh. I don’t know about this. A lot of trepidation. Many thanks for your comments and input. 

I have older two sisters and a brother in the area who will be helping out, but honestly, they’re kinda the big reason I feel so nervous about this."
"My parents battled with a few neighbors- and now one parent is gone, the other is in a nursing home and I’m living in their house.

The neighbors were at fault but my parents were, too.  I realize the value in having good relationships with neighbors, particularly now (they can give referrals for service providers and keep an eye on the house).

How to start a new relationship with the neighbors: leave a bottle of wine and a note on their front porch? Or just ring the doorbell and introduce myself, unannounced?

Thanks."
"My mom is 65 and has diabetes and I'm afraid she is developing diabetic dementia.. we went to a concert a few weeks ago and it was her favorite band and they sang two songs and immediately after she looked me and said they didn't play these two songs. I was shocked. 
She is forgetting where she is and how to drive places. 

Everytime I have mentioned talked to her Dr she just says it's age. She gets very angry when we talk about it. I don't know what to do."
"Something thats on my mind and want to remind all you caretakers out there. This can be really rough stressful work, physically, mentally and emotionally. be sure and eat properly, take your vitamins, get good sleep, drink lots of water and get some relaxation. Do meditation, listen to relaxing music, get in a good workout, warm soak in epsom salts. Play a game on the pc or whatever. read, write, paint. Whatever it is practice your passion and work towards bettering and furtehring yourself and what makes YOU feel worthwhile. Dont get lost.

We started our episode two weeks ago and ive had someone or other call and wake me up every morning. Ive lost 5 pounds. But im eating ok. maybe im not snacking. It is emotionally draining to visit dad as he cant talk more than a hoarse whisper so I cant understand him. he may be passing on the secret of Life and ive missed it. the prospect of deciding where he goes for rehab just kills me, huge responsibility. theres just been so many things to do. I know ive come across as short with many people not meaning to. 

So tonight im chillin. Might order in a pizza and work on some artwork. Tomorrow will be a full day and it seems like something unexpected each day. So I wish you folks all the best. I pray for you wisdom and strength and compassion and love. 

Take good care."
"If you have an aging parent who is in declining health, do you go to all medical appointments with him/her?  Or do you let a caregiver go (without another family member also there)?

My widower father is in poor health and can’t walk, so we have used elder transportation (in a van) to transport him, in a wheelchair, to recent doctors’ appointments.

My brother and I (who live far away) are making plans to be in town so that one of us can always go to each medical appointment, too.

However, is that excessive?  We figured that a family member needs to be at each doctor’s appointment with our father- but would you let a paid caregiver go with him instead?

Thanks."
"I was  told yesterday by the caseworker from the hospital I had to choose a facility by tomorrow. Dad will need rehab after pneumonia to regain strength in his legs to come home. She sent me a shortlist of four that are in their network and I know I can choose another as long as its in his Ins network. I really like this hospital, first time our family has used it. I wish the rehab facilities were this good but I know better. I did try and get him into a dedicated rehab hospital but Ins denied him. I have no idea if right now he can do 3 hours rehab a day. 

What worries me and makes me very sad is that these places arent dedicated rehab. To me theyre nursing homes that also do rehab. maybe im wrong. I will never ever dump my dad in a nursing home. So now, he needs to go some where that will be dedicated to rehabbing him and sending him home. 

And thus my frustration and question. IF they let me just walk in and talk to whoever is in charge it will be a short visit. Im looking online, their website of course is just advertisement and every place is so wonderful. Im googling them for medicare ratings etc, BBB, incidents but still if theres no flags there I still dont know if they will check on him often, not make him pee on a pad in bed. Current hospital has him a condom catheter, such a good idea. he has swallowing issues and needs some special care, like pureeing his food. I dont even know if he will be back on real food by then. 

anyway im rambling, how the hell can you decide on a place just from the internet and a short visit? how do you know they will actually be dedicated to fixing him up and getting him home? 

Thank you"
"I’m looking for ideas on how to help my mother keep up with her lighters.  

Mother has short term memory loss and is legally blind.   She looses her lighter constantly throughout the day.   I bought 20+ new lighters and placed them around the house.   

I have found something called Lighter on a Leash…but wonder if any of you have experience with helping your parent keep up with the lighters"
"I live in a home that I co-own and share expenses with my 78 year old mother. It’s basically the “family HQ” that has been in the family for decades. It was left to the children and grandchildren (ie me) in common; my mom retains life estate.  My general plan was to live with her until such time as she passed and then sell the house and move to an apartment.  (I have independent savings and resources, and wasn’t really counting on the sale of the house as a central part of my future stability.)

For whatever reason - oncoming dementia, untreated depression/anxiety, or just a series of stressful events - my mom over the past 3 months has experienced a complete health and personality meltdown.  It seems to have been triggered by my return to work after 18 months working at home due to COVID requirements. But other stresses had been piling up before that. It’s just that her ability to cope with uncertainty and change has never been the greatest, and we always sensed she had a narcissistic streak - but now it seems to be full-blown.

The added problem is that her sister (my aunt) has had a catastrophic housing and health crisis now as well (see my other post history), which is complicating matters severely. My mom is needless to say not handling it well, not helping the situation at all, and continues to insist on trying to do whatever she wants. Her narcissistic tendencies are in full bore right now, so yesterday when she fell for the fifth time in three months, she literally blamed the floor’s flatness for causing her to fall. 

It’s impossible to find a home health aise these days - the waiting lists are so long. Meanwhile, my sister and I have been consumed with our aunt’s desperate situation - which seems to inflame my mom’s narcissistic demands even more. Things are just on the verge of complete disaster, as the next time my mom falls, it may be her own one-way ticket to long term care.

I’m beginning to resign myself to the very real possibility of losing my house and my personal savings as well."
"Dad went to ER for aspirated pneumonia last Monday, was released to rehab SNC tuesday and Thursday went back to ER for what they say is aspirated Pneumonia again. Tbh I dont know if its saliva or eating at rehab. The hospital was cutting up his food very fine and adding gravy. 

So he is in hospital now and over the pneumonia, looks good, feels good, on O2 and weaning him off O2 assistance. But his voice is so hoarse he has a hard time being understood. It gets a bit better every day. Today I can understand a few words. he passed a simple swallow test today and the therapist wants to do a barium swallow test monday. shes very keen to find out whats happened to his V chords. I wondered since he has drainage if maybe he has mucous caked on the back of his throat. 

So, anyone have or seen anything similar? Any idea whats going on here? Also, anyone have recurring aspirated pneumonia Cant keep going on like this. What ive learned and we will change for the future if/when he comes home.

His food will be cut up very fine and gravy added where able. I will make sure he follows eating protcol:

small bites, chew fully, small sip of water to swallow, get every bite fully down before you take another one.

Also going to get him some therapy to help improve his throat muscles and learn to swallow better.

And why I say 'if' he comes home. The first bout of this made him so weak he couldnt walk. he used to use a walker and was weak. The PT at the first hospital got him to stand and take a few steps one day so was really helpful. Right now he looks almost normal. he needs to get his meds going again. 

But has anyone had this aspirated pneumonia and been so weak they couldnt walk ...was it possible to get strength back and walk again?

just trying to figure things out, thank you.

Hospital has been really good this time, different place and I think we will adopt them. But I dont always ask the right questions. Need to find out if he's starting his meds again and if he can start foods, liquids i guessing now."
"So my dad passed away after two months in the hospital- it's a clusterfuck of emotions I'll tell ya. The last day the hospital told me it was happening and asked if I wanted to come. I was with him for the last two weeks, every day, seeing him at his worst, but I just couldn't bring myself to sit and watch him die. He had a private nurse that was with him on and off during the two months and he grew fond of her. When I was here in the beginning and he was talking I could really see how much he liked her. On the last day she insisted on being with him until the end, providing him with peace and comfort and giving me updates when I just couldn't be there. She even insisted on staying overtime that night until he passed. She is truly an angel and I want to send her a gift or something to express my gratitude. Any ideas what would be appropriate? I know this is a bit of a weird question for this sub but I figured maybe some of you have gone through something similar...? Thanks so much"
"In the situation below, in addition to getting a paid 24/7 caregiver, would you:

1.  Move in with your widower father?
2.  Visit your widower father maybe once a week or once every two weeks?
3.  Just visit your widower father in case of a key doctors’ appointment or case-by-case need?
4.  Require your widower father to move near family?
5.  Put your widower father in a high-end assisted living center?

My father is in very poor health and is suddenly a widower.  He lives in his childhood home (which is a large, expensive house).  He can’t do anything himself (cook, clean, get dressed, etc.). So he needs a 24/7       caregiver.  Money is no object; he can spend whatever is necessary for care.

He has no close family nearby and he hasn’t made an effort to keep up friendships.  Thus he is completely alone.  He doesn’t want contact with anyone other than my brother and me.  But we live 600-900 miles away from him and each other.

So without my brother and me, he’d spend the rest of his live just with a 24/7 caregiver.

I am single and can work remotely (with some trips back to the office every week or so), at least for now.  My brother works for himself so he can work anywhere but he has a wife and kids.  So each of us has flexibility and can come visit Father often.

I am fine living in Father’s house most of the time, for now, traveling back to my home once every week or so.  My brother thinks it’s crazy for me to be willing to live far away from my home, but I figure that I need to do what I can to help ensure that Father’s life is as good as I can make it.  (And flying around during the workweek is hard; I’d rather stay in one place as much as possible.)

What would you do in this situation?

Thanks."
"My mother moved in with her mother after she sold her house and is planning to build a home for the both of them where my grandma can comfortably live out her last years. 

I’ve discovered (never realized this as a kid) my grandmother has smoked in her home for decades, my moms entire life. 

It triggers my mom to no end and angers her but she refuses to bring it up to my grandmother to avoid confrontation. 

She absolutely refuses to have a smoker in this new house and I’ve tried to listen and hear her out and even offer advice but it falls on deaf ears. Do I stay out of it or try to help mediate? I’m at a loss here. They’re both so stubborn."
"Went to visit Dad in the hospital and I dont know if it can be solved but I do see a big issue. he cant have water yet and is on a O2 mask so his throat is so dry he barely whispers and you cant understand him. hes weak and has tremors so he cant write notes. At that his hearing aid batteries died and he couldnt hear well anyway. 

So how can he communicate? they were trying to do a swallow test and he didnt follow commands. Im guessing he either didnt hear them or couldnt understand and he cant ask questions or tell them anything. he was afraid and first thing I did was make sure he knew he was ok and in a very nice hospital and that he is getting better. Its frightening to be alone and get an ambulance ride and wake go thru ER and wake up in CSU bed not knowing where you are or why. I dont know if they explained anything to him. But he was so happy to see me. 

I just wish there were a device or some way he could communicate. I took a notepad but his tremors and weakness were bad enough he couldnt write. I wonder how much the hospital tells patients like this. I guess not much cause they have no idea what transpired before, just from when they got them."
"Hi everyone. I have been really struggling coming to terms with my mom’s inevitable mortality lately as well as what my role will be with that, and I thought this might be a good place to turn. 

So my story. I’m 24F. My parents are 65M and 59F. My dad is doing quite well health wise. My mom on the other hand was unfortunately diagnosed with Huntington’s disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes you to have uncontrolled movements eventually taking away your ability to walk, speak, swallow… you know the rest. The prognosis depends it can be anywhere from 10-20yrs post diagnosis. This has been absolutely devastating to me. She was diagnosed almost 10 years ago now but her symptoms have really progressed over the last 3ish years. Her mobility is quite poor but she’s able to walk around on her own and she’s had a few minor falls. She has had a few episodes of choking on food but nothing serious. Her speech is impaired a bit but still able to have conversations. She has become more volatile…. It is very tense at home sometimes. I was able to deny what was happening before then but now it’s just hitting me like a truck. Currently my dad is her main supervisor. It’s more of a contractual marital obligation than anything. He checks on her in the afternoon after she wakes up and spends the evenings with her.

I moved to a city 2.5hrs away from home on the farm for university 7years ago. I decided to pursue medical school. My parents are so proud of me. But now I feel just an overwhelming sense of guilt, sadness and anxiety nearly every day thinking about her. I will be able to return 30 mins away from the farm for my residency in 2 years time which does help alleviate some of my guilt but that’s a long time away… 

I feel so much guilt that I’m not doing everything to keep her safe and enrich her life. She is so resistant to everything and very independent and stubborn. She doesn’t even want to see doctors-that usually ends in a fight. Every time I share my story with people, the logical advice is “get someone to come to the home and help!” And of course that’s a good idea and maybe it would give me some peace of mind but mom does not want that right now and really since she’s pretty independent still I don’t know what help would be able to do for her. So it just feels like every time that’s suggested I feel like the most awful person and I’m neglecting her. I feel so helpless. And then this stems into my next biggest problem. 

I am the closest person to my mom by far. Her supports are few and far between. Her disease and what it’s done to her has caused her to want to isolate from all her friends and most of her family. She denies wanting support or to connect with anyone. She is perfectly happy to stay home with her dogs. I know she is proud of me but sometimes I just want to quit school and stay with her all the time, not only to cherish the time we have left but to keep her safe. I love her so so much. I have told her and my dad this before and they tell me this is the worst idea ever and they want me to continue on with school, become a doctor and make them proud. My dad swears he will tell me if he feels that things are unsafe and they are not managing at home and then we can decide what to do from there and not to worry about it right now… but of course my anxious mind makes me think I am the most awful person if something happens that maybe could have been prevented (fall, aspiration… etc). 

It feels selfish of me to think about my own future. I hate doing it even. I have a long term partner, we want to get a house and have a family but I can’t think of a life where my mind isn’t constantly on my mom and my free time isn’t entirely spent on her. Sometimes I catch myself fantasizing about my life, what kind of doctor I’ll be, the house I’ll have, my kids. But then I feel so much guilt. And sadness. And grief. I feel like i shouldn’t work, take care of her, live at home with my parents. Unfortunately she will eventually be totally incontinent, nonverbal, unable to eat, and a total lift. I feel the stigma associated with deciding on long term care for your parent already. Surely I must be an awful if I prioritize my own life over my mother who gave me life. 

I just want to know if I am a bad person and if I deserve these feelings I’m having. If i truly am as selfish and awful as I feel. If I’m not doing the right things. If you read all this thank you, I appreciate you"
"For thirty days no family members have been permitted to visit my mother. The assisted living where she lives had some COVID, and even though the affected employees had no contact with the residents, and haven't reported for work for quite some time, and affected residents were moved out, making the building essentially COVID free, by state law they had to seal things up to visitors. I finally got in today because my mother was being evaluated for hospice and I hold her medical POA.

The month has gone very badly for my mother. In the absence of loving family members to help her stay grounded and the COVID restrictions, she has spent entirely too much time alone, and her dementia has gone from quirky funny things like ""grandma came over and we had ice cream"" to a whole dark area of distress and despair.

She's been seeing my father, who died in July, and the encounters are hurtful and rude. This is ironic and confusing to me because my parents had an excellent 70 year marriage with never a hint of discord, so why is her mind going to such places? Regardless of the reason, her reality now is that my father is alive but that he hates her. He comes into the apartment, she says, and scowls at her and refuses to speak. He has taken up with another woman, she says, and no longer stays overnight. She told my cousin that she imagined they would be getting divorced soon.

But physically she's holding on. Her weight is stable, her vitals are strong. Mentally she cannot tell you the name of the place where she lives, but physically she is just fine. For these reasons the evaluating agency determined that she is not yet eligible for hospice.  Too bad in a way, because the laws permit two people at a time to visit hospice patients even when the facility remains closed, as it continues to be, so now I don't know when the next time will be that I can see or hug my mom or sit with her and reminisce or hold her hand.

A second meeting took place immediately after. It was to determine Mom's care needs for the next months.  The director of the memory care unit was present, and I had steeled myself to hear that the recommendation would be immediate removal to memory care.

There are several strong reasons to make the move:  1--My mother is a fall risk, and currently lives in the larger apartment that my wife and I had chosen when we pictured both my parents living there together. Living in a smaller memory care apartment might reduce the need to be up walking so much and reduce falls.  Also staff could begin to transition Mom to a wheelchair when the time came.

2--The apartment has memories of Dad which might be prompting the hallucinations. Dad was never content in that apartment, so that might help explain why he's so unhappy when she ""sees"" him.

3--Mom is isolated. With COVID, the dining area is closed and meals are served individually in rooms. Family isn't permitted to visit, so all she sees each day are caregivers, who often are under enough pressure that they don't have time to visit much. They do their best, but they're understaffed like everyone else right now. Memory care by its very nature is more group-oriented and social.

BUT: Mom doesn't want to move and there are family members who support that position. We all recognize that hospice and memory care are inevitable if her life follows the common course, but some in the family are not ready to force that upon her quite yet.

Ultimately there was a compromise made. She will begin anti-psychotic medication in hope that we can reduce the number and intensity of the troubling hallucinations. If that works, she'll probably be ok staying in her apartment for a while longer, but if she continues to have depression and to live in a constant state of being upset, the move to memory care will be necessary.

Moving my parents in the first place was not as hard of a decision as this one is. Mom has had a rough year, breaking her hip, being moved against her will out of the home she ran for 55 years, losing Dad, and now, potentially being moved again to an environment that's quite different and much less private than the life she's been living. Some in the family think she's had enough upset for a while, but others say since it's inevitable you might as well get it over with and do it, with the thinking being the sooner it's done, the sooner she'll begin to accommodate and to enjoy the benefits I listed above.

But not now, is the decision. For now, my mom is healthy enough that hospice isn't appropriate, and we're going to get her some medication to help fight those distressing hallucinations.  For now, we are holding on."
"Waiting to go see dad in the ER. Last Monday he went in with aspiration pneumonia. weak and a fever but no coughing. he was transfered to a rehab skilled nursing Home Tuesday. he had no fever or coughing at that time. Wednesday he was coughing alot, sounded like he had gunk in his upper resp tract and was very tired. they put him on O2 and albuteral, the chest xrays were clear. A nurse practitioner saw him and thought it was from his parkinsons and gave him a script for atropine for over salivation. His doctor had given him that as well. 

late yesterday I get a text from the rehab director saying they had successfully completed covid testing and all patients and staff passed, no covid in the building and restrictions lifted. So apparently they had an outbreak of covid. No one ever mentioned that, I would not have taken him there. 

My dad is 95, he never gets sick, never gets a resp infection or flu. Ever. Just the aspiration due to his Parkinsons. Last time he had a resp illness was four years ago when he had a stroke.

My questions. 

\*Shouldnt the rehab facility have been transparent about the recent covid outbreak? 

\*Very curious he was not sick at the hospital then comes to rehab and immediately gets sick, is rehab liable?

now, he hasnt seen anyone but hospital staff and me. I havent been anywhere for a couple weeks except the hospital and rehab. I have zero symptoms and am healthy as a horse. 

I'm just very curious as I wait to go see him. Is the facility liable or is it that they have taken every precaution and he just caught something anyway. I just dont get how he got this illness.

thank you, hope it makes sense as I am extremely concerned at this time."
"Dad went to a skilled nursing center for rehab tuesday late and yesterday was coughing alot. No fever, mucous clear. they put him on O2 and albuteral. They just called to tell me theyre sending him back to the hospital, hes getting a fever and trouble breathing. Going to wait a couple hours so they can get him over and look at him then will go see.

What scares me and pisses me off is the rehab sent out a groupe text to patients families that they had completed covid protocol testing and restrictions were lifted. now I wonder if they had covid in the facility and wondering if they gave it to my Dad. But will see what the hospital says.

dad went through a week in hospital for aspirated pneumonia. Over that in a few days, just weak. Im scared now that he wont have the strength to fight off whatever this is.

Who or whatever you believe in please pray for my dad.

&#x200B;

edit-facility called me, EMTs were taking dad back to the hospital he had come from but he then needed an ER and they wentv to the closest one. I dont hold much hope at this point. googling to see where it is.

edit2-I knew it would one day come. And I pray he come home. I dont think id ever be ready but could have been much better prepared. never think you have time, because it goes so quick and you never know how much you get. We take it for granted. Thank you for the good thoughts."
" A caregiver is someone who takes care of a close family member or friend who may have medical or personal issues. It could be helping with simple tasks like meal prep, cleaning up their living space, running errands, or just being there emotionally for someone.

Being a caregiver for someone, especially for someone who is very close to you, can be both rewarding and overwhelming. It can become difficult both mentally and physically. It can cut into your social life and your work life making things financially tight. It is important while taking care of your loved one that you take care of yourself too.

Caregiver burnout can occur quickly or gradually over time when the stress and the pressure of making sure your loved one is taken care of become overwhelming. As a caregiver, you may feel exhausted, alone, overworked, and underappreciated. It is very important to recognize when these signs start to show. It is important to address them as they come instead of covering them up or telling yourself you are ok. The more the burnout progresses the higher the chance of you not being able to provide the care you are capable of and the care your loved one deserves.

Recognizing the signs…

You may start to feel and see signs of burnout. You might feel some of these signs all at once or slowly over a period of time.

Many of the signs are

* Exhaustion
* Depression
* Anxiety
* Pushing your own health and mental state to the side
* Losing interest in your hobbies or things you once really cared about
* Feel like you are losing control of everything around you

The emotional side to caregiver burnout might start with something as mild as feeling anxious, being irritable or upset, and might not be so easy to recognize. It can quickly turn into physical pain, such as headaches. Becoming either very tired or the total opposite of not being able to sleep is very common. Losing any interest in eating, bathing, or chatting with friends can quickly creep up without you even noticing.

"Possibly a difficult/triggering read ahead. For sure, a long one, but I'll put a tl;dr at the end.

My mom is 83. She's always had a ""difficult"" personality. It's her way or the highway on most things, she is cynical and when upset gets very unpleasant and emotionally/verbally abusive. In the past couple of years, and more so in the past few months, things have taken a turn for the worse. 

First, the paranoid thoughts. She believes everyone in her apartment building is involved in a massive drug operation. Yes -- everyone. She thinks the security lights are a ""signalling mechanism"", she sees people in their cars using their phones and thinks they are communicating with their ""drug people"", etc. Also, anything that happens to her or goes wrong is part of a plot/conspiracy against her. ""Why do all these people want to harass and pester an old woman?"" she complains. If she loses something, it was stolen. When her Internet stopped working, ""they"" turned it off. She's called the police a handful of times to report people who are part of this ""operation""; of course, she has no evidence of anything and they don't take her seriously. So now she thinks they are in on it too. Me and my son and her former acquaintances/friends are, as well.

Second, the depression. She's pushed everyone away, so is basically all alone and lonely, and of course that isn't good. And even though she's still doing okay physically, things are getting harder for her and her body is obviously far from what it used to be (again, she's 83). She says she hopes every night she dies in her sleep; that she is looking forward to it. ""All I want now is to die.""

Now the combination of these two things has created a bit of a crisis. Since ""everyone"" is out to get her, she has zero trust left for anyone. Recently her apartment complex was acquired by a new company. She's now refusing to pay the rent. The apartment complex has given her a notice to vacate and I expect eviction proceedings will begin at some point. 

She says she doesn't care if they kick her out, that she'll live on the street, and anyway it doesn't matter since hopefully she's going to die soon.

From what I have gathered discussing this with a few people, there's little the authorities can do unless she presents an ""imminent danger"" to herself or others. But I can't throw in the towel without exhausting all options. 

Since it's the ""obvious"" solution, I have to say in advance there's no way I can have her move in with me. She's simply too toxic, unpredictable and has little to no consideration for boundaries. It would be a nightmare.

So, I'm at the end of my rope and looking for any suggestions for helping her. Perhaps there's a state agency I could turn to? (We're in Texas.) I'd be satisfied (albeit not super happy) to see her put under care. 

tl;dr -- aging parent with paranoid/depressive thoughts who ""just wants to die"" is probably going to be evicted soon for non-payment of rent. Looking for a way to keep her from becoming homeless. Any advice or options appreciated."
"Was told I have to sign a form to get access to a list of Dads meds. My pateince is short but I have other forms to sign, and a phone conference Friday with his caregiver supervisors. 

And today he is sick. He was wheezing and coughing up this morning. they started him on oxygen and albuterol. he is constantly coughing. No fever and the phlegm is clear so no infection. They ran a chest xray and waiting for results.  he had aspirated pneumonia which put him in the hospital but he wasnt coughing at all with that. he was just very weak and tired. I havent seen him with chest congestion coughing up for four years, he just doesnt get sick. 

The nurse practitioner was supposed to be out there late this afternoon and will look at him. Will call after dinner to see how he is. Tbh im scared."
"My mother (71F) and father (75M) just concluded a visit from a few states away with my wife (35F) and I (40M).   We have been married for 2.5 years, and parents and wife are generally very mildly amicable to each other.

My wife is normally introverted, and is especially cautious around my parents.  My parents are loud and quite negative, always  complaining and arguing about everything.  Parents often triangulate me into their drama, phoning me whenever they are fighting, usually weekly.  And now they are old and their attitudes have amplified with age.   My wife had a relatively healthy upbringing and has uhm boundaries.  Her family likes to quietly discuss books. 

Before my parents left, my mother flipped out when we were alone.  (wife not there).  She start yelling and crying a little, that my wife is cold to her and makes her feel unwelcome.   My mom listed all the things she did for my wife and her family through the years. And how my wife did almost nothing for her.   My mom in her frenzy, told me to make sure I have my own bank account, because she wants to send money to only me, and she would sacrifice everything for me.   She then told me not to say a word to my wife.   My dad was pleased to have a night not focused on him and almost seemed satisfied that I am sharing in her wrath.  

My wife HAS been more reserved than normal, and not making much small talk. ... because she is 6 weeks pregnant and feeling sick.  She also works 10 hours a day.   We don't want to tell anyone about the baby till another OB appointment or two.  we still had dinner with my parents every night for a week.

I feel ashamed and came to vent.  My wife is pregnant with my first child... but all I can think about is how upset my mom is.  And thinking ""how do I later use the pregnancy to placate my mom"".  I even had the horrible thought, ""I hope my wife doesn't have a miscarriage, or else I'll never be able to explain to my mom why she was withdrawn!"" 



 A sick part of me thinks ""a good son/husband would secretly make excuses for his wife so his mom won't be sad"".

edit: We had a phone call the next day and my mom acted like nothing happened and I went along with it."
"I know I cant be there 100% of the time and that I'm doing my best (along with my sisters) to have everything controlled and cared.. Nobody knows when hist time to depart will be (days? weeks? months?), but I'm concerned in advance that I'm investing my time in other things than being by his side. It gets me very nervous and a little sad.  I wonder if wont regret this attitude in the future, but I dont know what other thing to do. I've just returned to work after several days offline, of which I spent several there."

Unsure if this is the right place to post this but here it goes... posted on another sub too... 

TLDR : my father 75 years has asked me to extend my stay with him and I am feeling confused.

For context we recently lost my mother after a long terminal illness. She was 75 years. It's been a month almost.

I  came to my parents in August as my mother was hospitalised. She passed  away soon after. I stayed back and will be leaving on the 4th of October  to return to my country.

I  informed my father yesterday about it after battling this thought in my  own mind if I wanted to and was sure of leaving on the 4th. Once I felt I  was okay I informed him last evening. To which he was obviously sad and  said oh stay back a bit a day or two. I gave him a few reasons why I  feel that I should return. Anyway some factors to consider for the  advice -

\- my house is shut since two months. It's a rented appartement.

\-  I stay all alone at my dad's house the whole day. No one to talk to and  I rarely feel like going out as everything reminds me of my mum and our  memories together. Even my parent's house reminds me in every corner  about her. My father goes to work from 9 am to 18h30 and then comes in  between for lunck break. After returning in the evening we exchange a  few words here and there and he starts distracting himself by watching  videos or religious stuff. I go back to my room (I practically stay in  my room the whole day coming out intermittently).

\-  Everything I say or do or not reminds me of my mother. It's extremely  painful. I either keep crying, blaming myself (I have also been blamed  by my dad and sis for not doing enough), feel guilty, regret everything  including my move abroad as that's when everything started to go  downhill with my mother's health. No one it seems was happy with my  move. I am 37 and was 33 when I did.

\- I am unemployed and still trying to make my base there but it's not like I can live there without making efforts.

\- I now feel guilty of going back and think maybe I should extend till friday but I am unsure what that would change...

\-  I cannot come to visit them/him often as I am still settling myself and  for other mental health reasons which aren't relevant to the story

\-Basically  I am mentally exhausted and always anxious because my dad on previous  occasions has asked me to extend my stay and even then I wasn't doing it  sometimes because I had found a job. Other times I have stayed without  anyone saying but even then it seems it wasn't enough. I feel very  guilty and feel that I am being selfish for just caring about my life. I  don't know what to do. Please can someone help me. Any advice ? What  would you do in my position ?

Thank you for reading"
"Ive taken care of my dad for over 3 years. i am his POAs, his caretaker and have driven him to every appt. he just went from hospital to skilled nursing center for rehab. hes 95, had parkinsons, some balance and weakness issues. he beat the aspiration pneumonia and on Thursday was almost his normal self cognitively. And he came a long way from tuesday, he was in ER monday night. 

But starting friday he seemed drugged up, he slept all the time, fell sleep on me this past weekend while feeding him. But he seemed drugged up, real out of it. couldnt stay awake. Today at the rehab place the nurse showed me a list of meds. the hospital quite honestly was not helpful. But there were 2 or 3 new meds that the hospital started. One for pain, one for brain function and cant remember the other. 

My concern is that one or more of the meds the hospital added on are causing him to be drugged up and sleep all the time. he has never ever complained of pain. I have talked to him about his health many times.

now, do I have enough pull to get them to stop giving him these drugs? Do I have any legal grounds as his POA, son, caregiver to odrer them to stop those drugs. he was fine before his pneumonia without them. he saw his doctor and neurologist regular and they didnt think he needed anything else. he already has a med for Parkinsons and one for brain fucntion. I just want to give him the chance to not be all drugged up.

Thanks"
"My mom (78) recently had a dr’s appointment and her normal doc wasn’t available. The person she saw instead wouldn’t let my dad accompany her in the appointment. The problem is mom has memory issues, and the reason we took her there was she is not eating, as she a) is never hungry and b) forgets to eat. So she couldn’t tell the doc that this was a problem, and similarly would not bring up other issues, because they just aren’t present in her mind. My dad tried to convey this to the nurse but her exit papers didn’t indicate anything about nutrition or appetite (blood work was performed though).

I know it is for privacy and safety purposes that we see doctors alone, and I respect that but surely there is a way around this when someone is not entirely capable of self-care? Any advice, is this a legal issue? Is there a special “I am this persons’ caretaker” phrase that would get him in the room?

Thanks in advance."
"Dad will be taken over to the Skilled Nursing Facility for rehab stay in the next half hour. I know he will be scared. I asked his social worker to talk to him and let him know where hes going and that I said its ok. If he forgets then he will be scared. I got the call last minute so dont have time to get to the hospital. I'll head over to the new facility. 

I have a half page of questions for them. Will talk to his doc, PT, and nurse about his treatment plan. I know they will evaluate him and draw it up. 

Will let them know he needs a walker. Give them a list of his meds and ask them to call me before giving any new meds unless an emergency. He needs to wear adult diapers. Sitting on a pad as in the hospital will NOT be acceptable. I will weekly get a list of the meds hes been given and also get a PT record and see if he can handle a bit more. I dont want him being in there if it does no good. 

He will have a TV and they couldnt say if he had a roommate. they said some people like having someone to talk with. I will take his hearing aids.

oops gotta get going...dad is so good, he refused to sign his discharge papers without checking with me. 

now, papers at rehab, I will be reading it over so lets hope they are honest. What i udnerstand is if for any reason i want him out he can come out. 

Thanks all, pray this place takes good care of him and he gets to walking."
We will see how it goes.
"Hi all,

I live in TX, mother lives in GA.  We've been estranged for 20 years but talk on the phone maybe twice a year.  She is around 60 and is working full time at an office with meager pay. She is very sedentary at home, drinks/smokes and has become fairly weak due to this lifestyle. She lives in a townhouse and has paid off most of it.  I don't know specifics of her finances but I get the impression that she's treading water and may have credit card debt. She either lives alone or rents a room out, currently she has a roommate that seems to help her out. I have one sibling who lives very far away but who keeps in contact with mom better than myself.

I'm just posting here for advice on what I should be looking at to prepare for her decline in health. I'm familiar with how Medicare and Medicaid work. 

What are the questions that I need to be asking her, my sister, and myself at this time? I don't want to wait for it to blow up, but it feels like it's late to prepare."
My grandmother had a small stroke but that and multiple UTi's had her in the hospital then a rehab facility. She was already in bad shape before but she could at least walk with a walker and use the bathroom on her own. Because they could get her to stand by lifting her up they decided she was good enough to go home. We're basically picking her up every time we have to move her and she's stuck in a wheelchair slumped over because I can't get her into anything else because I'm not strong enough and I'm the only one here right now. I've called her case manager for when she was at the rehab with my concerns. I can't pick her up by my self so I'm not even sure how I'm going to change her diaper. She also has C. Diff and my 1 year old has to be with me here while I take care of her because we don't have the money for daycare. So I'm taking care of a 1 year old and attempting to taking care of my grandmother. I don't think she should be home but my mom and uncle thought yes she should be home because she wants to be home but just because she wants to be home doesn't mean that's the safest thing for her. I don't think this is a good situation for her because I'm really not able to do much for her. I just want to know if I'm bias for wanting my grandmaw to not be home or if I'm right in thinking she shouldn't be here. It's hard for me to do this with a baby so I know I'm definitely bias. But I genuinely don't even know how I'm going to get through the day because she needs more care than I feel like I can give.
"TL;DR:   Be sure to check that key documents like Power of Attorney your aging parents sign don't have typos, so banks won't refuse POA. 

 

UGH!   So p.o.'d!    I hired a lawyer to draw up estate planning documents for my parents.   I got a recommendation from my financial advisor, whom I trust.     The lawyer was immediately available, whereas most estate planning lawyers are currently slammed.   

Well, fast forward, and IDK how much exactly - $5k? - and Fidelity just refused the Power of Attorney for my dad, as the paragraphs weren't numbered correctly!    So the POA is unuseable!!!!!   And this is even after I read each document before signing.   I am so pissed!   

Luckily my father is able to execute a corrected POA, but if he were not, IDK what would have happened.  More pain in the butt."
"Just to make sense I found out some things today at the hospital. Tuesday dad was like a vegetable, so out of it. he got progressively better the next few days and Thursday he seemed fairly normal, just weak. But from Friday til today he has been fading. Sunday he seemd to just sleep. i fed him lunch and dinner and he fell asleep during dinner. He seems out of it, has a hard time speaking, his speech may slur a bit. Today a bit worse. he kept falling asleep on me so i turned the light off and came home.

His nurse today is an amazing young woman, compassionate, bright, and proactive in her care. She looked up his chart and told me who his neurologist is and his doctor. She put a request in for each to call me. I was concerned since they had said they doubled his Pramipexole that it was causing his decline. he usually gets 1.5mg a day and doubling would be 3. In fact they are giving him 2.0mg a day or only .5 extra. I have no idea if that would do this but I wouldnt think so.

There is another nurse in there who takes really good care of him. I helped her change dads gown and pads after he peed em. My dad telling me he has to go pee and then realising he already had. I got the pee canister and told him to put his junk in it and he didnt understand. His brain is not understanding things at this point. And he is going downhill.

Thank you to everyone who has commented, I appreciate you folks. Ive asked that his doc take a good look on his rounds today. I have no idea what could be wrong. Only thing I can think is a Uti. If his doc calls me or when I go back up will ask them to check.

Take good care my friends.

edit: talked to his neurologist and he says the small increase in dosage wont cause a problem. they ran some tests and they dont see anything that indicates a problem. he says its just his age and Parkinsons. Tonight Dad was sleeping, I woke him up and fed him and the nurse and I chnged his underpad etc. he was sleepy and lethargic and didnt really talk. just kinds laid there and stared. His neuro said he was slightly depressed. I understand and keep telling him whats going on and were getting him rehab so he can come home again. But if today is an indicator he wont be able to do rehab. I fear the worst. i dont want him to ever end up in a Home but I dont know if I can take care of him alone."
"Anyone else faced this situation?

My father is a widower and in very poor health.  He’s in a skilled nursing center now and hopes be home in a few months.

He says that he’ll be lonely at home.  He doesn’t want visits, phone calls or even emails from anyone except my brother and me.  He wants contact from us, though.

Unfortunately my brother and I each live hundreds of miles away.  We can work remotely and will be spending significant time visiting my father.

This doesn’t seem ideal or reasonable: an aging parent being lonely and far from family.  Yet my father does not seem interested in moving.  He lives in his childhood home and so I guess that provides some psychological stability.

It would be easier for everyone if he’d move nearer to my brother or me. 

Has anyone successfully convinced someone in my father’s situation to move to be with family?  Or should we just accept that his remaining time is limited (at most perhaps 8 years, and likely far shorter) and just make the best of it?

Thanks."
"My dad (75) is caretaker for my mom (70) who has been significantly affected by MS for about 10+ years, mostly mobility and coordination issues- she has used a walker/wheelchair for most of this time. The last 5 years she has also had declining cognition, sight and hearing. She is very dependent on my dad, cannot/will not go out without him.

Dad has a lot on his plate, taking care of her, the house, dogs, doing ALL driving/shopping/cooking- it's a big job. They are well off, so he is able to hire help for them, but my mom is stubborn/proud/in denial and basically refuses any kind of medical aide, home-care type assistance bc it’s “not needed” and “awkward”. 

They do have a domestic helper- cooking, cleaning, gardening, dog sitting, etc. This is a critical service for them and really lightens my Dad's burden, physically and psychologically. She has been working for them for several years now; they live in a rural area and when their previous helper left, it was difficult for them to find a replacement.

Through a couple of mis-sent/accidentally seen texts, my sibling and I are fairly confident my dad is having some kind of affair/inappropriate relationship with this current domestic helper.

So, I'm mostly just grossed out and wish I never had to know about any of this.  I don't want to be involved in my parents' intimate relationships.  Perhaps they had/have an arrangement? Sibling and I also discussed other evidence of him having affairs when we were kids.  

I am feeling bad for my mom, feeling like perhaps he's taking advantage of her compromised position? Or maybe she knows and she just let's him do his thing as long as he's discreet (and maybe they've had a don't ask, don't tell thing for longer than she has been disabled)? Or maybe he's just been cheating behind her back their entire FIFTY year marriage? I am trying to understand that he may ""need"" something else to stay sane and stay in the marriage, continue his stressful caretaker duties and not blow up our whole family for the rest of their lives. 

Dad still has his wits about him, but as I said above it's sloppy texting and leaving phone screens open that started this... I'm a bit concerned there will be more of it...

I don't know what I'm seeking here; feel like I can't talk to anyone about this.... I don't believe he would leave my mom.... I don't want to confront either of them or have them know we know anything (although Dad probably realizes he mis-sent a text for his GF to one of his daughters- ew)."
"Should I pay for long term care insurance for her, or would it just be an unnecessary cost since she has no money to ‘lose’ to paying for care anyways? Or would her lack of money mean she doesn’t get care unless I pay for it? Sorry, I’m not exactly sure how this stuff works. She is in pretty good health right now, no serious issues, probably the biggest thing is osteoporosis."
"I’ve seen several funerals where the surviving spouse didn’t attend.  There was no divorce or estrangement, and the couple was still married.

Is this common?  I would expect that a spouse’s funeral would be extremely painful, so I understand.

Thanks."
"Hey folks, I'm running myself ragged (I'm sure a lot of you are on this forum!) trying to take care of my dad in his mid-80s. Fortunately, he's a delight to be around. Unfortunately, he has memory issues, bodily function (including catheter) issues, balance issues - all that fun stuff with old age.

Does anyone know if there is such a thing as on call caregiving? I just wonder because, I was out this past weekend and he got stuck and couldn't get up and I had to race home. This seems like it's an increasingly, frequent, issue. If I just had some sort of backup support it would make me feel so much better! He has Kaiser for health insurance but, I'm not sure if they offer anything like what I'm thinking of."
"My dad has been taking Pramipexole ER for his Parkinsons and no problems. Rt before he went into the hospital she doubled the dose. He did not tolerate that well at all. It drugged him up, he started sleeping all day and was really out of it. So I stopped giving him the second pill. In a couple days he was himself again. but then he goes into the hospital. 

I cannot get reliable info from the hospital. I know after tonight that the doctor who runs his neuro office is officially his neurologist in the hospital. he wrote the hospital script for my dad for the newer double dosage. now my dad is doped up, sleeping all day and vaguely responsive. 

When I had talked to his office before they told me dad could try a different drug. So they didnt understand. they also told me there was nothing else they can do. 

I am going to calmly call them tomorrow and explain whats going on. Its not the drug he has issues with, its getting twice the dose. i will also send a certified letter to his doctor that saw him in the hospital and will know at least the office gets it.

Now, legally, what options do i have to get his dosage fixed. Tbh this may kill him. At the least it means he will end up in a nursing home sleeping all day. I am his son, have lived with him and taken care of him for 4 years, I have both POAs and I handle all his affairs, I take him to all his doc appts and go in. I also know how the neuro meds work. You start at a lower dose to see how the patient tolerates it. If they can then you up it a bit and if they cant you step back down. I need them to step back down before they kill him. If still no one will listen then I will find an elder law atty. Which I cant afford. But ill be damned if they kill my dad.

So we are in Texas, what options do I have?

btw-I went in to see him tonight, he was asleep, woke him up and fed him some dinner and he fell asleep halfway through."
"My father recently fell and broke some bones and underwent surgery; now he’s in a skilled nursing center.  Then my mother suddenly died.  So my brother and I are suddenly charged with being caregivers (monitoring/coordinating with the skilled nursing center).  My brother and I each live hundreds of miles from our father, and each other, so we’re coordinating who spends time with my father so that he’s covered.

We will be getting a 24/7 home health aide when my father comes home, which may be months away.

This is the scariest and most depressing thing I’ve ever faced in life.

Is being a caregiver of an aging parent always scary and depressing?

Thanks."
"I quit my job at the end of July so that I could assist my 74-year-old mother in caring for my 80 yr old father. He has end-stage multiple sclerosis and is in palliative care with hospice. He’s in a hospital bed and there’s a manual Hoyer lift that we use to get him in and out of bed and into his electric wheelchair every day, sometimes a couple times a day. The problem is, I have a bad back and have had spinal surgery. This coupled with the lifting, has put me on bed rest for the last week. I can’t afford to be sidelined and have my mother care for my father alone. The main issue is getting him into his wheelchair from the bed using the Hoyer lift and getting him seated properly. I find that I have to use all of my strength to lift him straight up, while my mother pushes his knees in, so that we can get him completely situated into the electric wheelchair. He has no muscle control except in his left arm so he is unable to help us position him. Of course our wonderful CNA and nurse from hospice help when they can, but they are not available every time my father would like to get up. His mind is still sharp and being stuck in the bed sends him spiraling. Does anyone out there have any tips, tricks, or advice on an easier way to move him from the hospital bed into the electric wheelchair without having to lift all of his weight to properly get him in position? Any help is appreciated. Thank you!"
"I cant afford to live in their house when eventually dad passes. My brother keeps telling me to keep it, but dont want to even if I did. Right now dads been in the hospital for a week. theres no way I could stay here even if I could afford it. Too many memories. I keep walking past his bedroom to check on him like always and hes of course not there. Too many memories. Just curious what others think?"
"What it looks like at present is that as soon as dads Insurance goes thru for the skilled nursing facility he will be transfered from the hospital. he is ONLY going for rehab and gain his strength so he can walk again. His normal is walking with a walker, standing up and getting on and off the toilet. Thats all he needs. I made it clear to the facility he's not staying. The lady explained what his Ins covered, up to 100 days but that most likely he wont be there that long.

Do we sign a contract and do i need to read it thoroughly. Can he leave when we decide no matter what the facility says? What im scared of is that they will try and keep him longer than needed or even permanently. they have a pharmacy they use that delivers drugs daily. Will insurance pay when we already have his meds? 

Should I notify his doctor and neurologist so they can send his medical records over? I dont like the idea of PT and docs and nurses having him with no idea of what he needs. PT at the hospital had him walk on his own. he only walks with a walker. If they want to do something get a damn walker and see how he is. Ive tried telling them but no one pays attention and can get to talk to a doctor

Hoping Ins processes Monday so he can get moved over and praying he will be well treated. 

thanks, just very apprehensive here."
"I havent seen any posts on Insurance problems. Up until yesterday I had wonderful experiences with dads. he is in hospital recovering from pneumonia. he got so weak he cant walk so he needs some rehab. Our preference which is a rehab hospital (3 hours a day rehab) was denied because there werent complex issues. lady at that facility said she thought he could get in so call and ask to do an fasttrack exception. I could plead his case. I called and even tho im on his ins as his advocate they wanted his verbal ok. I drive to the hospital and when I call back im told his ins doesnt cover that facility. he stayed there previously just fine. The lady at the facility says his ins covers it and the first guy I talked to at his ins said they covered it. So be it. 

So I call his caseworker and she says he can get into a skilled nursing facility (rehab 30mins a day) and ins covers it shes running it thru. lady from that facility calls me and says they should be transferring him this morning. no calls. I start calling around and

His Ins company closed before they finished his claim. they didnt stay to finish it even tho hes waiting. They are closed for the weekends. how does an Ins company close on weekends? 

So now hes stuck in the hospital and it will be Monday earliest. I dont like how they treat him, rather ignore him. I want him the fuck out of there. His Ins has been very good til now and this is amazing bad. Im beginning to wonder when he will be able to get trabsferred, if i could lift him id say fuck this and bring him home. but its harder to go to a facility from home than the hospital.  I dont like him in there, they dont take good care of him and I wont feel hes safe until hes out of there.

Anyway, Ins drops the ball and I hope he doesnt suffer from it."
"My shut-in widower father has made it clear when I’ve asked that he does NOT want any visitors other than his children. He doesn’t want couple friends (that he and my mother liked) to come over and he doesn’t want any visits from church members.  He says that having his grandchildren over is too much for him. He says that he’ll be lonely all by himself in a big house (but with a caregiver there, and his children visiting frequently).

He’s an introvert and he’s told me that he is concerned because he isn’t a good conversationalist and figures that he’d just sit there looking at a visitor.

Is it normal not to want ANY visitors other than your own children if you’re an elderly shut-in?  

If so, when people ask if they can visit, is it offensive to say that he isn’t up for visitors at this time but that the family would appreciate prayers?  

Maybe I’ll ask him if he wants quick phone calls from people?

Thanks."
"I didn't find anything yet in this sub that is close to what I'm experiencing with my dad. I've been living with them for the past 10 years (I'm late 40's), at first because it was financially helping me, but now they need the financial help so I've stayed. I noticed when I moved back that the toilet seat often has some feces smeared around the inner rim (usually the back, side, and sometimes front), sometimes outer rim. He is overweight, but doesn't seem to have issues with mobility and he still works (he's in a construction type field, and often works in other people's homes).

At first I said nothing and just cleaned it up, and for the past few years we have stocked bleach wipes/spray/paper towels in the bathroom so all of the supplies to clean up are there. Over the last few years I have mentioned the bathroom incidents and my mother does not want to talk about it, and my dad acts surprised (this is not actual surprise as this is a normal reaction he has, nothing is ever his fault). It's not uncommon now to find it on the wall (near the toilet paper), counter, in addition to the toilet, as if he had some on his hands and it transferred while getting off the toilet. The worst incident was when I stepped in a fully formed piece on the bathroom floor and found another - this time I brought it to his attention and he admitted it was his (in a ""oh that must have been me"") and he cleaned up the other piece (of course I went over his clean up job to be sure it was all gone). 

We have a bidet (toilet seat kind), and I find feces on the handle. I thought that if he had an issue with reaching well enough to wipe, this would help. Bringing it up to him does not help, as he views this as ""picking on him"". I have tried to explain the health impacts, and that other people use the bathroom besides him. Unrelated but he also will not cover his mouth when he coughs, or if he does it is with his hand and he will not wash his hands and will only use hand sanitizer if you ask (and this usually ends in an argument). We were able to get him to be a bit better about the cough/hand washing due to covid, however now that we are all vaxxed, he's fallen back into his old habits. He has a chronic cough that he isn't interested in resolving, so the coughing is all day long.

I don't think it's incontinence, as there are no accidents around the house, and I typically wash all the towels (not his clothes), and so far there has been no fecal matter found there. 

I am going to bring this up to my own doctor at my next visit in a month, but I am at my wits end trying to figure out why this is happening, and what I can do to help him. I don't accompany him to his doctor visits (and I don't think he would let me), he had diabetes, kidney failure and is on dialysis, so he does see a dr on a regular basis. I don't remember this ever being a problem when I was a child or a teen living with them. Dementia does run in his side of the family, but I'm not noticing any other signs that would make me think that this is it. 

Any advice, or tips for coping is greatly welcomed."
"Quick question about medication. my dad is supposed to be transfered to a skilled nursing facility for a few weeks of rehab. Am I supposed to bring his meds in? I dont think they have a Pharm there, its not big like a hospital.

I also wanted to know if they would try and give him any meds not prescribed by his doctor. We dont want them giving him anything else. And how do they decide what he gets...from what the hospital did? because they gave him the wrong version of one med. Or do i contact his doctor and neurologist to send his script info over? not sure how this is done.

I am very wary they may give him something that he has not been taking. he doesnt need anything not prescribed by his own doctor."
"My aging mother is into all kinds of conspiracy theories that she finds on Facebook. Unfortunately, it's also affecting her health and I'm concerned about what she's reading and looking online. She's also fallen victim to email scams. 

It's funny because parents are concerned about what their kids do online, but now the kids need to be concerned with what their parents are doing online. 

Unfortunately, she's paranoid about people monitoring her phone and computer, so I'm just not sure how to go about this. My goal would be to see what my mother is looking at and help guide her away from anything that affects her health and wellbeing. 

Is there anything I can do to monitor her activity? I realize this gets into the grey area and privacy concerns, but she's starting to endanger herself and my father with everything she's falling for online."
"Ok, a bit confused. My dad wears depends, they work very well, he doesnt get rashes and such. The hospital has him wearing a gown of course but said he cant use Depends because he will be sitting in pee and getting a rash. he's in a gown, sitting on two flat pads with a folded pad over his junk. How is this setup any better? Depends absorb the pee and pull it away from the skin until it saturates and overflows. Im just really really confused. Oh, and my dad now has a red rash."
"No idea if this is parkinsons or dementia related so posted here. dad 95 with PD dementia/alzh stroke survivor. was taking Pramipexole 1.5mg ER (extended release). year and a half ago he was taking reg Prami and got in a very bad way. neuro changed him to the ER and he retunred to his normal. He was in the ER monday with pneumonia. Caught it early so he kicked it but lost all strength in his legs and that day and the next he was cognitively bereft. for the past 2 days he has gotten so much better cognitively. 

They dont have Prami ER in the hospital so theyre giving him regular. his tremors get pretty bad. I know hes very unhappy and scared. We talk and I explained where he is and why and at lunch he udnerstood and is fine going to rehab for his legs for a few weeks. 

Tonight I went to visit about 6pm and he was different. Not rational. Kept talking about sneaking or running out of the hospital, he cant stand up let alone walk. His tremors were worse.

So im wondering if the change in his mind from lunch to dinner is sundowning? Maybe his Pramipexole is wearinf off?"
"I'm interested in learning new ways to respond to hostility which usually end up with:

* ""You're gonna be SO happy when I'm gone""

* Me: ""It's not like that, you are still alive, you have time to learn to try to treat me better."" (implied: ""We can still repair our relationship, but you're wasting your time."") 

* ""Bullshit. I don't want to talk about this."" * leaves * (default response)

We already lost a family member recently and wept really hard, there were regrets, why is this so hard to understand.

Has anyone else gone through this? What approach did/would you take?"
"Working on getting Dad into the Rehab Hospital he was in after his stroke. They said theyre waiting for the ok from Insurance. I taked to his caseworker and she said be aware he may not get in. I know. In case he doesnt she gave me a sheet with about two dozen skilled nursing facilities in the area. now im curious why she would not offer any other rehab hospitals but only skilled nursing facilities. 

Today he is still markedly improving after his pneuomonia. mentally good. he had a almost unnoticable speech inpediment from his Parkinsons before and not he stutters a bit and it is noticable. The big issue is he cant stand on his legs. he can move his legs and feet normally just not put weight on them. At 95 he fought off pneumonia, went two days without food and little water and was very weak. He looks better, sounds better, just need to get his legs back. I am trying to get him into the place he was in after his stroke 4 years ago, very good place. Still waiting. 

I had asked his caseworker the difference between a Rehab Hospital and a Skilled Nursing Facility and she said they both do rehab just that the Skilled Nursing facility was a slower process. 

I'm sure they vary quite a bit and just depends on each facility. Going through this rated list and Googling. Not that I can really see that way. Is there any way to really see if a facility is good?

Thanks"
Does anyone have any experience with their parent being in a rehabilitation facility after surgery? My fil broke his hip had surgery and contracted covid in the hospital. He is fully vaccinated and shows no symptoms. The original plan was that he would enter a rehab facility close to his home to regain mobility and independence. The only rehabilitation facility that will accept covid positive patients is beach gardens rehabilitation and nursing center far rockaway ny. He is there currently and he answers his cell phone occasionally but we have not been able to talk to a single staff member and he seems over medicated every time we talk. Our main concern is that there has been no communication from the staff the phone is never answered we’ve left voicemails for social workers the nurse station the admin team basically every option the call q gives us. He also told us he fell out of bed and had to have his knee screwed back on. He’s kind of a hoot and we can’t really take him seriously as he’s soo medicated but it’s really getting alarming. No one is allowed to visit him and I’m just not sure if this level of communication is normal as I’ve never dealt with one of these facilities before. Any advice is appreciated.
"As many of you know, I've been helping my mom with short-term memory loss / dementia.  My brother is here and is helping too.

My mother's voice is LOUD but she has this habit of talking to me - in a normal, conversational tone - AFTER I have left a room.  Especially if I go turn on a sink, do laundry, etc. It's like she waits until I leave to say something, just to get me to come back.  Almost like... she just wants me to come back into the room.

I get it.  I know that's what she wants.  But gosh darn it it's annoying :D

Wanted to let y'all know you're not alone because I am POSITIVE your parent / parents do this to you too.

Keep the faith y'all.  [Enjoy this little meme I made for you](https://i.imgflip.com/5o02zv.jpg) and have a great day."
"Hello Everyome, my Dad is 79 years old and is very active. He and my Mom (76) live together in their own home and are still independent in most respects (my mom takes on most of the responsibility in terms of bill pay, shopping, etc.). My Dad has been seeing a Neurologist and has memory loss. He has basic long term memory recall but does not remember recent things and has trouble with recall in general-I see them at least weekly and this has been more noticeable over the past several months (he has become quieter, looks to my Mom to answer, states a lot that he does not know). He is pending an MRI of his brain upcoming as ordered yesterday but I am curious to see if anyone has had any success with their parents in regard to medication for memory issues. As a nurse I understand no medicine will cure this or stop it. I had a lot of experience years ago with Aricept when I worked in a memory care unit but was not impressed with what I saw. Any advice, input is greatly appreciated....thank you in advance."
"havent been told for sure but thinking dad gets released from Hospital Friday. trying to get him into a rehab hospital but if that fails will have to take him home. As of today he cant stand. So Im wondering what devices people use to get someone around, on and off the toilet, in and out of bed etc? If at all possible I want him to be at home. he has parkinsons, suffers weakness and some balance issues. he went in to ER with aspiration pneumonia, didnt eat or drink two days til he cleared his swallow test. was better today but tired and sleepy. geesh hes getting over pneumonia. I just want to give him a chance before they want to shuffle him off to a nursing home, hell no. I will give him every opportunity to heal, get stronger and be able to use his walker again.

But in the meantimes may need the help of devices to say get him on and off a toilet and in and out of bed.

Thank you for any suggestions, this came on so suddenly and is threatening major catastrophe.

edit:thanks for all the responses, rehab hospital is working on it and hoping/praying he gets the ok tomorrow.  Imho the hospital isnt even trying to help him recover physically IE get his legs back. His neurologist was supposed to come look but hadnt as of yesterday. I get the very very strong impression they are selling me services, trying to push him into a nursing home. I want to make sure he at least has every chance to be able to stand and get on and off the toilet. Thats basically what he needs. Will hope for the best and i'll be damned if they try and force him into the system.

&#x200B;

edit2---here is what I think should be done. dad goes in for pneumonia, treat pneumonia. he hasnt eaten or drank for two days and is very weak and mentally lost. Day two hes beat the aspiration pneumonia but he cant walk as well. You feed and hydrate him, look at is there any other reason why he cant stand, and his brain fog. After two days his mental abilities are very much improved, but hes sundowning which he has never done. Look at the legs, as long as he is in there do whatever you can to bring him back to where he was before he got sick. yes he will need physical rehab but make sure the physical end is good. nerve damage? just weakness from pneumonia? 

Thats what im thinking. It will take some time but they have no idea or interest where their patient is as far as being well...because theyve never asked...No one ever asked, 'how was he like before he came in'. So they can have some idea what and where to work and have an idea how far is possible. Its their job to make people well. Priorities, life threaning first etc. If he goes to rehab and has say nerve damage or something rehab wont know. 

It just seems they let him sit and dont look into anything else, pneumonia is gone so lets get you to where we can push you out without being sued or anything. I see alot of missed opportunity. If theyre not going to do anything then he needs to go ahead and move to rehab, hopefully tomorrow. "
"I live 600 miles away from my father, who is now a widower and in poor health.  My brother lives far away as well, so we are getting a 24/7 home health aide/caregiver for my father.

Question: have you lived with an aging parent who has home health aide/caregiver, all in the same house?  If so, how well did it work?

It seems like an adult child, an aging parent and a home health aide, all in the same house, could be a bit much.  I also prefer not to be around too many people, with Covid concerns.  My father and I also haven’t been close.

However, it’s a 4,000 square foot house, my father won’t be around for a long time and I am single and can work remotely.

Thanks."
"My dad is second day removed from aspiration pneumonia, didnt eat or drink 2 days, was mentally out of it yesterday. This afternoon he was much better, he ate and is drinking and second day back on meds. he looked at me, was holding normal conversation, remembered me and my brother and his best friend. he was a bit off cause he asked if I was still driving north on my trip. But ill applaude the gain. 

His legs are deadweight. Doesnt surprise me since thats his weak point. They want to kick him out friday since his pneumonia is gone. 

his case worker is pushing him into a home or facility, pushing palliative care, he has parkinsons, no pain, no cancer or any dire disease. really dont see why he would need it. She also wants him to have a skilled nurse to come in. No idea what they would do. If dad needs help I do it. he has been getting up, potty  by himself, gets around on his walker. If he should need a lil spot I do it. 

She is telling me elders never recover after they get home, he wont regain his legs, and im telling her I will not setup anything the second day fter admission. She is looking at hos he is and projecting that as its as good as he gets. 

I refuse to do that to him. I will be realistic and what he needs he will get but I refuse to not let him try. he tells me he wants to go home. he will have every opportunity to regain his legs, and come home. I cant pick him up. Realistically i just cant. Even if hes in a wheelchair he has to be able to get on and off a potty.

Now, i talked to the lady at the rehab hospital I want dad in. he was there a few years ago and they were great.I expressed my concern to her about the social working trying to characterise dad as hopeless and sell services and push him into a home. lady said she gets alot of complaints about that. She wondered if that was a thing nowadays to try and push the elderly into a home.

by the way, I know gaslighting and this lady was laying it on thick. For ex telling me dad wouldnt be weak after not eating or drinking for two days. Utter bullshit. One day of little food and you can tell, pneumonia, no food or water and no meds? legs are the first to go and the last to come back. 

just wanted to share, be aware, dont assume you can trust anyone, ask questions, be assertive."
"My grandmother is turning 75, diabetic and currently lives alone, and has a good monthly income from social security and her pension. However, she has begun having difficulty remembering to pay her bills and is overspending more than she has. One of the worst is she spends some $1,200\~1,500 a month at grocery stores, buying a lot of excess food. She has a really low computer-literacy, financial-literacy, mobile app literacy. 

In the immediate short-term, I was thinking of switching her banking over to Dave Banking ([https://dave.com](https://dave.com)) because it allows automatic budgeting for bills, so that she can't spend away the money in her checking that she needs to pay her bills. And that way her available balance is the money she can ""consequence-free"" spend. I don't want to have the rights to manage her money for her because she has all sorts of debts I don't want to get attached to my own financial identity/responsibility.

Before I switch her accounts, I was really hoping to get any advice on this plan from others in the community, as well as any tips or guidance from your own personal experience with this. 

Any advice for me? I'd really really appreciate it 🙏"
"Not looking for help (though I will gladly read advice), just want to vent a little.

Last summer, we moved my MiL and her twin sister into our home after the sister called to say that MiL was exhibiting memory issues. I modified the house so the two extra bedrooms were a small suite before they moved in.

When they moved in, we talked to them about their health problems, mental issues, etc. We met with all their new doctors, and discussed how to manage various problems (Type II diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, Alzheimer's disease (MiL only, not the sister), hearing loss, etc.). We got them local Medicaid, food stamps, Meals on Wheels delivery, in-home caregiver, and told them we would help make meals that were appropriate for them (to help manage the diabetes).

They have fought us every step of the way, claiming the food we made wasn't what they needed (then buying M&Ms, graham crackers, fruit cups, and other sugary crap when the care-giver takes them to the store), finding excuses why they couldn't take short walks in the neighborhood (gravel drives didn't work with their walkers (even after I bought them sand wheel walkers)), and arguing with my wife about anything she wanted them to do, and telling their care-giver that we had installed cameras in their suite to watch them all the time (we hadn't, and haven't). Further, the twin sister claims she has all the same health problems as MiL (she doesn't).

Meanwhile, their health has gotten worse, and we can't take care of them (since they fight us, and we both work full time). So, we started looking for care facilities for them. Note that both of them are on SSI, SSA, and have no savings at all.

Facility 1 - Memory care facility: 

Agreed to take them both, as a couple, with a one-year spend down, but require a memory test at the facility. We take them to the facility, and twin sister passes the memory test with flying colors (because she doesn't have memory issues). The facility declines to take twin sister, but offers a bed at a facility controlled by the same company. We schedule appointment with their PCM to fill out the paperwork.

Okay, good. One week before they are to move in, the facilities call to say the twin can't come because neither facility has the nursing staff to supervise insulin injections (we discuss the diabetes during the initial phone call with every facility with which we speak). Bugger.

Discuss with care manager and PCM, who both recommend the sisters be placed in a skilled nursing facility.

Facility 2 - Skilled Nursing Facility near our home:

Facility agrees to take both sisters, but won't have space available until after ongoing renovations are complete, completion expected in one month. Straight to Medicaid, so no spend down. Good.

4 weeks later, facility calls to say they have decided not to take long term residents, only rehabilitation clients. Bugger.

Facility 3 - Skilled Nursing Facility near major hospital in the area:

Facility agrees to take both sisters, straight to Medicaid. Good.

1 week later, facility calls to say they can't take patients with OSA. Bugger.

Argh! I can't take care of these people! They don't listen, they won't do anything I need them to do. Every facility has some dumb reason the facility can't take them. It seems like care facilities only take healthy old people, the kind of people who don't need a care facility."
"Dad doc called me today to touch base. he is ok physically but mentally he was flying over StLouis (lifetime aviator). We're trying to discover why he has flown mentally. his neurologist is being called in, he missed his Pramipexole the day he went in. they wanted to do a swallow test before they let him drink or med. he went in for pneumonia and aspiration it turned out.

Day he went in he had lunch, went back to bed, didnt want dinner. I woke him 7ish for a half a sadnwich and he was out of it. Went back to sleep and as temp kept climbing they took him in. So, things I know:

Stress is bad for Parkinsons-transfer to gurney and hospital was stressful and im sure scary as hell

I must correct myself on the Pramipexole, he gets that rt after lunch, he was fine at lunch so he got his Prami, my apologies 

new environments are bad for dementia

tremors-when I saw him yesterday it wasnt so much his tremors were visibly worse...but when I tocuhed him it was like high tremors in his body, like turning up the oscillation to a higher frequency.

he seemed agitated, was always pulling on his blanket, moving his legs. like a trapped animal trying to get free. Several times he would open his mouth and tug his blanket like he wanted to lick it. He pretty much ignored me and didnt look at me while there. I think tbh that he doesnt know who I am. And I dont think he likes me at all. When he was in stroke rehab he was very responsive to the women. he was talking alot to his lady doctor.

All I can come up with is the onset of pneumonia and the shock of the ytransfer and being in the hospital. I wonder if it would help for him to be home. maybe he cant make that correlation tween being in the hospital which he doesnt understand, he just feels lost so hes making up his own world. 

I also wonder at how the Emts transfered him. No offence to em. They had the gurney pretty high, placed a sheet under him on the bed and basically threw him on it. Easier to just place the gurney at bed level next to him. get the sheet under him and lift two inches and move him a couple feet. 

Im thinking at this point he will need a care facility soon as he is physically ok. If he doesnt come around will need a care home as I cant watch him around the clock. No idea if that means selling all he owns or what. I do have both POAs so that may make it easier. Will see what comes the next few days and may need a consult with a elder care atty."
"EDIT: I’m not so concerned with moving as I am my mental ability to cope with thinking about my again parents. I just wanted to clarify that! I really appreciate everyone’s insight and opinions. Thank you so much!

I’m a 30 year old woman, moving from the west coast to the Midwest for a position where I was offered $17k more yearly and would further my career. My biological parents are divorced. My biological father (69) lives in the southwest with my stepmom (he has lived out of state since I was about 10 years old and I’ve only gotten to see him once a year since then). He has major health issues so I’ve always sort of had fear about being away from him specifically. My biological mom (68) is in the west and married to my stepfather (65).

I’ve been with my mom and my sister (24) my whole life. My mom is very much a helicopter parent and although she is happy I’m going to have such a great opportunity, I can tell she is not happy I’m moving. She even told me she doesn’t want me to go (not seriously but sadly).

I have really bad depression and anxiety, and a preoccupation with death, especially regarding my parents and family members because in my late 20’s my last biological grandparent passed away, and then last year my step-grandfather passed away. All of my stepfather’s siblings aren’t super close, so having Christmas together will no longer exist since the step-grandfather has passed. It’s funny how you don’t know what you’ve got until it’s gone. It never occurred to me that one day we all won’t be here for Christmas again, because our lives will take us different ways.

My sister moved out of my mom’s this month so now my mom is an empty-nester at almost 70, and I’m moving many states away. I wouldn’t say that they are in bad health, but I can tell that they are aging, and so am I, and it’s scared me so bad it’s all I can do not to sob myself to sleep every night.

I’m not sure how to get past this? I feel like I’ve been “in mourning” over myself aging and my parents aging, and chapters of my life are being closed and new ones are beginning. I’m excited for new chapters but terrified of others closing.

I am on medications and I see a psychiatrist (although I will have to find a new one when I move). I’ve been trying to work through it with her but it’s just sort of felt ongoing for years. How do I get past this so I can be happy I still have my parents without being so sad knowing they will someday pass?

Thank you everyone for any answers, I’m truly lost."
"Stressing over my dad. Walked out into the yard since its our first really cool Fall evening and stared at the moon, clothed in wispy clouds. Mother nature keeps going and is so beautiful. honestly, this world cares nothing for our lives. we live, struggle, rise and fall, maybe end in tragedy and are forgotten. All the anxiety serves no purpose. I am staring at the dissolution of my Life. So i think it best I stfu. Apologies for letting anxiety push me. I guess I always thought he would pass peacefully in the night in a couple years. Thought things would be alright til then. But there is no justice or inherent good in Life. life just is. I blew it and wasnt prepared. 

One piece of advice. love them while you can and take nothing for granted. Dont wait to do things, dont put them off thinking tragedy never comes. Its coming now. Steel your hearts and do whats needed.

peace"

"My 82 yr old father with a laundry list of health problems has been in the hospital going on 8 weeks. Back and forth from ICU to hospital. Many ups and downs, mostly downs. In the last few days he's in the ICU again, been intubated for the first time and is sedated. He has a pnemonia now and is on more meds to fix it. Every day I'm sitting here in the hospital with him because I feel like he should have someone but it doesn't seem like there is any way for him to bounce back from this. (He's got way too many health problems to list) but I basically feel like I'm sitting here waiting for him to die. I told him the other day if he doesn't want to fight anymore we will be ok. Today they are saying a ""slight"" improvement but still a ton of bad shit very wrong with him. I find myself trying to fast forward to his death which I know is imminent, but I just can't stand this slow waiting game of him laying here unresponsive. Every beep and boop of his monitor alarms I'm like ""is this it??!"" I know I sound like the grim reaper but I just wish he was out of his misery. Even if by some miracle he ""bounces back"" from this, he's gonna end up with another infection that takes him down in a matter of time. I feel terrible that I keep almost wishing for his death- but I know that's where this is headed and it's just brutal to watch him like this... Ugh sorry just wanted to vent and hoping you guys would be sympathetic."
"Dads in for aspiration pneumonia, 2nd time this year. lady calls me from hospital suggesting several things like a home nurse not covered by Insurance, like hospice...Dad doesnt need this stuff. As long as He can get up and down I can take care of him. I REALLY got the impression they were trying to sell me. I tbh dont see where dad needs their help at home yet. As long as im able to take care of him he will stay at home.  Im pissed as hell cause it seems the hospital gets this old man with swalloe issues from parkinsons  so they want to sell a package of goods."
"My dad(68) has dementia and has lived with me for 18 moths now, he doesn't use depends but it's becoming an increasingly more needed tool for him as he has accidents (all over the house) more often and then refuses to shower unless bribed. He's refused them every time I have tried to offer their usefulness. Any suggestions or plans of action would be appreciated. I understand he may still say no, I'm just struggling with cleaning up poop in my home on an almost daily basis."
"Waiting to check my dads temp again, up to 99.1. hes normally from 97.8 to 98.1. If its higher still im calling have him taken to the hospital. he had pneumonia in april, doc thought from aspirating food. He knows there are ways to eat that minimize the risk but he wont do it. Doesnt matter.

I am reminded that I cant fix him, make him safe, make him  better. I can do so little and see much that might help. But I cant make him do em. Cant make him listen. Doesnt matter at this point.

the weakness and fatigue is always there tho has its good and bad days. Today he is very weak and tired. Been sleeping all day. Nothing I can do.

Not trying to gain sympathy. Pray for my dad. Just thinking that we as humans tend to seek level ground. We want a safe place and hope it stays that way forever. life isnt that way. I hope and pray I go in there in a minute and dad at least hasnt had his temp gone up. I think it will be a long night tho.

Realise this life is beyond you. Hold your loved ones close, look in their eyes and tell them you love them. All you have really is this moment. and tomorrow may bring some really unpleasant things.

take good care of yourselves.

&#x200B;

going to type this as a focus so I dont cry, dads temp went to 99.8 and he was real out of it so they just took him to the hospital. hate him being in there, dont trust docs or hospitals or nurses. the nurses didnt take good care of him last time. God help him."
"My father lives in North Carolina with no family or friends around. I live in Ohio.  He is laying on the guilt trip, saying my husband and I should quit our jobs, sell our house and move to take care if him.  He won’t move here because it’s too cold.  

I think this is selfish.  Am I unreasonable?"
"Hi everyone! 

This is my first reddit post so I hope I have not broken any rules or written anything offensive/incorrectly. If I have please let me know :) 

My mum (62) has been struggling with her health and her long list of chronic health morbidities for many years now, and I worry she may never get better to live a life that is fulfilling and meaningful.

My mum is an immigrant parent to my brother and I (24). She has worked tirelessly throughout her life to raise the two of us and to give us the best opportunities possible at the expense of her health. She suffers from an extensive list of medical conditions and is a very complex patient for many specialists to treat. Some of her conditions have included acute renal failure, spinal stenosis, bilateral lymphoedema, periorbital/facial edema, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, rheumatoid arthristis etc the list goes on. 

My brother and I have been her primary carers, and have taken the leadership in managing her health, navigating her through the complex medical system as she does not have the strength, energy, education and determination to do it herself.

But I am here now more exhausted and worried than ever before. I feel an immense sense of responsibility towards my mum's health and feel I have failed her in every way. Her conditions have continued to persist and have significantly affected her quality of life. She can't mobilise herself independently, she can't freely go outside/do the shopping, and even simple tasks she loves doing, like cooking us a meal, is now incredibly difficult for her.

This has also taken a toll on me as well. I find it very hard to fall asleep as I am constantly worried and filled with a flurry of thoughts (it is currently 3.30 in the morning as I write this post). And I feel terrible about leaving my mum at home when I go out or go to work. I feel there is no one I can really turn to. Sharing these struggles would be a huge burden to the others around me.

I decided to post because I honestly feel trapped and hopeless. I hope there are members within this community that can empathise with what I am going through, or maybe others can find counsel in reading my post.

I apologise for this really long post and what seems like a selfish spiel. I really hope you are all doing well and are looking after yourselves."
"My mother died yesterday after a week in (in-hospital) hospice care. She made it to 86 and had lots of good years, including many at the end, and she lived life her way, so I am sad, but I don't feel she was shortchanged (nor was her family, really, though she will be missed). 

I wanted to share some ideas and thoughts with anyone with older parents. Nothing revolutionary, but sometimes we just need to hear things more than once, right?

* **There is no ""right"" place to die**. We know Mom wanted to die at home. We wanted that, too, and tried to make it happen. However, when the time came, she was in so much agony, it wasn't feasible to manage her pain at home. It also progressed fast, so there was no time to get her home and get care set up. Having the nurses in the hospital with painkillers when the pain broke through was huge. We had another close relative die at home recently, and his last week was a living hell for him and his family. His wife still regrets it. Dying at home can work, but it's not a failure if you can't make it happen. Mom had her kids around her in shifts that last week and was in a quiet, private room at the hospital with good nursing care and strong IV painkillers. (COVID comes into play here, too--trying to find in-home medical care in the US right now is near impossible.)
* **Have the hard conversations**. Mom was always super-clear about how she wanted to be interred after death, to the point it was a little morbid, but it helped to know! And my sister and I pushed through a conversation last year with her and her husband about their finances, insurance, wishes, plans, etc. It was uncomfortable and Mom and her husband got touchy a couple of times, but we were persistent. We took careful notes. (My sister discovered she was an executor at this point as well as medical POA, so she wasn't surprised by it this month like she would have been otherwise!) I also had a conversation with her about ""what is your minimum quality of life"" two years ago over a glass of wine (see book recs below), and she had a clear answer. Once she hit that point, and the doctors were suggesting surgery, it was so much easier for us to side with her and say no. One of the last things she said to me before she fell unconscious was ""no surgery."" So her kids were all in agreement and supported her. When it was time to find her legal documents, we knew where they were and we knew what was in them. (If you want a list of questions to ask, DM me and I'll see how to share them.)
* **Book recs**. If you are interested in more end-of-life perspective for yourself and elderly relatives, here are the two books I read that really, really helped: Being Mortal by Atul Gawande (about EOL care in the US, but also covers general quality of life considerations) and The Art of Dying Well by Katy Butler. The second one is great to read if you're middle-aged and want to start making choices to make your EOL better. That said--
* **You can do everything right and still have a difficult ending**. I believe this message was in the Katy Butler book (above), and it's important. Cancer and post-cancer symptoms got Mom in her 80s, but up until then, she was thin, fit, ate well, no smoking, etc. Death just ain't pretty. Mom looked cadaverous, and the changes in her breathing were distressing to watch over the final days. (""We call this guppy breathing,"" the hospice doc said. Okay.) When the pain broke through, she was unconscious but still moaning in pain, which was also just ... you know.  Real fucking hard. But death is part of life, and I think we do ourselves a disservice by not being exposed to it until it's someone dear to us. The books above and my experience with our other relative helped, but it's still my mom. Accepting the ugliness of it is part of life and it's not someone's fault, I guess I would say.

Thanks for reading. Hoping for acceptable outcomes for you and your family."
"I need a WFH job that would allow me to bounce at a moment’s notice (so, not like customer service or ESL teaching, which require set hours at a phone or computer). 

Something project or outcomes based that would allow me to work whenever would be ideal. 

I have experience in editing, but it’s old. I suppose I could learn to code, but I don’t have uninterrupted time to learn. Not sure my brain works that way anymore tbh, or at least not at the moment. These days I do more nurse-y, putting out fires sort of thinking.

I have a BA in a social science and sort of generalist office experience (everything from database design to communications, not a specialist in anything,  unfortunately). 

I feel like I could do sales… would it be doable on a WFH/flex/part time basis? 40sF (I look younger)."
"Looking for suggestions.

My father, who lives 1000 miles away, does NOT EVER want to go to a retirement/nursing home. He has made that abundantly clear. He just had triple bypass surgery and is on a lot of medications. He is starting to show signs of cognitive decline. He has been asked by medical professionals about his living situation and whether he has family that can take care of him if things take a turn for the worse (he doesn't--there is no immediate family within 600 miles). 

He gets around just fine now, but since my divorce and the passing of my mother 4 years ago, he has been trying to get me to agree to let him move in with me and my two daughters. I am in a position where it would actually make my life financially easier--I wouldn't have to stress about getting a low-wage job and still take care of my kids--however, the house we are in now isn't suitable for an aging person (lots of stairs), and my father and I simply do not get along. I need to find a decent job, take care of my kids, and build a better life for myself. Plus, I would like to have a relationship with someone before I'm 80, and I don't think that is feasible if I have my dad living with me.

He does not have money to receive in-home care. I cannot pay for in-home care for him because I do not have money. I do not know what other resources are out there for someone in his position.

What are other people doing in this situation?"
"Hey all, hoping for some advice here. My 80 year old father, in decent physical health, has had progressively worsening memory loss over the last few years.

It hasn’t been anything extraordinary, just silly things here and there that one might expect for someone of his age. 

Within the last two weeks there have been some concerning situations: 1) we were having family dinner at a relatives house (he had been there a hundred of times over the last 10-15 years) and two weeks ago he goes to the wrong condo, walks up to the door and asks for our relative. Wrong house. 2) he walks daily for exercise and always texts me when he has finished his walk. The other day he texted around 2pm like normal to say he had walked that day and then at 830 at night he sent another message saying he almost forgot to walk that day and just got back from it. 

He has anxiety (mind won’t wind down) and I believe a touch of depression. I don’t know how to carefully broach the idea that he should be examined by gerontologist (to see if this is normal aging or god forbid, something worse), without sending his anxiety/and or depression soaring. 

Additional factors: he has NEVER slept well (I think anxiety is a big part) and has sleep apnea but won’t use his cpap machine. Also, his awful doc has prescribed him sleeping pills for years, which as far as I know, shouldn’t be used long term and have known side effects like memory loss. 

This is all killing me. I don’t know how to deal with starting this convo, and if I’m being honest, I’m scared to death of the outcome of what such an exam might show. 

Any suggestions would be so appreciated!"
"Some Background: My Father in Law is 85 and went through a slew of health issues last year that resulted in him living with us for the majority of last year and then eventually moving into an Assisted Living Facility. While my husband was raised by a single mother, he has always had a really good relationship with his father (best friends). My FIL has always been really positive, upbeat, and overall a joy to be around. At the time of his hospitalization, we lived about 1.5 hours away from him and after release from the hospital brought him to live with us. During the time we noticed a complete change in his personality-- he is no longer the fun, positive, upbeat person that he once was. He does not seem to want to spend any time with family, and wanted to spend his days alone in his room, talking on the phone to his friend Don. While we had heard mention of Don before, this was not a friend who was known to us, and it was presented that he had met Don through one of his longtime friends Dave, who my husband has known since he was a little boy. My husband has so many stories of his dad and Dave, and all the nice things that Dave has done for him and his family over the years as my FIL was friends with Dave for 40+ years.

At first we thought that since it was such a big change that perhaps my FIL was just depressed about having to lose his independence (his car), and move to another city to live with us and that with time things would go back to normal. However, as time went on we started to notice some really concerning things about my FILs relationship to Don:

1. FIL calls Don at least twice a day, every single day without fail. Once in the morning as soon as he has woken up, sometimes several times throughout the day, and another time in the evening. Yet Don has NEVER called him (and trust me I went through an entire years call log and all calls are outgoing by my FIL).
2. The things discussed on the phone are always inappropriate or negative. They are either complaining about things, making derogatory/racist statements, or sometimes even talking about scary things like sexually harassing/coercing waitresses at their favorite restaurants.
3. My Father in Law will not interact with any of his other friends anymore:
   1. He made statements that they are not good friends because they do not reach out to him. When asked if he has reached out to them, he states that he has not and that they should be the ones to do it. After looking up his friends online, several of them have died years ago and he didnt even know because he hasnt been reaching out to them. As previously mentioned my FIL only calls Don and Don never calls him so this is odd that the feels like his other friends should call him when Don doesnt even do that.
   2. A woman hes been seeing for many years, and the only person who did ever call him, went into hospice and when asked if he would like to go visit her before her passing he said ""No, she wasnt really my girlfriend anyways"" and looked at me like I was insane for suggesting it. She died two days later.
   3. Every time he talks about Dave he has nothing but negative things to say about him. If Don mentions him (because remember Dave the mutual friend is how they met) my FIL becomes very angry making derogatory statements about Dave and his personality. Almost like jealousy-- like my FIL cannot stand the fact that Don has other friends.
   4. My FILs relationship with my husband is practically non-existent. When living with us (and since) he was no longer interested in participating in Family events, coming out of his room to interact with us, etc. We could hear him on the phone in his room with Don talking about how much he hates living with us and how terrible we are. We tried to get him out of the house for a weekend fishing trip and he wouldnt even come out of his cabin room to fish, an activity he used to love doing-- just stayed in there all day trying to call Don on the phone.

Throughout the pandemic, he was saddened that he could not go into restaurants, shops, etc. and we thought this may be part of his problem. Since clearly my FIL wasnt happy, we actually ended up making the decision to move back to the city where he lived before and set him up in a very nice assisted living facility. The facility is located about 20 miles from Dons house and we felt that perhaps the freedom of living on his own again would help alleviate his stress and correct the isolation issues. However since being in assisted living it seems that the isolation has only continued. Since the release of the vaccine, the Assisted living facility has opened their doors so that residents and family are free to come and go as they please, but my FIL still only want to interact with Don.

1. For his birthday we visited, brought him a bunch of gifts, balloons, a cake, and spent the afternoon with him. From our perspective it was really nice to see him settled into his new apartment looking much better. As we went to leave we could hear him on the phone with Don though, telling him about how awful it was that we had shown up late (we didnt show up late-- we had to have a negative COVID test in the lobby before we were allowed into his room so it took some time to get the results and we explained that to him) and what a miserable time it was visiting with us. His exact quote as we were walking away was ""I cant stand being around them"".
2. The Assisted Living Facility puts on events where they take the residents to places but my FIL refuses to go.  Museum trip: ""maybe Don can pick me up sometimes so we can do together"", restaurants: ""I'd rather just go with Don sometime"", grocery store: ""I'll just have Don take me at some point"".

Obviously its good that my FIL has a friend and we are both happy for him, however this relationship is hindering our ability to connect with him and we are slightly worried. He makes statements about the other residents that they are ""beneath him"", ""not on my level"", ""old enough to be \[his\] grandma"". He claims that they are all disgusting zombies and that he cannot hold a conversation with them as they are all just too old and feeble-minded. The thing is though, he's not in a nursing home or a memory care center, its a retirement community with nurses on staff. These are just regular old everyday elderly people that are able bodied and perfectly capable of having conversations (We met a lot of them on move in day and they are YOUNGER than him and perfectly pleasant to be around). Some of them drive cars and own pets, yet he claims that he doesn't belong and cannot possibly interact with them. We really hoped that after 9 months of living there, he would have made some other friends and not be so reliant upon Don, but he seems to have no interest in doing so. While ultimately the friendship does not appear healthy by any means, we're still fearful that if something were to happen to Don or the friendship my FIL would be so lost that his health could take a turn. Are we being overprotective and worrying ourselves over nothing or do you think we have a legitimate reason for concern? Anyways, thanks for listening to this long-winded scenario, I appreciate this community so much."
"All the websites I find offer living arrangements that either seem not like the right fit or downright way too expensive. Are there brokers who aren't associated with specific property management companies, who will help place your parents in the right arrangement, sort of like AAA travel but for senior living.

My mom doesn't need much care, but needs certain services because she can't drive and is technologically illiterate. She needs a building superintendent who would be willing to help her with some lifting around the house, but she's still able to get up on a step ladder to change a light bulb. Ideally an apartment or small condo with lots of community options would be ideal. She's very social.

She's not I'll but she's completely addled. Years on anti anxiety, anti depressant, sleep aids, and focus aids, have left her brain pretty fried. She passes cognitive tests but her memory and focus and attention span are completely shot.

She's soon to be 71. Her mother killed herself because of depression, anxiety, and a bad cocktail of medication at 74. I'd really like to help my mom find a situation that makes her feel comfortable."
"Hi all, I just wrote a post that was a scattered mess so I'm trying again. I'm not asking for a diagnosis of course, just whether what I'm experiencing makes sense in the context of dementia or Alzheimer's or not.

Some background/what made me realise my mum has a problem:

A few weeks ago on a Friday morning, my mother (64f) ran over her dog. She didn't think the dog needed to see a vet despite her having serious gravel rash and a visibly injured leg, so she spent the day at home (maybe six hours) then left for a weekend holiday. I (32f) was meant to housesit on a different day but she gave me the wrong date four times and then demanded I come and do it even though I was busy. When I got there I found the dog. The vet was closed by then and no vet nearby was open Saturday so my bf (34m) and I drove 200km to get her treated, and when I got there mum texted me forbidding any x-rays. My children (14m, 11nb) saw it all and were mortified. I tried to explain to her that she doesn't understand the gravity of the situation, and she said ""why couldn't you just deal with it and tell me enjoy my holiday?"" When she got home on the Sunday, mum realised she was wrong. By Monday, the dog was in pain again despite the pain meds she was being given. Mum took her to the local vet and the dog ended up losing the leg.

This is the incident that made me realise that something is not right with my mother. I understand this could be explained by Alzheimer's, but obviously isn't definitive. I should add that she and this dog are attached at the hip, it's not that she's ordinarily neglectful or doesn't care about her. 

What I don't understand is whether her cruelty towards me is potentially a symptom or if it's just who she is. She's returned to behaviour she used to engage in and had apologized for and stopped doing. 

Besides calling me selfish (something she often does) while I was trying to explain what was going on with the dog she told me to f*** off. Today she reaffirmed that she was completely right to say that because I ""sent a long text message"" and she ""doesn't like to text"", even though I said I'd call her at the vet and she's the one who texted me. My kids tell me they witnessed a heartfelt apology to the dog if that matters.

I don't know if her telling my kids that I don't love them is illness or lucid cruelty when she used to tell me the same thing about my other family members (especially my bio dad). I don't know if her disinviting me to her birthday lunch then telling my kids I refused to come is illness or meanness. It's mostly because these aren't completely unusual out of character behaviours from her, but they're a lot worse now. We go through phases where we can get along and then she does something incomprehensibly selfish and we don't talk again for a while. Reasons like this:

Eg she received a large inheritance and offered to pay for me to get my teeth fixed, changed her mind after I booked a consult and spent the money on new kitchen drawer faces, and was sure to tell me all about them. I know it wasn't my money but I didn't ask, she offered then took it away for no discernible reason. The issue isn't the money but the offering and then changing her mind.

Eg. I wanted to buy a piece of furniture and she offered to drive her ute up to haul it. She told me to confirm the time with the seller on Facebook, and then when I told her I had, changed her mind and refused. No explanation given. Again, I didn't ask her to do it, she offered.

Eg. She told me she was ""deeply hurt"" that I only bought her a box of chocolates for Xmas. She bought me nothing (and she knows I'm a disabled student and she has a lot more money than I do. Her not buying me anything isn't unusual but it's the double standard that's really, really odd)

Eg. She ridiculed me for asking for a loan saying I'm old enough to take care of myself even though I financially supported her for five years when she was much older than I am now (but still working age and not disabled or anything)

But she does extremely kind things too, like offering her ute so I could move a bookcase then helping me pick it up and get it inside, finding a cheap secondhand sofa and buying it for me, giving me the bed in the spare room when my frame broke (I didn't even ask, she just offered). When I was in a bad way last year she gave me money for groceries on several different occasions. So she isn't always horrible, sometimes she's incredibly kind and sometimes she's horrible to me. 

I thought she was just strange but regardless of her mixed feelings for me, she did (does?) love that dog. Were it not for that I'd assume she just periodically hates me. There are other symptoms though; she's become a terrible driver, she used to be a really discerning and critical thinker and now she believes basically anything, she mixes up dates all the time and forgets things etc.

An example of past weird rather than mean behaviour: maybe five years ago she was showing me some tea towels she had bought, then when I visited a few weeks later she said she couldn't find them and asked me if I'd stolen them (I have no history of theft or interest in tea towels). Why would she think I'd steal a tea towel? Why would anyone?

Could Alzheimer's, or really any age related brain issue, make her mean like this? Could it make her revert back to past mean behaviour she had stopped doing? Can I reasonably dismiss this as a problem with her mind or is this kind of behaviour just personality? Could she have had some issue like this for several years? The woman at the helpline said intelligent people sometimes fly under the radar because they can use their intelligence to compensate for their symptoms. 

Apologies if this is all over the place. If you got to the end, thanks for reading."
"My brother and his family invited our aging and not-so-mobile parent to live with them.
Its been ~6mos and my brother and parent do not get along. They both are stubborn and have regressed. My brother has regressed in dealings with with our parent. And our parent has regressed most with him but also with everyone else.
...Or was our parent always like this? They never had a close relationship, maybe it always wasnt great. Either way they both are not good at interacting with each other. 
Ive raised this problem to both of them, but this is something for them to talk out right? 
I mean, I dont live there. I just see them maybe every weekend. How does either of them (preferably both) just snap out of it and treat each other with more patience and understanding? 
Is it too late because maybe they never really did?"
"My father is now a widower (suddenly) and lives for now in a skilled nursing complex near his home.  He is recovering from a bad fall and should be home in a few weeks.

I’ve been visiting him twice a day, for probably 5-6 hours a day total.  I live 600 miles away and will need to be in my home some of the time, but I can work remotely and live in my father’s house and thus be nearby some of the time.

If you lived near a parent in my father’s situation, how often would you visit him?  Once a day for an hour, or more?

If you lived 600 miles away but could work remotely, how much time would you spend living near a parent in my father’s situation (if housing were free) and how often would you visit?

I would figure “as much time as possible” but my brother is in a similar position as me and has been visiting our father 30 minutes a day.  He loves my father as much as I do, though.

Thanks."
"I just got Philips Alert Care for my mom. The first call, we could barely hear the operator and she had to call my cell phone. She said to push the alert button on the system in 2 hours to try to setup again. It’s been 30 minutes and no one has picked up the call. Is this common? How long should one expect to get ahold of an operator after pushing the alert button? I can’t imagine if my mom truly needed help she’d have to wait 30 minutes. Any advice/insight would be helpful. Thanks!"
"just a couple rambling thoughts. Things I finally learned about Life:

Slow down...some things in Life you are given but most you create. You dont have to cram every minute full. Life is as much about time between events as the events themselves. give yourself the time to savour people and things. Try and relax, breath and enjoy the little things. 

Slow down 2...its not all about the big, loud, flashy stuff. Its more so about the little things. take the time to hug the people you love. make time for them, make it. next time you walk out your door look up at the clouds and find shapes, watch them float across the sky. 

The most important things in Life have nothing to do with wealth and power. Its people and time. love is not only the most powerful thing in the universe it also takes time and effort. Learn how to communicate to those you love. Like a garden, water and fertilize them with time, attention and caring.

Joy is to be found in the hearts of those you touch. The joy you find in material things is temporary and hollow. You will one day leave all of it in the grave. Love knows no boundaries.

Become...our society seldom teaches wisdom or development. So many are fast tracked, preplanned to life. Go to college, get a good job, get married, have kids. Some dreams are better and many worse. HOW is this wonderful? The 'dream' doesnt develop you as a human being, doesnt teach you about life, love, happiness. You're supposed to be a good little consumer and follow the beehive.

NO!

You have to take the initiative, you have to dig...because we dont value wisdom and personal study...we no longer value the experience and wisdom that comes with age. Thats greatly why we are so messed up as a society today. 

You must go on your own and find truth. College and school may not teach you but you have to learn how to ask the good questions, research for answers, then decide which are the truer ones. Come to conclusions. But THINK FOR YOURSELF. We have a society where a large part just follows directives and doesnt use their brain.

Think about your future, plan. Ask questions, make some noise. What you do now will greatly affect you 5 and 10 years from now. 

You change...how you are now isnt how you will be a few years from now and certainly not ten or twenty years from now. You can help direct thses changes. If you dont like how you are then change it. takes time but its so worth it.

Ever wonder why your grandparents love spending time with family? because they understand, they get it. Kids are so full of energy and its go go go. They cant help it, theyre blinded by it. but when you get past that you start to see some truth.

Alright, have to go fix lunch. For all the Grandparents who may read this, love you all. I think you understand Life better than anyone. It took me a long time and im still dumb on alot of stuff.

take good care"

This is likely the final update for a while.

I've spent the last week getting finances and house in order.  There's a lot of maintenance that just wasn't getting done.  There's more to come but I fee that it's well in hand now.

Thursday we went to see her doc, who confirmed short-term memory loss via the ""mini-comp"" test.  We had a long discussion about her ability to manage the house and chores by herself.  I should note she has NOT tried to drive since I've been here - and when the doc asked if she was driving she said ""no.""  I've not formally taken the keys because I don't think I need to yet, but it's looming.  

When I got home I contracted with an [elder care management](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/what-geriatric-care-manager) firm in my area.  I've already talked to the RN who will be assigned to us - she sounds great.  We will first meet with her on Tuesday.  I've kept my mom informed at every step of this process because it is FOR HER and I want her to understand we want to come up with a plan - with an expert - that will be what she needs.

Mom was scared, hurt and confused.  She says she feels ""foggy"" and like she's losing herself.  She's still sharp as heck (we do word jumbles together and watch Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune) and she does great on those!  On the flip side, this morning she couldn't disarm the house alarm, which has had the same code for 30 years.

She knows her short-term memory is going and it is clearly distressing but in general her mood seems ok.  She has twice said she'd have preferred to die (both times I have disarmed that conversation with gentle humor).

Once she told me she's ""sorry I'm doing this to you.""  I said ""Mom, you're not doing anything TO ME.  This is something that is **happening to you** and neither of us would have chosen this""

I brushed the hell out of her mostly-outside cat and got some mats out of his fur, fortunately he loves being brushed.  Will take him to the vet ASAP because I want him to be around for her and he's a good kitty.  I washed all the covers for his bedding last night, and today I'll be cleaning straightening his stuff so he has a secure, warm and dry spots to eat and sleep.

Thank you ALL again for your help and support."
"What to do about relatives that live near and far that want to play doctor with my mom? I am medical and durable poa for mom who is on skilled care for rehab after surgery. She has made good progress over the past 10 days. I am very proud of her! 

I get calls in the middle of the night (think 2 or 3am) from aunts and uncles (her siblings) that live in the same time zone as me blowing up my phone saying your mom hasn't pooped for 3 days what are you doing about it. Another call stating therapy says that she's not doing as well as she should. That is absolutely incorrect as I spoke with therapy the earlier that same day and she's doing great. They are quick to blame me for shit that goes wrong. I had a a huge argument with my uncle at 2am because he kept asking me if she should go to the hospital because she's nauseated and hasn't pooped (they gave her a laxative). I am not a damn doc or nurse, skilled care should make that decision as they are with her right now. 

I know they care but I'm putting them on do not disturb at night so I can get some peace. I'm my mother's only caregiver, the one brother that lives close doesn't really offer care or any help at all, he just wants to dictate how I run my mother's life. He is very controlling with people in general. The other family that lives 6 hours away are easier to reason with but they can't offer real support as their 6 hours away. 

I'm just so frustrated that I am forced to push family away for my own sanity. Sorry for the rant."
"My mother’s funeral was today.  Her church (where I grew up) went above and beyond in providing a wonderful funeral, with lunch beforehand for family and visitation afterwards, with refreshments.  Plus the church recorded the service.

My parents probably didn’t donate heavily to the church.

How should my brother and I thank the church?  Thank you notes, plus a generous donation (we can afford that)?  Or something else?

Thanks."
"Hey, 

I see you, hiding in your parent's bathroom on a Friday night, trying to grab 3.5 minutes of sanity, while hoping no one falls. 

I see you, stealing glances at the neighbor's yard party. You're not just the designated driver anymore. You're tripsitting a drunk toddler, All day every day. 

I see you, begging forgiveness from a higher power for being frustrated. For having been short with your loved one. The guilt is the hardest thing. 

I see you, how hard you're working, and how hard the situation is. Hang on. Do a tiny nice thing for yourself, even if it's just turning off the phone for 15 minutes and listening to the quiet. 

I can't fix it, or I would, for me and for everyone else. I know you would, too. Sometimes the best thing we can do is be a compassionate witness.

And so, I see you. 💙

Edit: You all are amazing, and you made me feel seen too 🤜🤛 keep on keeping on"
"Here’s my situation.  My #1 goal is to ensure that my father is cared for and happy.  I’d appreciate any tips on what you’d do in this case:

1. Family is now me and my brother.  I’m single, and he has a wife and kids.  We each live in different cities 3 hours away by plane from our hometown.

2.  Our mother just suddenly passed away.

3.  Our father is in a skilled nursing center in our hometown, recovering from a broken hip in a fall.  He expects to be able to go home in a few weeks.  He’s in very poor health and says how lonely he will be.  Even earlier this year, before our mother passed away, my brother mentioned that our father won’t be around for more than a year or two.

4. In a few weeks, he’ll be home.  By himself.  He is not interested in moving to be near me and is iffy about moving to near my brother.

5.  My brother and I are getting a 24-hour caregiver for him for when he gets home.

6.  I plan to come down frequently and can probably even work remotely from father’s house for days on end.

7.  Father has few true friends; they’re all my mother’s friends.  Mostly from church.

So, apart from getting a 24-hour caregiver, visiting regularly for long periods and having friends come visit, how would you help ensure that my father is OK?

I did not show my mother the love and respect that I should have and I seriously want to just die due to the regrets and this current situation.  I am determined to honor my father as the Bible tells us to.

Thanks."
"My dad (87) is in the final stage of a cardiac condition. He was hospitalized last month and returned his home severely weak (to the point of needing blood transfers periodically). My sisters and I mounted like a custom geriatric, with assistants and our dedicated focus (although living apart). 
He raves heavily and most of the time is severely confused. I decided that he (the man i knew) is not more present and that helps me to travwrse these days. Anyhow, the other day I passes quickly by the house and didnt pay him much attention. When i left i realized that maybe, in that moment, he seemed to be ""connected"". It broked my heart to think that he is ""still here"" and he felt my unloving presence. 
It's very difficult to live this moment."
"*TL;DR - The chat function on the iPad when using Zoom is broken for hard of hearing seniors who are bad with technology, and needs to be reworked.*
 
Hi all, I’m the admin and host of my family Zoom calls which we have once a week mainly to benefit my grandmother, who’s in her 90s and in an assisted living facility. Like many others her age, she’s clueless about technology, so the staff there set her up with an iPad to talk to us once a week, which is nice. The bad thing is they give her 0 help after setting it up, she’s on her own after that.

We have about 8 people on average every week on the calls, and it’s just hard for her. She’s lost a lot of her hearing so I got a Zoom Pro membership just to use the closed captions. The live captions are pretty inaccurate, but they do help some.

But I recently decided to just assign myself to type captions, when I sense she isn’t following us. However this is often distracting for the others on the call. 
Really I just wish I could use the chat function to do this with her directly.

But that’s the main problem here: 

Zoom’s chat feature on the iPad is simply horrible for accessibility purposes. On the iPad, similar to the iPhone, the chat box doesn’t open automatically, and she won’t notice that there’s a chat waiting for her most of the time. She doesn’t get she has to press the “more” button to open the chat box, and no one at the facility has the time to help. To make things worse, when someone does open it for her, the box takes up the middle of the screen, blocks everyone’s faces, and won’t budge from that location until closed, either. 

So since chatting with her that way is impossible, I have to do it using the caption system instead. The flaw with that is that there’s no way to do it privately, others can peek as long as they wish, it’s just not an efficient replacement for actual private chat.

Do people understand what I’m getting at here? I’ve looked at third party CC services like otter.AI and Rev, they can’t fix this issue, not sure what to try next…

For anyone confused, check out the video I’m about to link. Whoever dreamed up this design for Zoom chat on the iPad is no pal of mine. On the iPhone, I totally get it, there’s no room for a chat box on the side. Not so with the iPad though.

"Hi all,

We were looking into getting an Apple watch for my mother. She occasionally falls, loses her phone or forgets it places. My father has significant hearing loss and they live in a large, multi-floor farmhouse (I know, I know, they won't leave until someone has an accident) on a large property. 

Money is not an issue, so we were thinking about getting a stand-alone one so she'll have it available even when her physical phone isn't.

I have no experience with Apple wearables so I'm not sure if this is a feasible plan. Anyone with experience want to weigh in? Is it a complicated device or relatively intuitive? is the screen large enough to see to be able to answer the phone (she doesn't do much texting anymore)?

Thanks for your help!

Update edit: she loves it! I took off every app I could except phone, text, fall detection etc.. Still trying to get her to wear it at night and in the shower but she’s answered every time someone’s called, which is huge! We continue to practice calling people using Siri voice but I’m so happy she understands how it improves her life! 

She’s an artist so we had a fun afternoon picking out her favorite art to display."
"So today I went to Costco and the amount of ""stuff"" I brought home (toilet paper, paper towels, napkins, and tissues) was pretty overwhelming to her.  I found a place to store everything but she felt I was doing too much (she was out of everything).

The real ""bridge too far"" was that I bought towels.  I should point out that I'm 50 and I think every towel in the house is my age or older.  Who doesn't like nice fluffy white towels?  Someone who feels like linens and laundry are HER domain, that's who.  They're still in the trunk.  I considered telling her they're MY towels but I could tell she was a little upset so I just backed off.

As a complete aside, I'm still finding tons of stuff in the house that needs fixing and remediating that.  Those of you following the saga will be happy to know the basement dehumidifiers are 100% squared away ;)

Today it was the p-trap under the guest bathroom sink - it had completely rusted out!  So I went to home depot to buy parts, and came back with a new trap... plus a smoke / CO detector for the kitchen (there wasn't one before) as well as a fire extinguisher).  In many ways I feel like I'm here at exactly the right time.  I hope so, anyway.

Mom was able to remember that her appt with her NP is tomorrow and that she should shower in the morning so I'm getting her up at 8:00.  She hasn't showered since I've been here and I've been asking her to please take care of herself.  Faced with the idea of an appt. with someone she knows tomorrow, she agreed to shower.  I asked if she felt safe in the shower (i.e. do I need to install grab bars?) and she said yes.  I will probably install grab bars anyway.

I talked to a couple of [aging life care experts](https://www.aginglifecare.org//ALCAWEB/What_is_Aging_Life_Care/Search/Find_an_Expert.aspx) today and it was great - they basically act like a project manager / case manager / focal for your loved one.  It's exactly what we need to let mom continue living independently for as long as she can.

The next few days will likely be tough.  Tomorrow we'll talk to the NP and get a referral to a neuro for the memory issues.  Going out really wears mom out, so either today or tomorrow I will re-introduce the concept of getting in-home help, and communicate that I am not leaving until we get SOME level of care in place.  

Then I'll stay for a few days to make sure the wheels I set in motion are running as expected, and be able to go home with a clear conscience.

Thanks all for the support."
"Hey All - (burner account for privacy)

TLDR: did some detective work to figure out what is wrong with my mom.  I need advice.

I (31 M) recently learned (62 F) mother has been struggling much more recently.  I just went on leave to get her help.  Her doctors have diagnosed her with PTSD, I believe her to have have a borderline personality, and I think I’m noticing multiple personalities she slips into.  She flips being manic episodes and depressive guilt about her unusual behavior within the same stream of consciousness.  She struggles staying present with me, often talking at me rather than with me.  She has really irregular sleeping hours.  Her personality reminds me a lot of susan from orange is the new black.

There are substances involved.   Too many Cigarettes, too much coffee, Pharmaceuticals (anti psychotics),-  I’ll get names tomorrow,  she also has medical marijuana.

First thing first - I’m okay.  It’s hard to see her like this but she trusts me and we are working this.

I’m in the process of organizing her estate so we can make sure her finance s are settled.  She owns a house with some debt on it.   With the price increases over the past year she has enough equity to downsize into something with no debt.  The current house needs a less than 5k to get it looking sharp an worth top dollar.

Can someone help me with what I do from here?  Can I get a social worker POV?  Thanks for your advice🙏🏼"
"My Gram - she is 95, has a light case of dementia, cannot walk well and is in assisted living.

She complains of being bored. She watches a lot of tv and life has become small for her.  I am trying to think of fun things to do with her and keep her occupied?

The place she lives keeps shutting things down that she enjoys like bingo and paint class due to covid. It gets her down.

Her best friend of over 45 years lives here also and they spend much of their time together. 

Some things we do are go for walks outside (her in a wheelchair), watercolor paint, look at old photo albums and have her tell stories and spend time with my dog.

We used to do puzzles and play cards but that has become hard for her due to dementia and her bad eye sight. 

Any ideas are helpful - especially if they are mentally stimulating because I want to do what I can to help keep her sharp. ♥️ thanks all"
"We have nightlights leading the way to the bathroom. We just got a medical alert system. Is there an app we could hook up to a tablet to remind him to take meds? We're thinking about getting a webcam. It just seems like there could be so many cool, helpful tech solutions or home hacks, but I don't know where to start..."
"I (her son) live and work in NYC. Mom lives in AZ, where she has put down roots.

About a month ago, she had a massive stroke and is no longer capable of taking care of herself. Luckily she does have a strong friend support network, but it's very much looking like we're going to need some professional assistance (we most definitely can't leave her alone for more than a couple minutes or she tries to wander off. She's fallen a LOT, once needing staples in her head. I caught her this morning trying to mask up her dogs).

Unfortunately we are starting to find out that she's been somewhat irresponsible financially (mainly coming to light as we sift through mountains of old tucked away documents)

She is retired and on a fixed income, insured via Medicare and an AARP, possibly making too much for ALTCS (Arizona Long Term Care System).

I've already determined that we should probably consult with an attorney who specializes in elder care, but any tips on navigating the system would be appreciated :)"
"I'm in my mid 30's and my parents are 59 and 60 respectively. My mother has had bad rheumatoid arthritis since age 28 and my father's body is breaking down after decades of hard manual labor.

7 years ago I moved a few states away from where I grew up to help assist my wife's parents as they age (that could be a whole other post). I'm seeing that my parents might be needing help in the coming years as they age, and doing so from a distance is obviously difficult.

Now here is where it gets really hard. My parents are still very close with my brother and I refuse to go near him (I haven't spoken with him in years). He has always had unchecked mental health issues and has many extremely violent outbursts. 

When we were kids he pulled knives on my friends and threatened to kill them, he got in fist fights with me while I was an adult, he pulled a loaded gun in my father's face and threatened to kill him as an adult (they never pressed charges), and he makes extremely violent open threats I don't even want to repeat as recently as last week.

He is 33 and my parents think he will still ""grow out of it"". We all know he won't and I don't even want my wife around him, he is a total loose cannon. 

So that throws a massive wrench into how I can possibly care for my parents when my unhinged sibling is still very close with them (he lives like 2 miles from where they live). He treats them like shit too but they will never cut him out of their life. I try not to even think about it but I'm clearly seeing a decline in my parents health and I feel stuck.

It's clear I could risk myself and my wife's well being if I interject myself into toxic dynamic, but at the same time my parents love me very much and I just don't have it in me to be hands off. Any ideas on how to even approach this situation?"
"Hi friends.

I'm pretty bushwhacked today but got through it.  Mom's short term memory is thoroughly shot, I have to keep reminding her (gently) of simple stuff.

Me: ""I'm heading to Home Depot""

Her: ""Aren't you going to have lunch?""

Me: ""We just finished lunch. We had tacos.  You had a banana as well.""

Her: ""That was a good banana""

Me: ""Glad you enjoyed it, would you like anything else while I'm out?""

Her: ""Aren't you going to have lunch first?""

Etc.  

Today I visited with several of the neighbors and got them little gifts to say thank you for their thoughtfulness.  Straightened up the basement and worked on getting both dehumidifiers connected directly to the sump pump (bypassing the collector buckets) so they won't need to be emptied any more.  Fortunately I'm pretty handy and there's a lot of tools so I'm in good shape there.

Tomorrow I'm doing a Costco run for paper goods and will help mom find a place to store everything.  Going to start working with her on getting rid of old stuff (she's not a hoarder, she just hangs on to things for FAR too long) so we can make room and simplify the house.  Getting a fire extinguisher and the Wifi-enabled thermostat as well.

Med appt. is Thursday morning, she is remembering to take her pills and seems physically to be doing quite well (mentally she cops to being foggy).  I've asked for referrals to geriatric and neuro as she's just been seeing an NP for the last couple of years (nothing against NPs, I just want her to have a relationship with a doctor and start GOING TO REGULAR APPOINTMENTS).

Also working on in-home care tomorrow, I've gotten zero traction from emailing local agencies so I'm going to call them directly.  Also going to see what I can find on the [HHS Site on Aging](https://www.hhs.gov/aging/long-term-care/index.html).

Thank you all again for your support and feedback."
"Sitting here in the hospital with my mom after a big medical incident. Hate to see her like this but happy I could come help manage things and keep her company in a difficult time. 

But something struck me… As someone who is without children and is now reaching the edge of child-having years and not currently in a relationship, I most likely won’t have a “me” to help me when I’m the one in the hospital bed. 

I know there are no guarantees about what a child would be willing or be able to do. it’s just a thought that never occurred to me before this moment and I can’t say it’s helping my emotional state right now."
"My mother is 81, and in okay health.  I want to move to a city at least a 6 hour airplane ride away. I worry that I will regret moving as time goes on and her health declines. Has anyone experienced this, do you have advice?"
"I (29 F) truly am at my wits end and don’t know where else to go ..

Basically the post says it all in that my STUBBORN 55 year old mother has lost 30-40 lbs over the past 8-12 months yet refuses medical treatment. She is a small woman (4’10) so that is a ton of weight for her… I honestly think she weighs 86 pounds based on what it feels like when I go to hug her. She also has low energy and sleeps ALL hours of the day according to my dad and siblings who live at home… and tbh I have noticed extreme energetic shifts the last 6 months.. 

I should note years ago she was diagnosed with diabetes which she has not managed since 2013 because she refuses medical treatment.

I have tried to talking with her kindly, telling her how much she means to mean and that I want her here but she just screams at me telling me how bad of a person I am. 

I really almost lost it yesterday when my dad confided in me he bought her a card asking her to go to the doctors and wrote her love notes pleading and yet  she refused and instead resorted to calling him an asshole. I have spent the greater past 48 hours BEGGING her to go and she only yells at me and tells me how horrible I am and  that this is her life and she’s fine…

I truly feel so lost. I don’t like her behavior right now but I know she is only projecting her fear … and I get it ! but I truly can’t even stand to look at her just knowing something is wrong- we all sense it. I know all of us would give anything for her to see it and go to the doctors but nothing seems to convince her even when we try to lean in with kindness. 

So has anyone been here ? Did you have a breakthrough ? If not , can you send me some wisdom ? I truly can’t stop crying and feeling so angry and sad .."
Can someone suggest how we can de-risk the dangers of showering and improve personal hygiene for the elderly living independently at home?
"[First post may be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/pmm6li/what_should_i_be_doing_thinking_about/)

The smell was just RAMPANT mustiness.  She is confused about the operation of the thermostat and had the HEAT running in the house - set to 78 degrees here in the lovely Atlanta area.  In September.

Walking past the basement door the pungent musty aroma hit me bang in the nose.  I walked down and discovered the TWO dehumidifiers down there were turned off!  I turned them on, ran the AC in the house and... the smell is (mostly) gone. It's tolerable now, anyway.  Going to pick up some desiccant buckets at HD and place them in the corners to really address it.

I went grocery shopping for her today and got a bunch of pre-prepared / easy to fix stuff (I'm not much of a cook to begin with though I can make simple stuff, and I don't want to fuss over cooking too much anyway).  She had NO food in the house other than what her neighbors had been bringing over.

Took her to the bank today and got added to her account; discovered she had multiple past due bills and set those up for auto-pay since her record-keeping has gone to hell.   She can't remember when she's written a check, or to whom.  This will help my wife and me keep an eye on her finances and hopefully keep anything else from going in the red.  There's more to do but I got a good start on that.

Going to the bank wore her out (though the bank people could not have been nicer); so she didn't want to go to the dr. today.  She agreed I could take her tomorrow.  I went and chatted with all the neighbors and thanked them profusely for their help and made sure to get everyone's contact info.

Checked on her cat too; I'm one of the few people he likes and trusts (former feral) - he seems good but he could use brushing so I'll do that tomorrow.

Thanks again to everyone who jumped in on the first post, y'all are awesome."
last week my father got kicked out of a nursing home. he has severe dementia and alzheimers and needs 24/7 care. he was kicked out for inappropriate behavior towards the female staff and residents.  we had to move him into our family house because he has no where else to go. he makes too much money to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to pay for an assisted living facility with the kind of care he needs. we are completely bone dry out of money and can't take care of him financially anymore. what should we do? two nights ago he escaped the house and was wandering around the neighbor hood for hours late at night while we were all sleeping. he can't be 302'd because his issues are behavioral and not psychiatric. does any one have any suggestions??
"I don't know where to start or how to begin to make sense of what we are starting to observe.  Perhaps because it's not 100% of the time?

My mother (86) goes from acting normal and appearing happy, to the complete opposite in an instant.  We are talking screaming and unsatisfiable.

For instance this morning (since is such a fresh memory) my 27 yr daughter (who has been staying with her for the past week) used her scissors last night and had not put them back just yet.   When scissors returned to drawer, mom just went OFF saying she ""had been looking for them for 3 days"", following her down the hallway still screaming .... ""you didn't pay for them"".   Twenty minutes later, it's like nothing has happened. She does not want to talk about it.

Yesterday a vendor made a mistake and offered $200 gift certificate (was very reasonable gesture).   However, mom wanted $500 (which was more than double the mistake) making a few comments under her breath about wanting more than what was offered yesterday.   This morning she called the vendor and was relentless, threatened going after their license, and taking them to small claims court.    She was like a dog with a bone.

I've tried to talk to her twice about similar incidents but she claims to be fine.  How do you help someone who does not want help?"
"My mom is now 95 and has been in fairly good health for her age - walking outside her Assisted Living resident almost every day, going to exercise classes and joining in the entertainment and singing clubs. She has severe macular degeneration so she can see little or nothing except in her peripheral vision. Three years ago she shattered her pelvis but bounced back quite well, if a little more frail and she started to use a walker. 

But three weeks ago she fell and bruised herself all over. It is taking her a long time to make any progress in getting better - she is laying down a lot, not enjoying her audio books and is often just too tired to have my brother or I stay long for a visit. She says she is done with life, there is no reason to go on and even before her fall what with the Covid restrictions and all, she doesn't see the point. 

I do see that her life is very small now. I am at a bit of a loss as to what to say. She is not a religious person. For the first two weeks I expected her to just bounce back I think she is close to just giving up. And in some ways I agree with her, as much as I would miss her, this isn't the life she wants. 

So, thoughts?"
"Anyone have experience with Pramipexole ER? dad has taken it n forover a year. Had a neuro appt last week and she wanted to try doubling his dose to see if it helps his tremors. That was 5 days ago. For 3 days now he has been sleeping all the time and im wondering if its the Prami. 

Like today he was up with an upset stomach, went back to bed. 9ish maybe? Got up for his normal routine then went back to bed. I let him sleep till 1 and woke him for food and his meds. he looked like he was sleeping off a drunk. Wasnt hungry. But he sat up and ate a couple turkey biscuits and took his meds, napped til 2/2:30. Woke him up for the ballgame where everytime I came in he was napping. Woke him up for dinner and guarantee hes sleeping again cause ballgame is long gone and hes just leaving the TV on that channel. 

He was at the doc and neuro last week, had blood drawn, going back to doc this thursday. Will try calling his neuro about dropping the dose back down but you leave a msg and 'maybe' someone calls back. 

Just wondering if anyone has experienced too much Prami and will it make them sleep all the time.

Thanks."
"My mom (76) just underperformed on her MoCA assessment (not surprised), & has been having a really tough time learning new things. 

But she has an iPhone 5 and it’s past time to upgrade her. 

Any suggestions on models people have moved their folks onto?

She’s really comfy with certain apps on her iPad (curse you, video slots), but never got comfortable with the phone. 

Thinking of sticking with Apple, just not sure how far forward to move, and if it’s time to put parental controls on. 

Thanks for input!"
"I live in the PNW, my mother (who will turn 87 this year) lives in the Atlanta area (widowed and fiercely independent for decades).  We haven't been back to visit in over a year due to the pandemic, but I call mom at least once a week and until rather recently she's been fairly sharp mentally.

The last couple of weeks she told me she wasn't feeling well - low energy, lack of appetite, ""foggy.""  This came to a head last Tuesday when a neighbor called 911 and had an ambulance pick her up for severe disorientation.

Turns out - She hadn't been taking BP meds (she's on three).  She let them expire and hadn't had them renewed.  The ER doc ran several tests (no TIA / stroke, blood O2 ok, etc.) and sent her home with refills on the prescriptions.  I've been calling twice a day and will be going down there tomorrow to assess her living situation.

**She can't remember my calls**.  Every time I talk to her she'll say ""I thought you were coming"" and I'll remind her of my flight.  I asked her (patiently) to write down when I'm coming to help her remember.

I have a living will and durable POA already, we worked that out several years ago.  My first focuses will be :

* **Her health** - I want to get her to a neuro and a geriatric physician ASAP to see how she's doing.  Also make sure she is able to bathe, dress and do things for herself.
* **Finances** - she is the ""get a bill in the mail, send a check"" kind of person.  I'm going to set up as much as I can on autopay and get her paying her CC.  I may give money directly to her to pay some bills if needed, but I will NOT pay any bills for her as I don't want to expose my family to her creditors (shoutout to the nice folks at /r/personalfinance for tips there)
* **The house** - can she still keep up with it?  is it clean?  Can she cook for herself?  Is she eating, etc.
* **Getting help** - what does she need?  I've called a few agencies so far (such as Visiting Angels) but due to the pandemic it's hard to find people taking on new clients (their providers are caring for kids whose schools have shut down)

Hit me with some advice folks.  Never done this before.

Thank you in advance.

"Dad 94, PD dementia, stroke and cancer survivor, tied to his walker,

more often now he has a bad day where he gets so tired/weak doing his morning routine he plops back in bed. Went to neuro yesterday, doc this week and a blood draw. The way he has been the past few years is ups and downs, good days and bad days. he has suffered weakness and balance issues since his stroke 4 years ago.

So I have seen the digression and I understand. The doc and neuro dont find anything wrong other than hes 94 with the stated issues. Its just hard to watch. he knows in a way. But he acts like theres nothing wrong. I guess we all would, dunno. His up and down cycle a year and a half ago was quite pronounced, but we changed that for the better. Now, his down days he will nap the afternoon. Or like today he gets into his morning routine and gets tired and weak so he goes back to bed and naps. Used to be i'd wake him for his a.m. levothyroxin or at least for lunch. I kinda think he needs food and water and will feel better.  He doesnt eat past dinnertime. Today letting him sleep. Guess I just needed to let it out. Kinda rough waiting to see if he wakes up and how he is when he does.

edit: he's out of it today, listless. his doctors offcie calls him and he cant answer his phone today, I swipe it and then he cant hear so I take his phone and talk to them. I know that makes him feel bad cause he couldnt use his phone but I dont know what else to do, cant miss the call. i can only call their service and leave a msg, callback is about 25%. They have my number and I keep asking them to call me instead but they dont. If he answers he cant understand them, often he just makes something up. Dont know what else to do fo him as far as a phone, we are on number 4. many days he's fine, just not today.

edit2-wondering if its his pramipexole. Neurologist doubled the dosage earlier this week and hes been sleeping alot the last few days, maybe he should go back to his old dosage."
"I'm wondering if anyone could offer me advice on how to convince my mother with memory loss issues to stop paying her credit card bill and let it go to collections. She's about $10,000 in debt. No savings. I have obtained power of attorney. She was terminated from her job and short term disability income was stopped in December 2020. Since then I've been trying to get her public assistance. I'm (24/F) an only child no father in my life, I have an uncle who lives in the state. I got her on food stamps and they give her a discount on the electric bill. I also got her social security retirement that's $1,000 a month. She is also on unemployment but I didn't want the fund to deplete so I paused for a while in March. She currently has about a month left of unemployment before it's done. I didn't understand that she was paying off everything with her credit card at the time but last month it become apparent to me because she has maxed out her credit plus account. I had to pay her $1,500 to cover the rent and utility bills that were pending on her bank account that was in the negatives. 

Yesterday I called to remove the TV and phone from our TV/Phone/Internet plan. That decreased the bill by $135 a month. I also called our car insurance provider and removed some protections on the car and those removals bought it down by $100. 

For the past 3 days, I've told my mother to not pay her credit card bill. I've told her several times throughout those days with reason. I was handling the TV and car insurance decreases in the meantime and the rent money was going to be taken out of her account soon. 

I just checked her account and she's made a $400 payment to her credit card and I'm so ready to commit a crime. I changed the password to her bank account so now she's just making payments without knowing what's in her account. If I take away her cards she won't leave me alone, I don't know what to do."
"She's 92, in assisted living and uses a wheelchair because she broke her hip in a fall. (She had other falls resulting in other broken bones, too.) She has a diagnosis of dementia and takes a dementia drug whose name I can't remember and three different antidepressants in addition to some of the usual 'old age' drugs.

How do you handle this particular delusion? She can't remember what was stolen (obviously, because nothing was stolen), so offering to help look for 'it' or 'them' just frustrates her more. Telling her that nothing was stolen isn't the right thing, I'm pretty sure (anyway, I don't do it).

Do I just go along with it and commiserate about the awful people who sneak into her room?"
"My mom has developed back pain over the past few years and it has gotten to the point where she is looking for new jobs as her current one won't give her ADA accommodations and she already reduced her hours to 20 hours a week.  This is what we're looking for in a new job, any suggestions? Thanks in advance!

\- cannot carry heavy objects

\- cannot stand for long periods of time

\- cannot sit for long periods of time

\- no work shifts on Saturday or Sunday

\- up to 30 hours a week if she does not experience back pain on the job

\- up to 20 hours a week if she does experience back pain on the job

She's willing to study and get certified or licensed if it's reasonable. Something like cosmetology school  that costs $10-20k and 1000+ hours of studying was ruled out. Medical billing/coding might be more reasonable.

It would be nice to have access to employer-sponsored medical insurance but worst case Obamacare is an option."
"Dad (81) says his incontinence is much worse after surgery and hospital stay (June). He now looses bowels too, when that wasn't an issue before.  I'm not sure he has discussed the condition with his Doc.

I'm just wondering is this the new normal or any hope for regaining of function. He's super frustrated (understandably)."
She lives in her own home and is in general good physical and metal health but is getting more stubborn as she ages. Without power we evacuated the day after Ida and she wanted us to leave her; said she’s ok with the heat. I’m generally very submissive to her because she’s hell on wheels but I told her to get her ass in the car right this minute. She did but I’m concerned about upcoming storms. Any suggestions?
"My mom is about 5 feet tall, maybe 80 pounds on a good day, so very petite, and is mostly bedridden with extreme pain. She is able to get to the bathroom with a walker a couple of times a day and move around with help, and she wants a housedress or duster that is easy to get on and off (so, not a pullover) and isn't a trip hazard. Prefers long sleeves but can be short. Either with snaps or zips, but no tie/sash. So not like a standard bathrobe.

My sister has looked online and can't find anything small enough, and it really needs to be short enough not to trip her. It's possible it can be hemmed, but that's another complexity that's hard for us to manage since all her kids are distant and managing through visits."
"I sometimes have trouble finding conversation about aging people and actual mental illness, without someone rushing in to say “Changes in mood and behavior are dementia signs, I tell you! Dementia, I say - put your parent in a home as soon as possible!”

My mom has been assessed by a neuro. She hasn’t got dementia.  Except when she’s anxious and raging, she knows exactly who, what and where she is.  She has always been anxious and ranty when she gets anxious, her whole life. Untreated.  Strangers aren’t trusted, so she never saw anyone for it. She’s got lifelong depression and anxiety that a neuro can’t treat, and the depression and anxiety is getting worse with age, and she won’t see a psychiatrist, and she won’t take the Lexapro that was actually working. She’s kind of like she always was when younger, except now on steroids. Unwilling to seek help, overconfident that she can handle herself, and a huge hypochondriac. 

Doctors and nurses’ eyes glaze over when she blabs on and on about her many ailments and life story, which she does when anxious. To be fair, Mom has been through a lot in the last few years:

-Loss of vision in one eye

-Loss of hearing in one ear

-Gave up driving 

-estranged husband died

Since this spring:

-aunt close in age to her died

-longtime neighbor (35+ years) died

-best Internet friend died (she doesn’t have any other friends than on the Internet, though she has met them in person once or twice)

-no longer can climb stairs due to bad knee and was told she is not a candidate for surgery

-beloved cat died; the final pet in a lifetime of pets, she can’t care for any more pets

-she has to leave her longtime GP because his office is too far away now

-and now the latest twist, her slovenly hoarder sister was flooded out of her apartment and is forced to stay at my mom’s. They don’t always get along.  (See my other posts for gory details on this unfolding hoarder situation)

The Lexapro was helping, but she’s convinced it is making her vision disrupted in her remaining eye and refuses to continue with it.

I feel frustrated that I can’t find any help for her. Afraid it will become dementia if she doesn’t get back on some medication or talk to a professional."

Planning ahead can be a good start in getting your mind at ease as well as your family. Making certain decisions such as financial planning is important to do.

In order to plan your **end-of-life goals** properly, having your family involved to help can make a difference.

Learn more about how to properly plan for end of life.

## How to plan for End-Of-Life Care

Having a checklist for end-of-life planning can be very useful and can take some stress of.

–**Considering legal** and financial matter

\-Organ donations decision

\-End of life care you decide

\-How you would like to be remembered

\-Funeral planning

Having proper communications of your end-of-life wishes is important to discuss with your family.

## Choosing where to spend your last days

Choosing where you want to spend your last days is important to keep in mind. Usually, people prefer to die in the comfort of their own home with family near them to say their goodbyes.

Talking to your health professionals who have been assisting you can help you decide where its best to die.

Spending your last days at home and receiving in home hospice care can be suitable for some people. Deciding this end-of-life care can help you become closer to family and friends. Having at home hospice care can sometimes be overwhelming.

You must be constantly thinking ahead in case of emergency and have everything taken care of as there is not as many health care professionals assisting. This is important to keep in mind when deciding what care is best for you.

A **hospice facility** can also be another option for you. Your family could feel more at ease with having assistance 24/7 with health care professionals being there to hold your hand. Our Sahara Houston Hospice services offer more in-depth than an in-home hospice care.

Services usually include **palliative care**, veterans care, grief and bereavement support and more

## Choosing how to die

This subject can be very overwhelming and might not be something you wish to even think about. Having a set plan for how you want your end-of-life experience to be is what everyone in a hospice wants.

Having a voluntary euthanasia, refusing life prolonged treatment, making a legal will or organizing decision by power of attorney can be a decision you must make when the time comes near. It is important to keep these suggesting’s in mind as part of your end-of-life care planning."
"My dad has finally agreed to physical therapy to address his issues. He's fallen a few times, has obvious balance/gait issues, and I'm concerned he's got other diagnoses that he's hiding from us. 

I'd love to hear about any experiences or tips you guys have had in this area. 

He doesn't drive, so so unless we find some amazing clinic the PT would need to come to his place. If there IS an amazing clinic, we could make it work. 

Again, I welcome ALL thoughts, but I had these specific questions as well:

1. Are the therapists that come to your house generally not as good as the ones who work in a clinic? A friend told me this. 
2. I'm concerned he's got neurological issues that he's hiding - would all PT's watch/test for this, or is that a specialty thing?
3. How would I recognize an exceptionally good PT? What about an exceptionally bad one?
4. Has anyone had experience with chain services like FYZICAL or Luna?
5. How long can I tell him before he can expect to feel differently from PT?

Thanks for any advice."
"my dad is 70 and had a spinal cord injury 12 years ago and is quadriplegic. since COVID, his therapy pool has been closed and he has deteriorated significantly both physically and mentally. he has virtually no social interaction and never leaves the house since his only previous interaction was the pool 3x a week with his disabled friends.

in the past 6 months his voice has changed to a whisper and I can barely hear him most of the time. I know he has gotten very weak and he seems depressed although he denies being depressed. is it normal for aging parents to stop talking normally? it strikes me as weird.

he sounds exhausted all the time like he lacks the energy to talk normally, but he also seems to lack awareness of speaking so softly, so I wonder if there is a mental health component.

has anyone experienced this?"
"Title, so Ive got the power of attorney, and need to square away a couple of his bills, at least one I'm sure is turned off. 

I need to be able to access his bills online accounts as I work and cannot speak with any of his service providers during the day reliably, but i get the feeling they will need to talk to him, and he's being a pain in the ass about facilitating my access. 

So I'm about to just try an end run so I can make sure his lights are kept on and the doors open.. do any of you know how much success I'm going to have waving a POA at them when they won't let me access his accounts, yadda yadda. 

Thanks in advance guys."
"New to this thread after visiting my grandparents!

My 97 year old grandpa ran his business up until he was 90 years old. He taught me how to use a computer, set up my first email, etc. But now he has dementia and still tries to habitually check his email.

He has a shortcut on his desktop, his password is auto saved, and he just clicks in.

When I was visiting I realized just how many spam emails he gets, and how willing he is to give them his credit card information. My grandma (much younger) has been going in every morning to delete all of the spam emails and I recently taught her how to “mark as spam” so that he stops getting so many.

I was wondering, is there any type of program or video game or something where I could get my grandpa to “play” or pretend to check his email? My partner and I were joking we should just give him an image that looks like his inbox and set it as his desktop background so he can’t do any harm. It got me thinking, is there anything like this where he could click around and pretend he’s doing something? He never actually sends emails to real people, just spams! Also just looking for advice and people who have also experienced this! Thanks!"
"I’ve posted on here before, a few months back. 

I (F28) have five siblings: (F36), (F32), (F31), (M26), (M21). 

My mom (F56) has suffered from untreated mental health for a long time, probably most of my life. 

She used to sleep for hours during the day time throughout my childhood. 

When I turned 15 things became more serious. My mom believed she could hear God telling her to move us all to Israel (we live in the US). 

My mom has also been very paranoid since my childhood and believed both my dad and maternal grandmother have tried to poison her; which isn’t true. 

Me, and three of my siblings (F31, M26, M21) have all witnessed my mom’s mental health episodes since we were children and teens. So we’ve been trying to convince my mom and others that there was an issue and she needed treatment for the last 14-15 years. 

In the last year, things became worse. My mom stopped grocery shopping and started struggle to complete daily tasks. 

Instead of accepting that it could be her mental health deteriorating, my oldest sisters (F36 and F32) decided she could have dementia. 

Many doctor appointments (including neurologist) and tests later it was determined she does not have dementia and is in good health overall. 

Within the last 2 months things have become more extreme. 

My mom thought the neighbors were sending her messages through the music they played. And started to respond aggressively toward them by blaring music toward their house all night long. 

My sister (F31) called a crisis line I found, but they couldn’t help because my mom was being aggressive. She followed their advice and contacted the sheriff department. A deputy came out, but couldn’t make my mom go to the hospital because he said she wasn’t a threat to herself or others. 

A week ago we found out my mom had been walking down the road, to a neighbor’s house and knocking on their door because she believed the prime minister of Israel was there and was calling her to meet him and his wife. 

My mom refused to complete a mental health evaluation or to go to a behavioral hospital. 

She agreed to stay at my sister’s (F32) house for a few days, but returned home today. 

Our fear is that she is going to be hurt (shot) by the neighbors if she keeps going to their home or that she’ll be arrested. 

The day before she agreed to go to my sister’s house, they found a gun by her front door which isn’t like her. They have locked up all the guns in the home at this time. 

We (siblings) all agree that it is mental health and our mom needs treatment. I and my eldest sister both live 6-7 hours away from my mom , so we’re limited on the help we can provide. 

I offered for my mom to come stay with me for a short period. She says she might in November. 

She also told me she is planning on moving, but won’t tell me or my siblings where she plans to go. 

Her & my dad are still married, but living separately. She receives a good amount of money through royalties she inherited, so she would be able to provide for herself for a period of time. 

I just don’t know if she’d actually be able to care for herself if she moved away without telling any of us where she plans to live. I also worry she could end up hurt and confused in an unfamiliar place. 

We’ve done what we can so far. 
My sister (F32) said if it’s necessary she’ll obtain a mental health warrant to have my mom evaluated and hospitalized…that is our last resort. 

It’s just a frustrating situation. I feel like I’ve lost my mom even though she’s still here. Two of my sisters (F32 F31) have lost a lot of hope."
"I’m approaching 50 and my parents are in their late 70s.  I live 600 miles away and am at the peak of my career.  My job consumes my life; other than a short rest on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings, I work constantly.

I used to visit my parents once per month,  but after they told me to stop visiting them, and after they secretly gave nearly $100k to a sibling and lied about it, I stopped, which was around the start of the pandemic.  I’ve really enjoyed having time to myself to rest on the weekend, even though it’s just a short break.

I have no interest in visiting my parents, and I haven’t seen them in over a year.  I know that sounds terrible.  Now they’re asking me when I plan to visit them or when they can come visit me.  I’m not really interested.

How often do you visit your parents if you work constantly and/or live far away?

Thanks."
"Like he does with his keys and glasses he lost the gun he carries in his sweatpants everywhere he goes. He said he lost it somewhere while going to garage sales... Let's hope a kid doesn't find it as it is always loaded without a safety... What did he do? Bought another gun.. 

Without debating guns I am confident that an accident with this gun is far more likely than him needing it for personal protection. He's declining physically and in his decision making and admits at no time in his life has he needed a gun to resolve a problem. He does not adhere to safe gun ownership and handling.  Sometime 5 years ago or so his brother convinced him he needed to get a permit and start carrying.

I would love to hear any advice on how to work with him on this. The local police have been informed that it was lost and they have the serial number. We have young kids and really avoid going to his house where he has loaded guns hidden throughout his property. And when he visits us I won't allow him to have the gun with him as my girls jump on his lap.

His response so far, He says he feels naked without it now.

We're not on the best terms as everytime we talk I'm pushing him to make changes. Now this came up while my brother and I have been pushing him to get rid of his hoard and move. Timing isn't great as he is really resisting any changes right now. He needs to make healthy changes now or when his health gets worse they will be forced on him. Anyway, any ideas about the gun? Thank you."
"We are in upstate NY, she's on social security and disability. She receives only 750 a month to live on. She's renting a room that's 600 a month.


My home is a 3 bedroom and we have three kids plus I've had emergency placement of 2 foster babies since April.  My house just can't fit her and her small dog. 


I'm willing to help with her monthly rent, but does anyone know of a program that may be able to help her?


She's confused most of the time, forgets doctors appointments and where she's driving / what she's doing. She has heart problems too.


Can anyone point me in the right direction? 


Thank you!"
"Hi. Hope this is allowed. I need some advice/ideas regarding my mil who lives in another country. I’ve tried talking to my partner but he finds it hard and will drink to avoid. He lost his father last year and since then it’s been an interesting situation with mil. She has diabetes, possible dementia, sleeps 18 hours a day and has just switched off from life. She doesn’t exercise or answer the phone anymore. She’s been on sleeping tablets since her husbands death. She doesn’t look after herself. Doesn’t do washing or dishes or cooking anymore. So family promised her she would stay in her house. The only thing that will change that is if she falls. We think she has dementia but it’s been months and she won’t go to hospital for tests. She has meals delivered, cleaners, a nurse twice a day, someone to help her shower. But we keep getting phone calls from partners sister saying how dreadful things are.  The nurses don’t come, she doesn’t wash, she doesn’t brush her teeth, the windows aren’t opened and now the furniture is mouldy etc etc. I don’t know how to help partner anymore.as a family they won’t talk about the future or work to make things better. They just snipe at each other and accuse each other of theft. I don’t think it’s sustainable but I have to bite my tongue and just wait while thinking I would never leave my parents in such a state.
Any possible advice other than keep biting my tongue?"
"So I care for our elder, and it's been pretty bleak in that bad times an pretty boring in the other times. I would never complained to my siblings about this role that I have willingly taken on. But they have grown a bit too comfortable with me handling everything. I moved into my family home and have taken over.the care of it as well as the resident octogenarian. I am trying to clean out the house in small ways to prepare for the future. It's still going to be a huge task some day and I need to find away to let my siblings know once caregiving is over, I am over. My shift will be over them they get to step in. My view is I do people not ""things"" and have tried to work on the things while I am here, but met with some resistance. So I have stopped and need to find a way to say, I will not be here. my sister said toe in a heated conversation "" you won't be cleaning out the house on your own..."" And that's when I knew for sure they assumed I would be here after being trapped in this house for at this stage a year an a half. I have an apt I have not seen in a year. I want to respect self later and to honor my parents, but need to say to them that I am here now, won't be later. Any ideas or opinions welcome."
"I mean, won't the body itself just quit when it does nothing all day?

She's in a nursing facility, but hasn't gotten out of bed in almost 2 weeks. 6 months ago, she was living on her own (not well tho). Too lazy to even charge her phone, so no personal contact other than nurses either. 

Guessing others have seen similar, just wondering if she will be like this for years or does the body just give up from neglect?

Broad question, just trying to get an idea of what to expect. Years of OXY/Alcohol/Smoking haven't helped, but I just can't imagine staying alive long without moving or doing anything."
"I am having trouble finding a homecare agency for my mom that is actually helpful in easing my burden as a caregiver. The two homecare agencies I have tried don't seem to have systems in place to make sure the visits are productive and helpful to the *caregiver.* Instead, they focus on what my mom deems helpful, which given her memory and comprehension limitations is basically bringing her shopping for fun or making her a sandwich for lunch. But that does absolutely nothing to ease my burden.

So I am curious if anyone here has used a homecare agency that had systems/procedures in place to make the service more helpful and purposeful. Maybe lists or worksheets or calendars or check-in processes? Looking for any ideas that I can implement to make the homecare service more helpful in actually freeing up some of my time and mental space.

For some background on my mom's situation: I live 2 hours away from her. She is a bit frail but is physically able to care for herself. However, she has issues with memory and is very irresponsible when it comes to managing her affairs. That means she doesn't keep up with things like refilling meds, paying bills, getting car inspections, taking her dogs to the vet, grocery shopping, etc, so it all falls on my sister and me. She either does not remember or want to admit that she has trouble with these things, so she does not ask the homecare attendant to help her with them."
"My mother has had 5 kids in her life. She didn’t raise a single one of them. The longest she had one under her care was until they reached the age of 10. She has lived off the system most of her life. Had been a drug addict/drunk until a little over 10 years ago. When she got sober she lived with different family members and now she’s landed in my house. She is extremely difficult to live with. She thinks things should be her way well not paying for anything in her house and expecting people to bring her to her appointments, go to the store for her etc etc and if you bring her to the store she doesn’t pay attention to her phone to know when you’re leaving. She doesn’t have a concept of money. She has a part time job that I convinced her to get- she hasn’t worked in 6+ years and she gets paid fridays and is broke by Monday. She doesn’t have any concept of money and I don’t know how to teach her without coming off as condescending and mean in her eyes. She very much has the world is out to get me personality and if she’s living with me she has to pay for her own things like cigarettes and new clothes. That’s pretty much it… she doesn’t seem to be able to handle responsibility and people can’t keep having her live with them she’s incredibly mean to people. Especially when she doesn’t take her meds.

So my question is: is there a way to help her move forward in life at such an old age without making her insulted. I don’t want her to feel attacked and I want her to feel independent."
"Due to a couple of staff members testing positive for COVID, I'm not able to visit my mom in person at the assisted living facility either yesterday or today.  This lack of contact, the grieving over the loss of her husband, my dad, and the slow but constant ebbing away of her personal autonomy and mental soundness have all combined today to send my mother into a deepening depression.

I called her today at the time I would usually be visiting, to remind her that I wasn't allowed into the building but that I was thinking about her and wanted to see how she was doing and if she needed anything.  Instead I was threatened with murder.

""Do I need anything?  Yes, you can bring me a shotgun.""

""Why do you want a shotgun, Mom? What would you do?"" (I feared she was feeling suicidal. I've known three elders that attempted suicide as they felt themselves losing control of their lives.)

""I'd shoot everyone who took me out of my house and put me in this place."" (Well, Dad's already dead, so that leaves me!)

Knowing it was the dementia talking, I didn't continue the gun thread or repeat to her the story of how she got there; instead, I just changed the subject.

""What would you do if you were in your house today?"" (I knew the answer--sit on the sofa and watch television, it's been that way for several years and doesn't need to be any different for her now.  She has a sofa, she has a television, most of the same pictures are on the wall, it's not really that different.)

She thought it over and realized, I think, that it wouldn't be any different, so she said, ""I don't need your quizzes!""

""So who've you heard from? Has anybody called?""

""Who would call me? Everybody's dead!""

""Well I know that Uncle J tried to call over the weekend and I thought maybe he'd try again.""

""Oh, he doesn't know anything anyway.""

It doesn't take a degree in psychology to realize that she's very depressed. After I made as graceful of a ""goodbye"" as I could, I called the facility and asked them to send someone to her room for what they call ""emotional support.""

Some people have learned to make the best of their situations, but my mom isn't one of those people. She has a melancholy personality and has spent much of her life worrying and fearing the worst. It's sad that she can't be more happy and confident, but she often chooses to see the bad rather than the good. Now this year she was forced to leave her home of 55 years, and she's lost her husband, and her freedom, and every now and then since she has a lot of time on her hands she sits and thinks about all she's lost and she gets depressed. Nothing I can say or do will make a difference; in fact, I know that often I just make it worse because I won't agree with her that life is terrible and that she's right to be so negative. (For the whole story of how and why the move took place, look for my previous posts entitled ""I AM MOVING MY PARENTS."")

So today she says that given a gun, she would shoot me for moving her out of her house. I know she doesn't mean it. It's sad that with COVID the regulations have to be enforced and no one in the family can go over and help her out of her dark mood.

The facility will send someone to visit Mom, but there really isn't much anyone can do except to medicate her. She's convinced right now that she's the victim in the story and that my late father and I are the villains. Even though my brother who lives in another state concurred with the decision to move our parents in March, he wasn't physically present to be complicit,  so he's still on the ""good"" list. I've asked him to call her when he can (he's still working, while I'm retired) and maybe he can get her to lighten up.

After the nurse practitioner's visit on Tuesday, she determined that Mom is not yet ready for hospice, and will remain on palliative care. As I write this, it occurs to me that maybe I should call the agency that provides that to see if they have any thoughts or offers as to how to deal with the situation. If I decide to do that, I'll provide an edit later to relate what happened as the result of the call.

Until then, as so many caregivers have experienced, it is at times a thankless job for which a loving spouse or child is berated and threatened by their loved one. I truly want to believe that if my mother really did have a shotgun she wouldn't use it on me, but given her declining mental state, I think I'm glad that we won't have to find out for sure!

EDIT: I texted the agency's social worker but did not get a reply. 

However, hours later, I did get a phone call from my mom. Evidently my well-meaning brother called her to help calm her down, but in the course of the conversation he told her she had ""hurt my feelings."" She called me in tears, begging forgiveness and telling me she had no intention of hurting me and no idea what she said. This is so sad; I didn't have hurt feelings and I had wasn't going to chastise her for her words uttered in the midst of depression and dementia.  I know she wouldn't hurt a fly, much less ever aim a loaded weapon at one of her sons. So then I was on the phone with my poor mother who was crying and asking forgiveness but not knowing what it was that she had said. I had already told my brother I had no plans to revisit the conversation but he forced it.  In the future I'll need to be more circumspect with him.

Later after this I got an email from the acting director of the assisted living center saying that a third employee has tested positive for COVID and that family will not be permitted to visit residents through the weekend. My poor mom is being set up for further depression and despair in the absence of loving visitors. 

Finally, those who have followed this thread know that my dad passed away in July. He and I were football watching buddies, and even when we couldn't be together I'd call him at halftime of whatever game was on and we'd talk about it.  Tonight when the Minnesota-Ohio State game got to halftime with the underdog Gophers ahead, (they eventually lost) the thought crossed my mind that I should call Dad. It only lasted a second before I remembered I couldn't do that, and again the sadness just welled up. I suppose that will keep happening. I sure do miss him.

"Hi!

My mother recently had a stroke and I will be having to move her to a place that offers assisted living within Ohio. I am in another country so most everything I do will have to be via zoom which makes things difficult (Corona and traveling did not make it any easier). But those are minor issues. I am really confused about where to start first regarding these places. I really don't understand Medicaid/Medicare because I live in a country that has socialised care so I never really had to think about these aspects. I just feel kind of lost."
"I honestly think the worst things about this phase of life is the bathroom issues. My elder is mobile enough to make a mess ten times worse with their version of cleaning up. Generally grabbing a box of tissues or stuffing a dirty brief or underwear into a urinal ( how?) or using a sock or pillow case. I say repeatedly, if you have any kind of issue please just call me, I will help. And the next thing you know you are, at 2am, in the middle of hurricane Ida's rain storm, unable to open the windows for fresh air and lots of mess. The only smart thing I have done is layer the bed in disposable pee pads and when disaster strikes I can fling them off the bed and not have to change the bed in the middle of the night. And that is a pretty good victory, and I learned that from you smart people."
"If I thought it was hard when I was young, it’s worse now. Sad thing is, it dredges up all the stuff I worked out in therapy to deal with and makes it extra hard today to deal with her. Mostly just venting here. I’m on top of how to handle her and her “episodes” but dang if it isn’t hard to do when I’m a busy career woman. Thanks all for listening. I just need to reach out and know others are out there dealing with aging parents and especially those with disabilities like my mom has."
"Any real benefit to it??

edit: trying to decided if it is worth signing up my older parent."
"Hi everyone! 49 yo looking to the future a bit.  My mom will be 76 years old in October.  My dad will be 82 years old in February.   Long story short, mom has had 3 inpatient stays and then rehab the past 3 years.   She has diabetic neuropathy.  She doesn’t seem to be getting much better even with HHC such as physical therapy and nursing visits.  My parents live next door to me.  It’s a duplex.  Worst case scenario—If my mom had to be admitted to hospital again, and was unable to come home, is that when I would hire an elder care attorney?  My parents do not own a house, and live on their SS benefits.  No 401k either.  My dad would want to remain on his own next door and not go anywhere since his health is okay.  Any advice is greatly appreciated.  The saying “Getting old is not for sissies” could not be more true!"
"Today I went to the assisted living center to see my mom and to deliver her some groceries.  Despite the fact that the cooking is done for her, she still likes to have bread, peanut butter, coffee, and a few things that she can access on her own timeline.

We had a very nice visit, and I'd like to offer my experience as advice for others. My son had bought and left a coffee table book. In this case it was about western art, featuring portraits of natives, fur traders, cowboys, and the like, and lots of images of life in the old west. We went through that book page by page, and for my mother, it was like magic.  She reacted to each image, offering thoughts about what life might have been like in those times and places, and associating the pictures with people from her past (her uncle was a professional rodeo calf roper). Picture after picture brought comments about the beauty of the horses, or the strength of the bison, or the ruggedness of the western countryside.  

But then we were brought back to earth. On the way out the door, feeling very good about how things were going, I had occasion to be greeted by one of the nurses and she had new revelations for me. Both were very concerning.  The first, Mom has lost 14 pounds in a very short time and needs to start taking Ensure to help her stop losing weight, and the second, and very troubling one, that she has been wandering the facility halls at night, deep in delusion, looking for my father who passed away early last month. Not only did the nurse join the other voices in recommending that Mom move to memory care, but she took the extra step of suggesting that we consider starting her in hospice.

Yes, it all makes sense, and we've been expecting that the facility would recommend memory care since we had already heard it from paramedics and hospital personnel.  ""But the paramedics and hospital staff don't know Mom,"" we thought. ""They don't see her every day.  They don't see her good days"" and so we were prepared to give those recommendations less weight.  But when the assisted living nursing staff says it, obviously it means more. It means they, who see her far more frequently than even we do, and have more information and experience than we have, believe she is in danger living in her apartment, and, if the hospice recommendation is right, that she doesn't have a real long time to live.

This is hard. I tried offering alternative viewpoints: ""But she'll be taken away from her things, the things that have made her happy and comfortable all her life."" The answer""it won't be very long before she doesn't even know those are her things."" Well I disagree with that, at least for now. But I also know that when she fell the other night not only did she cut her eye open, she broke pieces of a prized flower bowl that she had owned since 1950 and that the family has always treasured because none of us can remember life without it. In the end, things are just things; her need for safety must come before her need for things.

Tomorrow I meet with the nurse practitioner who is supposed to enroll Mom in palliative care, the step before hospice.  I've invited the facility's nurse to join that meeting and present her case that we should skip palliative care and go straight to hospice. In addition to the hallucinations, delusions, and falls, we now also have the weight loss and the evening wandering. I'm guessing we are further along the process than I might have supposed.

In March I moved my parents into a beautiful apartment in assisted living, thinking that I had set them up for years of safety and happiness.  In April my father fell and in June he had a psychotic breakdown that ended in his passing on July 2.  Now, less than two months later, my mother is showing the signs that she too is headed for a different life than the one I had imagined.  

My heart is already broken by the loss of my dad; I thought I was doing ok until football season started and there came a moment when I realized I was going to have to face the season without my football watching partner. The moment that realization hit me, I reacted strongly and emotionally.  Now, just a week later, I learn that my mom is probably not going to make it either. May God grant me the strength to persevere through this."
"Trying to figure out how to protect the in-laws.  They are still functional and on their own, but are living beyond their means.  They are not out of liquid assets, but at this rate it's going to happen in the next 6-24 months depending on a few things.

They have excellent credit and nine credit cards.  They have not had a problem with debt in the past, but there are some concerning behavioral patterns and past experiences that lead me to worry that they would be susceptible to straight up scams/fraud, but also a predatory lender at a car dealership selling them a car they can't afford (they really want to buy a $95K Mercedes SUV and the dealer was setting up a loan for them when we found out).  In addition to debts like that, I believe that when they run out of liquid assets, they will just run up debt on their credit cards.

They were very lucky in their twenties and have been very well off since, but not at all financially literate.  They do not understand the implications of debt and do not understand that it will erode their fixed monthly income.  (They also don't understand that they are living comically beyond their means, but I have given up on that.  They have been doing it for so long, they won't really understand until they are out of liquid savings.)

Without having to completely take over their finances, what can be done to help protect them from severely hampering their retirement by running up a bunch of debt?  Any tips/tricks that we can leverage?

&#x200B;

Edited to add:

After working on this, the course of action we have settled on is to get a durable power of attorney.  They are calling it the ""kitchen sink"" version since it has every different allowed thing they have ever done.  With this, we can then setup accounts with each of the credit bureau and put a freeze on their accounts.  This will stop them from opening new credit cards or getting loans.  We will whittle down the current cards by switching them to one with money back and then slowly killing off the others as they are not used.

This is the best middle of the road approach we were able to come up with that did not require us to totally take over.  The durable POA will also let us start to do some estate planning on their behalf."
"So, my Dad is only 64 but he seems so much older. He has heart problems (atrial fibrillation but incredibly severe and longstanding) and can do very little for himself. Just loading the dishwasher or having a shower can set off his heart and make him feel very unwell for the rest of the day. The issue first started over 5 years ago and has been up and down since then but he has been incapacitated since October 2020 when he was rushed to hospital. My mother didn't tell me at the time as I was only able to get in touch after it was no longer relevant but the paramedics were pretty unsure if he would get to the hospital alive. He's on the waiting list for an operation that should fix the problem completely if it goes well but will have waited a year when he has it. 

I know that he is still here but I sort of feel like the man who was my Dad died several years ago and was replaced with an old man and an invalid. It's hard to see a man who is weak and old and very depressed because of it and think of my father, who was the life of the party in his heyday. As a matter of fact, him being the life of the party is very much why he is having health problems now but what's done is done.

Even though he should be better after the operation, I worry that he will relapse into old habits and his heart can't take it anymore. I worry that the operation won't be a success and he will keep needing further treatment. Or he will die because he's come so close to dying so many times. And I wish his old habits, which I am being vague about for privacy reasons, did not exist and that I had a normal father. Because it is not normal to be so decrepit at 64. My friends' Dads can still do running and golf and help them move house. If only he hadn't burnt the candle at both ends I wouldn't have to worry that he'll die before he meets his hypothetical grandchildren. 

Anyway, any advice for worrying less about all the 'what ifs' and coming to terms with the Dad I've got rather than the one I had would be appreciated."
"So, my dad died last year and I've been helping my mum (Parkinsons) figure out how to adult. During the chaotic probate - which is still ongoing, as dad left no will - a relative offered to lend mum money when she was staying with my sister (who is in huge debt), so they could pay hospital bills etc. The money was a lifesaver, as I had already given them all I could afford to spare.

Today the relative went to dad's shitty bank and they told her they're finally closing it and sending the money to mum (why, why did they do this?!). Last week, I begged the relative not to go to the bank, but she's always been a bit special, so she went anyway, and then posted about it in the family chat, together with a summary of what she thinks we owe her (she rounded down, we owe her more). Chaos ensues:

* Sister - ""sounds like she wants her money back?!"" Well, duh - she lent you and mum a shedload of cash, and no one does that without expecting it back at some point. Will you please calm down!
* Mum - ""if they want war, they'll get war!"" Mum, when someone lends you money THEY WILL WANT IT BACK AT SOME POINT ffs. This is normal.
* Me - ""it's too early for booze, leave me alone"" Thoughts and prayers, pls.

There is nothing I can do to diffuse this situation - it's so annoying that none of the three can behave like adults. I have no idea why the bank decided it's approriate to discuss details of the bank transfer with the relative (she's not one of the declared heirs, we are, although she had Power of Attorney to use the account when dad was alive). They made a mistake, but I can't be bothered to bring this up as the levels of drama this morning are already immense, and I just want peace, not 30+ whatsapp messages / minute. 

I just want the shitty bank to finish sending the money, pay the relative the full amount we owe her, and move on to the remaining 136 items remaining on the To Do list."
"My husband's father has been going downhill physically and mentally for years, but it has escalated in the past 6 months. He is 82 and a very heavy smoker. He suffers from dementia, heart disease, COPD, diabetes, high blood pressure and has an aortic stent. He has had 3 different types of cancer - bladder cancer, skin cancer, and cancer up in his sinus cavity. He's also had MRSA and many recurrent bladder infections - too many to count in the past few years. He's had a number of small strokes (we think) and seizures (we think). He's been in and out of the hospital 20+ times in the past 2 years for ""episodes"" where he becomes unresponsive and can't move, but he always snaps out of it after awhile. CT scans have all been negative for stroke or TIA. We have no idea what's really going on. Many of the hospital stays are followed by weeks in a skilled nursing facility, complete with PT and OT. After he's released he comes home and does absolutely nothing except sit in his chair and chain smoke with the TV on full volume. (He's hard of hearing and keeps breaking his hearing aid.) To be honest, we have no idea why he's still alive given all his major health issues. 

About 3 months ago he came home from the hospital after an episode, fell down and broke his ankle. He had surgery to put a rod and pins in it, but it is not healing. Doctor says it's because of his smoking, but he will not stop. After 6 weeks in a nursing facility he's come home and family is trying to care for him. It is tough, to say the least. He is completely dependent on others for everything and has also become both bladder and bowel incontinent. He has chronic diarrhea, so the incontinence is especially difficult to manage for caregivers. Nothing seems to help with the diarrhea. Right now we have hired someone to be with him during the daytime and family is with him in the evenings and on the weekends. He makes zero effort to help himself get to the toilet now, just pooping himself whenever he feels the urge. Caregivers are currently changing him at least 10 times a day, sometimes more. He used to urinate in a plastic urinal next to his chair, but he doesn't even bother to do that anymore. 

We have tried to talk to him several times about the need for more skilled care for him, but he won't even consider it. He launches into angry refusal. Even though he has dementia, he is cognizant enough to know what we're suggesting and to adamantly refuse going anywhere. He just says ""Hell no! I ain't going!"" Even when we tell him he can't do ANYTHING for himself, he says ""NO! I don't care.  You guys can take care of me"". He says he'll kill himself if we try to make him go. (Not sure how he would accomplish that, but just hearing him say it is heartbreaking.) 

We are all getting completely burned out. It's stressful and exhausting. He has an appointment this week with his primary care doctor, so we are hoping to talk to her privately to see what she suggests. We're pretty much at our wits end. My husband is about ready to just put him in the car, tell him he's going to the doctor, and drop him off at a care home. I know he really doesn't want to do that. 

I'm sure there have been other posts about this, but just typing it all out has helped. Any suggestions greatly appreciated."
"For the last few years my sister/BIL have been primary caretakers for my elderly mother, My mother thrives around contact with people and said she would die of depression if she were put in a nursing home which I think is probably true. She has her own apartment which is paid for by SDA/other benefits and lives alone with a cat who is her friend and companion.

At the start of the pandemic she was hospitalized with low blood oxygen and we didn't think she would survive but she did. The doctors said it was crucial that she had several hours of oxygen a day. There is mask she has to put on that provides it. Her routine is to go to my sister/BIL's a night, watch TV and have dinner with them (she barely eats) and then they driver her home (less than 5 minutes away) since they won't allow her to stay overnight.

Last month they went on their annual vacation to the Hamptons. They haven't brought her the last few years because of her frail health. This year they brought her but didn't bring her supplemental oxygen because the SIL said it was ""too dangerous"" to bring in the car. I'm surprised she didn't die. When she got back her health deteriorated. My sister/BIL took another vacation and my mother asked to stay at their house while they were away (I've stayed there many times before) but they wouldn't let me.

They have a dog sitter who me and other people in the family don't trust. One of the dogs shakes and runs away and hides under the bed every time they see him but doesn't do that with anyone else. This person was alone with my mother when she got a horrible gash on her arm that needed stiches last Monday. He called my sister who said don't take her to the ER. The next morning she was found almost unconscious. The doctors were whispering about the wound on her arm that the dog sitter claims in a ""dog scratch."" They believe that or a tooth infection led to a bacterial blood infection. My sister won't provide any information about the dog sitter. His last name, references, his address (she claims not to know). My mother is currently out of ICU and in rehab but will be released soon. I want all the siblings to contribute to hiring a better health care aide than the dog sitter by my sister gets hostile and my BIL claims I have no say in the matter since they have been the primary caregivers the last few years (only because my mother lives near them while we all live far away)

My mother may be eligible for 6 hours of help from a home health care aide but they only reimburse up to $14/hour. My sister wants to hire someone for 3 hours but give the rest to the dog sitter although he isn't on their list of approved health care aides. Should I call APS? I feel like it would be difficult to prove anything."
"My father was recently moved to an assisted living center after he was discharged from the hospital.  He had fallen repeatedly, and my mother wouldn’t get a home health aide…so he fell and broke his leg.  He’s supposed to be in the assisted living center until he has recovered, with physical therapy, although he isn’t really trying.

My mother has been banned from the assisted living center.

Apparently she tried to give medication to my father instead of turning over all medication to the assisted living center staff and letting them handle it.  She’s a scientist but not a doctor.

Is this common?  Other than from trying to get my mother to follow the rules, any suggestions about anything I should do here?  My brother and I both live far away and he alerted me to this.

Thanks."
"My MIL(79) is a widow the past 20 years. She still lives alone but we’re thinking that won’t last too much longer due to her health decline. 

Every bedroom, closet, pantry, cabinet, drawer is packed to the brim with newspapers, plastic containers, plastic utensils, paper cups, magazines, paper clippings…. 

Her counters and tables are covered in random knickknacks and papers. 

Her floors are clear and clean and her home is kept clean. It’s just so much JUNK. 

Last year her water heater leaked and I cleaned out the entire pantry of years worth of papers and plastic containers. 
It is now refilled to the brim just the way I found it last year. 

The day after the water heater leaked her deep freezer died. So I had to do the same cleanup in the laundry room. PLUS empty the freezer of 30 year old thawed food. 

My SO works out of the country most of the year so he wasn’t able to help. 

This list goes on and one. 

Yesterday I moved garbage bags and boxes of old newspapers and magazines in order to clear her entryway for emergency purposes. I got her permission to move these things first. 

But then she panicked and said she had to go through every magazine and newspaper before we recycle anything.  All I was doing was moving them not tossing them. I never mentioned tossing them.

I am a very patient person and I can bite my tongue like no other. But inside I’m angry and frustrated. 

When she passes it’s going to be such a huge pain to go through all this junk. 

I know I should just keep my mouth shut and just keep the floors clear of clutter. 

Anyone else deal with this before?"
"Now my 78 year old Mom, who’s been living with me for a little over 3 years, is telling my 2 brothers and God only knows who that I’m forcing her change her will and cut both brothers out of it! Ohmygoodness! And she’s being over-the-top nice to me while I help her look for a Memory Care facility. She knows she’s in bad shape mentally but cannot help herself because of the Paranoia her Dementia has brought on!  

I need help to find her a place that isn’t private-pay only and soon."
"My father, just turned 70, has vascular dementia and Parkinsons.  I live at home to help my mom take care of him.

In the mornings and afternoons, he's usually pretty good.  Decently ambulatory (if I little unsteady on his feet), and very with it mentally.  Loves to read science magazines and news articles about the space program.  We actually had a fun time today watching the Astra rocket pull a Tokyo Drift and then get blown up after it lost control a minute into flight.

But the evenings....fuck me.  His confusion about things around him becomes nearly impossible to deal with.  He can't tell where in the house he is, his speech is nearly incomprehensible (which he knows, and it frustrates him to the point of swearing at himself), he mistakes objects for other objects and tries to do the wrong things with them, then gets angry when it doesn't go right or we have to take it away for his own safety (tonight he unscrewed the salt shaker and tried to drink from it).

Compounding the issue is him being a hardcore alcoholic.  Nearly a bottle each of wine and a bottle of Port every day.

We really want to get him detoxed, and we really want to get him at the very least into a temporary treatment facility.  But between Covid and his health issues, there is only one place in the entire Portland area that will take him, and they will ONLY take him if he goes voluntarily.  The next closest is in Bellingham, WA.  I'll save you the google maps look up, it's 262 miles away.  And because of the health issues he HAS to detox in a medical facility.  Going sober at home would probably kill him.

I'm doing my best to be understanding, to not argue with him unless it's for his own safety, to try and let him make his own decisions and then help him get there....but it's wearing me down hard.  My mother is doing even worse mentally than I am, and she's also dealing with her own aging body that doesn't give her nearly enough energy to get everything done she needs to do AND deal with dad.  I'm sick to my stomach every morning, I'm not sleeping well, and even though the weather has cooled noticeably, I begin sweating rather hard in the evenings as the oncoming stress ball starts to hit.

His doctors basically say they can't do much unless he agrees to it, and he's stubbornly refusing to.  Mom has power of attorney but even when he's had to be taken to the ER she hasn't been able to use it because he always manages to show just enough cognition to avoid that.

My job is starting to come back.  Which means I'll be away from home all day and into the early morning a few days a week.  Meaning mom will be by herself, and that frightens both her and me.

I don't know what to do.  If anyone has any ideas, especially ones that can be found in the Portland area (specifically Clackamas County), I'd be most grateful."
"Hey all, covid has hit my family pretty hard. Me, my father, and mother caught a mild case of it in March but it hit my dad the hardest due to his underlying conditions. Long story short, he had to have his leg amputated because he ended up getting a diabetic foot ulcer that got infected and started spreading. He is now pretty much dependent on me and my mother except my mom can't really help because she's legally blind and is also dependent on me... I'm a 5'2"" 95lb girl and my dad's a 5'8"" 180lb+ guy and me and my mother cannot lift him when he ""falls"" (he doesn't actually fall. When he attempts transfers to the wheelchair or another sitting area and fails, he slowly slides down until he's sitting). We're both too physically small and weak to lift him.

He was given rehab and doing well post-surgery until we got him vaccinated for covid which caused him to become very weak and start falling again. He was re-admitted, built his strength up, discharged, and was doing well again... until he got his 2nd shot a couple days ago. 

He has been in and out of hospitals and rehab centers since March. Here's a timeline:

March --> Hospitalized for covid

April --> Discharged, cleared of covid but then readmitted because he got diabetic foot ulcer at home

May --> First amputation, they did it below the knee. Discharged. 

June --> Readmitted because the amputation got re-infected at home. They amputated above the knee this time. It healed and they discharged him.

July --> First covid shot. Readmitted because of muscle weakness and he kept falling at home.

August --> They built his strength back up and discharged him a week ago. We got him his 2nd shot and now he's weak again. He was taken back to the hospital and I think he'll go back to rehab there.

I really don't know what to do. I don't think it's safe for him to come home because me and my mom are incapable of helping him to the fullest capacity he might need (aka worst case scenarios where he falls and we're both not home because we work full-time jobs). I want him to go to a nursing home or a care facility but my dad doesn't want that and I don't have POA. I've read some stories on here though that I may be able to tell the hospital that it's unsafe for him to come home and they could find a place he'll be cared for? I feel like I have a pretty solid case since he keeps going back. Any advice?

Side-note: I think he would be alright if he had a prosthetic which we're working on (he's retired military so we're trying to go through the VA because that's what the doctors have told him to do). So him being in a care facility until he gets a prosthetic is the ideal scenario for us.

Other info: He has medicare A+B and tricare for life"
"I made a post a couple of days ago about losing my mum. Today, is her 3rd day. Time flies and yet the sadness remains. The intensity is still the same too but since I took a pill to calm my nerves I feel okay. I am 37 if that matters and maybe in the post I may not sound like an adult. I have been crying so that's great. It comes and goes just like waves as someone told me here. Some waves are stronger than others. Some take my breath away with it's intensity. Some touch me but they aren't strong and feel like a small touch.

I had extreme anxiety for years about my mum dying and I not knowing how I would deal with it all. It was so bad that sometimes, when she'd travel I wouldn't be able to sleep till I knew she has reached. I'd just be in 'continuous panic mode."" No one knew that except just me. At certain phases of my life I think I had become obsessed about taking care of her. Can't really remember which ones anymore. And more recently, after her numerous hospitalisations and my going back to care for her, I actually became numb and just spaced out. Even from her. I couldn't take it. I was mentally exhausted and emotionally weakened. I was angry that my dad didn't do much or enough and nor did my sister. To the extent that to preserve my sanity I stayed away. Even from mum. Not the best thing is it ? I hate myself for all these times. I wish I hadn't become so depressed and anxious over my mum's health, so tired of my own life dragging it's feet and so ashamed of my own fucking existence that I actually couldn't find the energy to speak to her, sometimes for days. There were times I could have come down and maybe helped change things but I didn't I just couldn't. I recently, however had started calling her more often and even ended up wearing the earrings she gifted me. 

Sadly, I am not a strong person and wasn't a strong daughter either. I wish I could have done more for mum and I wish that my own life hadn't dragged me down so badly coupled with my fear of losing her that I actually became paralysed in time to do anything. I try to find ways to forgive me but I don't think I ever will. I hate that my own existence made me a difficult person for the longest time. I hate that I couldn't ever show her how much she meant and how much I loved her. I hate that my best friend is gone. The love of my life is no more. I hate that she left me and I know she couldn't live much longer. She was tired she was suffering too much. I hate that my departure abroad left her lonely and depressed despite my best to call her every day or whenever I could. I hate that I decided to leave but I know I was going crazy and would resent a lot of everything and not giving myself a chance. And now I wonder what was the point in all of that ? I didn't realise what I meant to her. I am sorry so sorry for that. I hate that today the roles are reversed and she is the one that left me. Forever. I'll never get to hold her again or call her and hear her soothing voice. share my worries, joys, shopping stories, or just life itself. I am typing this and I am crying. When I cry too much my sis gets angry at me and I don't even know why because when she tears up I don't force her to stop. It's like I am not even allowed to mourn. I remember crying in front of my mum hugging her and crying and she'd just let me. I miss her. Now, I have visits with her grave. And it's the hardest thing on earth. She was, is and will always be my best friend. I realise I am nothing without her. That I need her more than anything else. I wish there was a way to get her back. 

A person I thought was my friend, made me realise that I was demoted to the acquaintance level when I messaged her about my mum's passing and all she did was send me a text of condolence. She couldn't even care less to call. Or even ask the day after how was I coping ? I have decided to let go of such friendships. Sure one can reason maybe she doesn't know what to say but then don't but just be there ? Another cousin who I regarded very highly called after three days citing no internet (she lives in Europe and in one of the richest countries of the world), I guess landlines were dead too. And when she spoke to me it was like without any heart. It almost seemed like a joke to her. She is an adult and soon to be a mother herself. She didn't even want to talk to us actually but my mum's sister (the latter who broke my mum's heart in many different ways throughout my mum's life. Towards the end she accused my mum and sent back her marriage photos, at a time when my mother was fighting to survive). She didn't even want to talk to my dad I could hear her say no no to her mum. Insanity comes in all sizes. She often says call me if you need me, but fucking never picks up her calls nor replies to messages. I am super saddened. She knew my mum quite a bit. My mum's grandson 19 years refused to come down and see his dying grandmother. His excuse ? Nevermind i won't shre because to me it just seems like a lousy pathetic excuse. He didn't even call to give condolences nothing. He hesistates to even call me 'aunt'. My mom has done so much for this guy and he couldn't come for her ? People are fucked up. I spoke to him yesterday because he is leaving for studies and he didn't even sound sad or anything at the loss of his grandmum. I mean I get his head is elsewhere but seriously she is your grandmum. The one whose house you came and stayed for days. I mean just bloody wow.  In hindsight, the ones who didn't come just because are the ones to whom she mattered very little and I am glad by their absence. 

Truth be told I am actually surviving through Reddit. I am looking for associations that help with bereavement and once I go back I will be contacting them.  

Replies that I get here they help me survive a day or two. So thank you to anyone who takes the time."
"Tonight my wife and I had been invited to join our son for dinner at a place with live music. But as a caregiver, you never really know if what you're planning is really going to happen or not. As I finished getting ready to go, the phone rang, and the caller ID let me know it was from the assisted living.

""Your mom has fallen, she's bleeding from a head wound, paramedics have taken her to the hospital.""

To those who know my father's story, this is how the end began for him. He fell on April 17, was treated and released at the hospital, but over the next weeks his dementia worsened to the point that he had a psychotic breakdown two months later and caused himself serious injury which led to his death. I'm convinced that the fall did some damage that went unseen by the CT scan that was done that day.

So of course all that went through my mind as I heard the words. Instead of the dinner and music, off I went to the hospital where I found my mother with a cut over the top of her right eye and some bruising. Hospital staff worked diligently and quickly. Mom took four stitches and because they said she was slightly dehydrated she got an IV, and she was released.

Conversation with her revealed that at least for now, not much had changed.  She was still a mixture of lucidity and confusion. She did, however, think I was my dad for a while, something that hasn't happened much leading up to this point. ""What are you driving, I thought the car was sold."" ""No, Mom, I have the same car I've had for a long time."" ""How did you get it back from the people who bought it?"" ""Oh, that's your other car, I have my car."" Later she returned to the topic, still unclear as to how my dad might have reclaimed the sold car. 

But what everyone needs to hear came next.  A social worker came in and said, ""I understand you're considering memory care."" I balked. ""Not really; well, maybe someday.  We're concerned that moving her would be very upsetting and probably make things worse than they are now."" Then the thing I had never thought of: ""Have you considered that the falls might not be due to physical failure, but to brain failure?"" Wow, no. No, I had not thought about that.  I figured the falls were due to some form of physical weakness, poor eyesight, and so on.  I had not thought that the falls could be due to mental failure. But it makes sense, I guess, and now having heard that, I definitely must consider it.

As I said in my last post, the palliative care nurse practitioner will visit on Tuesday.  At that time, I will ask this question:

""Paramedics and hospital staff have both indicated to me that they think it's time to give strong consideration to moving my mom to memory care.  Do you agree, or do you see ways we can improve her situation without making that drastic of a move? For example, could she be safe if she moved to a wheelchair?""

I think we all know how this ends.  If the nurse practitioner tells me it's time for memory care, then that will be the next thing to do. I dread it, but Mom's safety must take precedence over everything else.

 But will she be any safer in memory care? What's to stop her from falling there? Or for that matter, what's to stop her from falling if she's in a wheelchair and tries to walk away from it?

I will have to do a lot of thinking over the weekend, and the answers I get from the palliative nurse practitioner will help me a great deal with the tough decisions that are ahead.  Until then, all I can do is hope and pray that my mom will be ok."
"My mom is about to be 67 and is in chronic pain. She's got back issues that have grown worse over the years to the point where she's going to get a spinal cord stimulator soon. I don't know when, exactly, as she's very cagey. 

She's also exhibiting some other symptoms that are potentially related, but are definitely exacerbated by her pain: anger, sleeplessness, moodiness, forgetfulness, impatience. 

To make matters worse, she's a considerable drinker. To my knowledge she isn't taking her pain medications, which is a small relief, but barely as she's clearly self medicating. 

Due to some financial issues in the 2000s, my mom still works. She works at a store and is on her feet constantly. Suggestions to find another line of work have been met with derision. To be fair, she's not overly skilled and given some of her symptoms, I don't feel like she's got the capacity to switch to something more office based. 

My dad is BESIDE himself. He's gone through some health issues of his own but is finally doing better. I think now that he's not in overwhelming pain himself, he's able to see my mom's decline more acutely. They've argued about her health and my mom just shuts down.

She's not a woman who has ever asked for help and won't accept help. She's visibly unhappy. . I think she desperately needs to start meds of some stripe (a lot of this feels like depression manifesting) but how on EARTH do you get someone who is stubborn to even listen to your concerns let alone actually talk to a professional? 

I love my mom.  I'm an only child and while I live relatively close by, I'm not especially close. I have kids, I'm pregnant, plus I work a full time job. I don't know what to do, I don't know how to go about dealing with this, nor do I have anyone to help me as I try to help my mom. 

Any suggestions, recommendations or similar experiences are greatly appreciated."
"In March I joyfully announced to the world that I had successfully moved my parents and had set up for them a wonderful apartment in assisted living, where they would be able to live out their final years together. I wrote twenty installments of that story between the end of March and the first week of July. Things unraveled, my father passed away, and there we were, holding the broken pieces of what was supposed to be a beautiful story.

On July 6, we had the funeral, and I signed off  with a ""goodbye,"" believing that I wouldn't have much more to say.

But now I do, so I'm back.

Widow's syndrome is a very real thing.  My parents celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary in April. My mother had not been without my dad for more than a week since he was in Korea in 1952-53, and now, at 91, she's supposed to rebuild a life without him. It is not going well.

Mom is failing in every way.  The dementia is serious.  She sees Dad almost daily, talks to him, and is immensely frustrated that he doesn't answer her.  Yesterday she woke up in distress, and after help arrived and paramedics were called to her room in the assisted living, she complained that she had called Dad's name at least 15 times and he never came. When she asks me if I've seen him, I tell her the truth, no, but then I add, ""we all miss him very much."" Some days she says she knows he's gone, but it gives her peace to pretend he's not.  However, the pretense isn't all there is, because she's also told me that she believes he goes down to the basement (which doesn't exist, the facility doesn't have a basement) with other men who are entertained by women there and has said if she ever catches him down there she will ""kick his a$$.""

Last Saturday she became so convinced that there's a human trafficking ring operating in the facility that she actually tried to leave and escape becoming a victim.  This is a unique event so unless it's repeated we're not too worried about it.

Physically she's failing too, having fallen twice yesterday, and one fall required a second visit in the day from paramedics. The reason for the visit wasn't really the fall, (she was not injured in either one of yesterday's falls) but by her delusions.  The paramedics said that in their opinion she does not belong in assisted living.  However, those of us who have seen her more than at her worst moments know that she's still ok where she is for the time being.

Today I signed papers for palliative care.  She will be visited by a nurse practitioner, and there are other nurses and a social worker available to help us out, especially if her needs become greater than what the facility can provide.  Also, because this is the ""last step before hospice,"" the palliative care people will be able to tell me the very minute they believe that it's time to transfer her care over to hospice, and I won't miss a single beat in keeping her at the level of care that is most appropriate for her. With these experts on board, the guesswork ""hospice, or not?"" is no longer there.

For those wondering, palliative care and hospice are both paid for by Medicare and are provided at no cost.  If you have an elder loved one who is on or who qualifies for Medicare, you might want to look into palliative care as a way to increase the size of your support team. As I said, in our case, both levels are provided by the same company, which happens to be a non-profit. The company also provides other levels of assistance at no charge depending on what is needed.  For example, after the two falls yesterday, I asked ""if my mother agrees to using a wheelchair, could your agency provide someone who could help her learn how to use it right and help her get used to it?"" The answer was ""yes, all we need is her doctor to agree it's appropriate and it will be provided at no charge.""  So definitely I suggest you look into what might be available in your town.  For us, this is the same agency that provided hospice house care for my dad and impressed us with their sensitive and professional care for him and for our family.

But of course my mom said ""no"" to the wheelchair, despite my best efforts to help her understand how scary her falls are and that if she breaks another bone, as she did in March when she cracked her femoral neck, it could be the end, because they really don't like to put dementia patients under anesthesia.  She said she understood, but no wheelchair, so really, all I can do is wait for the phone call.

My mother is lonely, but a lot of it is by choice.  She refuses to meet the other women who live there, even though some of them are very nice people.  Between the isolation, the mental deterioration, the physical deterioration, and the potential for a very serious injury due to falling, I know it's only a matter of time, maybe just a month or two, before we will have to move her out of the beautiful apartment that my wife and sister-in-law set up in more optimistic times.

It's all a matter of which system fails the hardest and the fastest.  Will it be the mind, sending her to memory care, or the body, when skilled nursing will be the destination?  All we can say right now is that the odds are she will continue to fail fast, and it's very possible that despite the plans we made back in March, we could very well be facing the possibility that both my parents will be gone by the end of the year."
"First off, great community here. So many stories and community support. 

I would like to pose a question to the group. What are things that have made a difference for both you and your parents in terms of services, supports or products? 

Doesn’t have to be health related, but what have you found that helped turn bad days into good days? What helped put a smile on your face?"
"So my aunt thinks I should get a POA on my dad. I havent been to visit him in a couple of weeks because Im still getting some stuff together to talk to him about but like, when do you know when to get POA? I dont wanna just spring it on him without doing everything I can"
"With sadness and heaviness in my heart, today I attended the funeral of my beloved beloved mother. To imagine her in the past tense hasn't sunk in for me yet. I tear up intermittently and I guess she is giving me strength because apart from the initial shock I feel okay. Maybe I am still in shock ? I genuinely hope I find the strength to go on. I feel an immense void. 

I wanted to thank each and everyone who supported me through the last few days and for all the advice. Much appreciated."
"I’m sure many if not most of us have heard this Top 10 number from the Resistant Elders Hit Parade: “I have to go through my things first.”

And you know that they almost never do, actually, “go through” the stuff.  Rather, they are more likely to say this over and over like a mantra, or at most, rearrange stuff into piles. 

Almost none ever gets tossed, given away, or even sorted. 

It’s impossible to make them understand that even if they spent eight hours a day “going through it” and lived to be older than Jeanne Calment, oldest recorded human at age 122, they still don’t have enough time to do it. 

Or maybe they do understand it and the balking is some way of staving off reality. 

I have tried so many times to be helpful and logical, not pushy or rushing, only to be thoroughly defeated by their defiant embrace of this fantasy time dilation that doesn’t exist except to them. 

Reminded of this again recently. My elderly aunt is a hoarder, she is a slob with too much stuff. She once had a lease not renewed because of her slovenly habits and clutter.  At her current apartment, disaster struck last week when her basement unit flooded due to heavy rain (all basement units in fact). The landlord came in to replace her carpets and informed her she had 5 days to arrange temporary removal of all her stuff. “I have to go through my things first,” she said. Obviously not understanding it wasn’t an optional time frame… 

I know they want her out of there permanently, and if she doesn’t get her stuff in storage within 48 hours, I’m worried they will terminate her lease.  

Don’t know why elderly people believe they have unlimited time ahead…"
"My dad has always been a storyteller, embellisher, needy, etc. he no longer has an audience. And i realised today he doesnt want to hold a conversation, he wants to just talk and have someone shut up and listen. he started a conversation or so I thought. When I responded his face looked like I had run over his dog. So from now on ill just let him ramble for a bit. Its funny because he has friends he can call and talk with but he doesnt. I tried for a couple months to get him and the guys in his club to meet on skype once a week and just heard alot excuses why that wouldnt work. their loss.

Anyway, lesson learned today."
"So my dad only recently has started to need someone to help him with reminding him to eat, drink, take meds and bathe. 

He likely only needs someone 2 hours a day and they don't need to be a registered nurse per say.  Any companies I've looked at all had minimum hours they required to send out their employees. 

What's the best place to look for someone to give care that's not necessarily a real nurse, but are there companies or websites for general care givers or even companionship? My issue is not being able to afford an actual nurse pay 28/36$ and hr but needing a company that I can hire someone from that will insure the employee so we are protected if they ever hurt themselves on property.

We are in California, are there specific message boards for care givers I can post on? I have no idea where to start looking for someone or how to vet them? 

He can still get around in his house ok, so Medicare and his insurance have said they don't cover this."
"(Just want to preface this wall of text to say I'm wondering if any of you have had similar experiences with ""no win"" situations. I wanted to share this story in case anyone can relate, and it's cathartic to write it out).

My mom drove herself to the hospital in January because she noticed some chest pain. Doctors found a large blockage and decided she needed double bypass ASAP. She was so bad that she almost didn't make it to the surgery. Surgery went fine and she stayed at the hospital for 2 weeks. The morning she was going to be discharged, she had a massive stroke.

To summarize the last 7 months, she went through acute rehab, sub-acute rehab, and didn't improve at all beyond regaining the ability to swallow. She is bedbound, incontinent, and lost 70 pounds.

Cognitively, she's even worse. She can't tell time, she can't read, she can't figure out a T.V. remote or her phone, she can't do any of her craft hobbies (still suffers from hemiparesis), and has no attention span. She screams all day every day for the nurses/CNAs in her nursing home because she has anxiety and panic attacks until she's too hoarse and tired to continue. She asks Alexa to call the police and set off the fire alarm to get attention -- fortunately neither one of those tactics work. She calls repeatedly to beg me to help her get the nurse's attention, often because she forgets she just had a diaper change (this is her second nursing home, and I think the staff do a great job FWIW). She shows no interest in having a ""normal"" conversation; everything is centered on how to relieve her immediate anxiety. She refuses to do exercises in bed (ensuring she remains bedbound), and shows no interest in rehab. Her memory, surprisingly, is still mostly intact, but she is confused a large portion of the time. She can talk coherently but uses that capability only to complain and scream for attention.

Before all of this, my mom lived by herself, drove, had hobbies and friends, and lived what anyone would consider a normal life. She was sweet, quiet, and would absolutely not want to bother anyone for anything. We had a great relationship. Now she screams at me every day in fits of confusion and anxiety. It's taking a toll on me and her family. Her extended family has visited multiple times but they have started giving up on her, because their presence seems to do no good. As soon as anyone leaves her room, she starts screaming for attention again.

I'm the only family member in the same city. I have power of attorney and all of the responsibility has fallen on me. I visited her nearly every day in the hospital and through rehab, bringing her anything I could to keep her morale up or find things she could do in spite of her disabilities. In the past few weeks, I've started to burn out, realizing that the situation is totally unsalvageable. I only visit every few days now because she seems not to notice (by virtue of not knowing what time/day it is), or care (distracted by her immediate anxiety, and general apathy). I've been unemployed this whole time, putting my career on hold to try and stabilize the situation, and in some ways it did stabilize - just in a really bad spot.

Anyway, I don't know what to do. I can't stand seeing her suffer like this, but at the same time, I don't think there's anything else I can do for her. I would do just about *anything* to help her out of this - she is a great mom and I owe her so much. Now, I'm just devastated and defeated. Has anyone else found themselves dealing with a totally lost cause?"
"Update: I called the last ambulance company that transported her to get a quote. They saw that she had some BLS needs, and they encouraged me to call the case worker back and remind them of this. After two voicemails in which I stated our preferences and the BLS info, I got a call back. The case worker consulted with her manager and arranged for the ambulance based on her aspiration risk. To me, it seems like by next month she will be recovered well enough that won't be a risk any more. So hopefully she will also be recovered enough that I can get her into/out of my little car, as well. I am looking into some lift equipment to see if that might be an option as well. Thank you Redditors!!

Tldr: what do you all do when you need to move your bed bound parents to a clinic for infusions daily? 

Mom is bed-bound in a Skilled Nursing Facility. She needs infusions every day for a week. The clinic which can accommodate her with a hospital bed during the 6 hour infusion is 40 minutes away (1 way). I just found out today that it is up to me to arrange transportation (as well as pay for it, due to transportation not being covered apparently). 
I don't think she could do it with with my car. I would not be able to get her in/out of the car by myself. It would also be challenging for her to sit in the car for the return trip (her limit is about 40 minutes of sitting right now). 
Her illness came on suddenly, so we are new to  all of this. 

Bonus question: Last month she was admitted to the hospital for the infusions, but they say this is not an option now due to covid cases taking up all the available hospital rooms. With it being only me staying with her, and the clinic unable to commit to helping with things like transfer and bed pan needs, I would appreciate some insight. Can I hire someone to help me as we stay with her? If so, who? How do I find them? Or am I approaching this wrong and I need to force them to admit her, even though the covid stuff makes us nervous?"
"Hey all. I'm glad I found this subreddit. I am new to this whole thing. 

My mom is going to be selling her home and downsizing to an apartment in the near future. Looking at what she can afford, pretty much ALL of her furniture is much too big. Her king size bed and LARGE bedroom suite, dining table, etc. I think her couches may be keep-able. We lost my dad last year and she just won't need everything she has now. 

Her stuff is nice, and all pretty new. Has anyone else gone through the process of having to sell off almost an entire house? She also has guest bedroom furniture. 

How have you all gone about downsizing? I'm hoping there is a better way than just putting stuff on FB Marketplace or Craigslist. 

Also, she lives out of state from me (right now, she is moving to where I am) and wouldn't be capable of doing a garage sale all on her own. Also, because of her limited resources, I really need to get the very best price for her belongings that we can. 

I do have some people who live near her that can help in some ways, but its limited. I'd rather now pay to have all her stuff moved here (Tennessee to Kansas) just to put it in storage and sell it off here. 

Any thoughts or assistance would be appreciated."
"Any tricks for this, especially if your parent is highly mobile and handy?"
"My mom has alcohol induced dementia, liver failure, can’t walk etc. she’s verbally and physically abusive to care and you can’t overmedicate her or you’ll kill her because of the liver.

She just got discharged from a behavioral institution with no care plan cause no nursing home will take her.

Who do I turn to to get her placed somewhere? 

My stepfather can’t read and I’m 3 states away. Please help

Location Central Indiana.

I’ve called aging care but all these places are just acronyms and answering machines.

Update: 
Got through to a person at APS. The facility is using scare tactics to get us to take liability for a patient to get my mom off their balance sheet. 

The basics are:

DO NOT PICK THE PATIENT UP

To anyone with a similar situation next of kin and/or POA do not make you liable for their care. Just decision making in that process regardless of what the facility says.

If you have voiced you cannot take care of her placement is their issue not yours."
"Hey all! My parents are aging and I'm nervous that traditional methods of seeing doctors (e.g. make an appointment, see a doctor) may not give them the immediate answers they may need. I don't mean ""Should I go to the ER?"", I mean, ""I'm experiencing something new that I wouldn't necessarily rush to the doctor for, but maybe I also shouldn't wait until my next checkup for it to be checked out.""

Telehealth is a solution I could look into, but I don't see much telehealth geared towards this specifically. Coincidentally, I actually work in the health-tech space and my company has a network of nurses and doctors who act as a first touchpoint for people seeking help (think virtual primary care, but only consultations). It's not used for senior-care so despite the alignment, it's not an exact match.

I would love to take my know-how from my occupation and see what I can apply to help my parents, but I just can't connect the dots because I don't know what to be asking or what to be looking for. Whether it's something I facilitate myself, or encouraging them to begin utilizing a service. 

So my questions are this:  
1) What should I be looking out for? What should I be aware of? What should I be considering as I begin to go down this road?

2) Of the above, or of anything relating to the above, are there any potential apps, services, or solutions I should evaluate? 

Thanks!"
"I am primarily taking care of my grandmother. She just went to the doctor, I had to force her to go for shortness of breath and a sinus infection. She has been staying with me for the last 4 days. She has been in her house a majority of the time since COVID hit. She drives down her driveway to get her mail and doesn’t move much. She will not listen that she needs to move and it would help build her lung capacity. She lives in a split level house and is afraid to go back home. I cannot continue to provide at my house. She doesn’t leave the chair except to go to the bathroom a couple of times a day. 

I do not know what to do anymore she thinks everything was fine until last week. I have been begging her for months to get moving. Her children do not have a good relationship and she refuses most help unless it is from me. 

I’m not sure what I can do at this point. I need advice."
"So, my mum is now put into a rehabilitation center and since a few days hasn't opened her eyes. She is breathing peacefully though for which I am grateful.

I am unfortunately despite my resentment and not wanting to speak to my dad and sis, I am. This is out of helpless and excessive loneliness. I have no one else to speak to. I went to my mum. Sat for almost 30 mins but she just wouldn't wake up to my calls. I even told her, ""wake up so we can fight"" even that didn't help. I m not strong for this and I have no idea how to cope.

"I imagine this situation has come up here before, but I’m new to the sub and maybe this is more unique than I think it is. My wife is hitting a brick wall when she tries to broach the subject, and we need an outside perspective.

In hindsight, there were signs in MIL for a while that we missed. She’d repeat herself a lot, and she’d have some key phrases that she’d repeat every time we saw her. We made it a point to swing by once a week during the pandemic, and after a few months it started to become clear how bad things had gotten. She’d repeat herself five or six times (“this chicken sure is good!” or “those kids are a handful!” every five minutes) or not be able to remember what she did yesterday, even when prompted. Recently, she forgot what one of her favorite foods was, and denied ever having eaten it. She’s very good natured and is generally enjoying herself, so at least she’s not suffering, but her activity level has shrunk down to watching TV with her husband all day and doing laundry, which she will cite as evidence that she’s perfectly fine.

FIL keeps insisting that she’s always been like this, even when confronted with clear differences in behavior from just a few years ago. He’ll occasionally concede otherwise, but then start spinning off excuses and worst case scenarios to avoid the subject (my wife suffers from anxiety, and we’re getting the impression that came from him, as they’re both prone to worry about a problem rather than address it, although my wife is at least aware of it). The big sticking point is that they have long been determined to die in their house and not in any kind of senior facility, as they felt the ones other family members went to were lousy, including her father, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. Knowing that we’ll likely never win that fight, we’re trying to get them to get a home nurse at least part time, but that just gets us more excuses. As far as we know, MIL has not seen any kind of neurologist and has never discussed the matter with her GP. FIL is concerned that, if he takes her, she’ll have to go to a facility, although it’s not clear to us if he thinks she’ll be forced to go (which I imagine is only the case if there are signs of abuse or neglect) or that the doctor will just tell him she should. MIL also has stage 4 cancer, which is currently in remission, but will likely give her 5-10 years left. It has crossed our minds that he might just be stalling until something happens that takes the decision out of his hands, as decision-making often triggers his anxiety.

A dynamic that makes this much more difficult is that my in-laws were a little bubble of codependency for years, and they often teamed up against my wife to enforce heir irrational behavior (nothing violent or dangerous, more like “always lock every window, or gangs will break in and murder us all” despite living in a quiet, suburban neighborhood). This dynamic seems to still be at play, and while half of their gaslighting duo is mostly out of commission, the result is the same.

We’ve considered going behind their backs and informing their doctor of our concerns, but we’re worried that, if they figured we were involved, that will lead them to keep us in the dark so we can’t interfere. We’re also open the the possibility that this isn’t dementia, but could be a side effect of cancer meds or their general isolation due to COVID and their general lack of mobility, and it drives us crazy to think she could be suffering from something that could be solved by switching up her pills or taking an art class on Zoom. Right now, we just want them to take the first step and see a doctor about this specific issue, and we’ve been hitting our heads against a wall for at least six months while FIL keeps moving goalposts and spitting platitudes. What have y’all done that worked?"

They have long term care insurance but I’ve heard there is a long out of pocket payment period before it kicks in. I’d like to get going on this. What advice do you have?"
"My dad had a stroke years ago, and my mom does most of the heavy lifting when it comes to his care. I run their errands, take them places, try to make sure she gets a break here and there to breathe and he gets to do something, even if it's small, to feel good. Several days a week I take him back and forth to dialysis.

It's not a lot, but I just sometimes wish I had a week to be alone. I planned a vacation amidst having personal money/transportation issues. With the help if my partner we managed to swing it and it seems everyone is having a good time. Today is the last day for the trip and my mom sticks her head in the doorway of the bedroom and says, ""so you guys aren't planning on going out today?""

I was exasperated and just sighed and ask her where she would like to go. Like a petulant child she says never mind and sulks off. I'm going to plan a dinner so we can all go out one last time but damnit. I spent this whole week being around someone. I'm just like her, I want time to myself. She's gotten a room basically to herself where she can close the door. Unfortunately my dad's side (who we always invite) invited another family member and so I've shared a small bed with my partner and a space with my cousin who, though I love dearly, is still in what I'd like to have as personal space.

My partner and I haven't even had a chance to go out by ourselves. I'm just frustrated.. I know she deserves this break but I wish I was thought of too. I don't have brothers or sisters to lean on. I get tired too."
"I’m a 27 year old male, and both of my parents are turning 54 this year. Both of them have been smoking since before I was born. I’ve seen my dad quit (months at a time) on multiple occasions. He could never permanently kick the habit. The amount of cigs they smoked always concerned me growing up, but it wasn’t my place (or so I felt) to say anything at the time.

Now that I’m older, and might I add - I have a baby on the way, I’ve increasingly grown concerned about the smoking. On top of that, my dad is low key alcoholic now. Both are the best parents I could ever ask for and I love them so much, but they’re getting older now and I’m concerned about lung cancer and other issues that smoking may bring. 

My two sisters and I have been so concerned about it cause my nieces and nephews are attached to our parents, so it word hurt really bad if they got sick so early. I want them around for my own child’s life too.

My sisters and I want to express our concern, but we don’t want to offend them or make them feel any embarrassment. On the other hand, Part of me believes that since they are nearing retirement age, who’s to say how they live their lives? What’s the best way to go about this?"
Each time I think: I dont want more relatives!
"Hi all, I'm curious if any family caregivers have taken on other caregiving jobs with other families in their area."
"Need advice for 78 year old father. 35F daughter here.
We’ve realized over the years he is narcissistic, OCD, highly sensitive, and may be on the spectrum.
Growing up, the days I was with my dad were awful. He was angry, controlling and a perfectionist. He would constantly judge people by their looks and skin color and tell me how big a woman’s butt was that he went on a date with. He made me walk through Macy’s cosmetics aisle to look at women and see if any were single. He is rude to everyone in a service job.

His biggest issue that continues to impact me is that he’s a thought vocalizer. Every useless thought that pops into his head he expects you to listen to him talk about it. And he’s loud and demands attention.
He has zero friends and could never keep a Girlfriend or wife, therefore very much alone.
I’m his only child 35f but I live a plane ride away. I have two toddlers at home. When my father comes to visit once a year, I become anxious and depressed about having him in my house. I basically go silent. He talks non stop, over my four year old who is also a chatter box. My father shows little interest in other people. He will ask you a question then after you finish the first sentence, he starts talking again. He never takes fault for his actions. 
He walks down our stairs and we are trying to make breakfast and focus on meeting our kids needs and he’s immediately rambling.

I’m not sure my dad knows the real me, I realized all of this when I 13 or so and have basically not been myself around him since. Things are easier on me when I go to visit him because my husband, kids and I can get a hotel so I see him in smaller doses. Just expensive for a family of 4. But when my dad comes here, he has to stay in our home. And i am absolutely miserable. I cry before the visit and I’m agitated and quiet the entire time he’s here. My husband hates it and wishes I could let it go.
I have too much guilt to not let him stay in my home given he has no one else and only sees his grandkids 1-2 times a year. Also he’s broke. It’s like every person in his life, my mother included, was able to escape him. But I’m stuck and I’m miserable. Is it okay for me to ask him calmly to please stop talking? What is acceptable?"

Thanks to everyone who offered advice on my last post. We followed some advice and contacted our Agency on Aging, explained the situation, and the representative told my mom they were very booked for caregivers right now. Repeated calls gave the same generic response. 

Meanwhile mom has continued to get worse and worse. Her PD medication seemed to be having adverse effects (weaning off of it now), and her bladder situation is now uncontrollable. It requires all her strength to get to the bathroom. Her 7/10 soilage rate is now up to a 9.5/10. Pee towels everywhere. Stains on our couch. Diaper bags always full. 

Between all of her issues, 40 hour weeks at my job and producing my album with my band, I am definitely starting to break. I used to have little to no anxiety but now it consumes me. I worry constantly about my mom, my job performance, my responsibilities around the house, trying to squeeze in my hobbies…. everything. It’s just too much. I can’t focus on one thing for more than 10 seconds before i start to worry. It affects me at my job. Sometimes while I drive. I need help. But i don’t know how I can get help when my mom doesn’t have anyone to take care of her. 

Advice needed desperately. We need help ASAP, today if possible I don’t know how much longer i can go on like this. 


additional details : We are both covered by medicaid and she receives disability social security. We live in PA, USA"
"Last night after a long time, my sister, dad and I were sitting and having some discussions about mum and everything else. For context, my mum is in a critical condition and is in a rehabilitation center after days of hospitalisation. She is on 24/7 respiratory support, feeding tube and has other complications. She doesn't talk much and fluctuates between wakefulness and sleep. This is an extremely tough time. She also has mild dementia.

I (37 F) am unmarried, unemployed, and have no children. None of this is by choice and god knows I struggle big time... to give some context.

I have an elder sister (44 F) married (perhaps might be separating I don't know), two adult kids, a job.

For the record as in my previous posts, my sister and I don't particularly get along. She is hot-tempered, and makes everything about her, plays victim and with her it's like walking on eggshells never know when she might get offended. And basically you can never say anything to her, she's easily ticked.

Since the past three years and a half, I decided to move away from my parents and live abroad. However, I struggle tbh. And within this time my mother has fallen sick and being hospitalised about 4 times. All of those times, despite everything and sometimes at the risk of losing my contractual job, I have come to take care of her and dad. At one point, I had to make back to back travel from my country to my parents and since my work holidays were getting over and I didn't know the rules of the country I am in, I went back and at the cost of losing the said job I came back to my parents(I wasn't allowed to leave as it was a job by the region difficult to explain). And they both were hospitalised. At that time before leaving, I had asked my sister if she could send her daughter (20 years) on vacation at that time, she said no. It was just a temporary request till I could find a way back. I was extremely hurt and the excuses she made were enormous. She herself came after everything was over citing she couldn't get leaves. She's the closest in distance to my parents. Me it takes two days travel. Anyway, even when she would come she'd have this attitude to her. Speak as if she was doing me a favour. The next time in november my mum was sick again and my father was in depression. I went down again leaving a training this time. We had to rehospitalise my mother. And then eventually shift her to an old age home to be taken care of. I did everything at that time. My father was there but was of little help. My sister, whenever she spoke had this air of superiority telling me how to do things when unaware of the realities of the ground. Plus, I had to tell her and explain that parents are getting old and many other things which seemed to have escaped her tiny brain. She wasn't even supportive to me despite asking. All she 'd say is I am alone too. Not correct she was surrounded by her children and husband. He had even come down to see what was happening but did nothing except visit a few centers with my dad. I had to even call an emotional distress helpline because there was no one to talk to. After that, I made the efforts to get the house cleaned it was literally like a garbage bin. Here too, my sister had to be told to help me, she didn't want to after some past experiences.

My parents have always been like ""forget it, she's like that. Some people are like that."" I have actually gone into therapy because of the toxicity in my family and my own past and the way I led life thanks to finding no support from anywhere. In the house, I am considered I believe, to have no issues at all. I have tons of them and no one really cares.

Unfortunately, this time my mum fell sick again and was hospitalised. I wasn't able to come down as I lost my official documents to enter the country and so the reapplication took time. However, I made it after a lot of tears and distress. When I came down, I saw my mum and she was super happy. The next day her condition deteriorated and the doctor told us she'd have to be let go. I didn't get any time with her alone and there were things I wanted to say to her, my future etc. I asked for a minute alone and my sister took offense. Anyway, from then on, I fight my way. Thankfully, it was a false alarm and my mum is doing okay struggling but :) and is in a rehabilitation center. LAst night, my dad patted my sister's arm saying, ""it's all because of you and I commend you on your help."" I was obviously gutted because he has never praised me before this for doing anything for mum or them. I have been his replacement husband in my mum's life for a long while as he was awlays absent and the family dynamic their marriage was is a toxic mess. For the longest time, I recall I have been made to feel guilty for having left home and he asked me on several occassions to even come back and take care of her. It was my sister's mother-in-law, who at one of the dinners last year, told my dad to appreciate me and even then he said no no both daughters did equally.  Not true.

The problem is my sister is able to help out much more financially than I ever can. In fact, my contribution is hardly recognised as anything just like my efforts. I send since March whatever little I am able to. My parents feel very bad for my sister and her life and her struggles. They hardly ever say anything to her or correct her behavior vis-a-vis me. It's true that my sister has had a hard life but so have I sadly no one knows it. I was like a headless chicken and kept looking for some affectation or support but never found. My mum would often listen to me talk but poor thing wasn't able to help much. Even she, had a similar reaction to my dad as far as my sis is concerned. She never corrected her. For the last three years and a half my own life is at a standstill because of the frequent coming and going and emotional distress I feel. I myself struggle with anxiety and depression PTSD etc... To add cherry to the cake, my mum didn't want to see me there yesterday when I went to visit her and didn't recognise me. And then my dad did this. All said and done, I don't deny her efforts but yes, hurt is a small word for how I feel. 

Edit : I did call my dad out on it and he was like ""yeah but the other times she wasn't that serious."" Clearly, he is joking !

I am unsure what am looking for but genuinely some support would be welcome. Also, any advise on how to go about things from now on ? Or should I leave it and not be so hurt ? Considering the situation ?"
"I wasn't sure who to ask for advice. So here I am.  
Situation:      
- Dad lives in Tennessee
- I live in Denver    
- He had a diabetic kidney failure issue 3 months ago    
- He has been to the hospital then to a rehab     
- His insurance only covers 100 days and that is up today.     

I talked to a case worker at the rehab facility and basically was given 3 options.  
1. Apply for Medicaid, which he doesn't qualify for I assume . (supposed to have less than 2k in assets)    
2. Stay at the rehab place out of pocket. 225 dollars a day with first and last month rent as a deposit 13,500 dollars.     
3. Go to a assisted living facility. 1800 a month for room and board anything else would be ala carte. He needs to have physical therapy and dialysis three times a week.      
Bonus 4. Go to his apt and hire a person to take care of him. However there are stairs and he is in a wheel chair.       
     
      
Currently he is unable to walk or even take care of his basic needs.  At this point I don't know what to do. We don't have a lot of money, and not sure what to do exactly.      
     
Any help would be great.     
      
Update: I was misinformed. He does not have Medicare. I am looking into how to apply for that. He did get a 9 day peer to peer extension."
"I’m really at a loss of how to proceed. I just came home for the first time since COVID and found my parents in a bad situation. My mother is dealing with the consequences of 30+ years of alcoholism and depression. She is drinking about 12 beers a day and continuing to take benzos (I’m in the process of talking to her psychiatrist about weaning her off them but we’re not there yet). That mixed with some alcoholic neuropathy and dementia have made her an extreme fall risk and she’s dealing with constant pain from the many bumps and bruises from falls. She’s also obese, incontinent, and refuses to bathe or change her clothes. Her primary is extremely concerned about her bloodwork and advised me that she could go into liver or kidney failure or seize from an electrolyte imbalance at any time. 

Her caretaker has been my father but he’s 75 with heart problems and mild dementia himself. She keeps him up all night with her demands and it’s definitely taking a toll. He’s lost 10 lbs over the last month and he looks bedraggled. He is barely getting by.

My mother absolutely refuses to get help. I know some resistance is to be expected but she will scream and yell and threaten to kick us all out of the house if we even mention bringing in a “personal assistant”. She refuses to seek treatment for her drinking or even see her primary doctor despite us telling her that she is literally drinking herself to death.

She has been nasty and abusive to me and my siblings my whole life. I’m used to setting boundaries and I’ve found a healthy balance between accepting who she is but also getting my space. But I’m worried about my dad. He is a wonderful human who raised us mostly singlehandedly and protected us from the worst of her abuse. Even with the mild dementia his prognosis is good - according to his doctor he could easily have another 10-15 happy years. I can’t abandon him with her. Any ideas?"
"Hi,
My mom and I have been trying to think of ways to improve the quality of life of my grandma. She has COPD and is bedbound. She’s on oxygen and also cannot move her legs at all. When she moves her arms it’s very shaky and slow. Her mental state fluctuates between completely lucid (but still kind of slow, she’s 81) to completely hallucinating depending on if she wears her CPAP mask, which she is afraid of because she’s claustrophobic. She has to be changed when she has bowel movements and they do this by rolling her onto her side, which causes her immense pain and she has anxiety attacks thinking about it. She also sometimes bleeds out of her belly button when they do this. Her hands are too shaky and slow to use her phone that well.

So I’m looking for help thinking of ways to make it less painful for her to get changed and for activities she can do at home alone between visits. My only idea for changing her is if we could somehow lift her straight up instead of turning her, with a hole to access the diaper. Does something like this exist or can it be made?

My quality of life ideas were a laser pointer to play with her cats, a birdwatching book since my mom took over our bird feeder and put it outside her window, and an iPad. 

I love my grandma a lot. Any help is appreciated. Even just spitballing ideas.

Edit: this received a lot more traction than I was expecting. I can’t reply to everyone individually but I appreciate every comment. Thank you all so much."
"My elderly mother refuses to consider Assisted Living and refuses to have one of my siblings move in with her. She is unstable on her feet and has fallen a couple of times in the past 6 weeks. I'm trying to piece together ways to reassure us that she is ok (she often leaves the phone off the hook). In addition to a medical alert bracelet, I'd like to install cameras in certain areas (kitchen, the bottom of stairs, etc). Of course, I'll skip the bathroom. Any suggestions on affordable cameras that have a mobile app?"
I would like to get a medical alert necklace or bracelet for my elderly mother. She is hearing impaired. Can anyone recommend a brand with a console with a good speaker?
"In the past year my mom has changed drastically late 80s. She lost a lot of weight while she is already petite to begin with. She has high cholesterol, low blood pressure and one of her arteries is not looking good-  her short-term memory is worrysome. She will basically forget a conversation we had 5 minutes earlier. I'm trying to find solutions to make my parents life better in their health but also improve my mom's mental health.

1. She no longer wants to cook but is eating really bad food (fast food) probably bc she is so thin and it's easy. One solution is I want to have meals delivered to my parents at least 3-5x a week. My mom is kind of a picky eater- but I want something healthy for her heart (but not too healthy/modern bc she won't eat it). The food would have to be prepared or maybe just heated it up.She loves spaghetti, any noodles :/ which I don't blame her but aren't the most healthy for her condition. I would say japanese/asian foods and mediterranean as well? Ideally I would love to find a person nearby who can prepare their meals but until I get a recommendation- a meal service that might work? I was thinking maybe sunbasket but a bit skeptical she will like the food. I wish I could find someone local.
2. Finding a trustworthy person to maybe go on walks with my mom? (she needs someone to go with her to motivate. She'll walk when I visit and accompany her but stop when I leave. My dad has bad knees and can't walk far and sister is too busy. I find it hard to trust people into their home. So maybe just walks will help?
3. Any other ideas to keep her more active and creating more social engagement.
4. Also creating a budget bc this could get costly but may be necessary.
5. Some good problem solving ideas/advice is appreciated!"
"I am looking for some help with resources like books, etc., to get started.

In the past year I have stepped in to help my partners parents.  They outwardly appear very successful business owners.  They have very strong personalities and have very high standards for everyone around them, including their children to the point it could be borderline abuse.  My partner is their only child who actually maintains some level of contact with them, the rest have pretty much disowned them and do their own thing.

They started to make some large financial moves last year as the pandemic set in and impacted their business.  It quickly became clear that they were in way over their heads and I stepped in to help guide them through it.  It's been an eye opening process.

I am very concerned about them because they clearly do not have any idea how the world, finance, business, etc., operates.  I think they were incredibly lucky and then managed to find a few good people who helped take care of them.  In the past year, those people are all gone.  They have a very optimistic, everything always turns out fine attitude.  According to their kids, they have been very lucky in life and somehow managed to pull it off every time.

On the business side of things, 20-30 years ago they had a lot of success and made millions.  As far as I can tell for the past 12 years they have been hemorrhaging money from the business (about 2 million).  based on stories from the oldest siblings, I suspect they have been loosing money since the late 90's.  As the pandemic hit, their last employees saw the writing on the wall and jumped ship.  My in-laws know nothing of the business (or business in general), they don't have any documentation, tax returns, titles to things like cars, etc.  They don't know how to do payroll, pay taxes, anything.  It appears this was all handled for them.

The worst issue is that they don't seem to realize or care.  When I ask questions, they jump to blaming other people who have left.  Usually an employee that left 10 years ago!  I am told that these are not things a boss does and they end the conversation.  When I point out they don't have any employees, they say that my partner will handle it. (My partner has their own business, and while willing to help does not want to be an employee or take over their company.  If they had their way, they would not be involved at all.)

Looking forward, they view themselves as ""very rich"" but also consider themselves frugal and estimate their spending at $30-40K per year.  Of what I have seen based on bank statements, I suspect it's well north of $12K/month.

They have no retirement, about $25K in savings, and no other liquid assets.  They have maybe 1-1.5 million in properties, but none of them generate income and all are in such state of disrepair that they are uninhabitable.  They greatly overestimate the value, but I think they would be lucky to get $1.5 million for all of them.  They refuse to sell anything other than their current home, which they expect to finance the purchase of home close to us in a much more expensive part of the country (they want houses that are 2-3x what their house will sell for).

We have had a long, long, conversation over two days in person about this that did not yield much.  My partners father totally trusts his wife, who apparently studied finance, to handle everything financially.  She seems completely unconcerned, had endless excuses where more money will come from, and appears to not have the slightest idea about finance.  ""I don't care"" was her refrain as we tried to show them how long their savings would last.  She does not track expenses, or even reconcile accounts.  She did not seem to even be familiar with the concept of reconciliation.  She does track income to the business and themselves in a check book register, but it's all comingled and fairly pointless without any of the expenses.  (I am not sure she did not realize that she was only tracking income, she kept pointing out how much money they make, and I would show her where that was in the spreadsheet, but it did not cover their expenses.)

My partner and I were setting up to help them buy a house closer to us, as we realized their situation would not allow them to buy one on their own.  After working with them and realizing the depth of their issues, we have decided not to do anything to help them liquify some of their cash.  I don't see a way to change their trajectory until they are completely out of cash... At which point debt becomes a concern.

When we were discussing finances, the mother pulled up the online account for one of their nine credit cards (that we know of) and that card alone had in excess of $40K/year on it!  They still have good credit and pay off their cards every month, but the we're rich attitude is so core to their identity, and they have significant credit available to them, I am really concerned what happens when the bank account hits zero.  (They bought a new very expensive car the first time they met me.  I just assumed it was a long considered and financially justified move as I could not comprehend anything else.  Now I realize it was probably on a total whim to demonstrate their wealth.)

Every time they see us, we get envelopes stuffed with cash, thousands of dollars.  While we put this into a high yield savings account earmarked for them, I know they do this to others too.  If you refuse they will hide it somewhere random and prone to being lost like an outer pocket on a checked bag or under the windshield wiper of you car in the hotel parking lot.

They are not mentally incompetent, they just don't care, are extremally optimistic, and trust almost anyone.  The problem is their spending and importance of looking ""rich"" which results in them to trying to by a monster house that looks extremely wealthy and projects this image that they cultivate.

My challenge/fear is that they are at a fork in the road.  If they drastically change their spending and start to make financially smart moves, they could have a comfortable retirement.  If they don't they will quickly end up broke and penniless.  I don't want to manage their finances for them, or tell them what to buy or not buy.  I just want some reassurance/acknowledgment that they see and understand the situation, but they really don't.

**tl;dr**

How do you protect parents that are at the fork in the road of a decent retirement or financial ruin who are being finically irresponsible and don't seen to realize or even care.

**Questions**

What can we do to make sure that they don't fall victim to scams/theft (it's happened three times that I know of already) and protect them financially without taking over or dictating to them how they spend their money?

How can we have a conversation about their finances and getting them to realize the impact their actions today will have down the road?

What can I do as a somewhat outsider in this case?  Their kids have mostly disowned them and my partner has very limited emotional ability to put up with them, but wants to help.  (They are very tough love past the point of abuse with my partner. It's easier for me to shrug off so I end up being the face for both of us most of the time.)"
"Hi all, I'm new to the sub, thanks for reading.  


Long story short, my dad is 88, litany of health concerns (heart failure, cancer, diabetes) but has recently had to be put in long-term care due to his worsening Alzheimers. 

He was always the greatest guy in the world to strangers and aquaintences, verbally and physically abused my mom, sister and myself. Now that he's in care, I'm really struggling to find a balance where he's supported and my sanity is preserved. There's a lot to his behaviour that's so hard to reconcile. The home would tell us that it's the Alzheimer's...The suicide threats, the tears, the manipulation - accusing my mom of having affairs - she ""got rid of him"" so that she could ""have fun"". This is a 81 year old woman that's been taking care of his every need for 60 years, including toileting help for the last 3. But this is just him. He's been controlling us with these threats and put-downs for the last 40+ years. 

All the nurses see is this kindly old man who is funny and ""the life of the party! we all love him!"" - and we've really been trying to keep a regular visit rotation going - my mom 3-4 times a week, my sister and I 1-2 (we have small kids and careers, so that's what we can managed)... but it's killing us. The entire time we're there is the same old abuse. It's just Alzheimer's layered onto what was already there. 

We checked him out of the home on the weekend to attend a birthday party for my daughter (we're all fully vaxxed) - and the whole time was spent cleaning up after him (he refused to wear a diaper but is incontinent) and him crying and swearing at my mother. Yet to the world, isn't it wonderful he's able to be part of our lives... it's crazy making. The swearing at my mother isnt' new, the incontinence is. If he were kindly the incontinence would be easier to deal with with compassion, but since he refuses to wear anything and this is now the second family event he's pooped himself (and my couch) at I'm at my wits end. The personality traits that make him refuse to wear depends pre-dates Alzheimer's. He makes messes, the women clean it up. 

We get a lot of guilt from his home that even at 5+ visits a week we aren't there enough. Because he cries to whoever listens that no one comes (even though there is a large calendar in his room with all visits clearly marked. My mom is wrecked with guilt but then also killing herself by continuing to care for him.

I don't know what my question is, honestly... I guess, does anyone have a similar family dynamic? How do you deal with guilt from the people who don't know him and the complexity of dementia layered onto an abuser? After the party, I don't know when I can go see him again. Plus he's hyperfixated on my daughter who looks like him and ignores the one who doesn't (which is his typical behavior, not dementia) - which just kills me. It's like we're putting ourselves through hell to support someone who's lived his life to abuse us. Thanks for reading. My hearts with anyone else going through this garbage. It dregges up so many feelings from the past. I feel like a kid being smacked around and ridiculed again, which is just so weird, but it's the truth."
"Hello all
I posted before about my bedridden alcoholic parents. My father passed away this July unexpectedly. My mother is still locked out of his bank account since they never put her name on it. We have a power of attorney form filled out but it’s not submitted anywhere official. She also has a DnR/directive filled out at the hospital. I’m getting her set up with in home support/hospice nurses, but here’s the situation: her landlord asked her to voluntarily vacate a few months ago and I have been working to get her placed somewhere and get rid of all her stuff. We were able to get an extension to September 1st but I’m not going to make it as I’m doing this all by myself. I quit my job at the beginning of august to focus on her care, but I’ve also had to take over weekend caretaker duties for my grandfather which has eaten into my time for mom. What recourse do I have with the landlord? Whwre can I put my mom in the meantime while wait for housing? How can I get through all the family heirlooms and junk quickly and cheaply? I’m struggling and I have very little time."
"So this will be part vent and all asking for advice. Any advice welcome. I just found this sub after realizing none of my friends are going to be going through this for awhile or ever. 

So background: I'm 33, Taking care of my 73 year old mother. She had me at 40, dad died when I was 11. We've been on our own for 20 plus years. She travelled frequently for work and I usually tagged along for the long assignments, was interesting growing up in a variety of places. Brought along a whole host of other issues growing up with no solid home. 

I went off for university and attempted to settle down while she kept travelling for work. I tried following in her footsteps a bit and did my own work travel. That all collapsed a few years ago, both our careers had visa related challenges (mine Brexit, hers scummy employer), she decided to retire near family in a seniors building, and a few months later I came along with no job and barely enough to cover rent. So we battened down the hatches, she couldn't find work at her age but her pension covered her half of rent and bills. I've finally locked down a physically exhausting job, the pay is over minimum wage and that's my focus. We're treading water just making ends meet. Few luxuries. I had unemployment related debt which is nearly paid off, because she lived overseas for so long her Canadian pension is tiny. She had hoped one last assignment would set her up for a decent retirement, but she blew her savings holding out for that last job and had to leave the country before anything was signed.

Since settling down she's developed a host of health issues, neither of us were good about seeing doctors overseas (in her case job security, mine just being a wimp). We're good about remembering prescriptions and doctors appointments for each other. I had hoped our nearby family (her side) would step up a bit but they're going through their own drama and health issues. 

For awhile it worked alright. When I had a job I'd give her half my paycheque for rent and bills, split food costs, pay for our own perscriptions and vices. We would each go for weekly grocery runs and keep tabs on our receipts. Then we fell ass backwards into a pandemic. 

With her being at risk I told her to stay in, pick up a hobby and just wait it out, I'd take care of the shopping. I've done it for a year and a half and unfortunately her shopping trips were her only real exercise. Now she can barely make it to the end of the block without leg pain. I bought her a cane and offered to get her a walker but she's prideful. There was the usual promise of never putting her in a care home, it still holds considering we live near a mismanaged care home and see the results of that life daily. 

We each do our own thing, call each other roommates. I keep her best interests in mind while shopping. She usually does a lot of the housework, which I feel guilty about, but we can't afford a housekeeper or care aid and I'm barely functional after working a shift. We split meals, cooking or dishes. I have zero social life outside of work, try to get away once a year to see friends and get out of our small town but that's it. She sees her sister once a week and that's it for her socializing. It's not a great existence for either of us and I want to improve everything, but with little to no additional expense. 

I'm running into my own health issues, some choice related, others entirely the universe deciding i needed more anxiety and stress in my life. 

I don't really know what I'm looking for, a different job would mean more time to help her out, but wages in our tiny town are stagnant and we're barely squeaking by as it is. I'll be haunting this sub from now on to see if I can glean some knowledge about caring for old folks.

Edit 1: Forgot to add the big reason for my worries now. I found the cheese grater under the sink and the kettle in the fridge. I'm suspecting dementia, it's in the family, and have no clue what to do about it aside from bringing it up and telling her to let me know when she gets confused....not exactly proactive.

Edit 2: Also figure I should mention another hurdle. I'm single, have been since I left my fiancee overseas to take care of her own old folks. I couldn't ask anyone else to join me in this lifestyle, I've tried dating and I wouldn't say cohabitating with my aged mother has been a total dealbreaker, but it sure hasn't helped. Another layer of anxiety."
"My father (87) has a severe cardiac and renal condition. Severe to the point that he would be a candidate for dialysis, but the doctors dismissed it due to their cardiac condition (heart working at 30% of capacity). His situation worsened and was stabilized after several days in hospital. He was released almost completely dependent: he manages to eat by himself, but needs help for all the other things (even raise from bed).  He couldn't barely stand. He improved 0,01% and now he can stand on foot with a huge effort.

We're 3 daughters in our 40's. I've been the most dedicated to them, for sure.

I've always teamed with my older sister, but now she has a baby and is not as available as before (understandable). My younger sister states that as he ""has already improved"", she doesn't consider he needs us so much, so she wont go to help unless she's in the mood to do it. I got raged, then I got very upset. It breaks my heart that they don't see the situation as dramatic as I see it and that -in my opinion- they're prioritizing any other thing before his father's latest days.

I hope I'm wrong (about his lasts days and the dramacy of the situation). But it hurts anyway. :("
"I’m so tired of the pettiness, the cold shoulders, asking me favors, nothing ever being just right, the entitledness, the insults… I’m tired of spending my weekend pissed off about my asshole parent that lives with me."
"Hi all,

My spouse and I (both 31) are going through a tough situation that I would like some help navigating.  There is alot of history but I will try to distill it as much as possible.  

Spouse's mother (MIL) died earlier this year due to non-Covid related (but still sudden/unanticipated) reasons.  Spouse's father (FIL) has a degenerative disorder that left him physically unable to live in my spouse's childhood home alone.  My spouse has a sibling (SIL) that is financially/emotionally unable to help much in this situation (for reasons I'll get to later).  This has left my spouse primarily responsible for convincing FIL to move and taking charge of physically and emotionally dealing with finding FIL a new home, taking care of MIL's estate, etc.

Here's the difficult part of this situation - FIL is a VERY difficult person to deal with.  He was physically/emotionally abusive to spouse and SIL (with SIL getting the worst of it) growing up, and (along with late MIL) has taken the general prerogative that any real issues are ignored and bringing up these issues (including the mentioned abuse) is met with gaslighting  This is largely the reason for SIL drawing hard boundaries and stepping back from the situation entirely.  FIL has a VERY inflated sense of self worth/stature, which coupled with his poor financial management, extreme insecurity, and denial of/refusal to address or mitigate his deteriorating physical condition (which there are multiple options for) makes dealing with him intolerable for long periods of time.  Also, the fact that spouse and I are more successful/making several time more money in our early thirties that he ever did is an obvious sore point for him, to the point that he's begun making up career accomplishments/experience that are obviously fictional.  For all of these reasons I have a very negative opinion of spouse's father (which spouse understands, but I know clouds my judgment in these situations).

Spouse agrees with all of the above.  However, spouse has very deep-seated senses of familial obligation, which has led spouse to overextend physically and emotionally to take care of all of FIL's issues (which he will rarely admit even exist).  I, on the other hand, have a very different relationship with my family.  I don't have the same sense of familial obligation, as to me it often seems that this perspective leads to being taken advantage of, and the ""family-first"" mindset is very often an excuse to be a massive d\*\*\* to your family without fear of any consequences (which, to me, is exactly what is happening here).  On a side note, spouse and I are much closer with my parents, who are divorced but with which we have separate, much more healthy (and two-way) relationships.

I know that how spouse deals with spouse's family is up to spouse.  I ask often about how things are going with FIL, pick up slack around the house when I can, try to be understanding when spouse is upset/irritable after dealing with FIL, etc. But I find it difficult to keep my mouth shut when I feel that spouse is being taken advantage of and spending so much time on helping someone that is wholly unappreciative (and often has not asked for spouse's help).  This whole situation has led to great anxiety for spouse and is a huge time commitment, which along with spouse's very time-intensive career, has led to decreased time for us to spend together and decreased emotional availability of spouse when we are together.  Spouse is separately in therapy to help deal with this, but i see it as an issue that will never end, so long as spouse's father is alive.

Which leads to the meat of the issue.  Spouse feels i am not supportive of spouse in helping with FIL (which I will admit is true and why I'm here seeking advice).  However, I find it hard to support spouse when FIL is so unappreciative, unpleasant, and (I feel) taking advantage of spouse.  Also, the ways in which spouse separately helps FIL affects us both.  We have worked hard on communicating honestly and openly in every other area of our relationship, but this one issue we can't seem to come to an understanding.  I also fully recognize that I am very much in the wrong here, as I have not been as empathetic/supportive as I need to be - i just don't know what that looks like in this situation.  And spouse does not want the increased emotional burden of providing me with the answers.

So, reddit, can you help?  I can clarify anything if needed."
"My dad is experiencing muscle pain in his leg when he gets up in the morning, which lessens when he’s up and moving around. I suspect that part of the problem may be his sleep situation: laying in the same position in his hospital bed all night.

What is the average lifespan of a hospital bed mattress? Anything else I should be looking at?"
"Moms in a small group home now and the transition was sadly easier than I thought it’d be. 

I say sadly because she ended up in emergency 2 mornings in a row when I found her on the floor of her casita and she wouldn’t let me help her up. After the 2nd ER visit they kept her overnight for observation, then admitted her for an additional day. 

The hospitalist was so compassionate and explained our options so well. Mom had x-rays, bloodwork, UTI culture and a CT. We were actually hoping it was a UTI because we could fix that. It wasn’t, and the hospitalist said an MRI could maybe answer what happened but it might also find more issues. Mom has a DNR so we decided since she’d stabilized not to do the MRI. 

The hospitalist did recommend she be discharged to a care facility as she needed more eyes on her and assistance than I could provide at home. So the hospital set me up with a service that suggested care homes in my area. 

I’ve used a nearby home for respite before and was planning on just putting mom there but felt I owed it to her to look at some other places. And I am so glad I did. The first place they took me was so nice that within 15 minutes I was ready to sign mom up. Not that there was anything wrong with my original respite providers home but the new place was so welcoming, busy and homey (is that a word?).

Moms been there for two weeks now and my first impression has borne out and I feel better about the place daily. I visit every day and my interactions with mom are so different now. I’m not stressed over feeding her, her pills, her hygiene - now I can hang with her and relax.

Something did happen with mom though and there’s been a big change in her behavior. She is more subdued and content to sit and watch what’s going on around her. She has also degraded physically and requires her wheelchair to go more than 5 or 6 ft now. 

A month ago she would be insisting I bring her home and not happy about being in a home. But she hasn’t mentioned anything about being in the group home and she’s visibly happy when I show up and not concerned when I leave. 

So it’s sad she had an event and degraded so much mentally and physically. But it was also the right time to place her in a home. In the last 5 years I’ve been helping her we’ve gone from my visiting a few days a week to my taking over finances and household management, to medical management, to hiring in-home care, then finally moving her into a casita in my back yard. 

I’ve tried all along to give her the privacy and independence she wanted, keep her safe, and her home in order. Everything has been baby-steps and so gradual but it’s also been relatively stress free compared to what I see others go through. I’m lucky to be close by and have the time to guide her through end-of-life. I feel for family members who don’t have this privilege and have to manage from a distance. 

So we’re at a good place and I feel the transition went and continues to go well."
"First responders. Police, firemen, EMTs, rescue teams. Everyone loves them and rightly so. They keep disaster from happening and help people in their hour of need. They get saluted, honored and get a 10% discount on baseball tickets. They also get paid and  some have strong unions. 

But last responders? The people who take care of the elderly, the disabled and dying? Not so much.

For anyone who cringes at the term “caregiver” and feels drained and humiliated by it rather than empowered… you are a last responder and you are just as critical as first responders are.

But you don’t get honored, you don’t get paid, you don’t even get recognized by your own family sometimes, much less the government or society. No discounts for you. No free tickets. No salutes.

You are sometimes the last person to respond with care while others have noped out.

Call yourself proudly what you are!"
"Me 37 F and sibling 44 F-

My  mum (75 F) has recently been readmitted to the hospital as her  condition detriorated. I arrived after much delay (due to official  paperwork missing) while my sis for once was before me. Usually,  whenever my mum falls sick it's always been me that goes and my sister  often has a very laxed attitude. If you ask her this, she'll deny it.  Anyway, the story is when I arrived I went to see my mum and she seemed  slightly okay.

The next day her  condition deteriorated however, and the doctor told us to prepare  ourselves as we might have to let her go via sedation and some other  procedure. I at that time was home, and unwell and just didn't have the  energy so decided to go a bit later in the day to visit mum. However, my  sis called and informed her discussion alone with the doc. So, I  rushed. The emotions were high and I thought she will pass away. I mean I  didn't I think understand that it would take a while etc. Anyway, I  wanted to spend some time alone with my mum and also say my goodbyes to  her in private. My sis and dad were there so I requested for a minute to  be with mum. I wanted to share some stuff only with her and I am  extremely discreet as a person so it made me anxious to say anything in  front of two people. Besides I share a surface level relationship with  my sis and dad. To this my sister took offense ( she often does for  every little thing. Even if you request nicely and if it's not in her  plans she gets offended. It's like walking on eggshells. Her classic phrases are, ""everyone just wants to kick my rear or everyone seems to have a problem with me and such things...) I requested  very nicely if I could spend a minute with mum alone. My sis got pissed  and said no, "" whatever you want to say you say in front of us. "" I  didn't wish to, so I said again nicely and literally repeating 'please'  about 4 times before she huffed and puffed and left the room.

Hardly,  some mins had passed and she and dad reentered ( I wasn't planning on  speaking the whole day) and she said ""you asked for a min, I gave you  three mins"". I mean I was really hurt and I told,  ""out of everything,  this is one thing I will never forgive you for. you cannot deny me time  with mum. "" My sis and dad are really bullies. And this isn't the first  time. She accused me of my attitude and trying to gain sympathy? And  also how she always helps me (very bizarre since I don't speak to her  often and so far to the best of my knowledge I have never asked for  anything not even financially).

Anyway,  coming to the topic I don't understand where was i at fault because I  asked nicely. She loves to play victim for everything and it's getting  super tiring. I avoid her like plague if I can but it's just impossible.  She has over the years commented on my body parts, looks, the things I  have (one black bag recently, shoes, underwear and so on...). My  therapist said she is jealous of me and I confirm that. When she says  things you don't come to know but there is a hint of jealousy in  everything. For the record I am not even successful and have very little  in life. No partner, no family. Not by choice.

I'd like to know if I was wrong in asking for some alone time with mum ?

Need to add, my mum is still alive but this happened when the doctors warned us."
"Could this be a sign of dementia or other mental deterioration in an aging parent?

My mother emailed me a few days ago.  Here’s our email exchange:

Her: “I hate to tell you, but [Politician X] is a graduate of [University Y].  I was shocked!  He is a complete selfish idiot and I hate him.  And he plans to run for president!”

(Politician X is a nationally-known elected official around my age.  University Y is where I went to school.  It has about 400 people per class in the school that Politician X and I were in, so our school is not huge.)

Me: “[Politician X] graduated a few years behind me and we have plenty of mutual friends.  We were in the same political club while there. I disagree with his policies but I wouldn’t cal him an idiot.  Based on his educational credentials, he’s smarter than perhaps 99% of people.”

Her: “I know that he is IQ-intelligent but he is a selfish idiot and does not do what’s best for people.  All he thinks about is himself and I hate him.”

Me: “Please turn off the news and don’t read the paper, both for a few days.  You’re attacking friends of my friends.  That does no good.”

I don’t like Politician X’s policies but of course I knew that he went to the same university as I did and I find it incredibly rude to attack someone after I say that we run in the same circles and have mutual friends.

But this is how my mother has been in the past few years: obsessed with politics and full of hate towards the other side.

Is this perhaps a sign of mental deterioration?

Thanks.

EDITED TO ADD: She hates Republicans."
"I’m sure I can’t be the only one with an elderly person who has become fixated on Instacart. The pandemic has probably made it worse.  My mom is really fixated on food and even when she could get around she would buy loads of groceries. She is upset at the idea of being without her favorite food and snacks for even one day, so pretty much every 2-3 days she is putting in orders and wasting tremendous amounts of money. Not to mention that she gets obsessed with following the shoppers’ every move, stressed when they don’t buy something on her list (store doesn’t have it in stock), and frequently frustrated with her iPad…

Of course, she can no longer greet the shopper at the door so I spend a lot of time sitting around waiting for her groceries to come.

If I offer to pick up things on my store runs, she piles on tons of things. Sigh.

Anyone else got an Insta-addict?"
"My elderly parents will be coming to visit us for a few weeks and I am scrambling for a good sleep solution. We will be converting our office to a guest room and I am not sure if I should purchase an air mattress, pull out couch etc? I want them to be as comfortable as possible but when I ask them, they tell me that they can just sleep on our couches and they don't want to put us out. Any recommendations???"
"Situation in brief: my mom is 78, recently had some sort of episode that caused her to physically and mentally/emotionally collapse, is struggling to regain mobility and control, but this is a clear signpost in her decline.  We live together in a house that she has basically lived in all her life and refuses to consider moving. (It’s basically her turtle shell, part of her very person, not something seen as an asset.) The house is owned by both of us, but she retains life estate.  She has about $20K in savings and a minimal amount left in a 401K.  Ie, she just basically has no money except for SS coming in and those assets. 

What should I be doing with an elder care lawyer? I want to be able to protect her minimal assets so they can be directed to her care when she truly becomes incapacitated, but I don’t know what to say when I/we consult with a lawyer. I feel like lawyers are for rich people and they might not think we’re worth taking on.  Also, is it too soon to seek POA? I am in NY.

The house will not go into probate because it passes to me as co-owner upon her death, but we would like to have a will to avoid the hassles we went through when my father died without one. Unfortunately my mom believes if she gets a will, she will soon die or says “I’m not dying yet” and it’s hard to get her to focus on the need for planning.

Newbie tips appreciated."
"Remade the post to clean it up. dad was with his tremors accidentally hitting the 5 star button on his android 2 greatcall/lively phone.   Select ""Options"" > ""View Phone Settings"" > ""Android Settings"" > ""Apps"" > scroll down and select ""Lively"" > Select ""Force Stop"" and then ""Disable"". Once that is complete simply restart the device. After it boots back up, test the CALL 5\* button and now it should no longer do anything. If you receive any Android system updates for your phone, I recommend following these steps again incase it reverts it to default settings. Will disable the 5star button. Im reading that many people have issues with it."
"Hello all,

I've been nearly silent on this sub since my dad died early in July.

Since then I've been to see my mother (91) in assisted living almost every day, but I couldn't go for the past week due to a COVID-related shutdown. Last night, all the staff and residents had tested negative, so the facility reopened to family this morning and I went over at my usual time, around 10:30.

I found my mom with her jewelry box on her lap and she was trying on earrings.  So that's the set-up:

&#x200B;

I:  Wow Mom, you're getting all gussied up today, huh?

Mom:  Well yes, the wedding is at 12:30.

I: Oh, who's getting married?

M:  Well I am!

I:  Really? Who's the lucky guy?

M: I can't remember his name, but there were two of them and I chose him.

I: Wow, you had two guys after you?

M: Yes, that poor other guy sat here and looked so sad, I felt sorry for him.

I:  Was it \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ? (her med tech; before Dad died, he suspected in his dementia that there was something going on between those two!)

M: No, he was the sad one; I picked the other one.

I:  But you're marrying him and you don't know his name?

M:  Well it will come to me. I wonder if after this I will be a Jehovah's Witness?

(I tried hard not to laugh, because no one likes to be laughed at when they're serious. I'm not sure where the JW reference comes from; I do think her med tech might be one, but since he was rejected, who knows about the other ""suitor""?)

M:  One reason I didn't choose (the med tech) was because I asked him to introduce me to his mother and he wouldn't do it.

\---------------------

As per our usual routine, I read her the lunch menu and she said she wasn't hungry today. I know she has snacks in her apartment so I didn't press her.  I had her sign some papers that had come in the mail and, since I wasn't invited to the wedding, returned home.

Since my dad passed, my mother has really fallen hard into her dementia.  She has called me upset because she says Dad keeps coming in and walking around and leaving without saying a word. Sometimes she says he gets in bed with her but still won't talk.  She's also said that he and her mother (deceased in the early 1990's) have been joining her for dinner and then they all end up in bed together.

She has also fallen three times in August, with no apparent injuries, but one of these days she'll hit her head or break a bone and then we will most likely be done in assisted living.  I've already reconciled to myself that she'll be out of that nice apartment soon, probably well before the holidays.  Depending on how she falls, or how her dementia progresses, she'll either be in memory care, skilled nursing, or maybe she will join my dad in death. Her doctor has said he ""wouldn't be against"" the idea of putting her on hospice, even though she doesn't show signs of imminent passing away. I'd have to think about that before we did it.

I've pretty much come to terms with my father's passing.  Every now and then a sadness comes over me, but I know that's normal and I'll experience that from time to time for years to come.  I can honestly say that as I consider everything that happened I have no regrets. I did the best I could, and I'm now trying to care for my mother at the same standard, again with the goal of ""no regrets.""

In the past week when I couldn't see Mom, I was confident that she was being cared for by good people who were doing their best. I remain certain that she is where she belongs for the time being.

*""Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land the LORD your God is giving you."" Exodus 20:12 ESV*"
Seriously there should be a mandatory High School course about caring for an elder parent. This stuff is crazy hard! I’m gonna lose my mind as I try to care for my wonderful Mom who has Dementia with Paranoia off the charts. I moved her in with us only 3 years ago and the past 12 months have been so hard for her and me both. I love her so much and I struggle with how to help her.
"I'm 24 and my dad is 70.

He's lived a rather rough lifestyle, especially the last 20 years— heavy smoking, drinking, going out to the bar, and not consuming the best diet. He's also had health problems on top of that from years prior. He lives in a rural community, 30 minutes from a town and 1 hour from doctors/hospital. He and my mother (now deceased) divorced when I was five and his girlfriend of about 10 years passed away last year.

In the last 7 or so years, he's had some major back injuries which he's never quite recovered from.

Now in the past 3 years, he's had several falling incidents.

\- 3 years ago, he fell and fractured his hip

\-2 years ago, he fell and broke his femur, which required surgery and weeks of PT

\- Last week, he fell and twisted his knee and now he can't put any weight on it

These are just the falls that I know about because he was obviously injured.

Needless to say, he's having trouble getting around. His balance is awful and the 4+ beers he drinks every night doesn't help. He uses his walker, but is downright stubborn when it comes to listening to me or doctors, physical therapy, etc. He can't take care of his trailer anymore, it's filthy with roaches in the drawers and all in the kitchen. It's becoming obvious that he needs help with even basic stuff like going to get water in town. I even notice sometimes that he has urine all over his pants like he can't get to the bathroom fast enough or can't aim-- I'm not sure. 

Now he's gotten to where he doesn't want to drive into town for his appointment (he says he can't see as well) so he calls me up to drive him. When he falls, I'm always the one that comes down for days or weeks to tend to him. 

But I live FOUR HOURS away. I have a business, friends, a serious boyfriend, and a life that I love built in my new town. Though I work remotely, I don't have my office here, the internet is absolute crap at his place, and he's blasting the TV 24/7— so working is hard. He doesn't seem to respect my time or my job and just assumes that I can stay as long as he wants me to. I don't feel appreciated. Whenever I tell him I need to leave for work meetings, it feels like he manipulates me to stay longer or make me feel bad. But when I'm here, I can't sleep, I'm anxious, and inhale an ungodly amount of secondhand smoke.

Still, I'm worried about him out here in the middle of nowhere. Last time he had to call an ambulance, it took them about an hour and they had trouble finding the place. He has friends out here— but all he seems to do is complain about them or that he is alone. 

I want to help him— I really do. I think he's starting to realize that he needs more help, but won't do a dang thing. I am trying to convince him to move closer— at least within an hour drive of me— but he won't have it. He complains about his situation (and a lot of other things) but when I offer solutions, he makes up excuses.

Is it too much to ask of him to move closer to me so I can be a caretaker? I could check in routinely, take him to his appointments, do shopping for him, etc. without it being such a huge burden because of the travel time. 

I feel weird having to tell my dad what he should do when I'm only 24, but I think this is what it's coming to. He still feels like he can do a lot and that he's independent, but falling? Borderline unsanitary living conditions? Me having to drive him to his appointments? It tells a different story.

So some of my questions:

\- Is it wrong of me to get him to move closer?

\-When do I know that it's time to put my foot down? 

\-How do I put my foot down without being selfish? 

\-What do I do if he refuses? It's so hard on me mentally, emotionally, and physically to keep coming to his place. 

TLDR; My dad is not getting around well, and I want him to move closer to me and the life I'm making for myself 4 hours away."
"Curious about something. My dad gets something on his butt, uses creams and such and it will go awat but eventually come back. he wears Depends all day. At times his urine can be seen on the back of the shorts he wears over the Depends. This tells me his undies are full and leaked out a bit. If its out the back does that mean its also out against his skin? In other words could this rash or whatever be like a diaper rash because he needs to change his undies more often? 

The other thought was, since he sits all day in the same position maybe its like a bedsore? I havent looked at it. he told me it was gone but in todays televisit with the doc he talked to her about it. 

He is aware of changing his diapers and is concerns he seems to be peeing more? Says he never used to need to change his diapers as much. Im guessing he didnt ever drink enough water either. he takes a med to help with his peeing...dutasteride-tamulosin.

Anyway will be at the docs friday. I offered to hold his phone during the visit in case he wanted to drop his shorts and she could look, but hse needs to see it in person.

Anyway, any thoughts welcome."
"My mother is approaching 70. She never really worked out, is asthmatic, has drunk and smoked too much for over 30 years and tends to hide more and more in her home.

My father, 71, has always been quite active and social even though he drank and smoked too much too. His baseline is fine in comparison, but he has been in the hospital for a bypass surgery in his leg. 

My mom is simply shrivelling away. Walking up the stairs is too heavy. She doesn't want to go with my dad to meet up with friends at their homes, she even doesnt really want to stop by me or my sister. It asks too much energy of her. And it only gets worse because she doesn't do anything.

It hurts my father mostly. He still wants to be active and go out, but the love of his life is turning into a cinder block keeping him home. He feels guilty when he is out all day and she's at home doing nothing.

A couple of years back I've tried in very blunt and ineffective ways to get her too drink less, move more, stop smoking and just get out of her shell a bit more. This ended in not speaking to eachother for two years, by my choice. In the meantime she ended up in the hospital for livercirroces. Since then she doesn't drink hard liquor anymore, but she still always drinks wine. Were currently on good terms.

I don't want to push her, I know it isn't my responsibility and that pushing won't work. But I'm wondering if there might be  ways to inspire her to make small steps on her own.  Do you have any ideas or experiences that could help this situation?"
"I’ve resolved not to participate in this group by posting my own immediate critical problems with my elderly relatives… God knows we all have our own separate unique problems… rather I want to post positive things or solutions, or if not those, then at least some philosophical musings about this way of life we’ve all been shunted into…

My dad died 2 years ago from cancer, my cat died less than 2 weeks ago and my mom is going downhill (new downturn on what seems likely to be a long and painful no-return). In each case I feel like they “checked out” long before the actual end.  They were “gone” before they were/are actually gone. I would love to know where Hollywood gets these wonderful deathbed endings where words of love are tearfully exchanged before the expiration. In my experience all you get at the end is people (and pets even!) doubling down on their already established personality issues and starting to function on a very primitive self-interested level. It feels like a long slow torture where they give up and die  before they actually pass, and no amount of love and care from you makes any difference.

I can hardly blame terminally ill people (and pets!) for not having the energy to love me any more or even remain mature. I just wonder about myself and what I will be like in the end."
"My grandmother is 94, she's prone to falling, has C. Diff, is diabetic, and has congestive heart failure. Also the meds to reduce fluid are hard on her kidneys and if we don't stay on her she won't drink enough water. Basically she needs someone with her all the time. My mother is usually the one who stays because I now have a 1 year old. My mother has to work though and is going back to work on Monday, she's a senic artist for movies and has to travel for her job so she'll be about 4 hours away. I'm supposed to start watching my grandmother starting Monday. It's not very hard to take care of my grandmaw (not much physical labor) the main problem is there's not an appropriate place that's baby safe, my mom is a bit of a hoarder so the living room is quite crowded with boxes, furniture, small trash my baby finds every time we're there, etc. My mom does want to clean but she's always in pain and severely depressed so it just doesn't happen. The stuff doesn't effect my grandmaw much though because she never goes into the back of the living room because she uses a walker. Also the other problem is there's only one bathroom. My grandmaw's C. Diff is quite chronic and she has bad bathroom habits. Last time I watched her I tried to teach her what to do but her memory is going and she kept forgetting so she kept doing the same gross thing of wiping herself with a cloth washcloth, ""washing"" it by putting bar soap on it and her hands, and washing her hands that way with the bar soap and washcloth. I tried to just be there every time but she didn't want me in there and it would upset her and get her worked up. If my grandmother gets too stressed she'll hallucinate. So I stopped trying instead asking my mom to try to talk to her when she got off her last job. I know she still does it though. Basically the bathroom might look clean but it's very much not and I'm terrified of giving c. Diff to my daughter or myself. I can wash my hands but I won't know if it's anywhere else on my and my daughter likes to put her mouth all over me because she's a teething 1 year old. She's also just learned to walk which is a whole other thing. I love my grandmaw and at one point  would have just been fine with everything but now that I have a child with me I'm not anymore. It's honestly extremely stressful to try and take care of both. We don't have money for daycare and if we did I would basically almost never see my daughter except for 2 days a week when my uncle that lives with my grandmother is off of work. I told my mom I want them to try and find a nurse for my grandmaw because I can't do it for 3-4 months but I'm not sure if they will because of money. Does anyone know of any forms of financial assistance for in home nurses?"
"Of course, it's never a good thing. My MIL is a docile and non-aggressive woman and she wouldn't hurt a fly unless she is pushed to the extreme and she was pushed to the extreme because someone took her plastic cup while she was having a breakfast in the dining area. 

My MIL stood up and asked for her cup back but the other resident wouldn't so my MIL pushed the other lady which made the other lady to fall and in the process hit her head on the corner of table nearby. By miracle, the other lady is OK....

This incident reminded of getting a phone call at work 18 years ago from my kids' daycare saying my daughter pushed another kid. I always tell my kids that you never hurt anybody but you never become bullied yourself, you have rights to protect yourself. The problem is small kids heal really fast but the elderly don't...I almost had a mini-heart-attack at this phone call.

Anyone having similar problems...how did it end for you?"
"Hi, 

My situation is that I have relatively elderly parents who don't  have good control over their finances. Both of them are in their 70s,  and they have been used to spending money as they wish, but their  financial situation doesn't support that any longer.   


about  7 years ago my father had a stroke. Which hasn't incapacitated him but  certainly impacted his executive function. The result is that they are  drawing down their savings much faster than anticipated. He has  continually dipped into his (rapidly dwindling) retirement savings to  pull additional money out.   


They, and specifically my  father, do not have good control over their spending. Packaging arriving  from amazon every day. TThere are  also tons of expenses on vehicles, spending on cable/streaming/cell  phones. 

My father has finally realized that  something needs to give. They don't need wealth management - they know  how much money they can be spending. What they need is someone to help  them set and stick to a budget. You have X dollars to spend this month -  and you can't spend any more.  

&#x200B;

Has anyone worked with someone like this in the past? searching for direct recommendations - thanks in advance."
"I hope he wins this time. But several conditions, his age and the pandemic depression make me think there's no much more ahead. I'm trying not to think. 
I""ve been fearing this situation for decades, now seems that the time to go through it has come. 
I hope I have enough strength to do it while serving him and my family."
"Husband, context: my wife & I bought our first home right before the pandemic hit (Nov 2020). Coincidentally, my mom was about to retire (remember this is all pre-pandemic bliss) and wanted to come see the house day 1, flying from out of state. Next thing we know (yes, my fault for not setting boundaries, but it happened FAST) she convinces us to stay in our home when COVID does hit- giving up her rental.  Now, Aug 2021 she is just HERE. She has shown financially she doesn’t have the money to get her own place or move back home. So now I’m feeling trapped. My wife has taken it particularly hard because she feels robbed of our first home experience and wants Mom out. Even in retirement my mom doesn’t want to travel or fly home to see the grandkids (my sister’s). She’s just content. Being here. Doing nothing. I’m posting because I was thinking of therapy for myself before a friend suggested this subreddit- which has made me feel not alone. I love my Mom (73 years old) but now I also feel like I can’t escape either. End of rant."
"How do you cope with siblings who are basically detached from the caregiving process and when you try to give away a terribly uncomfortable sofa they absolutely loose their noodle on you? I live at the house where I caregiver and I felt this pressure to be doing more by helping to clean out the house. It is absolutely chock a block full of things. When our time comes to an end at this house it is going to be a massive clean up process. I thought I was helping, I found some things that are low value, never used and took photos and sent them to my siblings with an explanation that I am trying to get rid of a few inital things and to ask  and to ask if they can think of anything else that can be donated. Well the trucks coming a few days later and they flip out saying we need a discussion about stuff like that. I though that was what the email was for but I agreed and cancelled the truc and agreed to a discussion about donations in the future. I am not a total dolt, I know this is a sensitive thing and it can make people feel out of control. When they actually look at the email I sent them and at the things I chose to get rid of, they will see I would never get rid of anything of value or that I remotely though they would want. ( I am talking a $60 thrift store table, two glass side table that are so fragile you can't safely put a glass down on the top, a formal sofa.) But their over reaction to this is and treatment of me has let me know how they really feel about my role and what value I bring to the equation. Anyone else having this morning dynamic in their."
"..that I'm glad that I dont have children that make me pass for this anguish again, if they have problems..."
"Hey everyone. I (M21) have live with my mother (60) for several years across several houses. No father or siblings in the picture but her mother (my grandmother) is able to provide limited help, such as meals.

My mother has RA, Parkinson’s disease, an ankle suffering from 2 botched surgeries, and is obese. She used to be able to handle stairs fine but now she can barely move in her own room. She sleeps on the couch downstairs most nights. She can never make it to the bathroom to pee. She has bladder control issues, and as such pees her pants frequently. thankfully our insurance provides diapers, but she has such a hard time getting them on and off most of the time she just doesn’t bother. She pees in buckets, or in her trash can, if she knows she won’t make it to the bathroom, which is about 6/10 times. This morning I woke up to find her pee bucket had spilled onto the floor, which made me late for work cleaning it up. 

She has no leg strength. She has no sense of balance. She cannot stand up for more than a minute or two at a time. Her joints and bones are so weak because she does not use them and she is so heavy. She’s fallen ~3 times in the last 6 months and has gotten worse off with each fall. 

Needless to say, this is putting MASSIVE weight upon me. I work a full time job. I try to work out and stay active, I am in a band with my friends and we are working on an album, but I just feel like my mom is so helpless by herself. She makes it clear to me that I do not have to make sacrifices to take care of her, and while I agree with her I just cannot bear to see her live like this. I want to help her as much as I can to alleviate this miserable life of hers. It makes me want to cry when I see her struggle. I worry about her all the time, especially when I'm not home with her. I just fear that one day I will come home from work or the studio and find her dead, fallen down the steps or choked to death. It makes me never want to leave the house.

I love my mother. And I want to be there for her. I was a bum for the majority of my young adult life and I feel that I need to be here for her. But I didn’t ask to clean up her piss. I feel so trapped. I have goals and ambitions and I almost feel like my mother is holding me back.

Advice appreciated. Additional questions welcomed and encouraged. We need all the help we can get because this is very overwhelming for us right now."
"I don't know what to do about my aunt.

She's in her late 70's and early 80's and she's deteriorating.

She's single with no children. She lives alone in a high rise condo downtown about an hour away from me. She's the last of her siblings and her only family is my dad (her brother in law who she sometimes doesn't get along with, my sister and her kids, and me, my husband and my kids. None of us live close to her. 

She's got a variety of health issues, but she also is resistant to doctors and isn't always clear or truthful when we ask her what's going on. That's kind of hilarious because she has a phd in neuropsychology, so she has just enough medical knowledge to self diagnose and then  bullshit us. 

She says she has an unruptured brain aneurysm, that could burst at an point, which, if it burst will likely kill her. She's clearly in chronic pain. She has sleep apnea, but doesn't use her cpap machine, so she never gets a good night sleep which she has stated she believes is leading to dementia like symptoms.

She has severe ADHD that is more and more uncontrolled which makes it so that she is unable to make or keep appointments, make decisions about her own care, or even keep in touch with us. She also has some childhood trauma that I think makes it hard for her to seek help. I would say it was also generational if she weren't a therapist. 

She has some chronic pain. She's claimed that she has had some vitamin deficiencies that led to bizarre episodes, but I'm skeptical. She lies about having gone to the doctor. I suspect she's lies about that, because she also has a problem with alcohol. It's gotten worse since my mother died in 2011 and even worse since Covid. I would have categorized her as a functioning alcoholic before, but she no longer is.

She does not have a landline, but has had a cell phone for at least 20 years. Unfortunately she frequently loses it. We offered to set her up with ""Find my Iphone"" but while she can manage an iphone, she cannot manage a computer and she will not let us link her phone to us because she thinks we might track her. (She's not really wrong. We might because she goes off the grid and we worry.) 

Lately she's been completely unreachable. She doesn't respond to texts. Her voicemail is full and her work like is disconnected. She was working as a therapist, at least before Covid began. I assume she's not anymore because the phone line has been disconnected for the past month or so. I've taken to calling the front desk of her building to see if they've seen her. The thing is, she is able to call us back from her own number when she's pressed or when she feels like it, so I don't think her phone is lost. I think she's intentionally off the grid.

Yesterday after no one had heard from her in weeks, I called the front desk the lady at the front desk saw her exiting the parking garage very slowly and slumped over. She called 911 and my aunt was taken to the ER with blurry vision, and extremely low blood pressure.

I was working with no childcare, because my nanny had fallen down a flight of stairs the night before and had a concussion, so I called my dad and asked him to go down to the ER and sit with her until she was released and then bring her home.

Per my dad, the ER doc said her blood alcohol level was very high and she had clearly not been eating. He tried to take her to eat before taking her home but they couldn't find any open restaurants in the city. (Suspect. My dad is also aging, possibly with some early dementia linked to Parkinson's. He was also, I think, pretty pissed at her. In retrospect, I should have left work and made my husband leave work so I could go down.)

She clearly needs help and care. She probably needs to be in assisted living with people who will make appointments for her and make her actually keep them. She's not opposed to assisted living and she can afford it, but it would require her to sell either her condo or her rental property and I don't think she has the ability to follow through and make that happen. Even if I do 90% of the legwork, I still need her to make decisions and follow through. And that would require her to answer her phone. I can't even just show up at her house because she lives in a high rise with controlled access and the best I could do would be to hang in her lobby and hope she is still checking her mail, or stand outside the parking garage and try to flag her down. That's assuming that I can get off work and find someone to watch my kids.

Would an assisted living facility even take an alcoholic? I mean, she was drunk in the morning. I called the building at 11am. I'm sure the alcohol isn't helping with the cognitive and other health issues, but even without that, I think she'd still be struggling.

That's not even getting into the driving thing. She was a terrible driver 30 years ago, sober. Now? Terrifying. I haven't ridden in a car with her in decades. Leaving things as they are might result in her killing someone. 

I honestly don't even know what to do or where to start with this. 

I suspect she's able to pull herself together for short periods of time and it would be a real struggle to have her declared incompetent. Also, my entire family would hate me, so that would be fun. 

On top of all that, my dad is also approaching not being able to live alone. He's made some terrible financial choices since mom died. His mobility is declining and he's forgetting things. He lives alone in a second floor condo with stairs. He's also fallen into a racist, right wing, radical rabbit hole which makes him hard to be around. He blamed the homelessness and the inability to find restaurant last night on the Japanese for ""letting skateboarding into the Olympics"". I just... Skateboarding was invented by white surfer dudes in California around the time my dad was born. Most of the kids skateboarding are probably not homeless, they are just kids. Also they didn't just pick it up because it's in the Olympics. It's not exactly easy to just jump on a skateboard for the first time."
"My mother is 72, lives several states away and her general mental and physical well being have been in decline for the past few years. I believe she has early stage dementia but I don't have a diagnosis yet. (Working on that). About six months ago, one of her front teeth, which was already loose, got knocked out in an accident. 

For context, my adult brother lives with her but isn't exactly a caretaker.  He does the bare minimum to keep her fed but for the past year I've been coming there every few months to put out little fires and help as much as I can.

Anyway, she didn't get to a dentist right away and hadn't seen one regularly in a few years. She uses the local community health center for dental care where she lives. They have sliding scales, etc. It's affordable but wait times for appointments are long and they are fairly impersonal, which is understandable given the volume of patients. We finally got her back into the system and through her primary visits. For her to get a partial to replace the missing tooth, they first want to extract six other teeth. She is a lifelong smoker and has not taken great care of her teeth the past few years so this is not shocking. She was scheduled to begin those extractions this week but she is going mental about it. She has already been so despondent about her one missing front tooth. She feels very low about herself and just wants it fixed. Trying to explain that to her  that she has to go through months of more missing teeth and the accompanying trauma might put her over the edge. 

I don't know what my options are. She is only on Medicare so her dental care options are limited. I've looked into supplemental dental insurance so we could get her to a private dentist and (hopefully) more manageable treatment plan.  However most of them appear costly for not a lot of benefit. Any advice about that would be welcome. I could spring for a consultation with a private dentist but can't afford the dental work she would obviously need out of pocket. My brother wants to delay the appointment and look into our options. They all seem bad to me."
"Hey everyone....I'm going to post this in a couple places, because I just can't find an answer through any of the seemingly obvious avenues like calling the medicaid hotline or calling the Dept of Job and Family services.  So, I'm hoping that someone out there has some personal experience with a situation like this and can help me.  

Here's the situation.  Mom has dementia and is currently living alone.  She needs someone to check in on her daily and to take her to appointments and to the grocery store and such.  She also needs someone to manage all of her finances, medicines, utilities and all of that.    Mom currently has money in her savings account to pay for hourly care, but she is going to need to apply for medicaid once she goes into long term care.   For the last year, I have been using my own time and resources to provide mom the care she needs for free because...well...she's my mom.  But as this situation goes on, and I am unable to take another job because of her needs, it would be really nice if I could be getting paid for the time I am spending with her.  HOWEVER, I know that when you apply for Medicaid and they do the 5 year look back, they get grumpy about money that is paid out to family members, and I don't want to create a situation for myself where I end up having to pay back all of the money that I would earn from helping her to a long term care facility before she can qualify for medicaid.    

So, my question is...Is there a way that I can document my hours with mom or a contract I can create before she starts paying me so that it is all legitimate when we go to apply for medicaid?  

I have spent 3 hours today on hold with various agencies and hotlines trying to get an answer to this question...and I'm not sure if people aren't understanding what I am asking or if this is really that weird of a question...but, either way, no one seems to know the answer and they just keep referring me to someone else...  So if anyone out there has any experience with this, I'd be greatly appreciative.  

Mom is located in Ohio if that is helpful."
"My husband’s father is dying of cancer. I am helping in every way I know how but I cannot handle how withdrawn and depressed my husband is. What helped you? What can I say? What can I do?

❤️Thank you"
"My dad has been anxious to go home, he’s making progress but the therapists at his skilled nursing facility aren’t ready to clear him for release yet, but in the last day and a half he’s decided that he needs to leave NOW (he’s citing COVID Delta variant). His house isn’t ready for him to go home yet, but besides that, what are the implications in regards to insurance, medications, etc. if he just… leaves?"
"I'm really at a loss on what to do, maybe some folks here have some experience with this.

My Mom is 70, she has some health problems (probably) of some indeterminate nature.  We don't have a good relationship.  She doesn't have a good relationship with any of her kids.  We're struggling to decide what if anything we can or want to do for her.

Some backstory:  My parents got divorced when I was about 8, it was a bit messy and unpleasant.  Shortly after that, my mom announced she was terminally ill.  This was nearly 30 years ago.  I really have no idea what is true and what isn't with regards to her health.  She generally uses her health to get attention, as an example (One of many many many) a few months ago her doctors said (she says her doctors said, I've never spoken to them) they thought she had a brain tumor and needed a scan immediately.  But they can't get her in for a few months.  A few months go by, and we ask about it, and it's either like it never happened or it was nothing, or she got in a fight with the scan tech and never got an answer, or whatever.  

So long story short, she has maybe some sort of illness of some indeterminate nature.  She does go to doctors frequently, takes crap loads of meds, was on opioids for a long time, might have gotten off them, but in hind sight I doubt it, because at some point she was back on them?  I don't really know.  She smokes like a chimney.  It's difficult for me to take her problems seriously both health and financial when she smokes pretty much non-stop during her waking hours.  For a lot of years, she gave up drinking as she claimed her health problem was related to her liver, then somewhere around 5-10 years ago, she decided it wasn't her liver (?) and now drinks pretty regularly.  

After my parents divorced, she married her third husband.  And that was a neglectful, abusive shit show.  My siblings I think got it worse than I did as I was the youngest, but it wasn't great.  Long story short, things weren't great then, and eventually she divorced him too, yadayadayada, my siblings are all moved out, I move with her to a different cheaper city 150 miles away.  Things aren't great there either, she runs out of money and moves in with her moderately wealthy mother, I move in with my dad.  Things are much better for me, and she does okay with that.  After some many years, she moves into some low income senior housing in the area.  She meets another man.  My grandma passes away and leaves her a substantial amount of money.  

She can't stay in senior housing any more, so she bought a small manufactured home about an hour and a half away from her nearest kids.  We all tried to give her advice on the best areas to live, nearer some of us, also tried to get her to talk to a senior advocate lawyer to help her set up her money.  She ignored it all, bought a place far away from everyone, her new boyfriend from low income housing convinced her to put him on the deed.  He's a piece of garbage, we all know he's a piece of garbage, but things go okay-ish for a few years, until of course they don't.  She breaks up with him, but to do so, she ends up having to sell her home and give him half(ish) the proceeds to get rid of him.  We tell her she needs to get a realtor and put the house on the market, she needs to get as much as she possibly can out of the house to buy a new place and live on the proceeds as best she can.  She ignores us, and sells it at a deep discount to her neighbor, and rents from the new owner at $2k a month.  

She can't afford this long term, and with all the cash from the proceeds of the sale in her account, she no longer qualifies for medicaid, so all her doctors visits, tests, etc. will eat up all her money very quickly, and she won't be able to afford anything, rent or buy.  Over the last weekend, no one could get a hold of her, so my brother drove the 1.5 hours to her house to check on her.  He found her chain smoking in the back yard. Her phone was just on mute, and she was apparently at least vaguely aware of all the missed calls and messages but didn't understand how to do anything about it.  Apparently she was hyper fixated on her house being painted black (the house is being painted, but not black)  Said she hasn't been able to get out of the house for days and has been living on peanut butter.

I have very mixed feelings on what if anything I want to do about all of this.  The reality is, every time we've tried to help her or advise her, she ignores it all anyways, so I may go to some significant trouble only to get nowhere.  I live in a different part of the country, and I reached out to a realtor, and it sounds like there are options down here that she could afford, which would all include HOA fees and the like, so it would almost certainly cost us some money on an ongoing basis to make this happen.  If she does move here, she'd be significantly closer, so I could keep an eye on her, make sure she has food and all of that. But I'm less certain she has the faculties to continue to live independently.  I mean, I can probably stomach going over an hour or two a week to bring her groceries and make sure she hasn't burned the place to the ground, but if she had to move in with me, it would be very bad for my mental health and probably marriage.  

Maybe it's better to let her go broke up there, get back on medicaid and maybe into an assisted living facility that accepts it?  I really don't know what to do here, anybody here have any similar experiences?"
"My mum (75) has been hospitalised again. She suffers from respiratory issues, dementia and is bedridden. She has for the last seven months been shifted to an assisted accommodation. We seem to have issues with the center but for the moment there aren't many centers where beds are available. The option to bring her home is not possible. 

According to my dad, prior to her hospitalisation today, my mum wouldn't speak much, wouldn't eat much and in general was extremely weak and looked tired and slept all the time. She is everything to me. I feel like shit ... and hopeless. 

I am unsure what to do or how to feel. I feel numb. I cried and still am. I understand my dad is doing the best that is possible with the circumstances around that include the country, the help given, the facilties provided, financial issues,  Coronavirus among other situations  we (as a family) find ourselves in.

I don't have friends except one who reads and then replies when or if she wants. I have extended family members who do nothing but put pressure, and increase my anxiety and fight about why so and so member of the family wasn't informed whereas I/ we at that point just need emotional support and not accusations. the latter has happened so many times that it's hard to call them family. 

I feel angry, scared and alone."
"My elderly parents live out of state and my dad’s health has been failing for quite some time (he’s 81). My mom is very difficult and has been resentful of her caregiving duties and the fact that none of her children live in town. 
She told my sister tonight that my dad has really taken a turn for the worse. 
I’ve been dreading this for so long, knowing that, when something happens it will be an emergency. 
I’ve asked them repeatedly to get things in place so if/when a crisis occurs we will be in a better position. 
They refused to move out of their 2 story home where we grew up. They do have power of attorney and long term care insurance. But my sisters and I are not on any of their bank accounts, nor have they done a power of finances. 
In addition, they haven’t purchased cemetery plots or even looked at assisted living to get an idea of where they may want to go. 
Finally, my father owns his business and apparently owes “a lot of money” due to loans he took out to keep it going. He’s still been working even though we have no clue how with his mental decline in addition to physical. It’s to the point where he can no longer work. My mom has said they will have to pay off the loans from their personal account. 
I am uncertain what to do or if I can even do anything since they refuse help or to put any plan in place."
"Mom lives with my husband and I. We were fortunate enough to go visit his parents for a week. Honestly I was dreading it. They are more frail, older, and need help also. Wasn't something I wanted to do woth hardly any time off available  with work. But I knew we needed to do it. However the visit was so enjoyable, and even our relationship changed the minute we got there like when we 1st started dating. It was such a great trip! Coming home I started to dread it but it helped me realize why helping my mom is so different! His parents are more frail but still have each other, they have a companion. His parents still have some routine and like things to be organized. My mom has never been organized. Likes to eat something of variety all the time and doesn't clean up. When she talks her voice and tone is that like a child. People will tell me how cute my mom is because they don't take care of her. Once my dad died at 62 mom never recuperated. Dad was her backbone, her companion, her security. Losing him she slowly declined being more insecure and reverting backwards into a child mentality. Now I understand for myself why it's so frustrating for me and feels so heavy to carry at times. Everyone's situation is different. I have struggled many times myself. Blended family of 4 and it's like I never have been able to get out of taking care of a child. Doesn't change anything or make it any easier, and actually struggle feeling depressed and drained the 2st day back home. But there is comfort being able to put this into perspective and have some understanding and hoping I can do something with this that will help the situation. It's worth a try."
"My mother passed three weeks ago from alcoholism. It wasn’t a good situation so I was only in contact with my father over the phone and the calls were brief. 
Since she passed he has been spending a significant amount of time at my house and is doing some things that concern me- forgetting words, mistaking who he’s talking to, forgetting how to play a board game while playing it.
Yesterday, he was leaving to go back to his house and walked passed his car which was parked on my side of the street. He then crossed the street and started walking down the sidewalk. He paused and then went to his car. When I asked him about it today, he said he had forgotten where he parked. His car was the only one on the street. 
Because I have only had brief contact these last few months, I don’t really know if this is new behavior or perhaps a response to the trauma of my mother dying? He also has Parkinson’s and I know that can lead to dementia.
What are some first steps I should be taking? Do I contact his doctor? 
Thanks in advance for any advice."
"My parents house is falling down on them... literally.  If I call someone to assist,  I'm pretty sure that they will condemn the home and force them out.  My mother is adimate that she will stay in that house until she dies,  but in their 80s with failing health,  they can't keep it in repair.  My mother,  especially,  is fiercely independent and refuses help even from her own grown children. My dad at this point needs to be in assisted living.  How can I approach the subject that they are going to have to accept help? If they won't allow us to help,  I'm afraid that it is going to be forced upon them by the state.   Are there any resources available to help them work through losing some independence? We live in Indiana. I worry about them every day."
"Today is the day we are going to talk to my mother about her memory issues. I’m going to be as gentle as I can be, but I know I’m not the gentlest person, especially when it comes to my mom. (We have had a contentious relationship since about age 13, but not as bad as it could be so I consider myself lucky). 

I have talked to my dad in the past and he didn’t do anything about it. So now my husband and I are going to talk to her, hopefully planting a seed that she needs help. We’re even ready to use our daughter (4 years old) as a slight guilt incentive: we want our daughter to be able to know you without the slips and we want you to know her and remember her as long as possible.  It really sucks that I’m an only child and have no siblings to share this hard road. Forever grateful for my husband and his parents. 

Don’t know why I’m posting. I’m terrified of what will happen. I know she’s going to be mad and not take this well. She doesn’t take any criticism well, even if it’s valid and requested. But knowing I’m not the only one having to do this type of thing helps."
"My mom, who is in her late 60s and has high blood pressure is refusing to get vaccinated. With the Delta variant spreading rapidly, I am feeling overwhelmed with anger and frustration. 

She lives by herself (divorced and not on speaking terms with my dad after a very hostile separation), and if she gets severely ill from COVID, I will be her caregiver as the oldest child. 

Here are all the things my siblings and I have tried and the unsuccessful outcomes: 

1. Enticing her with the benefits of vaccination like more socializing and visiting her grandkids:

>>This didn’t work because she said she doesn’t care if she can’t socialize and if she can’t see her grandkids “that’s too bad” in her own words, said with a shrug. 

2. Guilt tripping: telling her that the unvaccinated are putting others at risk and undermining society’s fight against this pandemic:

>>This didn’t work because she said: “I only care about myself now. I spent too many years being controlled by your father and now I’m gonna do whatever I want to do. I don’t give a damn about society.” My father was in fact controlling, and with her newfound liberation from divorcing him, she’s fixated on doing everything “her way.” 

3. Saying to her “don’t you want your grandkids to have a normal childhood , free of the pandemic?”

>>In response to this she shrugged and said “I can’t be bothered to care about that. I only care about myself.” 

4. Telling her that I care about her and don’t want to see her suffer if she gets very sick 

>>In response to this, she said if she gets Covid and she dies, “oh well. Then what happens after that is your problem.” 

5. Trying to get someone she respects and trusts to talk to her. 

>>I called her doctor but I was told that he can’t really force her unless she reaches out to him (understandable.) My mom says she doesn’t trust the doctor, the media or the government. She’s not religious so there’s no spiritual leader that we can turn to to try to convince her. All her friends are vaccinated but don’t want to get in the middle of this. 

6. Sending articles that support the safety and efficacy of the vaccine 

>>This is a common suggestion but it didn’t work with my mom. First of all, she won’t even read them. If I try to read some excerpts on the phone, she hangs up on me or creates some excuse to leave the conversation. 

***

I’m not so much looking for suggestion as much as just wanting to vent…I love my mom but she is being so selfish and stubborn with this. And I can’t just ignore or pretend it’s not happening because if she gets COVID…it will inevitably impact me in an emotional and practical way. I’m entangled in this whether I want to or not - it’s not a choice. She’s my mom and I can’t “choose not to care.” 

I feel like at this point I just need to brace myself for the likelihood that I’m going to see my mom hooked up to a ventilator eventually…

***

Edit: Thank you so much to everyone who responded here. I can’t tell you how much I appreciate all your thoughtful input and for understanding my frustration. Reading your responses has made me realize that I have every right NOT to put myself at risk for someone who refuses to protect and take care of themselves with the vaccine. It has helped firmly resolve to set boundaries and stick to them. Thank you all so much…I’ve lurked on this sub for a while, and I just really appreciate how sympathetic and understanding people are here."
"Like many of you, I have put my life on hold to caregive and I have to face facts that my old life is gone. I had to move and quit a job and I have distant friends but they are fading away the longer I am here. So,  I feel like I should get smart, get over the guilt and use this time to make a plan. Have any of you done this? How so you make plans? Should I talk to a life coach? I don't really have anyone I can talk this over with.  Any ideas would be very welcome."
"I'm an only child with aging parents. I'm far from the only one, I know. But I'm also childfree by choice in part because I chose my mental health over procreation, and I have no idea how I completely missed the fact that I would have to take care of my parents.

I am literally their retirement plan. My mom likes to tell me that she decided not to go after my real dad for half of his significant 401k when they divorced in 1997, instead accepting his offer to pay for my undergrad degree.* This isn't something I had a say in but she seems to think it entitles her to me paying for retirement care for them. What has she done in the nearly 25 years since? Not save on her own, that's for sure.

She also left her family to move in with my grandma when she was dying of cancer, and now throws tantrums that I won't do the same thing for her (after she acts like it's the first time she's ever heard me say that, every time). It's like I'm the embodiment of some morbid contract she made that again, I didn't have a say in.

She made these sacrifices for her family under the misguided notion that I'd somehow save her. I'm supposed to do the same things for her. This is what my life is to her.

I resent the hell out of this situation. I resent the hell out of her. She wasn't a great mom, she was blackout drunk for a lot of my childhood (even driving around with me in the car during these blackouts). But I'm supposed to drop my life and career and relationships to take care of her.

At the same time, I feel a lot of guilt about this. I'm not a monster (well, not totally). I know she had abusive parents and she never learned the emotional tools one needs to be a good mom or a good person (she likes to hurt you back if you say something that hurts her - I ruined a lot of relationships before I learned that's not acceptable, but I did learn...eventually). I know that she's a person, a human, and deserves dignity and care.

So my question, I guess, is where does grace end and boundaries begin?

*if you've been paying close attention, congratulations. When I say ""my parents"" I really mean my mom and my step-dad. Where are his kids in all this, you may wonder? Nowhere. They're not helping, either monetarily or via emotional labor. It's all me. Another reason I hate this situation so much."
"Hello everyone, I am 23F and my mom (59) was diagnosed with Huntington’s disease (HD) almost 10 years ago. Currently, she is still able to live nearly entirely independently at home. My dad is there to assist with meal prep because she doesn’t do that anymore. He spends time with her in the evenings but he is grumpy and sad about what has happened to our family. Understandably. Mom is currently able to take care of her own personal hygiene needs and taking care of her dog too. She walks with difficulty but hasn’t fallen in months (she’s had 2 falls involving stairs). She sometimes has difficulties swallowing and coughs up her food but rarely. Her communication has suffered and she has trouble with volume control and slurring her words. 

I am in medical school 2.5 hrs away. While she’s still safe at home right now, I still have so much anxiety and fear about what I know is coming slowly. this resulted in me almost taking a year off from school. My parents were not happy with this decision, they want me to keep going and get this done while mom is still stable ish because they’re so so proud of me. They’re my biggest cheerleaders. I love medicine and I am passionate about it but I feel a lot of guilt like I have abandoned my own family for the help of others. And with this career I know I will be unable to be her full time caregiver. 

Our current plan for increasing care as her condition progresses is getting home care or private nursing to come in a few times a week to help with showers and meals. It’s going to be hard but once she loses continence and is unable to clean herself or she is unable to walk independently anymore is when my dad is not willing to be her primary carer anymore and that’s when he wants to transition her into a LTC. I am happy he’s set these boundaries and I agree with them - once she reaches this stage of the disease we understand she will need round the clock care. We already know the LTC she will be going to when it time comes- it is close by, absolutely beautiful, and fancy enough for my moms standards. She was always so elegant and beautiful…. 

The one thing that gives me hope is I will likely be able to move closer to home when I start my residency in 2 years time. Being closer will allow me to be much more helpful and spend more time with her. God I love her so much. 

I don’t even know what I’m asking, really. I just wanted to share my story with people that hopefully understand at least in some way. If anyone has any advice or words or wisdom for me I would really appreciate it… I want to feel better and I want to be able to get through my days without the sadness, grief and guilt that I feel almost constantly. I want to set myself up for a successful life in the future while honouring my mom and making life easier for my dad. I love my mom so much and I don’t want to lose her and knowing it’s coming slowly and going to rob her of her vitality is soul crushing. 

Thank you for reading my very long post. May God bless you all"
"Hello all,

I’m doing anything I can to find help for my mother…

She lives with my grandmother in the Tampa Florida area. 

My grandmother (74) is severely mentally ill. She’s been officially diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. 

She constantly lies about having physical illnesses, despite having a perfect bill of health. She does this to get sympathy and money from people. When my mom and I were kids she use to also intentionally make us sick for attention and money. 

She also has a complete fantasy life that she lives out online with Facebook friends. My mom and I use to keep tabs on her Facebook, but she changed the password so we don’t know how bad it is right now. Last time we heard my grandmother told her friends that her uterine cancer was back (she had a total hysterectomy - not possible, and she’s cancer free), and was engaged to a man in California and they were going to travel the country in his RV. 

My mother moved my grandmother in with her because my grandmother refuses to care for herself or clean, despite being perfectly capable of doing so. She expects my mother to wait on her hand and foot and my mother has to constantly clean up after her since she refuses to do so. The only rooms my mother won’t clean are my grandmother’s bathroom and bedroom, which are in deplorable shape. 

My grandmother is also mentally abusive toward my mom, constantly making degrading remarks about her (and me) and doing everything she can to tear my mother down. There’s a whole lot more to all of it, but I’m doing my best to keep this short. 

My mom is well on her way to a mental breakdown, and she feels completely hopeless because every resource she has reached out to has told her there is nothing that can be done and she’s basically stuck. 

We looked into assisted living and nursing homes, but my mom can’t afford that (nor can I) and my grandmother is perfectly capable of caring for herself even though she refuses to, so she wouldn’t get accepted. 

Is there anything my mom can do to find a different living situation for my grandmother? I don’t want to lose my mom and I feel like I’m going to that if she has to continue on this way."
"My father (81) is falling asleep constantly. My sister found him in his car yesterday at 3:00 PM sleeping. He falls asleep just sitting in a chair even if he’s doing something or with other people. 
He’s in constant pain and no doctor has any clue really what’s wrong or how to treat it (long story but he was on prednisone for many years has severe edema in his legs and nothing helps).
He has owned a business for 50 years and has held onto it for so long. We are finally getting him to sell it and are worried about how he will fill his days. He hasn’t been able to do anything he used to enjoy due to his physical health (golf is one). Could depression be part of this? 
Thanks for any insight."
"I had to change my mom's insurance due to her getting on Medi-cal in California, found her a doctor and waited for 3 weeks for her first appointment on the phone. It was a 'special' new patient appointment, where I expected the dr to talk to us, take a history and arrange to see her in person.

Waited for two hours, the dr finally called us, asked my mom how she was, we started to talk about prescriptions and that they needed to be authorized through the insurance company. She refused to do it even though she could see my mom's entire health history. After 15 minutes she said, 'I have to end the appointment. I can only talk to each patient for 15 milutes.'

Me, in total disbelief, 'My mom has a complex medical history and it will take us a couple of months to get her history to you in 15 minutes bites.'

Dr - 'I'm booked up for 30 days, but you can call every day to see if you can get a same day appt, but I can only see your mom for 15 minutes each time.'

Needless to say I'm looking for a new dr, but I've wasted 3 weeks of time into her pescription time.

I immediately called the insurance company and they are going to file a grievence for me. I'm so upset!"
"My mom is mid eighties and she spends most of the summer with my sister.  My poor sister doesn’t realize that mom is sending her on wild goose chases. She keeps talking about the flashing lights in her bedroom and my sister is checking the smoke detector and the electricity panel, moving furniture in her room around and covering the window. Mom talks about it every morning because it gives her something to talk about. My sister is worrying about mom’s eyesight and her marbles. Because it’s not aimed at me it’s hysterical but I have her for the rest of the year. She’s all there now, and for that I’m thankful, but she’s going to be a devious old lady."
"Moving a parent into assisted living, and part of the paperwork we’ll need to do, is to set up part of his income into a pooled income trust so that he can qualify for medicaid.

I’m finding that they all seem to charge a 10% monthly fee, which seems excessive, given the small amount of work they are doing, and the fact that they keep everything after death.

It seems like there has to be some collusion going on here since they all charge a fixed percentage fee.

Has anyone ever tried negotiating a smaller monthly fee?"
"Before the pandemic, my mother (91) was still driving and doing her own grocery shopping and cooking/feeding herself, but when COVID hit, I had to take over doing all her grocery shopping. I now have to organize her grocery lists, and I make sure she always has food in her kitchen. Also, during the pandemic, so she wouldn't feel so isolated, I would go over and cook dinner from time to time. The thing is, this has morphed into her pressuring me to come over for dinner every single night, and she calls me every afternoon to figure out ""what to do about dinner."" I understand that she's lonely, but I already see her at least twice every day because her cat needs medicine 2x a day. She plays the, ""I just don't know what there is here to eat"" game on me constantly even when I've just completely restocked her pantry and refrigerator the day before. She knows there's food there. She just wants me to handle it. I make sure there's always something there she can just heat up if she doesn't feel like cooking. 

I feel like I have a noose around my neck that just gets tighter and tighter. And if I resist, she pouts.

Edit: Just to reply to a point raised by many of the response, my mother can still cook and feed herself just fine. She can make salads and use the stove with no problem. She can scramble eggs. I usually have a frozen lasagna from Trader Joe's in her freezer, which she can bake in the oven. She likes salmon and tuna steaks, but she's not great at cooking fish, so she likes to have me do that. In the end, I think she wants company more than anything else. But she wants to stay in her home, which is a nice home. She likes reading on her porch and watching deer and birds in the yard. 

I think a suggestion made below that we set certain nights when I'll eat dinner there and certain nights when I don't would be a good approach. 

Also, a little history. My later brother use to eat dinner at her house every night, but then he died suddenly seven years ago. Mom has kind of used the pandemic to rope me back into doing what he did."
"First of all big support for everyone in this sub fighting these tough inevitable battles! Second of all, sorry for the long post and thanks to everyone who takes the time to read it!

Topic is my 78y/o Dad who has several severe health conditions, including almost completely destroyed lungs, several coronary implants that followed two heart attacks, several cancers in the past and more - all that in a body that led very active and not too healthy lifestyle. Since \~5 years ago his condition has significantly deteriorated - latest drawback leaving him only on IV bottles and no food for almost a month due to reaction of a wrong therapy. After a month on intensive care in a hospital he returned to home in a very bad shape - both physically and mentally (very pessimistic, weak, needy, scared and uninterested in anything rather than diseases he is dealing with).

There is a nurse 24/7 at my parent's place who's gonna spend at least a month there to help with the recovery, along with my mother (63) who is not really what you would describe as a care-giver type of person; she has been finding herself very lost in her 'new role' and although she is generally reasonable and healthy person she is very prone to reaching for antidepressants and sleeping pills and is easily triggered.

I (a 30 y/o female species) have been trying to rationalize all of this but periods just leave me too drained and unable to reason properly, practice self-care or live my life without background creeping anxiety and repeating patterns of sad thoughts and incontrollable crying. I get it that all of this is a very normal part of life and something that most frequently cannot be avoided but would appreciate advice for someone who has gone through similar phases in their lives - how did you manage to calm yourselves in times of despair? My father has also always been very co-dependent and needy, both with my Mom and my sister and me and not owning that his conditions are mainly results of a poor lifestyle but always experienced them with self pity and victimizing himself.

Can someone share their insight what is a healthy boundary here? Each time I go to see him which is almost every day, all I listen about is his worsening condition, the unfair path of life that led him there and his regrets. I started thinking he is feeling like he is coming to an end (which as sad it would be wouldn't come as a surprise) but there is nothing I can really do there to make him feel better except from visiting regularly, doing all chores I can, showing love and understanding and sharing optimism. I am trying to be bright and supportive and often bring up random topics in order to occupy his mind with other topics but he always goes back to his health and it is just too overwhelming at moment.

I am maintaining social life at a very high pace however not spending too much time discussing all of this, seeing my close friends occasionally and talking moderately about this but don't want to burden anyone too much really as it is a 'normal' thing just taking too much energy and everyone is tangled in their own difficult battles at the moment; my boyfriend is supportive but not too strong on empathy game and often includes me in activities that require too much energy (bringing friends home, staying late on weekends or simply just over-complicating easy everyday tasks instead of doing them alone and giving me a quiet hour or two). All of this along with full time job and 90 y/o grandma who lives alone also requires care, time and energy leaves me with not too much time and energy to spend on myself which could make me more helpful both for me and for people around me.

Again sorry for the long post, stay safe and take care of yourselves as much as you can!

TLDR; very ill parent in his dawn of life - how to learn to accept the uncertainty and maintain a sane brain. Any personal inputs or resources which have helped you overcome similar situations or you have heard of more than welcome!"
"My mother is aging (60s f) and suffers from psychosis (probably schizophrenia, not dementia). She doesn’t believe she needs treatment because she thinks she’s perfectly fine and that any attempt to treat her is a conspiracy. She doesn’t take medication for her condition and she basically lives like a homeless person (but she lives in a house). She threatened suicide when I told her I wanted to Get her on meds. 

Seeing her decline so rapidly in the span of a few years has been very draining for me mentally, especially because I don’t get to see her often (I live abroad). In the span of 5 years, she lost a bunch of teeth and went from someone who taught me how to take care of myself to someone who drinks Coke every day and doesn’t brush. She looks insane. 

I would love to lead a happy, productive life and learn to make peace with this and not let it hold me back, but sometimes I just find myself thinking about her for hours on end and crying because it’s really hard to witness her decline and I want to save her so badly. 
How do you come to terms with something like this? I guess it’s similar for people whose parents have dementia. 

How are you able to move forward with your life? What do you tell yourself?"
"I'm sure this situation has been experienced before or something similar. Some backstory: My mother is 68 and is currently in the hospital. She has COPD and is there because she was in a badly hypoxic state caused by her refusing to use oxygen. This has led to some other ailments directly caused by the lack of oxygen. This isn't a sudden thing, I've been pushing for her to get oxygen since 2018 and she has been absolutely resistive to it. She has tried to leave the hospital AMA, but has been declared unable to make decisions on her own by a psychiatrist at the hospital, so they won't let her go. She's had some undiagnosed memory issues since 2012 or so because she refuses to go to the doctor. My father died from cancer in 2016 and my uncle (her brother) has been looking after her since then. I managed to convince her somehow to actually go to a doctor last month. She refused all tests, but was prescribed an oxygen concentrator where she was to be on 5L of oxygen 24/7. The use of the oxygen concentrator has been sporadic, mainly to humor me and my uncle. She would put it on when someone would come by, then take it off when they left. She is convinced oxygen killed her mother. My grandmother was a smoker for over 50 years, suffered a total of seven strokes, and died from pneumonia. But yeah, the oxygen did her in. My grandmother died in 1995.

So that leads to the next part of this. I am 32, am married, and live in Alaska. I've lived here for almost 8 years, so I'm quite established here. My mother lives in Florida and lives alone. My uncle lives nearby, but she's alone most of the time. Since my mom will not use oxygen or take care of herself, and was declared incompetent in the hospital, it looks like we may be headed down a path of getting her declared incompetent. This is where things are getting prickly. When my father died, I wanted her to come up to Alaska, which she flatly refused. I offered her a piece of land my wife and I own to build a small house on, next to our house, and it was refused. Fast forward to today. I had a phone call with my uncle and he said we appear to be headed down this path, and he refused to take care of her if she is declared incompetent. My aunt (her sister) who lives in the area also refused, and they both said I would need to handle this. My wife has said that my mom is not welcome at our house (not that she would willingly come here). So I'm basically in a situation where I am getting total resistance from all sides and everyone is looking at me to make a decision.

My mother is a very toxic person. She and I don't have the best relationship. I'm not going into the details, but aside from me, my aunt, and uncle, she has zero friends, and relationships with anyone.

So the situation is that she is going to need help. My uncle is basically going to abandon her to me. I've figured out that there is an expectation that I'm going abandon my marriage and take this on the chin financially, and I'm not going to play that game.

How would you approach this?

UPDATE: The hospital has deemed my mom unable to make decisions for herself. She is totally resistant to assisted living, but it is the only option. I am flying down this weekend to select a facility. The hospital has a placement agency working with me to help find a place for her. I already have access to all the finances as I'm joint on the accounts. I'm going to get POA and sell the assets to make sure my mom is taken care of. The hospital social worker told me that POA is not required to place a family member in assisted living if they have been deemed unable to make decisions for themselves. This is in Florida.

I've also had time to collect myself and think clearly. I appreciate the feedback those of you who responded provided."
"I live about 14 hours away from my parents who are 81(F) and 77(M). 
My father has undiagnosed health issues we think stemming from a misdiagnosis years ago of poly myalgia rheumatica which resulted in his being on prednisone for many years. 
He has a Bakers cyst, his legs are so swollen they look like tree trunks. In addition, over the past year he has declined cognitively as well. 
My mother is very bitter. She took care of her parents who didn’t age well. My sisters and I all live out of state, which she cannot get over (I’ve lived here for over 25 years!).
She’d like everyone to cater to her. 
Every time I talk to her she’s complaining that she “does everything” “there’s nobody to help her” and how my in-laws “planned for everyone to live in their city”
They still live in the house we grew up in and should not be living there anymore. My father is an accident waiting to happen. 
Any suggestion I make or help I offer is met with NO. Then she complains she has no help!!
I literally can’t stand talking to her anymore & listening to her complaints. 
They have advance directives and power of attorney. None of us have access to their finances and there is no plan for moving into a smaller place, assisted living etc."
"My father is 87 and lives alone in his home since my mother died in 2013. Recently I became unemployed and I decided not to renew my lease on my apartment and stay with him until I get back on my feet.

Backstory with him; he has always had a terrible temper and is quick to cuss at someone. He had been occasionally physically abusive to my mother and I vividly remember him pulling a shotgun on her once as a kid. 

Anyway, on top of being temperamental, he tends to be negative in general. He has been bringing up a lot of negative past events with me and one of my other sisters that visits him.

Last week, he was telling me about something in the past that happened with mom. I was listening, as usual, and I said something like, ""That sounds like a tough time."" and he quickly said, ""Let me finish my story, damn you!"" Well, I just let it all out, telling him that it wasn't easy growing up in that house and that he did some terrible things. 

I was sitting beside him and he told me to, ""shut up, damn you!"" and he hit me open fisted on the left side of my face. That's when I packed some clothes and left. I've been staying in a hotel since (I do have some savings). 

He did call later, not to apologize, but to tell me to forget what happened and come home. I told him I was staying in a hotel for now. 

My question is, what should I do now? I don't want to spend all my savings staying in hotels, but I don't want to stay with him either. Does he need a mental evaluation to see if he needs help? What resources are out there and what could I do?"
"As title states, my dad is getting radiation 5 days a week, for 6 weeks. As I understand it the latest appointments he'll be able to get would be at 1:30, with full drive time that's going to mean I'll have less than a half day to handle work, at a new job, that's a once in a decade kind of opportunity. 

I really need some kind of resource that will help me get him to the hospital, and back, including helping him walk to the appointment as the fucking hospital is huge, and a pain in the ass to get anywhere. 

Uber and Lyft would be great but that's him getting dropped off and brought back, it's like a 1/4 mile walk meanwhile. 

Haven't even gotten to the labs, everything else. 

Basically I'm going to need nearly a full time driving resource or quit. 

Fuck.

Edit, I should have mentioned this is in Cleveland Ohio, he and I live in mentor. The hospital system is University Hospitals"
"After 18 months, my mother is finally moving in with me and my husband today.   


I started last January (2020) cleaning out her house. The basement was full to the rafters of stuff. Stuff from the enormous house I grew up in that she didn't have room for in the ""new"" place (which she bought after the divorce in 1999). The belongings of my long-deceased sibling. Stuff from my uni apartment.  Every weekend for six months, I went out, sorted, tossed, organized, packed, coordinated donations, junk removal.    


Then got the house ready for sale. Then sold the house. Then started to look for a house that we could all live in.  Organized, sorted and packed my home. Finally bought a suitable place in January and didn't wildly overpay, the miracle of miracles.   


Took possession in May, started renovating the basement immediately. Did what we could ourselves, hired out the rest. Trades are in high demand, and this was a relatively small job. We were lucky.   


Mom has been with us for about two weeks without the vast majority of her furniture. It's all coming today. She knows it's still too much. But we can deal with that. We also need to get her stamina back. before we sold the house last year, she was very active and go go go. She stayed with some family for the interim and became a bump on a log. I begged her to exercise, keep up her strength. She arrived to us almost crippled.   


I am so angry at this family. They offered to help and frankly, they made things worse. They called to tell me how unsuitable the house was (before we took possession, and they still haven't seen it) They complained about my mom's mobility (that they directly contributed to undermining), and then on two days notice told me she had to be out.  Knowing that our renovations were in the home stretch, but not yet complete. Before we started, I had many conversations with these family members about the reality of taking mom in, the timeline we were working with. I checked in, to make sure it was fine. They lied. That's the only thing I can come up with. I wish they had had the courage to say no. We could have put her in an apartment in this city with her stuff and kept her active.  Instead, I am rehabbing my otherwise healthy mother.   


My husband is wonderful and very supportive. I could not have done this without him.    


Mom will be fine. We can work on her strength, fitness, and stamina. She is already improving just being here.  And her little apartment gives her independence and privacy without worry about finances or safety."
"What the title says. I care for my 80 year old dad. He lives with me and my family. He only thinks about himself, complains all the time. I feel so unappreciated and disrespected. I’ve lost a total of a 11 days of pay so far this year because he changes every appointment I make for him to a time/day that I work. I’m tired and needed to vent. Thanks for listening."
"How do you deal with otherwise loving and reasonable parents when they become elderly and start behaving like children? My parents -- both about 90 and still cognitively very healthy -- and especially my dad are facing loss of independence issues (Mom has a crap ton of health issues and is basically homebound so she's used to it), and suddenly I'm dealing with oppositional defiance and angry pushback (and it wasn't even me who brought it up, it was the eye doctor). Basically Daddy told me he would still keep driving even if he couldn't pass the driving test (uh, no?), and when I pointed out that it was illegal and we wouldn't be letting him do that, he just dug in his heels like a three-year-old. And then all the way home he kept insisting he would be able to drive just fine, that he just couldn't read the road signs, but he could see the traffic, and lectured me if I dared to not agree that he was 100% good to go.  


Even after I took him home and came in to visit with him and Mom, he was still grousing about everything I said, like it was my fault.

I totally totally get that he is scared and grieving the loss of his normal life and that he doesn't want to be dependent on anybody. I get that, as much as I can as a still-independent 58-year-old. I mean, I nearly cried when the doc told him that, and I did cry with my mom when Dad went to change his hearing aid batteries. (He can't hear worth beans, either, which is another good reason to NOT be driving.) I think he felt like he was handed a death sentence. So I am all about being empathetic and compassionate and knowing that this is huge and a terrible loss for him.

But it is NOT my fault, and I am NOT trying to be mean. And I hate having to be the ""bad guy"" (my one living brother -- we lost the other one to cancer last year -- lives in a different city and is fairly oblivious to all that goes on with my parents because they don't tell him everything when they talk to him). I feel like my parents should know me well enough to know that I'm deeply caring and love them and hate that they're having to go through all these ""very late life"" things. 

So how do you handle it? I am SO grateful that we're not dealing with cognitive decline/dementia issues (like my husband and his sibs are having to do with his mom). But this is hard, too."
"This might be a weird question, but is there a good checklist or planning resource for tough conversations and things we need to have figured out as my father (77) approaches the end of his life? He has maybe a few good years left, as we can tell his mind is already getting foggy and there is a history of dementia on his side of the family. I am starting to think about talking to him about his will, where he wants to be buried, etc, and just trying to think of what else we should iron out with him while he is still able to communicate his wishes."
"I (30F) have been working with my family on moving my 62 year old father into long term care. Yes, he's young but he has severe rheumatoid arthritis, one foot, overweight, horrible bed sores, can't walk, can barely hold things, can't bathe himself, feed himself, mixes up his meds.... And that's just what he's currently dealing with. He's had PE's, spinal meningitis, vasculitis, strokes, Afib, colostomy, torn rotator cuff... He was literally stuck to his chair for the last year and a half because he refused additional help. When he's at home he can't afford the amount of PSW care he would need. 

He's been kicking and screaming over it for months and it's caused so much turmoil and stress for my family and me. Finally, after some tough love, he's agreed to go. Now I'm feeling the weight of the decision knowing how hard it was for him to say yes. I read news articles all the time about how bad Ontario LTC homes are and I'm so worried it's the wrong decision. I'm not sure what to do. If he goes home he'll end up back in the hospital. He's currently in the hospital for a long list of things. 

Does anyone have any advice here?"
"Mom is 80, healthy but can't walk too long or far. Needs help with little every day stuff. Early dementia buy not too bad. Lost dad 19 years ago. Mom is VERY lonely. Likes to go and do things but I get off FT job, take care of dogs, house, adult responsibilities and I need to recluse. After helping her with little things I don't want to sit and talk, eat together cuz she drags it out, and want to go do anything. My husband and I invite her to every family get together we have. We are both introverts and rarely get time hanging out w/ another couple or go out to refresh, too tired from work and everything else. Just wonder if we were Extroverts if we could enjoy time with her more than feeling worn out all the time?"
"I feel awful about it. She has Dementia and NPH. I’ve been her and my grandfather’s caretaker for a few years now. It all started when my granddad had copd and needed help. Id come to the house after work and take care of him. My job went out of business when he really declined so I slowly started moving in it seems like looking back now. Once he passed away, I stayed to help my gma cope plus it was like a little starter apartment since the house is somewhat separated. I got another job and started receiving odd phonecalls at work or id come home and there would be yellow racing stripes on her white car. Eventually, I had to leave this job and be here full time. She declined slowly and then 2 years ago it became too much for just me especially because I’m male and my gma and I were both a bit. uncomfortable with me cleaning her so my mother moved in. This past 2 years have absolute hell and a drastic toll on me and my mother’s mental and physical health. My drinking got out of control, my mother over eats and started drinking, my father lives at home alone with our dogs hoping that we will visit after we get her in bed. 

We have Hospice nurses that come by every other day, a social worker, we had a live in aide for a week and she quit. I dont blame her, she was excellent at her job but my grandmother is impossible. She’s not mean by any means, she’s extremely nice but a total sap and a wimp. She also weights over 300 pounds and is littered with arthritis which makes everything a daunting task. Cleaning her, standing her, getting her in bed, all of these activities can take over an hour and she just screams and wails the whole time. We got a Hoyer Lift which is a blessing but it doesn’t help with going to the bathroom and she will quite literally refuse to go in her diaper. Which leads to the next problem, the paramedics have had to come about 4 times the last couple months on days where my arms gave out and she went down but there was no other option.

Finally, after much stress and no help dealing with places, we got her a bed at a home and she leaves today. I feel absolutely terrible. She’s sitting in her chair right now eating breakfast with her dog and has no idea in a few hours she will never see her home of 40 years again or her dog. Ughhh!!!! I know ive gone above and beyond for her and it’s time but I just feel like shit and needed to vent.  She is gonna be screaming in fear and I dont think you can even visit at the homes here  (NY) right now so that makes it more sad because she will have noone. Fuck."
"My mother is rapidly declining and I’m extremely frustrated that despite all the recent evidence that FMT could be an incredibly effective treatment, it’s not being made available or being promoted. Does anyone have more information on this?

"She gets freaked out and tells the people who work at her senior living place that she needs them to call me to come get her and starts crying because she thinks she doesn't live there. She's lived there for 4 years. After a while she'll settle into her apartment and everything will be ok. I'm just wondering at what point will she start wandering, because that's the day they say she has to go to memory care."
"Hello! My girlfriends dad has Alzheimer's. It's a stage where he has just now been moved to a full time care taking facility. He got moved there last week, and she just visited him there for the first time. Some people in her family keeps telling her, that she isn't doing enough. Which is not okay in my eyes.
Obviously she is very affected, and especially because he keeps asking to come home again, which breaks her heart and in turn mine.
And so, i was just wondering if you guys have any advice for me, as to how i can really support her in this, because it's a little hard for me to really understand her feelings, since I've never been in that situation.
And if you have advice i could bring her that might have helped some of you guys cope?

Thanks alot, and i wish you all the best of luck through your difficult times."
"Is this normal?  At first we weren't allowed to because of covid and so she could get settled, but then it was because she wouldn't remember us and would upset her?  She's already passed, but this bothers me still."
"My grandfather was in the navy, he was known as
onion for his tendency to make other men cry. I'm
visiting my grandparents for the first time in years
and he needed help finding the light switch in his
own home to go upstairs to bed. I showed him
where but he turned it on and then off so I told him
""you hit it twice"" and he replied ""just fix it""

I’ve known how bad it can be for a while but now it's
really hitting me hard. I need to fly back in a
couple weeks and leave my poor old grandma to
help him all on her own. First I've cried in
years, because sure I'd be sad if anything happened
to my parents, the difference is that my
grandparents are kind hearted pure people who took me in for a crucial couple of years that turned my life around. My mother was negligent and by grade 4 I couldn’t read or write, I didn’t even know left from right, literally.

My nan shouldn’t have to start nursing again at her age but she’s convinced pop wouldn’t be happy without her care. Caring for him is so demanding but she wouldn’t hear a bar of putting him into someone else’s care, even brought up the plot of The Leisure Seeker to me 😂 I guess she can relate to that movie but of course wouldn’t do that"
"My dad was diagnosed with mild/moderate Alzheimers in December 2021 after memory clinic assessment and review of brain scans from Sept 2021. We informed the DVLA of this in December 2021 and have received a holding letter to apologise for the delay in their reaction to whether it’s okay for my father to continue driving. My mother and I do not feel he is safe to drive, he had an accident in August 2021 which was entirely his fault, his reactions are not what they were and the mobility in his legs is effected (he shuffles a lot and gets cramps in his leg muscles) and we of course we informed the memory clinic nurse of our worries discreetly. As I’m sure is the case with a lot of men in their mid/late seventies who have just received this diagnosis, he says he feels no different at all and gets very defensive when we try to discuss his diagnosis and we think he hasn’t got a full grasp on what his diagnosis means (due to the condition, no doubt). Today, he received a letter from the consultant at the same memory clinic to say that he will be having a telephone assessment (due to Covid) regarding his ability to continue driving. Has this been the case for other people, he is of course going to tell the consultant and the memory clinic that he feels that he is fine to drive?! Does anyone UK based know if this is normal? He was just starting to get used to my mother being the driver and we’re desperately worried that if the NHS/DVLA tell him that he’s okay to continue driving based upon a telephone assessment (HOW CAN THEY MAKE THIS ASSESSMENT ON THE PHONE?) it will become a huge source of conflict if we try to stop him. Any UK based experience similar to this with DVLA/NHS would be greatly appreciated."
"It started all of a sudden. My mom passed away on 07.07.2020. Her departure had a great impact on my dad as they were together for 42 years. From 2nd half of 2021 (June or July may be) we started observing some abnormalities like some illogical statements and questions(which were very occasional and unnoticable). But from then we noticed his excessive fascination towards sweet foods including ice creams, cakes, chocolates, candies etc. He has diabetes but he started eating candies and ice creams whenever he went out alone. I talked to the local grocery shop who informed me that Dad on average takes 5 to 10 ice creams daily. I was very annoyed on him because of this childish behavior because till then I didn't realized that he developed something like dementia or Alzheimer's. Things kept going like this till this year. Last week my dad left home in the midnight and when he got back I asked him why he left home and he couldn't answer me and he was very confused. That time I realized something is wrong with him which needs medical attention. Next day I rushed to a neurologist who told me that he has developed dementia and prescribed few medications including Donepezil Hydrochloride INN 5 mg tab once in the night, Quetiapine Fumerate 25 mg 2 tabs in the night and Ginkgo Biloba 60 MG tab twice a day. Since we started The meds he started hallucinating throughout the day. After a couple of days I contracted with the with the doc and he told me to discontinue Donepezil and continue the rest. But till today there is no progress and his deteriorating each day. I'm really confused whether this is because of the meds prescribed or his progressing so fast. Is it really possible to deteriorate within a week??
I have done extensive research for lost couple of days and discovered Alzheimer's is also termed as type 3 diabetes which leads to excessive fascination towards sweet foods because of some chemical imbalance in the brain. My doctor didn't tell me anything like this. Later I came across some researches which shows nasal insulin helps  Alzheimer's patients to some extent. I really want to try that out. Anyone ever tried Nasal insulin for Alzheimer's  or dementia?? I know it is not conclusive or approved yet, but I cannot see my dad suffering without any medical care."
"My 70yo father-in-law has late-stage Alzheimer’s. He is very fond of me, always asking where I am, when I am going to his house, etc. He’s bedridden for years. Completely lost the ability to take care of himself. 

One day he suddenly told my husband he wanted to rape me (behind my back) and my husband just laughed it off and expected me to do the same, because he thinks he’s delirious and will soon die so we should be lenient. 

While I know he isn’t a threat (not sure if he means what he said though), I still feel disgusted. I told my husband I wouldn’t see him anymore because I simply don’t know what to do or what to feel. Husband feels hurt and upset with me. He thinks it will be a blow to his family. 

Any advice please? :( Really appreciate that!"
"My grandmother does not take her depression pills. We are not sure about the cause, could be both attention seeking and simple forgetfulness, but the issue is serious as she once already had a temporary psychotic episode (thinking there are people in her house, that someone locked her inside even though she just lost her keys), due  to taking the pills and then abruptly stopping.   


Unfortunately, after that we had to get her to an old people's house as we live in a totally different city and the family that is there does not pay enough attention to her to keep her on her toes with her pills. However, she is a very assertive, and proud person so we think it is best that once she is comfortably back on her meds to let her live alone again, if she so desires.  


To that end I am looking for some intelligent contraptions, perhaps with a camera, that will track whether my grandmother actually does take her meds, and notify us wirelessly. Did any of you have experience with similar machines? Do you have any to recommend?"
"My grandmother was diagnosed when i was about 7-8 years old. I lived only with her and my mother, so i had to take care of her when she had her first stage of the disease while my mother was working. I was too young to realize how terrible this disease is, so at first it didn't make me feel wrong about it. I used to walk out my grandma, so in fact i was watching after her instead of her watching after me. Giving food, helping as much as i can, i did everything, and life still didn't seem to be bad or different from how it's supposed to be. Soon, maybe, at the age of 10, it started to get worse, grandma started to be way more agressive, and whem mom wasn't at home she could hit me or start yelling curses for no reason. I think that's the moment when i started to realize everything. I am 15 now, and i am exhausted. As it got worse, when grandma started to yell at night or at any other time, I can't stand it anymore. Of course i don't take care of her as i used to before, i am not physically able to do that, so everything lays on my mother's shoulders. I think it's obvious that it causes her to be an extremly nervous person, i know the reasons and can't blame her, but it feels so unsafe in this world when even her, the only person that is supposed to be for me the strongest one and ""protect"" me is not dealing with all these things. I could even say that i feel like the only adult in our apartment, as i always support my mother and be her psychologist. I lost my interest in many things, i don't see my future at all, like i am tied to a chain that doesn't let me live my life normally. Last two-three years seem to be the most difficult to me. I also started to have problems with my nevres too, seeing nightmares and feeling things that i don't want to feel at all. My health is also deteriorating in the face of this. It makes me estrange from my friends, i always feel like i am ""incomplete"" when i talk to them, knowing that they don't have to deal with the same things i do. I started to convince myself that i should be grateful for that: my situation made me question at lof ot things in my life earlier that i should have, and I always hear that i am a pretty mature person. But do i want all these things instead of a fun childhood and unforgettable youth? And it comes to anger, when they complain about anything in their lifes, which is a very wrong reaction, and since i can't talk about it with anyone, all this anger sits inside my head all the time. If i tell my friends, there is no way they understand or help me, so i want to at least make them think that i have a normal life. My mother seems to realize how it affects on me, but she doesn't want to admit it (in which i don't blame her at all), so despite how stupid it sounds, it makes me feel like there's no one in the world who can understand me. I am sure that there are people of my age who deal with that, but i never had a chance to meet them, and searching on internet didn't help too. About a half a year ago i visited one alzheimer forum that was on my language, and people on it didn't take me seriously and thought that i am a troll cause of my age and cause that i was writing without any mistakes on my native language. That was the last time i had any hopes to find some understanding from other people. All i want is to have a normal life, or at least go through it without damaging myself too much. I have thoughts that i don't want to have, i feel separeted from my friends that are living differenetly, and i feel how my grandma's disease dragging me to thevery bottom of excistens. I can't study in school normally, can't enjoy my interests and that's only because of my family problem that is not leaving my head even for a moment. We can't send grandma to a specified hospital, because it is very expensive for us, and mom doesn't want to let her be in a free hospital, beacuse it's patients are usually dying in a short period of time, and that's why it feels hopeless for me. I have two more years in school to study, and that's not even a fact that i will be able to leave my mother and grandma when i end school. I am not even sure if i am ready to leave my mother along with that problem. Two months ago i had my last hope - a psychologist. I finally was enough brave to visit a doctor, but the result wasn't pleasant at all. The only thing i got is ""finding the problem"" using ""metaphorical cards"", and i was told that i am coping my grandmother's behaivour, which didn't help the situation in any way so i pretended that it was helpful and stopped visiting her. She was a good person, but didn't seem to know how to help me. I started to be paranoic, feeling like my mother and me are going to get alzeimers too, since my second grandma that is living in other country has this disease too, and i am not going to get a normal life ever. I started to have questionable ideologies in my head. I feel like my mind is corrupted, i feel like i am dying. I find my peace in music, but for how many years is it going to help me going trought this? Asking ""what should i do"" is pointless, as i know that there's nothing can be done.  
I just needed to share this with at least anyone, thank you for reading."
"I'd appreciate your opinions on this question. The situation is this: A couple in their late 70s, slowing down but still fully independent, have been in their current home for 10+ years, so it's very familiar, but also a bit too big for them. Wife was recently diagnosed with early onset, so anyone's guess as to how quickly things will progress. 

With the market as it is, they were thinking of selling their house and getting a condo, but now with this diagnosis, the question is should they: 

(a) stay in the house, as it's more familiar, but may not be as safe and will get more difficult to maintain, 

(b) buy a condo as planned but potentially run into issues with familiarity if the Alzheimer's progresses quickly, or 

(c) get a condo or apartment in a senior living building, with 24 hr available support on site, meals in a dining room, etc., but still risk the lack of familiarity plus the fear that being around others like this will ""age us faster"". 

I appreciate any insight into the options, or maybe other options we haven't considered."
"Mom is going to start looking at memory care facilities but is worried about dad being kicked out because he exhibits frustrated/aggressive behavior on occasion. So far it isn't anything violent but his dad, who also most likely had alzheimers, was kicked out of his assisted living facility because he was violent toward a nurse. I guess my question is, what behaviors will get dad ejected from a memory care facility or what type of facility should we be looking for that can handle patients with violent behavior?"
"my mum has alz close to 11 years, She is now admitted to hospice care and I was told the end is near...What helped you deal with this? Any tips ? I really don't know what to do"
"Partly just to vent.

My dad is doing his best to care for my mom and us kids try to share some responsibility to help when we can.  I have not seen the exact diagnosis for what my mom has...I believe my dad that it's Alzheimers but it feels like it has manifested a little differently from most peoples' experiences.  She is not yet at the point of forgetting who people are, not at all.  However she does forget the events of the day or any plans, and will ask over and over what time such-and-such is happening, unless the events are pretty significant like someone's death.  For example, every time I have seen her for the past year, she brings up how hard it must be for the family of someone who died of Covid over a year ago now.

Her main issue is overwhelmingly strong compulsions to do the few things she is still able to do.

She cannot sew, knit, do puzzles, watch TV/movies, or play games of any kind, and generally refuses to read books or just sit still.  All of these things seem to be overwhelming to her and she can't even get started on them.  This is what she can do:

* Dishes and laundry (when she feels like it, and doesn't last long)

* Check her email, Facebook, and mass-collect free eBooks (all trashy, but she has no idea; this also does not last more than a few hours per day)

* Go on long walks up and down the road picking up trash (she has never gotten lost)

* Recently, overeating any snacks she can find

If allowed to, she would walk endlessly, to the point of physically harming herself, but pain apparently doesn't register as a reason to stop.  When it's in her head, every 2 minutes she will beg and plead and find any excuse, swear that she won't walk for the rest of the week if you only let her go for a little while.  If you do extract a promise that it will be a short walk, she will go right past where you say she can (GPS tracker is a godsend).  If it was someone fully in control of their faculties, I would call it manipulative or sneaky, but it's the compulsion talking.  She takes every tiny candy wrapper all the way outside to the trash can just to get the experience of walking briefly.  For mother's day we took her to a state park to walk a trail together and on the drive home when we were all exhausted she was hinting that she wanted to go walk as soon as we got home.  She can't be left alone anymore, sometimes even when you're home with her.  Hiding shoes doesn't help, she has gone out barefoot at least once.  Locks are not really a good solution in case of emergencies.

She will also wear clothing inappropriate to the weather and takes a long period of adjustment to stop wearing coats in the heat (now) and start wearing them in the winter.  Fortunately she does seem to not want to walk when it's clearly raining or snowing, and on those days doesn't even ask.  Easiest days we have.

She likes going to any store as well, whether you need to or not.  If she can't walk, she wants to go to Wal-Marts or local bakeries, and just does a circuit with you as you pick up the few things you need (due to constant visits on her behalf).  And asks constant questions about stopping anywhere else as well.

Recently we have had to hide food because she will sneak any snacks she can find.  If you tell her to stop, she just smiles like ""oh I'm being so naughty,"" but doesn't realize she's been doing it constantly.  Yesterday when all food was out of reach, she was caught eating dog treats. :(

She was over at my house with dad today working on some outdoor chores.  Because it's unfamiliar territory she couldn't walk, and because we weren't indoors she couldn't snack.  I think she short-circuited and asked to go to the bathroom 6 times in 30 minutes, because there just wasn't anything else to do.  She also found bits of trash on the sidewalk and put it in my garbage cans even though we asked her to stop.

She is on daily pills and a few times we have given her a Tylenol PM in the morning and that has helped a ton...but this isn't really something we should do long term.  I've been curious what affect something like Adderall might have on her, but doctors will not prescribe anything other than what she is on, and just say she requires constant care.

Dad is having a terrible time.  I want to be able to do more but my sisters and I all have jobs and other demands.

Is there anything we can do about these overwhelming compulsions?  Is there any activity we haven't thought of to try to have her do that might keep her attention?"
"Sorry for the bad English, I'm not a native speaker.

I have been researching the combination of curcumin with piperine (to improve curcumin absorption and bioavailability) and research into its effects on alzheimer's, memory loss and cognitive decline in general, but found very few human studies despite there are studies with rats of curcumin and its effects, and although curcumin is safe, after all they are common spice substances, and there is a study that shows that piperine increases the bioavailability of curcumin by 2000%, is there any study that has done this test? have you tested the combination of these compounds combined for these causes?

At clinically relevant dosages?"
"It is undeniable that explaining Alzheimer’s to children is no simple task. Children may not understand why their grandparent, who once used to take care of them, picked them up from school or gave them a snack, can no longer do those things. Therefore, the first thing we should do is to **explain to the child what is happening to their grandparent in language that is suitable for the child’s age**.

“Your grandpa (or grandma) has Alzheimer’s, a disease that causes the brain to forget things.” But Alzheimer’s is not just memory loss, and the child needs to be able to understand all the other symptoms little by little.

Reassure your child with [simple, honest explanations of the disease.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/caregivers/in-depth/alzheimers/art-20043890)"
"My grandmother has got alzheimer's for about 1 year, I moved in with her 5months ago. I have always noticed the situation getting worse. I keep telling her something over and over until she gets it. I understand that what she say is not what she means and she'll say hurtful things and I have always not cared about her insults. But recently her situation worsened and all these methods are not working anymore. I found myself scolding her today, im so so sorry. I dont know what to do. She doesnt want to eat her meds but thats another shitshow too long to explain."
"As the title states, my mother (70) was diagnosed in October and is going downhill rapidly, imo.

Just last month, she was able to remember what happened that day. She was able to remember appointments she had, maybe not the exact date, but she remembered. She, pretty much, remembered what I told her during our visits.

I visited her yesterday and she's so much worse. She asked the same questions over and over. She couldn't remember what she said just minutes before. I just answered her like she'd never asked those questions before. She kept saying she needed a haircut and I'd answer, for the 4th time, that she has an appointment for next month. She couldn't remember Dr appointments she just had. I'm so afraid that next month she won't remember me. I'm so worried for her and it breaks my heart. I guess I just wanted to vent.

Also, some of you may see this twice, as I accidentally posted in r/Alzheimersgroup. I feel badly, so I deleted. I didn't know it was specifically for people with Alzheimer's."
"Hi all! My dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s about two years ago. My mom is his only caregiver and he’s declining pretty fast. He is still able to dress himself (though it’s usually dirty laundry because he can’t remember where the clean clothes are) and his memory is about 3 minutes now. He’s starting to get a little angrier than before when he can’t remember to do something and he gets really down on himself. They are both amazing people. They live about 1.5 hours away and I try to see them as often as possible. Does anyone have advice on what to do to support the other parent? I try to call my mom as often as possible but I cannot imagine how hard this must be for her as well. She isn’t able to go out or even really leave the house. I’ve contemplated moving down there to help out (I’m an only child and our closest family is about 8 hours away) so it could make her life a little easier and she would be able to get out of the house. He’s at the point where he can’t be left alone anymore. I’m nervous I’ll regret not moving down there and helping out before things take a turn for the worse. I’m not trying to make this about myself, just having a lot of mixed emotions. Has anyone been in this situation and can give some advice? Am I overthinking everything? Has anyone moved to help take care of their parent? Please help. Thank you all in advance."
"Has anyone here come across an automatic medicine dispenser that is worth the $. 

Ideally, it would be programmable and dispense the medicine for that date/time (my dad takes meds 2x daily). 

Would be even more awesome if it had some sort of notification/alarm that lets the person know it’s time to take meds. 

Wishful thinking perhaps, but thought I’d ask. 

TIA!"
"my mom is in late stage and has some bruises from sitting too long in the wheelchair.

I don't mind shelling out 400 dollars for the Roho high profile seat cushion but the home health nurse today recommended the purple royal seat cushion (for car or office) at 99 dollars..Not sure why she recommended a cheap cushion but based on experience, is there a big difference between roho vs. cheaper seat cushion? Which would you go with?"
"I am from Bangladesh. I lost my mom due to coronavirus in July 2020. She was then 63 years old. After departure of my mom, I slowly started witnessing some behavioral change of my dad. He is now 75 years old. Since last year he started showing some behavioral changes and instances of memory loss. Sometimes it sounded like he lost his logics. He would remember memories of decades ago but forgets recent memories like every day tasks. For last few days he was having some hallucinations. Couple of days back. He left home at midnight and after a few hours he got back and I asked him where did you go. He was staring at me like clueless and he couldn't remember why he left home in the midnight. I got very nervous and perplexed. I rushed to a neurologist who told me that he is having dementia which is probably due to Alzheimer's disease. I immediately started medicines but I am very afraid and concerned about my dad's health. Can anyone tell me at which stage he is currently in by looking into the symptoms I mentioned? How long does it usually take to graduate to next step? Please help!"
"Hello, basically I just came home and my grandma didn’t know I was home, I heard her talking and assumed she was on the phone, but I look round and she’s talking to an empty chair, but the way she’s looking is as ifs someone is sitting in the chair. Is this a sign of Alzheimer’s? Or something else, sorry if this is the wrong place"
"Hi - my dad has vascular dementia and my mum has Alzheimers.  They moved into a specialised dementia home about a month ago.  (Both are in their early 80s)  My mum  is trying hard to adjust and settle in, but dad just isn't even trying.  He says he feels perfectly fine and doesn't need to be in there ""with all the crazies"" and he wants to go home. When we try to explain to him that it's not safe at home for them, he argues and gets upset. When we try to explain why his behaviours are unsafe he says that ""he was just joking"" when he did/said [whatever it was].  He basically lacks any insight into his illness, and I just don't know how to deal with him - not to mention the intense guilt I feel about helping to move them both in (my sister and I have PoA and Guardianship) even though I know it's the right thing to do.  My mum does have some insight into her condition, which helps.  Does anyone have any suggestions or ideas on what to say when he gets upset and angry about his new situation?"
"My 88 year old grandpa is an amazing person. Like seriously one of the most kind, hardworking, compassionate, intelligent, loving people I’ve ever known in my 27 years of life. But he is slipping more and more every day with this awful disease. He is also a Vietnam and Korean war vet. He and my grandma helped raise me; they were huge parts of my life. He has loved my grandma for 67 years, and loved her so incredibly well. He would go to the ends of the earth for her, do absolutely anything for her. He’s just as in love with her now as he was when they first fell in love, except now he doesn’t make much sense when he talks and I know eventually he’s going to forget us including her (if he doesn’t pass away first—he is 88 after all). I can’t stand it.

I can’t stand that they had to have my Aunts (their children) sell their house—the house that I frequently visited as a child and even temporarily lived in with them for a time—so they could move into a nursing home. And my grandma who is still of sound mind has to witness the love of her life decline every single day (they were placed in the same room). She’s one of the strongest people I’ve ever known.

At their old house (that now belongs to someone else), we’d drive down to the train station with Subway sandwiches and just watch the trains go by while chowing down. My grandpa was very knowledgeable about trains and locomotive history and it was fun to hear him tell me things while we sat there. The train station had a park attached to it and we’d go take walks there. I know those days are long gone and I’m an adult now, been an adult for a while, but it doesn’t make this process any easier. I’ve never lost a loved one before. This will be my first time and I know it’s going to be extremely difficult. Thank you for letting me vent, and I appreciate this subreddit; at least I know I’m not alone."
"Two of my brothers were visiting my Mom who is in a memory care nursing facility, and they called me and put me on speaker phone so I could wish my Mom a Happy Mother’s Day. That thoughtfulness meant the world to me.  My Mom is in stage 7 and doesn’t have much time left on this earth. I’m wishing all of you out there with mothers with Alzheimer’s a Happy Mother’s Day with your mothers and hoping you remember the good times like I’m doing today. ❤️"
"My mom (65F) is looking into purchasing one in hopes that it will slow my step dads (68M) memory loss down. He was diagnosed in January. 

Has anybody here had any luck with a hyperbaric chamber?"
"This is my throwaway, I have gone NC/very low contact with my mother. 

She has hit him/shaken him up pretty bad. Today I was stopping by to pick up some mail that was sent to her house instead of mine and I heard screaming. “I hate you”, “I could kill you”, “you’re an idiot”, “you son of a bitch”. I intervened and she let up but he’s alone with her all day. He was holding his head so I think she hurt him but I didn’t see any obvious marks/bruising. He cannot live with me, our house is too small and I work 13 hours a day so I’m never home and he needs 24 hour care at this point. She locks him in the home, he hasn’t been outside in months. Only goes out for dr appts. 

What can I do? She’s his POA. He has money but she makes him sign over the checks he gets sent in the mail (I believe retirement or social security?). She won’t let me look at anything, nothing from doctors, no paperwork so I’m very limited in what I know besides he doesn’t know who anyone is and can’t take care of himself at all. I’m at a loss. If I call the police on her my dad loses his main caregiver, and she WILL retaliate on my partner and I. She’s always been an awful mother to me, which is why NC happened in the first place. Now that her kids have left her she’s taking out all the anger she used to abuse us, she’s turned onto my Dad. I really am unsure how to approach this situation. Any help is appreciated and hope you all and your loved ones are well."
"My dad has been fading from Alzheimer’s / dementia for about 10 years. This last year, he’s faded a lot faster. He had been living at home until toileting issues and agitation became too much for my mom to handle, so we moved him into memory care. His toileting issues got worse, coupled with dehydration from a stomach bug, had us take him to the ER two weeks ago. He was agitated by his roommate, the staff trying to give him medicine and food. I’ve never witnessed it, but I imagine it is more “I don’t know you or why you’re trying to put that in my mouth, step back” rather than more physical violence. He was there four days recovering, came back to memory care, and they called us 45 minutes late. They’d sent him to the local hospital, who then transferred him to mental care facility under a GA1013 involuntary commitment order as “danger to others.”

Do these medical professionals not understand that “my dad doesn’t know where he is or what’s going on” is not the same as “danger to others?”

My mom has only gotten a few updates. This facility does not allow any visitors at all (because it’s where they keep people that are a “danger to others”). He’s just as agitated, dehydrated again, toilet problems continue, not eating or drinking, not “compliant” with taking his medicine.

Until he calms his agitation, relearns the toilet, eats and drinks well, and takes his medicine without complaining, he won’t be cleared for release. The 1013 involuntary commitment expired after 48 hours, so it’s “hospital discharge,” which I suppose we could override if needed. Realistically, there’s no way he’s going to significantly improve in those areas unless they find an incredibly effective combination of medicines, or just heavily sedate him.

It’s worse because my mom’s process of grieving is “accept the things that I can’t change.” I don’t blame her for that, but when I ask her for updates, she’s very brief. On Monday, she even said, “just don’t call or text me for updates anymore, I’ll let you know if anything important happens.” I have the code to call the nurses, but even with the code, it took me nine phone calls to get to a “case worker,” who said that even though I have the code, they will only talk to one family member, which is mom. That was Wednesday morning. Mom said “oh, he’s doing just fine they say.” I had gotten a little information before they shut me down, and they told me about getting IV fluids because he wasn’t eating or drinking, which mom omitted. There’s no other information since Wednesday. She came over to visit my daughter and me today for Mother’s Day, and she didn’t say anything. Didn’t mention his name. She’s changed her phone background so it’s not a picture of her and Dad anymore. I didn’t want to confront her around my daughter or make a stink for Mother’s Day. She can grieve in her way, but I don’t think it’s too much for me to ask for the information and help in his care. I’m paying for all of it. Mom said that they couldn’t really afford the memory care before he even moved in. I said I could help, and so I guess I’ll be getting the bill for two weeks in the hospital, plus what’s to come. 

My mom and dad cared for my grandmother before she died with Alzheimer’s. She never got as bad as Dad is now. He’d say, over and over, just to me, “son, don’t ever let me get like that. Just let me wander off in the woods. Buy me a one-way ticket to Vegas and $100 of chips. Shake my hand and say, ‘see you later, Dad.’”"
"my mom is choking a bit on food...Any tips? I would guess more soups, and congee for her to eat, instead of hard solids"
Definitely a mixed bag of emotions. Thank you for all the insights I gleaned from reading posts here. They truly helped
"Hi all. I apologize if this is not the right subreddit to post this, but I'm looking for advice. My grandpa has a history of forgetting small things. It's worried my mom a bit, but nothing major has happened... until today.

I live with my grandparents while I go to school because they live much closer to my university than my parents do. I came home around 5:30 this evening (which is earlier than I normally get home) because I had to take an online test for school. When I walked in, my grandpa was sitting in the living room and my grandma was taking shower. My grandpa greeted me with, ""Well, you're home early!"" and I replied by saying, ""Yeah, I have to take a test."" I then just went to my room and took my test.

I can hear their conversations in the living room through the walls in my room. About halfway through my test, I hear my grandma say from the living room, ""It looks like she's almost home. I need to text her to get the mail."" My family uses Life360, so that's how she knew that. I expected my grandpa to tell her I had already come in, but he didn't say anything about me being home. 

After I was finished with my test, I was getting ready to go meet my boyfriend for dinner. Before I rounded the corner to the living room, my grandma said, ""She must be eating dinner in her car or something,"" and my grandpa still didn't say anything about me being home. After I went around the corner, I announced to them that I was going to eat dinner, and they both looked shocked to see me. I understand my grandma, because she wasn't in the room when I came in, but my grandpa should have known I was here. My grandma said, ""Oh, I didn't even know you were home!"" and my grandpa said the same thing. When I said, ""Grandpa, you saw me come in. You talked to me when I walked in the door,"" he was very adamant that he never saw me and didn't know I was here. 

My grandma quickly explained it away without giving me time to fully explain by saying he didn't feel good, but this really struck me as odd. He literally forgot I was home when I had a conversation with him when I walked in. He spoke to me and has no recollection of it. Is this something I should try to talk to my grandma about in private so she can look for further symptoms or am I just reading too much into this? I'm really concerned, as him forgetting I was in the house seems like quite a big deal. Thanks in advance."
"my mom is in late stage ALZ at the memory care..So she's always sitting in a wheelchair..Other than rash cream, any other suggestions to reduce the raw, bruise and rash on her buttocks? The nurse recommended they put her on her side of her body on the bed.....as the only remedy, along with the rash cream..."

"I've posted here before, but basically my grandma is getting pretty bad. All day has been a battle. It got to the point she was screaming at me that I was the devil himself and that I murdered her whole family and I was gonna go back to hell. Trying to hit me and push me down. We called 911, like we already have before, because we just don't know what to do. She kept going outside and yelling for ""help"" and getting into my grandpa's car and laying on the horn. Ambulance gets there and immediately says she needs to go to the hospital at least to ""get away from the devil"" and calm her down, i apologized for if we had wasted their time and the one I was talking to said he would've done the same. But, of course, a Social Worker shows up right when all this is happening and says she's very concerned about my grandmother's wellbeing and possibly being abused. 
Needless to say I am absolutely terrified. The social worker said we aren't in trouble at all but it's still scary, I'm not sure what to do or if we can do anything. She's set up to be placed in a memory care unit on next Wednesday but... I can't even explain how horrifying this is. We have a caseworker for the placement stuff and she already 100% knows how she is as she's came to the house and saw her get like this. I'm just so scared. I've done everything I could to take care of her. And now apparently social services thinks we are abusive..."
"Just off the phone with a member of staff from the home that my mum's in. She called to inform us of an incident that happened today involving a male resident trying to grab her crotch whilst she was walking down the corridor. This is the same male resident who was caught masturbating in front of her a couple of months ago, but not the same one who doggedly followed her around and was found several times alone with mum in her room last year, trying to kiss her whilst his penis was out (this gentleman was removed from the home soon after this series of events). 

I'm so sick of this happening. Two different male residents have now taken advantage of her and I am so angry and sick to my stomach that she's had this happen to her. Luckily she hasn't noticed it or been phased by any of it but still, it shouldn't be happening. I don't care that the male residents also have dementia and may not be aware of what they're doing.

My mum's young but her Alzheimer's is very advanced. She's 64 and physically still very fit and mobile, but this makes her the most vulnerable person in the home because it's so easy for her to wander into a corridor or room out of eyesight of a member of staff. 

I can't blame the staff. They're all lovely and they all do their best but these things just take a minute to happen, and they can't be expected to keep sight of every single resident every single minute of the day. There's nowhere near enough staff for that and even if there were, it still only takes that minute of being out of sight. 

I hate that this is happening to the woman who used to be my mum. Every day is spent with anxiety, dreading another call from the home to say that something's happened to her again. She's supposed to be safe in there, for fuck sake."
"My grandmother has been diagnosed and is unfortunately rapidly declining. The decision has been made for her to relocate to Texas close to my Aunt at assisted living. 

She has never been tech savvy. Doesn’t have a smart phone. She had a laptop but now struggles very hard to use it and really only used it for bills prior. 

I am wondering if anyone has had any advice on keeping contact? 

I plan to send her small gifts on occasion but was thinking that writing her letters may do some good but don’t want to fluster her."
"My mom closed her long standing bank account and opened a new bank. She neglected to have all the automated payments and deposits switched over.

My sister is the executor of her trust and has power of attorney. 

We her children were put on her bank account and we all worked to fix the problem.

However my mom opened another account at the current bank and has a history of withdrawals of large amounts.

What can be done to prevent her from doing this?"
"So was power washing my back yard today and I almost felt him their hes only gone four weeks he fought his fight since 2014. 

Was the youngest of three so even at 44 its still hard for me to process it still."
"I've written about my wife (70 F) diagnosed 3 years ago and it seems that within the last month or so her memory is failing faster then I'm used to.  I mentioned it to her Dr's but they didn't seem overly concerned.  Today she said ""check out the nice horse walking down the street"" it was a dog then about 20 minutes later she said ""there's a cute Penguin on the lawn"" and it was a bird!!!!  We both laughed at both of her mistakes knowing it was really kind of funny BUT she really is going downhill at a faster pace then she has been during the last 3 years.  I'm assuming it's not going to ever get better and praying it just slows down again."
"My mother has early onset and has begun to hallucinate various elaborate scenarios and has wandered away from my parents home on two occasions so far.  She also periodically loses me in her mind, so she doesn’t realize she’s walking next to me in public.  This leads to her wandering away and if I’m busy watching my son or distracted in any way she can get away from us.  

We are working very hard to prolong the time we care for her, but a care facility is a certainty.  Toward that end we are looking for ways to keep track of mom.  The best fit I’ve found so far is an Apple Watch with cell service on my dads account so he can see her location as long as she’s wearing it.  She’s pretty consistent about wearing her watch today. Hoping that having the grandkids on the face will be enough to keep her wearing it.

Are there better options for this? Has anyone tried this and been successful?"
"Can anyone share their experience with calling adult services on a parent with Alzheimer’s? 

Right now, my parents are in failing health and  don’t have any savings to their name. My mother is mentally ill, a lifelong alcoholic, and now has an Alzheimer’s diagnosis. 

I (30f) am completely overwhelmed and would like to hear from those who have any information on what services adult services can provide for memory care, etc."
"My brother and I are totally on board with this.  It’s time.  Next Monday, I’m going to have to go to the place and move her in.  Then we have to get Dad out of there and get him home to an empty house.  Just wondering if anyone has experience with this.  When is it time to leave the facility?  When is it time to leave him at home?  What on earth do you say?"
"My dad was a verbally abusive person for as long as I can remember. He would use terrible slurs and yell at curse at us and anyone who disagreed with him. He was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s at 57. I know sometimes those symptoms manifest for years before a diagnosis. Something I’ve noticed is that while he has forgotten how to do most things and now lives in a nursing home, he always maintained being verbally aggressive. He still screamed and cursed at my mom and sister, and the caretakers who would come to our house before he was placed. No matter what mix of medication he was on, he still maintained those curse words and racism he always had. I know aggression can be part of the confusion but the doctors, caretaker and nurses where he is now say that he’s one of the most verbally abusive patients they’ve seen. Do you think as the disease progresses, you become a caveman instant type of personality you always were? I know of so many of those with Alzheimer’s who are quiet, kind and soft spoken and were good people beforehand. I was just wondering if you become more of a version of the type of person you always were."
"Hi folks! I was born with my great grandmother having already lost who she was due to Alzheimer’s, so from an early age I knew about the disease. I have now watched my grandmother dissolve away, and now she doesn’t know she has children, let alone grandchildren. I am watching my aunt, her caretaker, suffering from burn out fatigue with a fear of her being next to succumb to the disease. The next step is to place my grandmother in a home just like her mother. 

I turn 24 this month, and fuck, I feel like my whole world just said “it’s time to live your life before you potentially lose yourself.” It’s time to enjoy my time with my father before he potentially loses himself. I bought the book “The subtle art of not giving a f*ck” to help kickstart my campaign of living. I am moving across my state, I am starting a new job, and I am moving in with my loving boyfriend. Watching my loved ones be so confused is so heartbreaking, and yet, I feel so invigorated to LIVE. I understand that there is the potential I don’t have the disease, but I don’t want to take the chance. 

Shout out to everyone who is taking care of their loved ones, you deserve the world."
im 17 and my dad was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s about a year ago. he'll sometimes have these emotional outbursts where he'll call my mom and me names (or homophobic slurs in my case). i know there's not really a way to get him to stop given his mental state and i know it's not really him saying it but does anyone have any advice for dealing with this on my end bc at this point i struggle to be around him at all.
"I lost my Dad to EOAD when he was only 56. I was 22 when he passed. I’m now 26, married, and full of anxiety about whether I have any of the autosomal dominant APP/PSEN1/PSEN2 genes because I’d like to have children in a few years. My dad was the oldest of 5 siblings, who are all doing well so far. If you were me, would you get a genetic test before deciding to start a family?"

My grandpa's hobby through out his life was painting (and other creative artsy things), and I tried to create a dementia friendly art desk. I'm not sure if I really accomplished that well lol. Labeling the drawers with what's inside didn't really help. If he can't see it in front of him, he can forget where something is. But he's already cracked out one painting of a viking ship ahaha and I think he might attempt the leprechaun next

I did a stew. She didn’t want it. Had beans on toast instead. I’ve got stew for every meal tomorrow.
"Just venting.

My mom has Alzheimer's and is only 67 years old. She lives alone in a different town a couple hours away. It is so tough to help her manage her house with all the things that need repairing. I don't get the full story from her, she goes and tries to solve these problems herself, doesn't remember that I've told her I'll deal with it. A month ago she bought a new tv cause her current bedroom tv ""wasn't working"" (I told her it was, she had just unhooked the cable box). Last week had a guy out to fix her roof shingles, and now she says she is looking at the back of the house and he didn't fix any. Did you tell him to fix shingles at the back of the house or only the front? Did you not look at the work before paying him (with support worker present).

I am trying to remind myself that I should be asking more questions and not assuming her abilities today are the same as last week. It's just exhausting and frustrating, and I feel bad that sometimes my initial reaction is wanting to just shout what the hell mom, this is so simple! :("
"Hi.

A long post for a first post.

About 5 years ago I became, accidentally, a caregiver for my grandfather.  

I lived mostly with my grandparents as I was growing up.  They legally adopted me.  They were basically my parents though my mother is alive and I am close with her as well.  My grandmother died over 20 years ago.  

Anyway, 6 years ago, I was living abroad and came home for Christmas to visit my family.  We were in the beginning stages of realizing my grandfather had Alzheimer's at that time.  While I was visiting, my grandfather fell on a patch of ice and shattered the bones in his lower leg.  He was living with his ""girlfriend"" at that time and they were a good pair, she was strong of mind and he was strong of body, and they made it work.  With his broken leg, they could no longer make it work.  My visit turned into me living with them and nursing my grandfather back to health.  After 5 or 6 long months, his leg was healed and I was ready to be on my way.  Just as I was making arrangements to leave my grandfather's girlfriend broke her hip and moved into an assisted living.   My grandfather, we were just figuring out, was not able to take care of himself any longer. 

I stayed with him.

After a few months of that, we, the family, decided he would go stay in the assisted living where his girlfriend was.  He wasn't in favor of that, but we eventually got him to agree.  While those arrangements were being made, I was talking with him about it everyday trying to make sure he understood what was going to happen.  It became clear that that was not at all what he wanted.  I said that I would stay with him in his house.

As the disease goes, it's been getting harder and harder to take care of him.  It's only my mom and I that help him.  I haven't had a full day and night away from him in almost two years.  

Just before the pandemic started I was going to move him into the assisted living with his girlfriend.  With COVID, that got put on hold.  Complicating the issue is that she lives in another state.  

I'm again, trying to get him out to where she is.  Though they haven't lived together since 2017, they have talked on the phone nearly every night since.  She's been the one constant person in his life (other than me) throughout all of this.  His other grandchildren have basically nothing to do with him.  He has two grandchildren that live in the same city he does, they haven't acknowledged him since Christmas.  He has two other grandchildren that live in other states, they sent him a Christmas card and nothing more.  As mentioned, my mom sees him a few times a week so I can try to recharge, and he has a son who lives in another state who calls him sporadically. 

I quit my job 5 years ago when he broke his leg.  I had a part time job for a while when he was able to be left alone for a few hours and mostly just needed help with meals.  I quit that job when he was no longer able to be left alone.  It was agreed that he would give me some money every month to replace some of the income I lost.  

My plan for moving him in with his girlfriend involves me moving to the state where she is since he has no other family there (other than a sister who may also have some form of dementia). I'm planning on asking for him to take care of my moving expenses and living expenses for a maximum of 2-3 months after the move while I get myself situated.  Along with his expenses moving into the assisted living, it's going to be a bit of an outlay of cash for him.   He does have a house, some money in a retirement account and a long-term care policy that I, conservatively, estimate at over $500,000 all together.  He's not poor.  But, I know the expenses can add up quickly.  

I think this situation is reasonable.  It's the only way he can be where his girlfriend is as no one else is willing to move so he'll be able to live with his girlfriend (again, other than myself and my mother, she's the only person he has regular contact with).  I've given up 5 years and 2 jobs already to provide care for him.  I'm asking for a couple months of rent money while he's also paying to stay in assisted living, along with enough for some simple furnishings for an apartment and a little cash to get by while I look for a job in a state that I'd never move to if not for this situation.  

My aforementioned uncle will, I'm sure, see it differently.  I have no doubt that my uncle cares for and wants the best for my grandfather.  But he and I do not see eye to eye on anything.  And the whole situation has become quite acrimonious between us.  He has little to say about the situation with his father, except about finances.  I have no doubt when I propose this that it will cause problems.  So, I just want to make sure that I'm not out of line in what I'm asking.

&#x200B;

tl;dr: I quit my job 5 years ago to care for my grandfather.  He gives me some money for his care.  I want to ask the family to approve him paying for me to relocate with him to another state where he can live in an assisted living where his girlfriend lives.  Is this reasonable or am I taking advantage of him financially?



Edit

Just to clarify.  I don't think the current situation is taking advantage of my grandfather

It's the situation about moving out of state and him, potentially, paying my living expenses even though I won't be directly taking care of him since he will be in an assisted living.  But, my moving out of state is still an expense for me that I would be taking on for his benefit.  Thus, I feel it's fair that he pay it."
"They got up at 10AM. Had breakfast, lunch and dinner at vaguely “normal” times. While they were having a nap in the afternoon I felt comfortable to go on a half hour walk. All food was eaten with no picking at bits. Told her about what the family are doing with no repeats. At bedtime she was tired and wanted to get to sleep. Some days are not just averagely nice, they’re actually really happy times."
"Sitting here with my best friend as her husband and best friend of 36 years walks him home, finally. Our Robbie was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s in 2017- he was only 59. The doctors explained how aggressive this type of diagnosis is and how rapidly her life would change… it was not an understatement. The cruelty of this disease is that you lose your person twice. Once while they are physically in front of you, and then again when they are called home. He is 65 years old and tonight we are heading into night 2 of sitting by his side as he slowly leaves our lives in the physical form. This disease is so cruel and my heart goes out to all of you who are also living in this heavy reality. Love & light to you all - you are not alone. Big hugs to everyone 💜"
"So my grandmother has dementia in the worst stage now, it’s been getting worse over 4 years but now there is hardly anything left of her. It’s been a lot for my mother ( her daughter) but I’m afraid now that I see some symptoms with her now too. I’ve never been close to my grandmother, showing for example in how up until my mid to late teens she would still give me presents with clothes in the size  that I wore in 3rd grade. 
I always put it with The fact that I hardly ever saw her but maybe those were the early stages for her.

Right now I’m visiting my mother and today just been a lot. She’s been asking me the same 4 questions about 5ish times in the span of an hour and again a few hours later. And she’s been telling me the same story of what happened to her about the same amount of times. 
When I phoned her earlier today her voice sounded different, higher more head voice like. She basically sounded like her mother. Now when I arrived her voice sounded the same and only after a few hours shifted back to her regular tone. 
I’m very sensitive when it comes to people constantly repeating themselves and me also having to tell the same thing over and over and over again so this stuck with me today. Over the past 2 years I’ve noticed this behaviour with her a lot more often. Of course she is afraid that she ends up just like her mother. We are a forgetful family as in constantly misplacing things we need, especially while we’re ovulating but it’s getting out of the ordinary now.

Can this be early indicators?"
"I am a 48y (F) married to my 51yo (M) spouse for 27y.  We have a 22yo (F) child who lives with her fiancé (23y M).  Right now I am classified mildly cognitive impaired but I also suffered a TBI last Autumn after being hit in the head accidentally by a piece of luggage in a plane while traveling alone.  That is how we found out about the EOA which is why I brought it up.  
A couple of months (6) before the TBI, my husband retired. We sold our house, bought a big RV and decided to become nomads because the last 25 years of our lives had been difficult, struggling with serious illnesses (mine and our child’s mostly) that seriously impacted our ability to travel even 2 hours from our home.  Traveling had been something we always wanted to do and saw this as our chance to finally do it, so we did.  
Now, I’m worried what my new impairments will mean to the life we have chosen.  I know that it could be a while before we see significant impairment but there are already things that are difficult like my not being able to lay down short term memory correctly.  He has to remind me on a daily basis about things that I would never have forgotten before.  Everything from prior to the last year is pretty solid, up until the head injury.  From there it is almost like a blank page on a lot of things.  I manage our finances, I always have, we hadn’t had a late payment in over 15 years… we’ve had 3 in the last 6 months.  I can’t just hand the finances off to him because he’s horrible at it, that’s why I took it over.  I got us straightened out financially and the thought of it going to hell causes a lot of stress.  A lot.  I’ve got a calendar on my phone now to remind me of due dates and I’ve put auto pay on everything I can to avoid late payments, are there other tools I should be using?  
I’m taking my med cocktail to slow progression and while it has given me a bit more alertness it hasn’t changed anything significantly.  I have other health issues (I’ve lost half my abdominal organs in a massive surgery [total pancreatectomy] to save me from a serious illness about 14 years ago) and our daughter has significant mental health issues.  He has diabetes type 2, I am type 3 from my abdominal surgery so those are all things that we have to deal with on a daily basis.  We’ve lost a lot of family in the last couple of years, most CoVid related, and that has impacted how we have viewed our end of life plans.  What we didn’t plan for was for either of us losing who we are and I don’t know how to handle that.  He is my rock, he’s amazingly kind and patient but I know what dementia can look like and I don’t want him to have to deal with that on his own.  That’s where the guilt comes in HARD.  
Suggestions?  I know it’s a lot of info to throw at you but I figured the more you know the better you understand what we’re dealing with.  TIA"
"I know a small amount of games can help reduce anxiety in anxious people. Also I would like to help support some light cognitive processing for my mother and bond whilst we are long distance. 

My first thought “words with friends”, it’s like a scrabble game and i remember having lots of fun with it. 

If anyone is familiar with that, is it a good choice? Do you have other app recommendations? My mother was diagnosed a year ago. 

Also I just realized so many apps have ads all over them which are annoying but I accept them when I’m playing, however I know they may be overwhelming for mum. So maybe I have to look for a game that’s paid so there isn’t ads

Thanks for your thoughts anyone!!"
"Hey all,

Anyone have any suggestions as to how to stop my father from using the bathroom sink?

He's either peeing in the sink, or shaking his pee off in the sink. This wouldnt be too big of a deal, but it emits quite an odor after awhile. The odor usually comes from the main drain or overflow drain. 

I'm usually working in the basement, but I'll come up to check on him every couple of hours and be greeted by the horrible odor from the bathroom sink.
It got so strong that I taped off the sink bowl to signal its 'off limits'. I also placed a make shift sign over the red tape stating ""do not use"". It works for awhile until he eventually rips the tape/sign off completely.

Any thoughts? Just deal with it?"

"Good day!

I have a mother-in-law that is currently living with my family. It was not out of financial necessity but preference as we enjoy staying close as my family travels a lot for work.

A recent doctor visit indicated some early onset conditions of Alzheimer’s.

Understanding that how long she lives with us under what condition is a complex question that needs to be answered, I would like to set that aside, and instead ask:

How can we create a comfortable living environment where her deteriorating memory and awareness are as least impactful as can be? I like to think a platonic 50 first dates.

- She will always have a portion of space that is just hers.

- We have some important personal objects that she associates strongly with that decorate her room.

- We are all planning on at least a few therapy sessions to establish positive behaviors. Especially for my young daughter that may not fully understand.

Thoughts?"
"My mom has extremely advanced, terminal Alzheimer’s. She was committed to hospice care on Friday after collapsing (she’s been living in a facility the past year). At the time the nurses apparently told my dad — I wasn’t there — she doesn’t have much longer and might die over the weekend. She hasn’t eaten solid foods (or really anything) in a week or more and weighs only about 80 pounds. She’s on methadone and a few other sedatives; yesterday when I visited her she didn’t wake up. She just sort of lays there like a cadaver, breathing in a raspy way. 

My question for others on here is: how long did your loved one last at the very end? I can’t believe she’s still clinging to life because she seems so weak and broken, but could she stay like this for another week? Two? I know death comes on its own time and isn’t beholden to anyone, so I’m just looking to hear other people’s stories about the End. Thanks."
"my mom hasn’t got the mammogram exam and blood test  since she was diagnoised with Alzheimer’s disease in 2017. My mom lost her medical insurance in 2018 because she had to quit her job due to her disease,

so my parents didn’t go to the doctors forawhile.. they had medical A and B since they qualified because of their age  , but due to financial reasons. They didn’t want to deal with copayments and I normally bought their medications through Walmart with the RX discount ..

&#x200B;

currently we’re financially better because my sister is helping me and I got a remote job, also doing side delivery gigs …my parents also got a senior advantage plan with their original hospital , so they are seeing their regular doctor normally…

&#x200B;

my Moms primary physicIan wanted her to get a breast exam and blood work , since she hasn’t done it for a few years, so I set the appointment for Friday .I take her to the appointment and I notify the nurse/staff she has Alzheimer’s disease…..I was in the waiting room but the nurse assistant came out in five minutes with my mom and told me it’s impossible to do this exam..while my mom was coming out in tears. I don’t know what happen but I know my mom doesn’t listen to anybody and she will get aggressive because of Alzheimer’s. The staff didn’t tell me what exactly happen but I guess they were frustrated.

&#x200B;

then I told my mom lets just do the blood test …once we have her seated. She keeps crying about wanting to go home and gets up ..Im already frustrated. I even have to raise my voice a bit in front of public ppl .. I just told myself. I just want to go home and I’m gonna reschedule the appointments again…"
"Hi guys. My partners mum was diagnosed a few weeks ago with early onset. He has been to see her and said ‘there’s nothing to her’ and that she is barely eating. There was food in the fridge that had gone past their sell by/best before dates because she’s not touching and, she does however have food such as pasta, in her cupboards, she just won’t eat it. My partner bought them a takeaway and made toast as well as a roast dinner and she demolished it, so it seems that she will eat when it is put in front of her but she won’t make it/cook it herself. 

I have suggested pre-packaged sandwiches from a supermarket, so she doesn’t have to make them and they are there and ready to eat and a meal delivery service has also been suggested  as a possible option. Is there anything else we can do? Thanks!"
"My dad (58 with early on set) is finally in a nursing home because he needed to be given a feeding tube in his stomach and Medicare has been paying for it for 1 days. We are about halfway there and although my mom has had an elder care lawyer for about a year, the process for Medicare and now Medicaid has been horrible. Medicaid denied us so the process is going through again. So far she has spent thousands of dollars and has nothing left for herself besides her home. 

Does anyone have experience making a parent/spouse a ward of the state? Would  my mom be financially responsible after that? Could we still visit him even if we give up rights?"
"You didn't read that backwards. My dad legitimately forgets that he has eaten. Every day, every meal. 

He's 67 and had a stroke in 2014, absolutely no working memory and his long term memories cut off at around 1979. I moved him into my house after my mom passed in October. Over all, we love having him around and bonding with his grandkids! But there's one issue: he is ALWAYS eating.

For example, I'll cook dinner. He'll have a serving and ask for a second. No worries there, I have two teenagers - there's always plenty of leftovers. But here's where it gets funky - he'll go put his plate up and grab a pb&j sandwich on his way back. Up to 3 times per meal. He also pops out for a sandwich.

His wait shocks me, too. He's maybe 5'6"" (about 1.7m),but weighs about 160lbs (about 80-ish kg, doing the math in my head). We've had tests run, but his docs have no clue what is making so utterly ravenous!

Anyone who has had a similar experience?"
"What is the best undergarment you have found? Dad is wearing Depends and still having leaks pretty often. 

Thanks!"
"How can my wife find out whether she is likely to get a diagnosis for early onset Alzheimer’s? 

My mother-in-law (64) was officially diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in the last year, but we’ve all known for several years that she had it. My mother-in-law’s older sister was diagnosed about five years ago after several years of symptoms, and her mother was in a home for many years with it dementia-related issues, but not official diagnosed. 

My wife (36) is interested in knowing what her chances are of getting it so we can make better-informed life decisions. What does she need from her mother while her mother is still alive? I’ve heard of genetic counselors. Is that something we should be exploring? We’ve lived overseas for the last eight years and will be returning to the United States this summer and can finally spend some time on this. 

Any advice on how to proceed?"
"9AM,  make breakfast “I don’t want it”. Stays in bed
Midday, make lunch “I don’t want it”. Stays in bed
3PM, snack time “I don’t want it”. Stays in bed
6PM, make dinner “it’s too much”. Stays in bed
9PM, snack time “I don’t like that”. Stays in bed
Midnight, gets out of bed, “I’m hungry”."
"I apologize if this post is just a ramble, my head isn't on right at all. I'll try to keep it short.

I had been helping my grandpa and dad take care of her for quite some time now, I've been doing all the physical stuff they can't do(both disabled). She's pretty far along now, she rarely knows who I am, cannot be left alone for literally any amount of time, beginning to lose a lot of cognitive function like her words running into eachother or sometimes it just makes zero sense. We were already considering putting her in a home soon- and then my grandpa suddenly passes. He was my rock, practically raised me and taught me so much more about life than any other adult ever has. He was completely fine a week ago and yesterday he passed while basically in a coma. Not only am I totally torn up right now over his death but now I have to take care of her by myself and I just can't. But we can't afford to place her anywhere. A social worker is supposed to come by Monday, but I'm not sure how that's supposed to help. I know nothing about any of this or what we can and can't do. All I know is if I try to take care of her for the rest of her life I am 100% going to lose my mind. I have no idea how anyone can bear to take care of a family member with Alzheimers any farther along than this.

Any advice at all is highly appreciated."
"I've been blessed to have a very close relationship with my grandparents my whole life.... but a few years ago my grandpa was diagnosed.   


Within the past few months... he has declined rapidly. Everything about it is awful. People can say ""cherish the good days"" but it gets incredibly hard to do so when those become fewer and fewer. It's absolutely crushing to watch someone you look up to turn into a shell of their former self. I want him back. I want more time. I want my grandma to enjoy her remaining years, but instead she's watching the love of her life slowly slip away. She is the strongest person I have ever known but it wears on her so badly. 

The worst part... is that there is nothing more that can be done. It doesn't matter how many times he goes to the doctor or the amount of medicine he's on. We've been told there isn't anything left to do. To know that it will only get worse is sickening. It's unfair.

I know we aren't the first family to ever be affected by this, but it still hurts, it still sucks."
"Sorry for the long story. There is a summary of my question and a TLDR at the bottom.

  I want to give some backstory. My mom got early onset Alzheimer's/dementia and over the course of 8years I watched her completely forget who she was, who I was. Near the end before we put her in a care home I was changing her diapers. She would talk to her reflection in the mirror like it was her friend. I'd come out in the middle of the night sometimes to find her just standing there staring into darkness or facing a corner. It was really unnerving. She started getting symptoms when I was about 16 or so and she died when I was 23, my younger brother only 18.  Her dad died of Alzheimer's but his didn't set in until he was around 80years old. Her symptoms started when she was about 40. She always said she wouldn't die of that disease and technically, she didn't. She progressed really rapidly in the care home and In her last few days she became violent, attacking other residents in their sleep. So she was sent to a psych and they prescribed her some medication. Well this medication made her really dizzy and a couple days later she fell and hit her head. She died of brain trauma/internal bleeding. So her statement did stand true in the end, she didn't let that horrible disease be the thing to take her out.. although i believe she died long before her physical body did anyways.. Now none of that is really the point of this post. Since she had early onset that means she carried a specific gene that caused it. This is hereditary so me and my younger brother have a 50/50 chance of carrying it. This gene can be found in a DNA/Gene test.  If I carry this specific early onset gene it is pretty much 100% that I will get early onset Alzheimer's. If i don't carry it there's still always the chance I can get it later in life but it's not a certain thing.

TLDR:  If I don't carry the early onset gene Id get some bit of peace of mind. But if I do carry it there are 2 cons and 2pros that come to mind.
 Con #1- it will most certainly effect  health or life insurance right?
 Con #2- I feel like I'd psych myself out and think about it all the time, worry if any small thing I forget is symptoms setting in etc.
 Pro #1) I could likely start trying tests studies treatments & prevention methods early on and 
Pro #2) I would try harder than I have been to live my life to the absolute fullest knowing that I could die in my 40s. I already live by this to an extent as i know every day isn't guaranteed but I'd definitely spend a lot more time doing the things I love in the next 10years or so.

 I know in the end it comes down to what I want to do but my question for you is, would you want to know?"
My grandmother has mid to late stage dementia and Alzheimer’s and we’re trying to place her in a facility that can provide the care she needs since we cannot. The only facility near us that can provide the level of care she needs is quoting us about $3000 more than we can afford. Does anyone have any resources that would help us financially? She doesn’t qualify for Medical. And board and care isn’t able to provide the level of care she needs. I’m desperate for any help because we’re running out of time
"hello, i am 17. i am ftm (female to male, transgender) but not out to him or many people in my family (although he would almost 100% be supportive. i’m so much sure of the fact he’d be supportive i’m more certain he’d support me then my own mum would) and i am autistic. 

due to my autism i am unsure how i can help, and i don’t think i can process this in the same way as most of my family. but i will figure that out so i am not worried about that. 

i have not had any personal experience with alzheimer’s before. most of my grandad’s siblings had it before they passed away, and he’s 80 now so i guess it was expected for him to get alzheimer’s or something similar. 

his wife, my nanny or nana, is 77. neither can drive and they rely on each other heavily. 

they have been together since they were 15 and 17, turning 18, and celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary last december. 

he’s been my only grandad as my other one passed away before i was born and i’ve never had to properly deal with the passing of a close relative. 

what i am worried about is 2 things; my grandma had a heart attack the day after her husband’s funeral and almost died- and i’m worried that may nana might have the same happens when this horrible disease really makes his quality of life go downhill.

i am also worried because i don’t know what to expect and i have so many questions. 

how long does the decline take to happen?

how do i help him?

how do i help my nana?

how painful is this for him? 

what can i even do?

how much of this can be prevented or halted?

when does he get medical help?

how long will he have to suffer for?

is it a good idea to come out to him or will it confuse him further? 

will he forget who i am?

what do i do?

will it hurt?

will he be okay until shortly before he passes or might he be in pain for a long time before?

are the questions which spring to me.

i don’t know whats going to happen or when and it scares me. i’m close to all 3 of my grandparents; probably more then i am to anyone else in my family, and i’ve never lost anyone as close to me as this, and i’m worried about when i’ll lose him. i’ve never even seen anyone seriously sick long term in my immediate family before. i’ve been the really sick person as i had cancer as a 12 year old and went through chemo for 2 and a half years. but i’ve never been on the other side of this so i have no clue what to expect when seeing him seriously i’ll. 

i don’t know what i’m hoping to achieve from this post. i guess it’s a vent. i think i’m looking for support. mostly guidance and answers tho; though i’m not sure anyone can give them.

thank you for any and all help"
"In effort to make this as short as possible,
I (30F) have a strained relationship with my alcoholic mother (65F)  who is mentally ill, and recently diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s. 

My parents are low-income, and have no savings or no plan for the future. They live about 2 hours away from me. Father is negligent and does not care/ doesn’t think what’s happening is a concern. He will not communicate with me or update me about her condition, and is afraid of speaking to me on the phone because she typically walk in and accuse him of gossiping about her. I have one sibling who is estranged and out of the picture, so ultimately no family support at all. The only saving grace is that they do qualify for Medicaid, but I have no idea what benefits IF any will be available to them for assisted living, etc. and need to figure this out. Maybe speaking with a social worker would be a good next step?

I am barely able to take care of myself due to generalized anxiety (can’t drive on the interstate, for example) and it’s all I can do to function and work at my new and very stressful, demanding job. 

There is a family friend who has recently started communicating with me, who is helping me parents by bringing them food, driving my mother to appointments, etc. I am VERY thankful and appreciative that she is willing to help out. She has expressed concern regarding their financial affairs, and is pressuring me to get POA, inform HR at my employer about my mothers condition in anticipation of me needing of take time off of work to take care of mother, etc. 

With everything I have on my plate, I am not able to or consenting to jeopardize my situation at work to take care of my mother. Nor do I want the responsibilities that come with POA. Due to my stressful situation at work, I am unable to attend my OWN doctors appointments, and have had at least 3 appointments of my own come up that I’ve “no show” due to me actually forgetting to go, because of my demanding work schedule. I can’t even see a therapist regularly, which I need. 

So how am I supposed to drop everything and risk jeopardizing my job, my livelihood, to drive to a different city that’s 2 hours away and keep up with my mothers appointments? 

I guess I’m at a loss because I have no experience with any of this, or no family support. I grew up poor, so I have no family members who can help support me financially. My parents fucked up my childhood and I don’t want to be robbed of a decent adulthood. I don’t have the capacity to be a caretaker and don’t know what to do.  

Has anyone been in this situation or can offer any advice?"
"I'm really struggling with how to help my parents.

My mom (70) clearly has some cognitive deficits, which have been getting worse for the past 5-6 years. It started with occasional word-finding problems, but now she is confused about lots of things (events that are recent and in the distant past). I know she is seeing a neurologist, but my parents do not communicate any of this with me (41) or my sibling (38). I don't understand if they are trying to protect us, or just have their heads in the sand and want to pretend that there are no problems. If there has been a formal diagnosis, nobody has shared that information with us.

My Dad (78) is completely sharp mentally, but really really stubborn.  He has made it very clear that he has no intention of ever leaving their house (which has 5 bedrooms, no proximity to any public transit, no bedrooms or bathrooms on the first floor, and has a large yard that they have to maintain). For now, this is going OK-ish, but if something ever happens to my Dad (even something temporary, like having a minor fall, or needing to recover in a rehab facility), I'm scared that my Mom won't be able to survive on her own. She still drives, but I'm scared to ride with her. Sometimes she will get lost, or simply forget where she's going after she leaves the house. I can also see her forgetting to turn off the stove and starting a fire.

Both my sibling and I live out of state (a plane ride away).  I don't know what to do. I think my Mom would actually enjoy being in a senior living community with graduated levels of care (she's a really sociable and generally happy / agreeable person, and she would really enjoy participating in planned group activities). We're still at the point where she could participate in the planning. There's a facility near where they live that is really nice (they have multiple friends who live there! they love the on-site restaurant!), and others that are closer to me or my sibling.

How do I address this?

Note: I actually have the ability to move closer (remote work option), but I don't want to become their full-time caretaker, nor do I want to take responsibility for maintaining their house.  I could conceivably use this as leverage to negotiate with my Dad (I'll move nearby, but only if you agree to downsize into senior living. Otherwise you are on your own!), but this sounds kind of awful.

Not sure what to do."
"I’m here in US and my grandma is with my parents and grandpa back in my home country. She’s 78 and her dementia has deteriorated rapidly in past 2 years and I am just looking for advice to make her life a little more bearable. 

She’s always anxious, never want to be left alone. 99% of the time she has company and even during that time she’s very anxious always trying to find other people in the house or assuming she’s in someone else’s house and wants to back to her home.

She has no interest in watching television, listening to music etc. So basically she has no way to kill time. I believe she’s mentally suffering every day and it also impacts my grandpa the most as it sometimes gets frustrating for him. 

Is there any way we can relieve some of her anxiety and make her calm and find an activity that can actually keep her busy couple of hours a day. We have tried a couple of doctors and medicines and nothing really helps out :("
"It is starting. But as bad as this is going to sound, I am not overwhelmed with sadness at this particular thought. 

This week has been unusually difficult. Not only has she had diarrhea every hour for days (anyone got a red bull??), but I also have some things in my life going haywire. 

This morning during a bathroom run at 2am as I was picking her up out of bed, she stated ""who is you?""... She has long forgotten dates, locations, aquaintances, but It's the first time she hasn't recognized anyone that's family. 

If someone had told me she was saying that before we (my 2 yo and I) started staying with her, I would have thought it was the saddest thing. But I'm so tired this week that in my head I'm thinking the same thing! 

WHO IS YOU? Where is my sweet grandmother who never had a bad thing to say? Who is this person with this constant grimace that appears to be some permanent under bite? Why does it seem your goal is to burp loudly on purpose and then grunt afterward like it was a painful surprise? Where is the considerate person who thought of others too? 

I know I'm cruel. I know it's not her fault and she is in there somewhere. But one of her main carers is starting cancer treatment soon. I know she won't be able to keep up her schedule forever. Sometimes when I think about doing this forever, I feel like I'm having an asthma attack. The kind where the panic sets in long before the end. 

Anyway, this post is just a vent I guess. I am trying so very hard but I'm breaking a little too. But like many of you (I'm sure) I save my breakdowns for 2am reddit sessions so that no one else can tell just how much I can't breathe. 

Kudos to all you who are the real angels. I read some of these posts last night during many wakeups and just think how amazing it is that people can love that hard."
"Hello guys,

Back in 2016 my grandfather passed. He had a heart attack while cleaning the roof unfortunately. He was really stable and looked after his wife, my grandmother, really well. 

At his funeral, I remember my grandma saying to my uncle that she was “losing her mind”. This was the first sign, and we quickly got her tested. A little after my grandfather passed we learned she had Alzheimer’s. 

In an effort to cope, I turned to music. For those who are looking for a resource and don’t mind country music, I’d recommend Riley Green’s “Numbers on the Cars”. It tells the story of him and his grandfather. I’ve never been able to relate more to a song. 

I like the song, and it still brings a tear to my eye even after she’s passed. 

Hopefully it helps another who went through / is going through what i am."
"Hi everyone. My grandmother has been dx for over a year now, with memory issues/dementia onset for quite some time prior to that. She is now living with my mom with her , myself, and my brother as caregivers. My mom has POA. 

Her whole life she's had unhealthy relationships with men and that hasn't settled down at all. Only now she doesn't have the judgement to not give out personal information or enter into relationships with sketchballs. For example she's currently ""engaged to marry"" 3 different men (fake profiles) that she has contacted through Facebook messenger. She's also chatting with strange men via texting, WhatsApp, kik, Google hangouts, Snapchat, etc. She's also previously downloaded tinder in recent history. Sometimes she's initiating the conversation and sometimes they are. 

Our dilemma is that we aren't sure how to manage this---we can't keep letting her put herself at risk but we also don't want to take away her phone completely or prevent her from contacting friends/family that are out of state- most of which is done through Facebook.


She uses an iPhone and is about to get a new one under my mom's phone plan so it would be the right timing to get the controls setup on her phone via an app or whatever else. Ideally it would allow us to see what's going on & remotely block people or delete apps, but I'm not sure that's even possible. Something that could be ran on and Android device as well would be ideal 😬

Wondering if anyone has ran into anything similar/knows of an app that could handle this. Or if we are off base all together in how we are approaching it..."
"Mom is physically active and appears healthy.  She's not old. She rambles a bit and loses her train of thought easily.  She has sticky notes all over the kitchen. And money (which she always handled) now confuses her. She can no longer differentiate between twelve hundred and twelve thousand.

&nbsp;

We visit her every day. We thought she was fine.  Last month she gave a stranger 87k.  She is NOT wealthy.  Thank God her bank takes 48 hours to process international bank wires.  She will get most of it back. 

&nbsp;


It's like her red flags don't work anymore.  Does anyone have POA?  I want her to have her checking. But I don't want her to be able to touch her savings or retirement account.  I want to get an alert when her checking goes under 5k or when she takes out more than $500 cash.


&nbsp;

I'm so not ready for this.  But with my sister, we'll build a security bubble around Mom. Just wanted to ask if we are on the right track.  Lawyer says we can sign POA paperwork next week.  What are we forgetting?"
"First time poster. My dad is 68 and was diagnosed with Alzheimer/vascular dementia around 2012. Today my mom is is full time caregiver - help walking, feeding, etc. as far as his interactions - he is familiar with my voice not really names. Not really talkative but says some words here and there. Just curious if it was 6 or 7 and basically how long he has? Sorry just a bit overwhelmed"
"I’ve read a lot about the connection and it makes me so angry that these chemicals are legal to be sold without a warning. I feel I have noticed the connection big time. My grandma drinks diet soda like it’s water and always has and now she’s in the last phase of having Alzheimer’s. When I mentioned the connection to my mom, she told me the only other person she ever knew with it was her friends mom a while back that had it come on very early and she drank diet soda like it was water as well. My other grandmother always has refused to touch fake sugar. She is 90 and totally with it. Drives, lives alone, etc. I am pregnant and have stayed away from these diet drinks after reading about how bad they are for unborn babies. Anyone else seriously pissed that this poison exists?? I’m mad!!!!! Why is it approved for human consumption?? And available so readily??? Wtf"

"For some background, I was raised by my moms side mainly. My mom and grandmother who I will call nanny here. A few months ago I visited my dads parents across the country to help watch my grandma because my grandpa was having a hip replacement. My nanny, mom and I last saw them when we all visited like 12 or so years ago. 

My mom and nanny  have both asked multiple times about if she can do things, like read and I’ve told them she can’t. It’s like they don’t believe me. They’ll say things like “she can’t read a short letter from us?” Snd they push it like I’m going to realize they’re talking about something smaller but I tell them she can not ever read at any time. When I was there and upset at my grandma being angry at me, they kept pushing ways to help her remember who I am... she doesn’t even know my grandpa is her husband and she doesn’t know she had children.. they would push and push ways to help her remember.. and  say things like “say you’re Jeff’s daughter” “say you’re my grandma”. Just the other day, again when we sent Easter cards , my nanny sent a prayer book and asked and I told her she can not read it. She kept asking and saying “she can read the card though, right? If it’s short? She has to be able to read that” I had to tell her she won’t remember the word she read before even if she can understand the letters together. Alzheimer’s is some scary stuff.. and I get it’s hard to believe without seeing it. That this can happen to a persons brain so quickly, who was so quick in the mind just a decade ago. But I’m not lying or exaggerating and it’s annoying that they don’t believe it. I’m sick of being told to call her grandma to help her remember or them claiming she’ll know who a gift is from"
"I can't find any information online whatsoever about someone so young getting a diagnosis like this. The absolute youngest I can find information on was someone who was 31.

"My mom is beginning to lose her short term memory. For the past couple of years, I would have to text her instructions or times/dates for things that I needed her to remember. Within the last 6 months, she will tell the same story 3 times within at hour if talking to a group of people. She doesn’t recall doing that. Her older sister passed away from
AD in her 50’s. My mom is in her early 70’s. 

My main concern right now is that she basically has a phobia of going to a doctor. She refuses to go. She hasn’t been examined by anyone in about 3 years. The only reason she went then is because she has asthma and needed a refill on her inhaler. 

She is out of prescriptions and is now getting some kind of over the counter inhaler, that I’m sure it not nearly as effective. We live in the south, and pollen has been really bad. She was boiling water and breathing over it because she couldn’t breathe yesterday and it wasn’t time to use the inhaler again.

I was so aggravated that she wouldn’t go see a doctor and get a prescription that would help her! Several family members have begged her to go and she refuses.. says she will go when she really needs to..

I need to get her checked out in general now that I feel that she may have AD. Does anyone have any tips on how to get their loved one to a doctor? Or has anyone experienced this “phobia”? I honestly think she is scared to go. My dad says she won’t even let him take her blood pressure at home."

"Hi, I’ve just joined this group as 2 days ago, my partners mum was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s following a brain scan. He is a neuro physiotherapist so he works with people with dementia so he has some experience of helping people in his mums situation. I however, am going in blind. How do we help her? We are 2.5 hours away from where she lives so I’m not sure what we can do. My partner works Monday-Friday and some weekends and we have 2 children and are therefore unable to pop up there all the time. How can we help from a distance?

Also, side note -  I lost my mum to cancer in February of this year and supporting my partner is bringing up a lot of emotion that I dealt with during my mums diagnosis. I’m struggling to help my partner when I’m going through grief myself? I’d be interested in hearing how you have been supported by partners/support your partners, thanks!"
"Hey guys!

I'm just looking for people to talk to about my family's situation and I don't know really know what resources to look out for. 

About three weeks ago my grandpa passed away suddenly from covid and we recently have taken primary care of my grandmother. She has recently been diagnosed with stage one Alzheimers and my family is deteriorating because of her. She mentally and verbally abuses my mom, accuses my teenage brother of stealing, and calls my dad a murderer and a rapist. Recently she has become physical by pushing around my mom, throwing furniture and we've had to start hiding our knives. My family is struggling and we have to find other housing options for her, but everything is way too expensive, and she doesn't qualify for medicare. Do yall have any pointers and any advice for me so I can help my family? I'm currently away at college and come home every two weeks or so."
"Hi all,

I bought my parents a Facebook Portal that they used for about a year. Now it sits unplugged on a dresser. I’d like to pass it on to a family that could use it. It’s in perfect condition and I assume it can be reset to factory settings. 

It’s a pretty cool device and helps you connect with loved ones via video when you can’t be there physically all the time. 

Please let me know if anyone would like me to ship this to them—just asking for shipping costs."

"My grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimers two years ago. It is really sad seeing her slowly degrade mentally, even though she still recognize everyone in her family. This is a pretty new situation for me, can anyone give me some advice how to support her and my grandfather who is there for her. It’s a rough time for both of them no doubt. Just two years ago the three of us traveled to Germany and now she doesn’t remember the names of her neighbours and favorite authors. It’s such a strange feeling mourning the inevitable while she’s still here and I notice that I keep thinking of her at least once a day.
Thanks."
"I was trying to just understand how my wife (69 yrs old diagnosed with Dementia about 3 years ago) thinks, like her thought process. 

I completely understand that her short term memory is horrible but was wondering if she is just living in the moment or she thinks things thru. If you met her you might think she is a little off center but still ok (I hope that makes sense).

I then ask her if she could explain to me how she thinks about doing tasks and I then go on to explain how my thought process works, an example being:

I’m going to play Pickleball so I:

Get Dressed, Grab my stuff, walk to car, start car, drive to court, play, etc……..

I then asked her what her thought process was like, and she already forgot what the question was! 

At that point what is there to really say other then I guess I now have the answer. 

I really just hate the my wife is going thru this and I’m losing my partner."

"Father 83 years old I'm sole caretaker, doing it for 7 years now up's downs you know the gist im ""used"" to it. but for the past year or so like clockwork around 8pm he wants to go home and it takes around an hour or more to make him ""stop"" and be content and stay. man it's so taxing. 

I mean he has incontinence bowel and urinary so I take care of that, and all the other stuff that comes with the territory no problem but this constant ""goin home"" gets me.."
"FIL is in AL but not memory care, so he can come and go.  I’m not worried about him getting lost because he’s not that progressed and his AL is in a part of town where he’s lived for 40 years (long term memory is still good).  I am worried that he’ll over do it and not be able to make it back home and get stranded.

He wears a medical alert necklace 24/7 but it doesn’t have a GPS locate so I was thinking about adding an air tag with the kind of water resistant cover you use for dog tags.

Thoughts?"
"He'll take money out, then forget that he took money out and then take more out. (You shouldn't even be driving himself to the bank where the ATM. We do the best weekend to stop him but it's not easy to keep track of him 24/7)

He gets a state issue disability check every month. And our mortgage payments are set to automatically withdraw from his account.

But he's reckless with money. Always has been. Even before he lost his mind. He doesn't understand how money works. He just keeps taking and taking. Takes out 400 to 600 a month to buy pot. (We still can't even figure out when and how he's getting it.)

In the comments section of a different post someone suggested contacting social services about having his check split between him and someone else. Someone else to manage his money. They wouldn't do it. It was a confusing conversation. Something about how his bank has an overdraft thing. So he can take more money out than he has. Which puts him in the negative. Which means social services can't give him a certain amount of money knowing that it's only going to pay off the negative balance and then he won't have any left.

I hope I'm explaining this right. I hope I'm making sense. We were trying to ask them to put $400 into his account as an allowance. And then put the rest of it into my mother's account. But because his account's always in the negative, they wouldn't do it.

My parents have separate bank accounts. So no one else has access to his account.

Could we ask the bank to cancel the overdraft service? I know typically no one else can make changes to a bank account without the account holder there. But if we explain the medical situation, and we're not asking to take any money from him. Would they do it? Or if we had some kind of doctor's note explaining he's incompetent, could we then take that to the bank and put my mom's name on his account as well?

We've tried to just take his wallet or bank card from him for a few days. We've tried to just prevent him from taking cash out until the mortgage is withdrawn. But he flies into fits of rage when he thinks he's being handled and treated like a child.

Sorry if this is long and rambling. Any suggestions though?"
"I might have posted this company before because they're doing a lot of work for caregivers especially in Florida.

"Short version (I can add info if needed), my FIL is stage 4 dementia.  He was living with a roommate with lots of family help (not doing well, but good enough) and then COVID happened.  Roommate almost died and is still recovering.  Family member who was helping lost her husband.

I am the legal guardian and I made arrangements for FIL to go into assisted living.  He can’t afford in home care and he doesn’t own his house (it’s in a trust, so he can use it until he dies but he doesn’t own it).

Even before Alzheimer’s, he was a negative and bitter person.  He has alienated most of his family.  I am stepping up as a humanitarian move.

He initially agreed with the move but now he’s changed his mind.  The problem is that his house is rented to help pay for his care and the help he needed to live alone is no longer available.

The reasons he gives for wanting to leave AL are not grounded in reality.  He thinks they’re stealing from him (items he hasn’t owned in years), they’re withholding eye drops (that are literally in his medicine cabinet) and they’ve intercepted his calls so he’s not getting the job offers that are coming in.

He’s not progressed enough for memory care, but AL is optional and so they won’t keep him there against his will.

I keep seeing advice not to try to correct someone with dementia, but if he walks out of there I don’t know what to do with him."
Is there any want to stop/help a grandparent from leaving the house especially at night? I think they’ve tried locks but she figures it out.
"Hello,

I’m not sure if any one can help me or steer me in the right direction but just looking for some help. My grandfather has Alzheimer’s (or possibly dementia) and is in full care by my grandmother (who admittedly is not the best with pushing for better medical care or testing from doctors). This morning he had an episode where he was laying down in bed, seemingly awake (eyes open and moving) but unresponsive to her calling him, touching him, etc. She called the paramedics and when they entered the room he “woke up” or became responsive again and was understandably agitated with them for being in his space. They took vitals and said that he was all good in that are and my grandfather refused to go to the hospital so they didn’t push it and left. 

My grandmother took him to his regular doctor today and said that it was just another stage of his decline. I am still concerned that it could be something else because I have never heard of it. I am the first point of contact for them but I am living out of state and trying to do my best from afar. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? Or can provide any more insight on what I should be doing next time I am there?"
"My dad has been in memory care for a couple of months now. Recently he had backpain and wouldn't leave his chair. So they sent him to the hospital to be checked on. They didn't find a source of the backpain (which seemed to go away on its own) but they did find blood clots in the lungs (blood thinners prescribed) and he was dehydrated so they pumped him with liquid. He was in bed for 3 or so days.

When I came to pick him up from the hospital he couldn't walk. I was really annoyed that the hospital wasn't helpful in that regard, but I chalked it up to his feet being swollen from the fluids. With a LOT of effort we finally managed to get him in the car, and back to the home. 

So I called today to see how he's doing and they said not great and that he's not walking on his own. Apparently they can get him upright with assistance but he can't walk. Sounds like he'll yell in pain when they manhandle him as well. 

The memory care doctor will be seeing him tomorrow so I know I just need to sit tight and not Karen until then, but I'm just so frustrated. He could walk just fine before hand. Dr. Google is telling me older people lose that function a lot faster after bed rest, but it just blows my mind."
"Hey guys. My father-in-law is under 60 years old and was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s about 10 years ago. My mother-in-law had always said that she would like to put him in a secure safe assisted-living facility if/when he starts to get violent or too difficult to deal with. Well, now it is “well he didn’t mean to hit me, he thought I was the dog” or “he isn’t going to hit me. He’s just making those motions with his fists.”

Let me preface this by saying she has “read all the books“ and she even leads an Alzheimer’s support group. I know she knows what she’s doing but I think her judgment is clouded because it is her husband.

She is not admitting to her kids the full extent of what she has to deal with on a daily basis. She’s not in denial about the fact of the disease is progressive, and that eventually he will be beyond her capacity to help, but I don’t think she is ready to admit that he is far beyond that point. She wants to have kids and grandkids over but also does not want her husband to be upset and stressed and angry.

Her kids legitimately had to have a meeting with her to convince her to get help just two times a week with an outside service that can come and give her a break. 

The hardest part is that she has told me that she doesn’t want to put him in a home because it will make her feel guilty. I know it is hard for me to understand because it is not my husband, but it is so hard to watch her lose control of him and have to take care of him or take him for drives when she really wants to spend time with her children and grandchildren. 

Are we being insensitive in thinking that he is more than ready to be in a secure facility? How do we navigate the conversation that she no longer has the capabilities as one woman to care for a 6 foot 200 pound relatively healthy otherwise man with early onset Alzheimer’s?

Side note: The facility has an excellent reputation and we have family that works there.

Any guidance or suggestions would be appreciated."
"Hi all,

Sorry in advance for this rant but it’s half two in the morning and I realized I just need to get things off my chest in order to sleep. I’ve been caring for a 92 year old family friend with Alzheimer’s for the past couple years. I (M22) live in the upstairs of her SoCal home and have been doing so for just over 10 years. My dad had to move here for work, but SoCal is very expensive. Thankfully she allowed us to rent her upstairs at an incredible price. My dad passed away in 2017 so I’ve been here alone with her for almost 5 years. Her Alzheimer’s is getting to be quite advanced e.g. - wandering, auditory hallucinations, not remembering close friends or photographs, not knowing where she is or where her parents are. She’s practically family to me now and I’m trying the best I can while also dealing with college. However recently I’ve been battling with some feelings that I’m not liking and am seeking some advice. I keep getting this awful feeling like I’m catching Alzheimer’s just by caring for her, being around her, or touching things she’s touched. This all started when I noticed some personal forgetfulness past the point of normalcy a couple months ago. I’m usually quite sharp/quick and this change kind of caught me off guard. It’s gotten to the point where over the past month I have been constantly second guessing my own memory and testing myself on minute details of my day to day activity. I know you can’t catch Alzheimer’s and I know those suffering from Alzheimer’s need just as much love and attention as we all do, but It’s like a horrible phobia that I can’t shake! I’ve been distant with her, and her daughter only comes to visit for a week or so every couple months. All she really has is me and a few friends who visit for an hour here and there once or twice a week. I just want to do what is right for her and care properly, but it’s impossible with whatever this is I’m experiencing. Thanks for reading and any advice would be much appreciated."
"Hey all. New member here. 
I guess I’ll give a quick background story; my maternal grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s back when i was in late grade school/early middle school. I was relied upon heavily as her caregiver (assisting my mom and a daytime aid we had most weekdays) and it was traumatic, to say the least. She was my best friend and it was just unreal to me that something could ravage a person like that. 
Now, my biggest fear is here. My mom was diagnosed officially last month, but i knew it had been coming for at least two years. The pandemic and some bad doctors really prolonged the diagnosis finally being on paper. 
I guess i y need to talk to other people who get it. My boyfriend, whom i live with, isn’t as supportive as i need. He lost his father last November and he keeps giving me shit for me talking about certain things regarding my mom in the past tense. He doesn’t understand that I’m in a grieving process. I do not speak about her like she’s dead, but i can’t call my mom for advice. Or to gossip. Or to joke about our weird family anymore. We can’t go shopping and try on clothes together anymore. It’s simple things. I feel that (he is a bit abusive but I’m looking for a way out of this, i wish we hadn’t moved in together, it’s so complicated right now for various reasons…) he almost tries to minimize my issues because my mom “is still here”. Some days he’s very loving and consoling but most he’s cold and is very critical of her doctors. He’s never met them, but he always makes sure to tell me every negative assumption he’s made. I finally have her with an excellent geriatric neuropsych, and he’s insisting that more could be done medication wise. I feel diminished. Like, you don’t think I’ve discussed these things to death with medical professionals?! 
Anyway, I’ve been in a dark depression for days now. It’s tough. I’m the only child and my dad is no spring chicken and i worry about how this will take a toll on him. 
But more than anything… i miss my mom. And my partner is not comforting about it. He has a slew of his own family issues which he expects me to always help with, and i do, but him insisting I’m wrong because i use past tense for certain things regarding my mother is irritating.  He doesn’t get that I’m grieving the fact that i can see my mom, but I’ll never get a text from her again. I’ll never be able to go to a Broadway show with her again or bake together at Christmas like we did every single year. It’a all so painful and I’m sick of how alone he makes me feel.  
Sorry for the rant. I’m just so deeply  drained physically mentally and emotionally and all i don’t know how much more of his crap i can take while i handle my mom’s needs. 
Sorry for the rant. I hate Alzheimer’s and i hate the lack of empathy among people. 
Thanks for reading, love and strength to you all 💜"
"Growing up I didn’t get to see my Dads side grandmother a lot. She lived a state over, and so I only got to see her maybe once a summer and over a holiday, unless she drove to see us, and those weeks always went by way too fast. But that was in elementary and middle school. She sold that house and moved to Florida when I was in middle school. I saw her physically 1 time In high school for Christmas and I am now 2 years into college and haven’t been able to see her since then due to COVID and just flights/school. Over my time in high school she developed Alzheimer’s, and we only ever talk when I call her, and it’s dependent on her being at the phone or not having lost her phone. And I loved the talks we had. It wasn’t too bad, just repeating some questions, but she knew most things and what I was up to and what was going on. It slowly got worse, but I cherished the time I had. But then for like a 4 month period she didn’t pick up,  and finally she picked up again. And it was not the same. She was depressed, and lost not knowing where she was. She was talking about her mother and grandfather coming to pick her up soon at the “motel she was at”, and thinking someone stole her car. It took her a minute to realize it was me,but when she reconnected those dots she cheered up, unlike any conversation she has had with my dad, mom, or sister the past year, and she started asking all kinds of questions about things I didn’t think she’d know about or remember. We were best friends, and I’m so afraid I’m on the edge of losing her. After we hung up the phone, I cried, it’s been two hours, and I’m unable to do anything else but think about the conversation we just had. I just want to see her, but I have no means to, and I just don’t know how when the time comes, I’ll function. 😭"
"If anyone can understand, it’s you guys. 

I (33f) am my dads only caregiver. He doesn’t need full time care necessarily at this point but it’s coming. I teach 75 minutes away from my home so my dad can stay in the home he’s lived in for nearly 30 years and I fully financially take care of my dad except for his small SSI check. 

My sister was going to visit from the other coast and take my dad for a few days while I was on spring break so I could live a few days of my adult life in my own home, getting things done around the house that I can’t get done otherwise. 

Woke up to a text that she’s been covid exposed and is waiting on a test but most likely won’t be able to come out and visit. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t lay in bed sobbing at 6am because I’d gotten my hopes up at having a few days of freedom. 

Tonight, went to check the mail and got the notice that the doctors office didn’t get the form in to IHSS for our initial assessment and so he’s been denied. 

There’s no end in sight and once again I’m laying in bed sobbing. I hate this. I hate my life. I have no help, I can’t get help, and I don’t have hope. I’m beyond burnt out and I’m doing this alone. Entirely alone. 

My friends can’t understand because they don’t live this life. I can’t get to a support group and so my entire therapy sessions are just me desperately crying to my therapist. I don’t need advice. I just need someone to understand what this is."
"Hello so trigger warning i guess is in order but a week ago we had to put our dog down as she was in pain from a tumor and that night my grandma stopped eating and the morning after she stopped drinking so it was obvious she was starting to decline and looking to be entering the death process on  Wednesday she seemed to get worse and worse by the day and by that morning her 02 sats were ""low 90s high 80s"" friday she calmed down enough to have her go to a nursing home because her care was overwhelming mom and she required almost 24/7 care so we had her transported there and we came to visit that night and they had a o2 tube in her nose which confused us so we asked and they told us her 02 during transport was 71 so they put a tube in and then they just kept it going at the home i get them doing it during a transport but not at the home they say its for her comfort and wont prolong death but i dont buy it to be honest it seems like a part of death and i feel some people with alzheimers die this way so it seems like eliminating a way of death which to me is prolonging death at a certain point her body just wont function on that low of a oxygen level so giving her oxygen seems like prolonging i get that it might be for comfort but to me death is uncomfortable the body doesnt like dying i can understand the morphine and haldol because those dont do anything other than help with pain and restlessness it doesnt help life but the oxygen seems like it would help her live longer she needs to pass soon and quickly she wouldve hated living like this and she would want it to be as quick as could happen also this nursing home is questionable i went to check on her today and the door was wide open which would be fine if i didnt walk in on her completely naked on the bottom edge of her bed just sprawled out and she had a few visitors earlier shes supposed to get morphine every hour an haldol every two hours both people said in the few hours they were there they never had a nurse come in and they had to get them to go give her her medicine which irritates me so im kinda questionable on their opinion so id like an outside opinion

TL;DR: My grandma is dying shes at a nursing home and they have her on O2 which confuses me since it seems like it would prolong life the home says its just for comfort but it seems as if it would prolong life im all for comfort but death is uncomfortable and it seems like they are preventing that way of death so does O2 prolong life"
"Hi there, my dad lives in a memory care unit. He has become aggressive with staff which is so opposite his personality. I know it’s just the dementia progression. He got admitted to psych this evening and they called me to tell me they had to restrain him to his bed because he assaulted a nurse. I am devastated. I’m not used to this part of the disease and I’m just wondering what happens after this. How much worse does it get? I am the only one responsible for his decision making/care and I just want to know what to expect. This is so painful; I can’t even believe this is a real illness."
"My mother is a resident in a really nice memory care facility. Last week she had another resident (a male who is a wanderer) come into her room in the middle of the night and crawl into bed with her. She was understandably terrified and had a meltdown. Lots of ""I need to get out of here"" and ""I am going to stop eating"". We got her calmed down and got her out for lunch so they could clean her bedding and make everything ""clean"".  It seems like it isn't the first time this poor man has done this but it's usually not at night. 

Mom is usually really focused on keeping her door locked to keep anyone from getting in her ""apartment"" (there are a few residents who wander in if the door is open during the day so she keeps it closed and locked whether she's in there or  not), but she must have not locked it. We talked to the staff (they're great) and they said that they'd check her door every half hour at night and also if they happened to be walking by. So all seemed to be under control. 

Until it happened again two nights ago. There's definitely no malicious intent by this poor man - he's definitely unaware of just about everything around him. However - my mother needs to feel secure in her room. 

Has anyone experienced this before as either the LO of a wanderer into other people's rooms or as a person who's LO has a wanderer show up in their room?  I am looking for ideas or thoughts on how to handle this so mom feels safe - without making a big deal and getting this man in hot water, if possible. TIA."
"Regardless of people's thoughts about aducanumab, the Medicare decision will go down in history as seriously misguided.  So they feel that it doesn't work, that's fine, but that's also not their role.  That's the FDA's job, and they granted it accelerated approval.  For cancer drugs, the meds then get covered.  For AD, the [Medicare decision](https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/view/ncacal-decision-memo.aspx?proposed=N&ncaid=305&fromTracking=Y&ncacaldoctype=all&status=all&sortBy=status&bc=17) states it will not be covered outside a RCT.  

Several problems I can think of off the top of my head: 

1. This is a double standard unless cancer treatments are given the same non-coverage decision.  This increases the stigma of an already stigmatized disease.  
2. This puts serious headwinds into AD innovation and drug development.  Why spend a billion dollars on a trial in AD when facing TWO hurdles: both FDA and Medicare?  
3. This regulatory over-reach will cause chaos if applied to other divisions within government.  Imagine the CDC disapproving a vaccine that the FDA approves.  
4. This harms individual patients who can't get into trials for a variety of reasons: access, language barriers, patchy social support, exclusionary meds or diseases.  They are basically told to F-off."
"Phew, documentary filmmaking is running me ragged, but I got some time this week to write a couple of caregiver tales!

"Story I'd like to share. My grandpa has been slowly losing his memories as Alzheimer's takes its toll. He's recently been moved into the memory care unit of his nursing home, and myself and the rest of the family do what we can to visit and talk to him regularly. His ""conversational loops"" are becoming more and more frequent - asking questions multiple times in a single conversation that he's just asked. The thing is, Grandpa has been a wickedly funny man his whole life, and yesterday he commented on his memory loss and the loops himself. 

""I know my memory is slipping here, but the great news about that is that you can never run out of things to tell me. I'm incapable of being bored!"" 

I don't know who needs to hear this today, but growing older and losing one's memory is tragic and funny, all rolled up in a confusing yarn ball. 

Its ok to be sad. Its ok to laugh. Its ok to do both at the same time."

is it really one step down from full Alzheimer’s??? please don’t sugar coat the truth"

"My mom has been seeing a neurologist and a few months ago she took some kind of written test to see whether she has Alzheimer's or not. I'm not entirely sure what the test results were as my mom can be rather private about her health and down play things, but the doctor ordered a brain MRI for her. My mom sat me down yesterday and told me that the MRI does show Alzheimer's. She has not been back in to see the neurologist yet as the doctor is booked out pretty far, but my mom is on the wait list for an appointment so hopefully she gets in soon. I'm not sure how far along the Alzheimer's is or if they can tell that from the MRI, but my mom seems to think she only has 4-5 years left. She turns 57 this month. 

I have suspected for a few months now that she may have Alzheimer's as she has been having memory problems for a while (started when I was in high school) but have noticeably gotten worse recently. Also, Alzheimer's does run in her family. She did have a brain MRI done 2-3 years ago (I'm not sure if it was related to her memory issues or not) and they said that everything was normal; I'm not sure if maybe they missed something or if there really were no signs on the MRI yet. These past few months I have been worried about her. She forgets things we have recently spoken about, sometimes as close as ten minutes ago. She cannot remember if she's taken her medication or eaten. She forgets what she was doing. She doesn't clean things up around the house (i.e her dog pooped indoors and she just left it there). She forgets to bathe. However, I do think things are worse than that. She told me yesterday that she's scared to drive as she thinks she will kill herself or someone else because she forgets to do things such as check both ways before pulling out of somewhere; I didn't know her driving had been affected. I'm sure there's more that she hasn't told me. She wasn't even going to tell me the results of the MRI and was going to pretend that everything was normal but my dad convinced her otherwise. She has not told my younger brother yet.

I feel very lost. I'm about to be 24, so I know that I'm an adult, but I'm still finding my footing in the adult world and trying to figure out my place. I don't want to lose my mom. I know I have to step up and help her, though I have no doubt that she will try to leave me out of everything and handle it herself, as she doesn't want to feel like a burden though I have assured her that she is not one. I'm sure my dad will help her with things but, while they are still friends, they have been divorced for over a decade and he works long, demanding hours. She has a lot of stuff that needs to get in order (i.e multiple properties, investments, a trust, etc.) I wouldn't mind moving in with her to help her but she will not let me. She says that she will stay in her house for now, and hire someone to come during the days to help her. And when that no longer works/helps, she will move into a care home. 

I just wanted to confide in y'all and hopefully get some advice. My mom has told me not to tell any of my friends, which I understand and respect, but it means that I have no one outside my family to talk to about this. 

For those who have a parent that has been affected by Alzheimer's, what was it like? What should I prepare myself for? What is something that you wish you had been told? How do I help someone who feels bad about asking for help? Any and all advice is helpful."
"Personally I'd rather see the Alz association focus on getting long term care covered by Medicare, using the same force and energy they're using for this drug. Or they could do a better job of creating more local support groups. Or publishing more useful guides - it's interesting to me that many of the great guides or books like Teepa Snow never seem to be recommended by them. 

But , for what it's worth: [Here's the article - it should be outside of the paywall.](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/health/aduhelm-alzheimers-medicare-patients.html?unlocked_article_code=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEIPuomT1JKd6J17Vw1cRCfTTMQmqxCdw_PIxftm3iWka3DJDm4ciOQYCoyc-wDEabdjat82mj2fVt9MMboiXuc3y-JTPkdkUQTtupKYmZkDPz5zqZ62Wil--aPxao0C0G2gaHileqA4zaejvhmCPX_pCvDU0nwrcxJip5YxaV2rjnwXla6TF_oi0tN-3q11Ucx-TDsQdWLd6amTfhZ4MN-GahDb7hBnGL0KHGGOwqPPru4IYw5QClnZTX5g4Gla6NhUOdIfPquXPAd3MYOlwu1XUjo0Wd_vU54hRIHUlKFotarPrnGPy8m0zvY3EcZErZveh6WjF9LwWltv-HRX7hA&smid=url-share)"
"Tl;dr: mom's sick and hostile towards me. How best can I help her, and keep us both safe, until the doctor sees her?

My mom gets incredibly agitated when she's sick and with a fever. She pushes me and grabs my arms and I've no idea how to help her in these situations to calm her down or how best to handle myself when she has me losing my balance.

I do my best to remain calm and try to tell her reassuring words but it seems like it falls on deaf ears. I can't redirect her or distract her like the resources I've been find online say as she only gets more worked up and tells me things like I'm faking being nice to her. I've also tried being in a different room than she is so she can calm down on her own, but she meanders and eventually finds me again and gets worked up. I've tried looking around for other tips but it's not for anything as drastic as her pushing me.

She's sick again and we're working on getting an appointment set up with her pcp ASAP. I don't mind so much that she's taking her frustrations out on me, granted I do get shaken up by it, but I just want her to be feeling better. Generally she's been very sweet since she got diagnosed with early onset three years ago so the sudden mood changes are quick to be noticed and the four of us, my dad, two sisters, and myself, work as fast as we can to give her care."
"This question was posed in 2017 and 2018 in this sub, but now that a bit more time has passed, I'm wondering if more people have read the book and tried the recommendations? I'm especially confused about how ""extreme"" of a diet do we need to follow? They advocate for a pretty extreme exclusion of all animal products, and then say ""but you don't have to be so extreme for it to work!"" Has anyone here tried these recommendations? 

About me: my partner's father was recently diagnosed, so we're doing research to help. And since  damage starts occurring in the brain starting in 30's / 40's, my partner and I want to make sure we follow a brain healthy lifestyle, given his family history. 

Thank you!!!"
"I have a parent who tells me they've been diagnosed with Alzheimer's.  My relationship with the parent has been trying for my entire life due to their mental illness and, I believe, extreme narcissism.  

Has anyone faced a similar quandary?  The issue I have is that I'm on my own and they're in one of the poorest states of the country, so, I'd be looking at some pretty limited options in terms of work and life, to say nothing of the fact that they've never really willingly been there since I graduated in terms of safety net or helping me in my career.  The parent has a partner but they're in their 80s so..."
"My dad is 50. I’m his primary caregiver, he has early onset Alzheimer’s and every day I see him get worse. He can’t remember what he’s doing, can’t remember names, he’s at a point where he’s asking the same questions every few minutes (‘where’s your mom and sister?’ At the dentist, rinse and repeat). Every day when I wake up I feel this gaping hole in my chest, and by the time I go to bed at night it’s so bad I can barely breathe from it."
"My father (M, 70) has been confined to a wheelchair for about 15 years, and is reliant on help for even getting out of bed and going out and about. My mother (F, 61) is there to assist him, and we are lucky to be able to afford carers who tend to him. Recently, over the last few years, he has become noticably forgetful - from both small things, such as what day it is, what he had for lunch, or what time someone is supposed to come over, to other more things such as my brother's birthday, his cousin's name, whether people are dead or alive, etc.  Sometimes he will ask the same question 2 or 3 times during lunch or dinner, not realising that we have spoken about it already barely 5-10 minutes earlier. It has reached the stage where it is noticable even to people who don't live with him, but are meeting him socially.

The problem is - he is refusing to acknowledge these things happening. He either tries to laugh it off, claiming he was fooling us (he wasn't), or gets verbally combative, saying we're trying to trick him into thinking he's going mad. In one instance, even when on text message he mentioned something unfathomable, and we tried to show it to him as 'proof', asking him what he was trying to say, he just shuts up and shuts everyone else out. In his opinion, everything is as it should be.

But it is clearly not. Looking at early symptoms of alzheimer's, he is displaying a number of them: forgeting about recent conversations or events; forgeting the names of places and objects; asking questions repetitively; becoming less flexible and more hesitant to try new things.

But he refuses to see a doctor. We have tried speaking kindly, politely, begging, cajoling, pleading, being harsh, being reasonable - to no avail. He is convinced that we ""want to make him think he is mad"".

I really am not sure how I even proceed with this - I do not live in the same city as my parents, and I know that my mother is quite anxious about what the future holds. In her opinion, even if we just know what is happening, either way, at least it makes it easier to deal with - if a diagnosis can be confirmed, wouldn't it be better to start treating with medicines as early as possible? And if he is being this stubborn now, and he does indeed have Alzheimer's, what is it going to be like as it progressively gets worse? In the last month itself I have felt it get worse. 

Any advice is appreciated, both on how to approach my father and try to make him see a doctor, as well as how I can help my mother cope better with this. Thanks in advance!"
"Hey there, I've been following this sub for a while and I really appreciate that it exists.

My grandma - who means the whole world to me - was diagnosed with PCA/Benson's Syndrome (a rare, visual variant of Alzheimer's) two years ago. But her health has drastically deteriorated in the past month. She’s been experiencing visual hallucinations and environmental unfamiliarity.

In addition to this being hard for her, it’s been really hard for me to witness it all. I’m not her primary caregiver but I check up on her every other day and make sure to cheer her up. But sometimes the situation gets to me and I feel very defeated.

We live in Armenia where resources/awareness are very limited, so I’m hoping to engage directly with people who understand what I’m going through. Ideally, I want to find or create a virtual support group for people who have a family member with PCA or dementia in general.

Any words of encouragement or advice will be highly appreciated. Thank you in advance."
"“The Deep, Deep Snow” by Brian Freeman. A missing child and murder mystery fiction. About a small town middle aged sheriff with developing Alzheimer’s and his adopted deputy sheriff daughter. Great read and audiobook as well.  Thought some here might enjoy.

"My dad received his diagnosis during COVID. He had a virtual 2-session “interview” with a neuro-psychologist from the neurologist’s office. Granted, the MRI/CT did show some atrophy as well, but the actual diagnosis came after this virtual meeting. My dad is 70, isn’t the most social person, and isn’t used to virtual appointments. The whole thing didn’t go well. Nonetheless, we toughed through.

Her findings were that he presents with Alzheimer’s and General Anxiety. And that was that.

Just curious how else someone gets formally diagnosed."
Just got this from mum after doing sunday lunch.  Looking after her is so challenging at times but fuck me that's made me well up.  A rare moment of thinking I am doing something right
"Had to go on a walk because grandma refuses to go to bed. But insists she will be up for church at 9AM (she will not, then blame me for not waking her). Had to cancel a 3pm remote piano lesson and a midday home haircut this week because she wouldn’t get out of bed. Anyone got ideas for readjusting sleep patterns, or should I just cancel everything?"
"Any ideas appreciated! This month I (clinical researcher and prior MRI training) have been helping my friend desperately look for help for his clearly demented (74 year old) mother (he has no other family). 

It began over the summer when she had a dizzy episode, syncope, and bad lasting headache (undiagnosed TIA?). Since then, she’s been declining rapidly and now constantly perseverates and forgets after 5 min. PCP told her to follow up in a year! I told my friend to request scans/neuro tests, and then I read through all the reports: MRI shows significant atrophy, no tau, spinal tap shows cognitive recovery in following few hours and then return to dementia, neuropsych scores are severe in learning/memory/visual, and neurology eval says “Alzheimer’s”.  

BUT she was ultimately diagnosed as “mild neurological disorder” and won’t get meds until she becomes severe. My friend said he was told there’s nothing else they can do (which is disgusting of our health care system), so I’ve been compiling lists of top neurologists and clinical trials. What else can be done for her that I’m missing?? Thank you!!"
Need help please. My daughter is visiting for a long period with her dog. My mother keeps saying it’s ‘her’ dog and gets mad when my daughter takes her dog for a walk or feeds her. Mom keeping getting upset and telling everyone to leave ‘her’ dog along. Anyone else have this issue? Thanks so much.
"So, it’s a bit of a mess of a story, but my paternal grandfather was recently admitted to a facility because of Dementia, and his kidneys have begun to fail so he doesn’t have much time left. I am currently 22, and I haven’t seen or heard from him since around 2010 due to my dad making the decision to cut contact with him due to other mental health problems of his to keep both of us safe.

In his final moments, I do really want to be there for him; and my father has successfully been able to do so himself. So far, I’ve only seen him once, and seeing how far gone he was, being nearly nonverbal at this point, absolutely crushed me. Last I remembered him he was healthy and full of life still, and I’m still shocked and tearing up over it.

I have mental health problems myself, and they of course have gotten a lot worse since these developments. I feel selfish because I know how much being visited means to him right now, but all I do is freeze and lose the ability to speak when in the room with him, and then begin drinking heavily for the rest of the day after that.

I’m hoping anyone out there has any suggestions or insight on the best course of action. Should I try harder to suck it up and be there for him, both so he’s less alone, and so that I won’t feel like I didn’t do enough after he’s gone? Or maybe I should stay away since it’s so high stress on my end and for the people around me worrying about my addiction problems coming back, and I’ll just have the pleasant memories of all the things we used to do together when I was really little. I don’t know him very well anymore but from how I used to know him, I believe he would want me to only remember him as he was when I was little.

Thank you for reading, I know how awful dementia is, and I’ve handled it before, but its completely different when it’s family."
"One of my parents has been leaving salt and pepper shakers in the microwave a few times and (from what I can tell) not thinking it was them who did it. I only brought it up the first time but am afraid to again. My mom’s family has a strong history of dementia and her own mom (my grandma) now has it. It seems like all women on her side at some point get dementia. So I think it’s my mom who did this but I don’t know. Does anyone have advise on what to do? I need to be sensitive about it all. 

Also my mom recently picked up smoking weird again for pain so I’m wondering if perhaps she’s just high, but given her close family history that seems unlikely."
"Grandfather is on oxygen, doesn't leave the house at all, he doesn't want to deal with her, so he lets her drive and do whatever she wants, she crashed 2 hours away from us and we only found out that she crashed because someone helped her at the crash. (no one was hurt she crashed into a guardrail), we are furious at our Grandfather, and aunt because he acted like he cared at the time, but they got her a new car anyway, they don't listen to us they only listen to our aunt, what do we do at this point?"
"For those of you interested in the science of treating Alzheimer's, there was a multi-day conference over the past few days where a lot of companies laid out how they've been approaching these different neurodegenerative diseases.  [https://neurodegenerative-drug-development.com/](https://neurodegenerative-drug-development.com/)

So far, Biogen has a product that passed FDA trials for treatment of Alzheimer's called Aduhelm.  It was initially listed at $56,000 for a year's worth of medication which was a staggering amount of money.  This was a obviously a real downer because I was initially excited to hear Biogen get the nod from the FDA until I heard about the price.  If anyone has experience with it, I'd be interested to hear about it.  It was somewhat good to hear that there weren't many takers at that price so it sounds like they'll be reducing the price by 50%.

What's great though is that time is running out on them being the only treatment.  It turns out that there are actually a lot of other companies that want a chance to perform trials and get something to market which will likely reduce the price and the possibility that one of these companies will knock it out of the park and for a reasonable price.

"My dad (78)is in the hospital as he has quickly advancing Alzheimer’s and he wasn’t eating or drinking enough. It is no longer a medical emergency ( it was)but he’s still not getting around like he was or taking in as much food as he should.
Also he’s confused and Sun Downing.
My mom can’t take care of him.
Problem is a few months ago he was so healthy and active and still driving etc.
It was a huge quick decline😔.
They are recommending a home.
When I visit he constantly says he’s doing better and eating, doing his physical therapy etc etc.
He’s asking why he’s still there and wants to be discharged.
I haven’t told him yet but keep saying “ just a bit longer” and “ once you get your strength back”.
Or I play dumb like I don’t know either.
At some point very soon the staff will tell him.
How do I handle? Do I just hope he immediately forgets that conversation when it happens?

"Has anyone dealt with moderate to severe incontinence in a parent with Alzheimer's? We've taken my dad to the urologist and he's on 3 different medications to tackle the incontinence from every direction but it doesn't seem to be working as well as we hoped. I'm beginning to suspect that he's just zoning out so hard that he doesn't recognize the urge and then just goes, only ""waking up"" once he has the wet sensation.  

At this point, the incontinence issue is probably worse than the ALZ, since he is in fairly early stages of it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"
"Mom (91) passed last night. It came on quick. I live out of state and wasn’t able to see her the last three years. she had vascular dementia and had gotten to the stage where I couldn’t talk on the phone with her.

And what really sucks , is my husband has Alzheimer’s and I can’t travel with him. He isn’t ready for a home yet. But he is  delusional  at times . Last time I drove  long distance with him he tried to  find something to cut the seatbelt and he opened the car door while I was driving on the interstate.  So going to moms funeral is out of the question. I don’t dare fly with him . We would probably kicked off the plane. I would love to have some closure. I’m not really asking for advice or sympathy. Just putting it out there because AD sucks. So I’ve been  talking to mom and letting her know how much she has meant to me and all the things I wish I could have talked to her about the last 8 years.

"I found out that to ""manage"" someone's Social Security benefits/payments, a Power of Attorney is not enough - you need to be the individual's Representative Payee.

But I don't know what the SSA means by ""managing"" benefits.  Does anyone have any experience in needing to ""manage"" the benefits, so that becoming a Rep Payee makes sense?  I don't understand the need, and why a POA wouldn't be enough for most cases?

"My dad has become increasingly forgetful. He frequently forgets how to get home, or he forgets a conversation that we just had 15 minutes ago. Once I remind him, then he remembers. For example, he needs surgery on his carotid artery. I'm arranging it for him. I was on the phone with him talking about it. I hung up, called and spoke to his doctor to set a pre surgery appointment. I called my dad back, literally 10 minutes or less later. I said ok dad we have to meet with the surgeon before they will schedule your surgery. He said ""What surgery?"". 
I said, the one we just talked about. Your carotid is 80% blocked. We just talked about it. After a slight pause, he said oh oh ok yeah now I remember. Stuff like this happens a lot. Then suddenly he will be fine. 

How do you tell the difference between normal aging, vascular dementia and alzheimers?"
Does anyone know how much can be deducted from taxes that is spent on a memory care nursing home? I would think it would be qualified care since it's memory care as opposed to regular care and my parent definitely can't take care of themself anymore? Anyone know? Thanks!
"Hi everyone,

I know both being stubborn and having trouble making decisions are symptoms of Alzheimer's but I wanted to know why this is, if anyone knows. As time goes on my grandma has been getting increasingly disinterested (?) In choosing things, like we will ask what she wants to eat or what shampoo she prefers or if she needs stuff and she'll just say ""whatever"". She was always kind of easygoing about that kind of thing but it's like she's incapable of making a choice, like she literally has no preferences.... Is this the case or can she maybe not express her thoughts right...?

The other problem recently is stubbornness. Like I said above usually she just goes with whatever people are saying but there's some things she's chosen as like her hill to die on. For example she saw something in our neighbor's yard and asked my mom if it was in neighbor #1s yard or neighbor #2s yard. My mom said ""its in neighbor #1s yard"" and my grandma said things like, ""maybe YOU think so"", ""they might think that but it's in neighbor #2s yard"", ""hmmm I don't believe you"". Another example is taking showers. My mom will ask her to take a shower and recently she even yelled and said ""no I don't want to!"" My mom asked her why not and she eventually said it was difficult...to open the shower door. This takes maybe 10 seconds and while it might be hard it's only 10 seconds and then it's over? We are lucky to get her to take a shower once a week at this point.

Does anyone know anything about these? Why this shows up in Alzheimer's, how it's a part of it and what we can do to address it? Thanks for any suggestions."
"Hi guys,

I hope this post is fine. Basically today my mum has been diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disease, most likely alzheimers but we will find out more on a second round of tests in 3 months. It's heartbreaking for her because she has worked in the NHS in the UK on dementia wards for the last 15 or more years and has said it's her biggest fear to forget who her kids are.

I'm out drinking at the moment (just a disclaimer against typos) but I wanted to ask some advice. I am going to have some food and a chat with her shortly. Of course part of that will be emotional support but another part is practicality. I want to start a conversation about doing things to make her life easier because she is okay at the moment but things will be different in ten years time.

For example, she had recently talked about selling her house and mortgaging two to rent out to make passive income. I don't think this will be sustainable with everything in mind so I wanted to advise her to buy something outright that she can own and not have having over her if that makes sense? Similarly I would advise her to live close to myself and my brother so if she needs us we are close by. This isn't at all intended to be patronising or anything I'm honestly just trying to start a conversation around ways to make her life easier for the years that are ahead.

With all that preamble I wanted to ask if you had advice of things we could think about or start talking about in terms of preparing for the future to make sure she is comfortable, happy and independent for as long as she can be. I'm sorry if I am wrong or stupid with anything that I am saying; she is an amazing woman and my hero and has been a mum and a dad to me and I am just searching for anything I can that will make life better and give her less stress if that makes sense?"
"Firstly I want to apologise in case I use any terms or anything incorrectly, I don’t know a lot about Alzheimer’s so I’m going with what I’ve read.

I (18) have noticed my dad’s changing behaviour since around 2020. At the start of the pandemic specifically he became irritable and argumentative, we assumed it was just him being bored and angry about covid so he was taking it out by saying outrageous things and fighting with me and my siblings about them. Though me and my dad have a great relationship and have never fought about anything major, he always loves to be a contrarian so while it was annoying it wasn’t anything crazy out of the ordinary. 

In fairness, a lot of his behaviours sound like symptoms of dementia although he has never really gotten “worse”, is always just the same eg he gets very stressed about things like making dinner, giving lifts or going on trips. Recently he forgets things like what I’m doing, eg a couple days ago I had to travel to a different city and told him I needed a lift to the bus, and on the day of he forgot and I had to jog his memory quite a bit before he remembered.

Basically, I can’t tell if this is just him getting old or if it’s signs of early-onset Alzheimer’s. Or if the term “getting old” actually stems from a misunderstanding of what Alzheimer’s is? The thought of it affecting my dad petrifies me and it weighs on my mind a lot. I’m scared to “lose” my dad since I am so close to him and my siblings and I are still pretty young. I don’t want to bring it up with my younger siblings or my mother who works 40+ hrs and is also pretty much full time studying, as I don’t want to scare any of them especially if I’m just overthinking. Thank you for taking your time to read :)"
"My mom's neighbour is getting worse and her half sister and friend are doing next to nothing to help her, instead, just leaving it all to my 81 year old mom to worry about. The neighbour, who I'll refer to as F, does not look after herself, wears the same clothes for days, repeatedly goes to the bank to withdraw money, which she then secretes somewhere, forgets where it is, then goes back for more, and is often lost, dazed and confused in the street, a mile or so down the road.

Meanwhile, despite my mom relaying all this back to her half sister and friend, all they say is that, because F is adamant she doesn't want strangers (carers) in the house, their hands are tied. They also just say 'she has safeguarding in place'. Uh, ok.

So, it's all on my mom.

Aaaaargh."
"There are a lot of you on here that ask for resources to help you as a caregiver. I just wanted to plug that the Alzheimer’s Association has a free 24/7 helpline that can be translated into over 100 languages. The people answering the helpline calls are all social workers with a masters degree and can help with any question you have - ranging from “what is Alzheimer’s” all the way to you being in a crisis and need guidance on how to handle the situation. They can also help connect you to local support, like support groups, care consultants, education, etc. It’s an amazing resource that I highly recommend."
"I wanted to share in this group for others with questions, specific to the impact of covid on their LO.

If you use it and could describe why and how it helps you, that would also be much appreciated. What are the features you like and what features did you wish it had?

Thank you!"
"If you saw my last post, I was just exploring the possibility that it could happen, and now it’s official. I ended up having a talk the week before last with my mom’s (64 F) daycare about her general decline, they agree she has declined, and said they didn’t think it would be any trouble for her to be evaluated and qualify.

We had the hospice referral appointment with her PCP last Tuesday, and it hit me harder than I was anticipating. So much so, I ended up calling out sick for work the next day, and took a me day while mom was at daycare. The first hospice agency referred to us by the PCP was not a first choice of the woman who runs the support group that I’m in, and I trust her opinion. She sent me some recommendations, and we ended up signing with the second agency on her list. My mom really qualified without any second thought. They’ll provide a shower chair, a wheelchair and a hospital bed as soon as I have room for them to. I got her a rollator last week that has been helping at daycare. Other supplies will be provided as well. Of course I just did a pretty recent big restock of diapers and wipes…

I’m a little nervous that I’m not actually going to get the extra help and relief I need. A nurse will come out twice a week, and an aid can come out 5, but only for an hour to get her ready for the day. She can still go to daycare and be on hospice as long as she does not become completely hard to care for in their facility. She will be assigned a social worker who may be able to help me figure out more in home health services or short term respite care. I know I need to see how this even plays out to start. They can arrange a 5-7 day skilled nursing facility stay for respite otherwise. 

My mom doesn’t understand much anymore. What do I tell her about this? Do I keep it simple and just say they’re new friends coming to help, or do I tell her that she’s on hospice? I have a feeling it’s the former, but want to get some input. She’s also interestingly started to increase the frequency in which she says things like “I’m going to die,” “just leave me to die,” or even “I don’t want to die,” when nothing of that topic has even come up around her. Is this a sign she knows it could be happening, or is it just the insecurities of the disease? I mean, she’ll say it at the most random times sometimes. I could be putting her socks on or getting her out of bed, and she’d say it. 

I’ve been extra emotional this week. It’s so hard having so many emotions and not knowing what to do with them all. These past few weeks have been stressful as hell, and I’m starting to feel it in other ways too, which is scary. I probably need to have a physical scheduled as soon as possible."
I don’t know if ptsd is the right word I’m sorry if it’s not. In 2020 I lost my grandmother to Alzheimer’s and that was hard but just last month I lost my second grandmother to Alzheimer’s I was much closer with her and saw her decline first hand Since then I’ve been having panic attacks and freak out when my mom or other family members forget things. I’m laying in bed crying worried about having to go through that ever again does anyone else have this problem?
"My grandmother was diagnosed about 2 1/2 years ago, but we knew long before she finally agreed to see the neurologist. Since the diagnosis it just feels like everything has now progressed so rapidly. Just last week things were bad, but after going away for the weekend I returned to the news from my mother that she had gotten substantially worse in the few days I had been gone. 

A couple days ago my grandmother was barely capable of holding a conversation, but now she isn’t even able to string together a couple of words coherently. She can no longer walk on her own, though she was shaky before, to be fair. The scariest part is I’m sitting in the ER right now, and I can swear I hear the death rattle.  She has also been mumbling what sounds like my grandfather’s name. He has been dead for 15 years.

So far we have ruled out a stroke, and they don’t seem to think she has any sort of infection. I just can’t wrap my head around how quickly this is all happening. My own theory is that she has just given up and is ready to go. It is heartbreaking. 

I’m sorry there is no real point to my post. I just sort of needed an outlet for my feelings with some people that understand. There is so much more going on with it, but the last couple days have been hell."
My grandmother is fiercely independent but lately has not been able to function the way she used to. I'm in a worrisome debate if it's regular aging or signs of something more serious.
"My dad had a fall and his caregiver couldn’t pick him up. She called for a lift assist from the fire department and they wanted to take him in to the er just in case. When I got there, I asked them if they did a uti screen. The doctor said it’s not protocol. What? I knew a uti had to be the problem with his balance and increased confusion. (He wasn’t hurt from the fall at all. Fell on the carpet) I called his regular doctor and asked him to order a urine test. Of course it came back as a major bladder infection. He’s now on antibiotics. What would have happened if I hadn’t followed up and just let the infection rage?!? What could the hospital possible be thinking by not running such a simple test?!? Ugh, so frustrating!! So, insist on a urine test!"
"I’m 21 and my dad was diagnosed with alzheimer’s when i was 17/18. I lived with only him from ages 14-18 and feel I missed out on many of those years and potential experiences due to worrying about/caring for my father. He has narcissistic personality disorder so I was also dealing with that abuse at the time. I had decided not to go away to college because he would say things like “you’re the only reason i’m here” all the time and ask if i was going to stay with him. This obviously lead me to think if i left he would attempt suicide (which he has multiple times). 

I’m having a really hard time knowing what to do right now because i want to go back to a new school across the country next spring. I feel like i’ve made so many decisions based on everyone else’s happiness instead of my own, it feels like it’s been such a battle to survive most of my life, and i’ve finally been figuring things out for myself and feeling better. Some things are going on right now with his potential guardianship which has been extremely difficult and is taking me back to those years when i was 14-18, feeling so stuck and helpless. It makes me feel terrible because obviously i want to do everything i can for my father, but i need to think about me. I want to have him in my life and have a good relationship, i want to be able to know what’s going on with him and help to make decisions. I’ve realized i guess all i can do is give the court my and my fathers truth and at a certain point it’s out of my hands what they choose. It’s hard for these things not to absorb my whole life, it becomes all i think and worry about and i begin to feel so hopeless. 

I guess i’m wondering people’s thoughts on that, whether you’re my age or someone older. Am i being a bad person for wanting to go to school somewhere else? I’ve never left my childhood town long term, i’ve always wanted to. It’s so hard because i want to be true to myself and give myself these experiences, but i feel like i’m potentially betraying my father. Also if anyone has advice about experiencing a parent having alzheimer’s at a young age, or any life advice for someone in their 20s, i would greatly appreciate it. 

I think if my dad wasn’t sick he would be proud of me and excited for me. He always wanted to make sure i had the ability to do what i wanted with school and careers and express my talents. Thinking about that makes me smile but it hurts. 

- my parents are divorced, my mother greatly cares for my father and they have lunch once a week"
"Would like to hear about everyone's experiences good or bad with small residential assisted living or adult foster care based in a private house. 

Better or worst than long term facilities?

Do smaller homes have better staff to resident ratio?

If you have worked in or own one I would love to hear from you. Would love details about your facility and why it's better in your opinion.

Thanks in advance for any help or information."
"my father (68) has alzheimers and up until recently was being cared for exclusively by my grandmother (87).  over the past year, my father's condition has progressively gotten worse and he's started showing signs of anger, anxiety, and aggression.  anti-anxiety meds helped some, but it still got to a point where it was no longer safe for either of them to be in that house together and we made the decision to move him into memory care.  

unfortunately, the transition to memory care did not go well.  within 4 days of moving him in he had assaulted another resident, cornered and threatened a staff member, and refused to eat or take his medications, until the facility finally asked for him to be transferred to a hospital because they couldn't handle him.  

fast forward 6 weeks and in that time, he's been in 3 different hospitals and 2 different geriatric psychiatric facilities.  he was transferred back to memory care after the first psychiatric stay when they thought they had figured out his medication, but after 4 days he had assaulted another resident, was tearing pictures off the wall and throwing them, and had defecated on the floor of another resident's room.  

he's currently on his second geriatric psychiatric stay as they once again try to tweak his meds but i' m not hopeful.  we are one week into what is supposed to be a 1-2 week stay so he's going to be discharged soon.  the memory care facility he was originally in won't take him back and so far we haven't found any others that will take him.  i don't see how he could come home, even with in-home nursing help.  i just can't see how it would be safe for anyone.  

i've checked into some nursing homes but supposedly they are going to cost between 10-15k per month and that's not something we can afford.  i don't believe he will qualify for medicaid as he has a pension that would put him over the eligibility requirements.  

making all this worse is i live on the west coast and am having to manage all of this remotely.  this last 2 months have been so draining and we seem to be out of options.  he can't stay where he is and he can't come home, but there is no place that will take him.  what are we supposed to do?  

i'm posting in hopes that someone maybe has a solution or something i haven't thought of but it all seems so hopeless."
If the loss of sense of smell associated with Alzheimer’s would be studied towards restoring it first would memory return? What is the brain trying to stop by smothering with calcification? Does the pineal gland hold the answer? Peptides mimicking pineal gland secretions can elevate the symptoms of menopause- why not smell? Memory? Researchers that are thinking outside the box should be awarded the grants not labs researching the same research that’s been done in a loop since the beginning.
"My Grandma is far down the rabbit hole and diagnosed with Alzheimers or dementia.  She can keep up a short conversation just fine but her memory is shot.  We are moving her to a care home tomorrow but one of her recurring issues is obsessively counting money.  In her own home we just had her constantly pay us money, put it in a cabinet and then give it back to her each visit.

Now that she's going to a home with outside people, we don't want her having real money just in case.  The Bank of Canada has a fake money printout for children but she can tell the texture difference between our plastic bills and complains.  Does anyone know of a more realistic fake Canadian bill that matches the texture/look of the real bills?"
"I’m worried about my mother. She can’t remember the most basic things. She asks me the middle names of my children, names of family members, birthdays, etc. This seems like the early stages of Alzheimer’s. 

What is more alarming to me, though, is her obsession with things. I’m not sure if it’s related to Alzheimer’s and I want your opinions. 

For context, if it’s relevant, She’s on Klonopin and has been for 20 years. She doesn’t take it at the same time each day and often skips some to “save money”. 

She OBSESSES over stuff. For example, if an app she has resets and she loses her ability to login using Face ID, rather than a password, she will spend HOURS trying to fix it. 

When she asks me a question and I’m speaking with someone else, if I don’t immediately answer she will say “SAY” or “HELLO?”

She needs IMMEDIATE answers to text messages or she will send 8-10 at a time. 

She leaves hateful voicemails if I don’t answer the phone. 

She is rude to the waiter / waitress and doesn’t “read The room” or follow social cues. 

Are these all signs of Alzheimer’s or something else? Thank you for your help."

" My mom is well into the later stages of Alzheimer's and can no longer do  any self care. She is constantly anxious and fearful people she sees  will be bad and hurt her. Her restlessness and excitability is really  tiring, so we requested a medication to ease her anxiety. To my surprise  an anti-psychotic ( Aripiprazole ) was prescribed, and while she does  tell imaginary stories I do not see how this drug will address her fear  and anxiety. Anyone got any experience with the effect of this meds with  Alz patients, and any relevant advice? I thought something like  lorazepam would be prescribed."
"Anyone else experiencing their alzheimers loved one clicking when he/she can't remember how to say a sentence? 

Earlier dad wanted to ask me if it would bother me if he turned on the TV but I guess he couldn't find the words.

So he just walked over to the TV, pointed at it, and started making clicking noises at me like it was a recognized language. 

Reminded me of that 80's old movie with the coke bottle. It's pretty funny in retrospect."
"Okay, so my dad was diagnosed with dementia a few years ago. Because I gave birth to a child and didn't live super close to my parents I was never able to attend many of his doctor appointments. Now I have moved closer and my child is older, so I'm paying closer attention to his health and helping out my mom. One thing that was never made clear to me is what type of dementia he had. So at his last appointment with his neurologist, I asked her what type of dementia is he diagnosed with. And she said, based on his scans it's either Alzheimer's or vascular dementia. She explained that it's hard to tell and that's there's a lot of overlap. So is that a thing? I guess I was looking for something definitive. Not: maybe this, maybe that. I guess from her perspective it's all under the same umbrella, but from my prospective I'm just confused."
"Cleaning grandmas bedroom today. I wanted to change her bed clothes. She didn’t get up through the vacuuming round her bed. When they did arise at 4PM, I was told I should’ve been louder :)"
My dad has been really struggling with being my moms primary caregiver. He has a nurse that comes and financial stability and family in the area but I think he’s not really equipped emotionally for this. He never had to do much of the child raising and I can tell he’s cracking but am not sure how to help him emotionally. Has anyone had success finding a counselor for their parent? He looked for support groups once and then never followed up so I think I’ll need to find someone and give him the push. Why kind of counselor has training in this kind of thing. Would it be a grief counselor or family counselor? Any advice is appreciated
"Do any of you in the pre-diagnosis stage worry that getting a diagnosis will cause your loved one to deteriorate faster? That’s what I’m struggling with. My family and I can tell something is wrong with my dad (and has been for sometime) but he’s already so sad I worry he will give up all hope if he finds out for sure something is wrong. We’ve already had a neuropsych consult and they want him to come in for further testing. I am pushing to get it done but the more adamant I am about it, the more I wonder if it’s even the right choice. I have been insistent that we need to know what we’re dealing with but honestly I don’t know what to think anymore. Thanks in advance for any advice."
"sending love to fellow caregivers today <3

sharing this Self-Care for Caregivers event tomorrow if you need a mid-week boost: [https://www.facebook.com/events/1332091130642378](https://www.facebook.com/events/1332091130642378)"
" 

In December, my father P (M 78) who has Stage 6 Alzheimers got engaged to be married to his girlfriend of 18 months (F 72) N, who had managed to isolate P from his friends and family and gain control over his finances. 

In early January, we learned that P & N were meeting P’s longtime accountant and another lawyer to rewrite his will to remove his children and grandchild and give everything he had to N. P had the original will written in 2019 shortly after receiving his diagnosis.

Although P had failed a capacity test in December and could no longer legally sign his new will or sign his Trust Fund over to her, he could still get married as the bar is very, very low. Despite his severe dementia, P still had many lucid moments and could seem totally fine for short periods.  

If P signed a marriage certificate, N would have legal control over his health decisions. It would also give her the cover she needed to drain away his financial resources in secrecy, a process she began even before the big day by redirecting the pension payments he received into a bank account she controlled. 

All N had to do is move him somewhere away from his meddling kids and take away his phone and he would be effectively incommunicado. We would never see him again and we wouldn’t even know when he died. 

Something had to be done. We started by emailing P’s large group of friends and telling them about N and what she was doing to P. They all responded with support for us and with love and concern for their friend. Scammers preying on the elderly in their community was nothing new to them. We also reached out to P’s accountant and found that he was greatly suspicious of N but stayed silent out of respect to his friend.

P’s friends and fam began to plan an intervention over Zoom. The idea was that his younger son J (M 51) &  daughter in law S (F 52) would go over to P's house, surprise P with a meeting with all of his friends who would then confront him about their concerns about N and her diabolical plan. 

After that, J would show P the evidence that they had learned from the background check that N was a Lonely Hearts romance scammer who had already been convicted of fraud years ago and had lied to him about her own financial situation, telling him she was “loaded” and did not need his money, despite having a huge tax lien on her house. 

They would also show P a [checklist ](https://maggiesresource.com/are-you-in-an-abusive-relationship-c110.php)of abusive behaviors to try to get him to see how terribly she was treating him. Once he was convinced, they would call the locksmith to have the locks changed, help him pack up his stuff, and drive off to a prearranged Airbnb out of state. 

Our worst fear was that N would somehow get wind of the plan and whisk him away for a quickie marriage. We also worried she may become physically abusive if he resisted her. Early on we had learned that N had quite a temper which worsened when she drank. What would she do if she learned her Golden Goose was going to break their engagement?

Timing was everything here. Thankfully, P's caregivers gave us a heads up that N was out of town that weekend and that she would not see him until she returned on Tuesday. J set the intervention for Monday.

When the day finally came, J arrived at P’s house to find that P had been primed by N to tell him that he no longer wanted his younger son in his life as he was interfering with his relationship with N. 

During the zoom meeting, P seemed unmoved, his face emotionless. His friends warned him N had proven to all involved that she was up to no good and implored him to break the engagement.  He said he had no plans to marry N (N wanted this kept secret!) but he was an adult and knew what he was doing. 

The zoom meeting ended in sadness and frustration.  It didn't seem like we had gotten through to him at all. 

About an hour later I received a text from my sister-in-law reading: on our way to Arizona with P!!

Apparently, P thought that N was a “wicked woman” (his words) but that he did not know how to break up with her. It would be a difficult situation for any person to realize they wanted to break up with a partner and take the necessary actions to do this, but for someone with dementia they may well be helpless. You can’t drive away, you can’t explain your feelings to people, you can’t call for help, you cannot defend yourself if the other person refuses to let you go. And the caregivers he lived with (as wonderful as they are) could not interfere. 

If J hadn’t persisted despite the emotional agony of having his Dad cut him off, this woman would have ruined him and his family.

The other thing we found was that P’s dementia was much much worse than we had known or suspected, despite the increasingly dire caregiver reports. Since our contact with him was increasingly limited to short visits and conversations after N arrived on the scene, we had not been able to grasp the severe decline in his memory and communication skills. N took advantage of P’s confusion over his own condition to convince him that he only had MCI (Moderate cognitive impairment - his initial diagnosis), which was vital in constructing a reality where she was simply marrying a man she loved and who loved her, instead of financially abusing someone dying of a neurodegenerative disorder.  

On the drive to the airbnb, J reported P had become incoherent after nightfall and kept asking them who they were and where they were going. They learned they needed to keep him out of the kitchen as he would wander around and touch all the knives and even play with the oven burners. It became clear they needed to get him into a care facility as soon as possible before P could endanger himself. Thankfully, even at his worst behavior, he continued to be a very sweet and loving person towards J & S. 

It would take about a month to get P examined by his doc and admitted into care. 

Until then, they had to keep a very active senior safe and happy in a relatively small space, arrange for a high quality yet affordable memory care, reconstruct P’s finances after N put them under her control and then trashed them, clean out P’s condo and arrange for sale, and do a FT WFH job.

Then the calls started. First, a man claiming to be a local police officer called asking if P was with J and could they speak to him? When asked his badge number he mumbled something and then hung up. 

P’s caregiver called: I know you told me not to tell N anything but she was so sad about P I had to tell her you were in AZ! 

J: How could we trust you with P? You are fired. 

Another call from LE in P’s county, this time the real thing. It seems that N reported P as a missing and endangered person, leading to them calling J and asking to speak to P. They asked if P was there under his own free will or being abused in any way.  P: Yes and no. Officer seemed satisfied. 

Then 3 days later another call from law enforcement, this time from J’s home county. The sheriffs were standing in front of J's door (they not home) and wanted entrance and to speak with P to verify his condition. This time J refused to allow them to speak to P, as he had already been checked on by LE - here is her badge number. They leave and don’t return. 

These LE calls were only the beginning of N’s harassment, and we now understand she won’t ever stop trying to get to her ex-fiance. But P is in a beautiful safe place now and seems very happy. He already has a bunch of new friends because he is still charming and handsome as ever. 

I hope this story helps anyone who cares for  a person who may be vulnerable to this kind of vile predation. We appreciate the supportive comments."
"My dad became unwell yesterday - very high temp, extremely confused, unresponsive at times, unable to walk.  I called the GP who triaged over the phone and advised we call an ambulance as dad was deteriorating and needed hospital care. 

After 6 hours we called again and were told it would be several more hours. My parents live in a flat and we couldn't get dad up from the sofa, let alone down two flights of stairs in order to take him in ourselves. 

This morning I called the GP back in tears. He came to do a home visit and has decided that dad is ok to stay home under the care of the community team as his condition is improving. 

I'm relieved that dad seems to be better today but absolutely appalled. I work in the NHS but I've lost all faith that there's any support."
"Yesterday was my Mom's 64th birthday, and the first that she had absolutely no understanding of or context for. This milestone, although obviously inevitable, has probably been the most difficult yet.

In past posts and comments here I've used some pretty foul language to try to express my feelings about this disease, but right now even all those words and phrases seem so inadequate -- and probably worst yet, futile.  I hate this. Although I was never particularly close with my Mom, my heart breaks for my Dad -- her primary caretaker -- who must endure this trajedy day in and day out, as he helplessly watches the mind of his wife of 38 years completely disintegrate. 

I'm sorry, I have nothing constructive to add to the dialogue right now.  I just needed a cathartic vent."
"Hi everyone! I hope you’re all doing well. We are HelpMate, a company run by PhD and Master's students with a mission to help caregivers and people living with dementia navigate their post-diagnosis journey.

**What are we doing?**  
Currently we are gathering expressions of interest for our free pilot cohort-based program which aims to educate and upskill caregivers. The program will run for 4-weeks, comprising of a live session each week led by a specialist in the dementia space (GP, occupational therapist, nutritionist, nurse consultant, neuropsychologist) as well as hearing stories from people living with dementia and their caregivers. We are currently looking to start this inaugural cohort in late April/early May.

**Are you interested?**  
If you are a caregiver and are interested in being part of a tight-knit community of caregivers and want to upskill yourself, please fill in the form below and we will be in touch!

[https://airtable.com/shrPPWzu0ODUh7GBx](https://airtable.com/shrPPWzu0ODUh7GBx)

**Why us?**  
Our team has been navigating this space for months. We have spoken to over 50 different people including caregivers, people living with dementia, loved ones, clinicians, and academics and one thing was very clear to the team. We believe the dementia space lacks a medium for many new and existing families to learn about how to adapt to their new situation. It was also evident that for many families trying to find specific information for their situation, this can also be very difficult as dementia is different for every single person and family.

We hope to offer caregivers and their loved ones access to necessary information and surround them with a community of people who share their journey, with our cohort-based program.

"My grandmother has been living alone for about 2 years and at that time more things have had happened that wad worrying as such.

AShe has gone away for 2 times already in which my father just bought an gps tracker for her so that she wont go again. Her hand got injured and got bloated because she fell down the stairs.

After this my dad was much more worried about my grandma, and made her stay here by lying to my grandma that she needs to wait for my uncle.

In the first few weeks it was fine and my uncle was able to come to our home again and again, but then in the fourth week or so my uncle left to go to america since he lives there nowadays. 

This became a problem for her to get distracted and to make her not leave our house, and the weeks were pretty sufferable since we always needed to distract her so that she can't go to her home.

This time it was different, it was today where she went out of our house and tried to go to her home. Surprisingly she was near the place and she could've actually gone home. 

Right now my grandma is arguing with my dad on trying to go home, she just wants to go home and me and my mom are very stressed about this situation because it is very irritating and since my mom is a baker, she always gets in the home. And my dad has had enough and had a mental breakdown about my grandma and surprisingly my grandma was fine about it and said sorry afterwards.

What do i do in this situation? I desperately need help because it is very stressing for my entire family and my mom wants to leave and rent an apartment somewhere so that she can work in a nice enviroment.

Please help."
My grandma has Alzheimer’s and she can barely see/hear so she “entertains herself” by scratching and fidgeting with her nails. Does anyone know of a fidget toy or ring or something that would be good for her? I googled fidget toys for adults but I’m wondering if anyone has experience with this and can recommend a product the person liked to use.
"My friend is in memory care. I don't even know why because I'm not family but was told by a staff member that it was alcohol that caused this, but I think it was inappropriate of her to say so. It seems more parkinsonian in that he can barely use his frame anymore and his foot hurts constantly even though there seems to be nothing wrong with it (now) He badly injured his foot about 7 years ago but it looks fine and wouldn't prevent ambulation. His voice comes out in short bursts. He has no memory of the past and I've met people with alcoholic dementia that certainly do up to a certain point. They would also constantly confabulate or retell the same story. His only story is ""going to get a car today"". 

The last time I visited him before omicron lockdown I was sitting at the dining room table with him and on two occasions his face suddenly contorted into a look of astonishment (while looking at me). Both times his face went back to normal as soon as I started talking again. Any thoughts would be well appreciated. 

PS I ran into him while visiting my MIL about 2 years ago. He just happened to be a resident in the same facility, so I visit both."
"It's been a rough couple of weeks with my mom (64 F). The week before last, she was stuck at home with me because she developed a skin infection on her butt from her nighttime fecal incontinence, and couldn't go to daycare because they wouldn't administer the medication she needed to treat it. On Thursday this past week, daycare called me to let me know that my mom was having a really difficult time and complaining of pain in her legs, crying more than usual and just not herself. ""Okay,"" I thought, I'll take her to urgent care when I pick her up. Well, when I picked her up that day, they came out with three bags of clothes saying that she peed through her clothes I sent her in, her spare clothes, and walked out wearing pants that were loaners. It was suggested they thought maybe she had a UTI and that might be why she wasn't seeming like herself. The problem there was, she had not been exhibiting any UTI symptoms at home. Urgent care ended up not being an option because they all need appointments, and the only clinic that takes walk ins is closed now for the foreseeable future after an electrical fire that happened the week we were there for her skin infection. So the only option was the ER.

They got her triaged and we waited in the waiting room for a couple of hours before she started sundowning and just would not stop crying over every little thing. The sundowning actually ended up saving us, because we were able to get her into a bed faster, and who knows how long we would have continued to wait if I didn't bring it up.

So we get her into the room, they cath her and say she has the cleanest sample they've seen in awhile, no UTI. No real explanation for her pain and exacerbated cognitive state. The pain is so difficult to help her with, because in the previous occasions I've had her seen for pain, it's really hard to pinpoint what's real and what's phantom, and then usually she's fine, but something does seem to be off. She screams as if I'm going to kill her when I try to swing her legs out to get her out of bed, or when I need to try and get her to sit up straight in bed, rather than hunched over to her right, or straining her neck, which will actually end up hurting her.

Anyway, the ER doctor was really sweet and talking to me about life with her as it is now, and suggested looking into getting a hospice referral from her PCP. Hospice had been suggested to me by a family friend, and that my mom doesn't actually have to be knocking on death's door, that we may be able to get the extra help just for comfort care. After the past two weeks, I feel like maybe these smaller conditions have just progressed her Alzheimer's further, and it might just be the disease pushing her into a new stage (she's already progressed so fast this past year, and has been settled in moderate to severe over mild since after she moved in with me last February).

I kept mom home with me on Friday just because we were up way later than she's used to while at the ER for hours, and I wanted to make sure she got some rest. Well, Friday morning after she woke up, she was really unsteady and unbalanced when trying to get her into the bathroom to change her, and she fell. I could not get her up. I could not get her to understand how I needed her to help me help her get up. She was too preoccupied with the fuzz on the carpet or with her shirt. When she was a caregiver for a man with Alzheimer's before she developed her own symptoms, the man she cared for fell all the time (not hard falls, usually he'd slip out of his recliner), and my mom could never get him up. The man's daughter told my mom she just had to call 911 each time he fell to have EMS come pick him back up. It got to the point that EMS told my mom that if she called one more time, she'd be reported for elder abuse and negligence. So imagine my immense dilemma when trying to decide if I needed to do the same. I did though, the guys who came were all great, and they were in and out in less than 10 minutes. But now I completely understand why my mom needed the extra help with the man she cared for.

I'm thinking hospice might definitely be something I want to look into, but I was hoping to get any perspective from those of you who may have had similar experiences with hospice. Any input, general information I might not know, suggestions or advice you may be able to offer would be really helpful! I'm also looking now into either a rollator or a wheelchair for her at this point, because the last thing I need is her falling at home, but also when we're not at home or she's at daycare. That's also kind of difficult to reconcile, because if she is at the point where she's not going to walk anymore, it's just going to make caring for her until I can get her into memory care, 10x more difficult, and it means that she is becoming further and further from who she used to be."
"My grandmother is in her final stage of Alzheimer’s disease. She hardly moves and is bedridden. Her nurse sent a picture of her legs with mottling creeping up from her feet - said she would probably be with us for another two days.

My mom, my husband, and I went to go see her. My mom sees her frequently, but this is the first time I’ve seen her since January. She’s extremely frail, almost corpse-like.

After my husband and I got home, my mom calls saying she checked grandma’s legs and the colors has gone away. Has anyone experienced this with their loved one?"
"My dad has been in assisted living for a short while now, and that is going great. 

The problem is everything else that remains.

My sister and I need to prepare his house and its contents for auction/sale. Of course, there are some things we both want in the house, and there are the feelings I have to wrangle with of “Should I keep this or not?” It’s like dealing with someone’s house after they have died. 

I’m overwhelmed. I just want to get this task over with and move on, but it feels like there’s so much to do. I live three hours away and have my own family, so it feels like an impossible task. 

I suppose I’m just venting. I truly hate all of this."
"My great grandmother, recently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, was very fond of her two dogs, a pug and a corgi, however she couldn’t take care of them after the dead of my great grandfather, and has been living alone ever since. I was looking for robotic pets she doesn’t need to take care of, and saw two nice brands. Perfect petzzz and joy for all. Anyone know if there’s some hybrid with realistic breathing and sleeeping and the same functions as joy for that’s a pug or a corgi? Set aside 180 pounds for this, hoping I can give the dog to her before her birthday of April 28."
"How do you handle this? My dad (alz, mid-way-ish through disease process) has diseased toenails that are difficult to manage. Should I have a medical professional assist in trimming every 2 weeks? It’s painful for him, but I’m always worried about possible infection. 

Additionally, best shoes for alz. He has these no-tie sketchers but they’re getting harder for him to push on. Maybe crocs? 

Edit: thank you everyone!!"
"I’ve gone through early-onset with family for decades. First my mom when I was pretty young 12/13 until 31) and now my sister from who knows when - past 20 years. My sister is now late stage. I don’t know how much longer she will hang in. I hate this. I hate it for them, and I hate it for me. Heartbreak my whole life. Trying to be positive, but some days are so bad."
My moms pretty bad off and believes that my dad who has heart issues ran off to die because he didn’t want her to find him. She also thinks the man taking care of her is her best friend MJ. My dad has never left her side and I know it’s killing inside. Is there anything we can do to help her kinda snap out of it or is it all just down hill from here?
looking for any good blogs / podcasts to follow on dementia. new diagnosis in my family want to build my community
"My mom has been diagnosed and lived with alzheimer for 4 years. Her condition now is really bad and she doesnt have any common sense and manner at all, she can hardly be concious at things and even if I call her mutiple times she wont reply. But lately my brothers turned some sort of buddhism audio for her at night while she slept, I'm an atheist so I dont care about much but then he had to stop because my dad didn't want to involve in religious stuffs (yeah that's audio was kinda spooky for real). After  a few days, one night, it was like 1 am or something, I heard she was mumbling, normally when my mom sleeps, she has somniloquy so i just think that she is sleep talking but then I came closer I realised that she woke up and looked just like the first stage of alzheimer. She remembered me, remembered normal manners, remembered how to calculate and I asked her to sign her name-which she normally can't do, she did, of course sometimes she still mistook things but I surprised that she was concious and looked normal. But when she be able to read the clock and tell the time, she had to sleep and I was kinda afraid that if she sleep, things would be back to normal, and they sure were. But it was still strange how she turned from a person with barely any memories to one who acted normally and I was shocked. Have anyone met this situation before??????"
"This last year my father's mental condition has been deteriorating. He's in his early fifties and so young to be dealing with this. This week my father drove into another town, and was lost and confused as to why he was there. He was really scared. It's the first time something quite like this has happened. It's been really difficult watching such a capable person lose pieces of himself this way. 

I don't know what to expect the process to look like, how to comfort him, and how to handle my own emotions during this. It's scary and feels like too much. Those who've been in my place for longer, how do you cope during the progression?"
"First I wanted to say this subreddit has been very supportive getting to hear everyone's stories/tips. I know many caregivers or loved ones can feel alone in the experience but this place helps. 

My wife and I are finally moving forward this year to move my mother in law into a facility. Wife was adopted and hence why we are both pretty young (31) caretakers. MIL is turning 80 this Saturday and was diagnosed about 6 years ago. We have been the primary caretakers of her and have stayed with her this whole time. There have been so many ups and downs, but to see this amazing strong woman slowly degrade has been heartbreaking. She was a professional violinist who played for the Chicago Symphony/Chicago lyric opera. She is remarkably physically healthy for an 80 year. We have mentioned the change to her about moving to a assisted living place/memory care before. We described it as a place where she can make friends and do fun activities. She was always hostile towards the idea however and was adamant she would rather go live with family in Europe than go. There is no family in Europe that can take care of her but its one of those ideas that stuck with her. We are really all she has left. We have had visiting angels come and stay with her for a few hours during the day when me and my wife are working. That situation worked fine but was always temporary solution. We feel guilty moving forward with this decision but my wife and I would like to start a family of our own. Being a caretaker and raising a child would be immensely stressful. We have toured a great new place about 8 mins from us which has multiple levels of memory care offered. We have also have gotten an elder care attorney to try and maximize her money for her care. She has been in the middle stages for the last few years and is still able to do a lot of things on her own as long as long as its confined to her normal daily routine. We are not sure when this year it will happen but wanted to see how peoples experience it was moving your loved ones into a place. Any tips to make it easier or to prepare? I know it will be one of the hardest things we do."
"Hi,  my grandmother (with Alzheimer's) has lost her sense of location and she tends to wander around (sometimes even outside the house to unexpected places). I'm worried that she might end up on the road (which is potentially dangerous) and sometimes it takes a few hours to find her. Since she doesn't know how to use a phone, is there some sort of technology that would help me pinpoint her location? Ideally, I'd buy something that can be worn all the time (doesn't need to be removed or charged) as her whereabouts can be during unexpected hours."
"I talked to my dad. He moved into the assisted living facility last week, and he seems to be adjusting well. 

I asked him if he was eating well. He said, “Yes, and you don’t even have to pay for the food here.”

I told him he was taken care of, and then I had a good chuckle."
"I know that Alzheimer’s changes the way food tastes and can often make people forget to eat, but I’m at wit’s end with how to counter it.

For context: my mom is still relatively early stage (highly functional around her home, feeds and waters her cats like clockwork, keeps everything immaculate), but she’s extremely frail and losing rapidly. She’s 5’4” and has dropped from 120lbs in 2020 to 104lbs today — from 110 to 104 in just the last two months.

All her life, she’s been beautiful and slim, so eating very little is engrained in her identity and she’s convinced she’ll “get fat” if she eats more. She also complains that she “looks pregnant” and feels full when she eats even the smallest amount. To make matters worse, she hates the taste of EVERYTHING except biscuits, Kraft cheese, potato chips, potato salad, and sweet protein bars — all of which she eats very little of because she remembers that those foods are unhealthy.

Offer meat? She refuses, saying she hates the taste no matter how it’s cooked (even chicken fingers). Fish? She argues vehemently that she’s allergic (she used to love salmon but there’s no convincing her). Protein drinks? She finds them disgusting, saying they taste like “milk.” She no longer likes the taste of nuts. She doesn’t like beans or legumes. She’ll agree to eat vegetables and salads, but not enough to gain weight (and trust, they’re cooked in olive oil to get as much healthy fat as we can). As someone who tracks her own macros religiously (powerlifter), I’ve measured what mom eats and it fluctuates between a 400-800 calories/day.

On top of disliking nearly every food group, she frequently cites not feeling hungry. And yes, we’ve thoroughly investigated with the doctor to make sure there’s nothing else causing this (MRI, gastric emptying test, extensive bloodwork). He believes it’s because her abdomen is compressed due to the kyphosis (hunched over posture) caused by osteoporosis, driving her to feel full quickly and experience discomfort when eating more. And yes, we’ve tried getting her to eat small meals throughout the day, but that doesn’t make a difference. If anything, she eats less, thinking she’s had a bunch of meals already and thinking we’re “trying to make (her) fat.”

She’s already anemic due to B12 AND iron deficiency (we’re supplementing), but I’m so afraid that she’ll die of malnutrition long before the Alzheimer’s takes her.

Any advice is welcome. At this point, I’m ready to shove an appetite stimulant down her throat."

"I had a horrible revelation today that I’d not thought of before. 
(I’ve  lived with her 24/7 for 5 years. So no “I see them once a week and understand” nonsense replies).
I’m going to have to send her to a home when she becomes even worse. Or I’m going to have to try and wake her up one morning and find she’s dead. Either way I’ve failed."
"My (26m) dad is about 7 years into early onset Alzheimer’s. I recently put everything on hold and moved in with my mom and dad after finishing my undergrad degree to help out on a more permanent basis. We spend every moment of his waking life with him, just trying to keep him happy and safe and healthy. He needs help with nearly everything, even going to the bathroom. We are in the process for care home placement but my mom is careful because she had a very bad experience with care home mistreatment with her own mother.

My dad’s mood changes rapidly and sometimes he becomes violent. It is usually triggered by us reminding him to take off his boots or jacket, or anything else that threatens his autonomy. In this state he will punch the walls, throw things, and get in me and my mom’s face with a very crazed, unpredictable, frankly *feral* expression and body language. Today, about an hour ago, was the second time I had to get physical in order to protect my mom. I couldn’t be sure whether he wasn’t going to punch her in the face. I am terrified of head trauma because we think my dad’s condition is related to head trauma.

This time, he wouldn’t calm down. I kept my body between my mom and him. I would put my arms up to protect myself when he would raise his own fists. But he wouldn’t back down and he was breaking things. We called 911 (for the first time) expecting there to be an option for a mental health police dispatch, which (we found out too late) exists just outside our area, but not in our own municipality (Delta, BC, Canada). However, regular officers came. They tried to calm him down for a short time but when he continued to be violent they handcuffed him and took him away.

We are expecting a call back after he’s taken to the hospital. My mom is feeling very guilty and thinks he was mistreated by the officers and that he will be misunderstood at the hospital. I agree with the idea that the police did not deal with it in the most effective way, and that the hospital might also be a bad idea, but I’m not sure whether to feel guilty.

However, I want to believe we did the right thing given our options. I don’t think I can physically prevent myself from quickly intervening physically with anyone who raises a hand against my mom. In fact I think I would regret it for the rest of my life if my mom got seriously hurt when I could have prevented it.

thanks for reading. any comments welcome"
"We just moved my Dad to assisted living this week , on Monday, and today is the first day i haven't cried about it so far.   All of the hardships and emotions aside, I'm trying to find ways to make his life there easier.   I did order one of those TV remotes that has 4 buttons on it to make it simpler, but I was wondering if anyone has any ideas for having full access of the TV remotely.

&#x200B;

I read someone set up a raspberry pi and IR emitter or some other crazy setup, but I'm not really at the point of pursuing that if there's any other option.  I'd like to be able to turn the TV on and off and access all TV menus (changing input) as well as opening youtube and bringing up videos for him remotely.  Is there ANYthing even close to something like that in existence?  He does not follow instructions very well so 'push the volume button' would be a struggle.    Complicating things is the multiple remotes, so if i DO hook up a amazon fire stick, he's not going to know how to use the remote.  

&#x200B;

Just curious what strategies others might have had for helping a loved one remotely with a TV.   He's definitely getting some more activities this week than he was at home, so it's not like i'm encouraging him to just sit in front of the TV for 12 hours,  but if he wants to watch the news or a sporting event or some educational videos, I'd like to be able to make that happen for him"
"We are moving MIL into a facility local to us after all. We toured a few places back in December, but after visiting with her and the rest of my spouses family (small family- his mom, his uncle, and his grandmother) we decided to move both MIL and GMIL into an assisted living facility in their state. MIL and GMIL live together, and it is not safe for them...at all.  I'm not entirely sure what happened, but we get a call this week saying that GMIL understands our reasonings for moving MIL to our area and that it needs to happen quickly. GMIL is getting scared of MIL's behaviors and their memory doctor said she needs 24 hour care immediately.  


We made the call yesterday afternoon to our first choice facility that is specifically for Alzheimer's patients. Looks like this is happening soon. Very soon. Like within a week or so.   


It's going to be hard. I know once we bring her down here and out of her familiar space things are likely to deteriorate quickly. I remember going through that with my grandfather. But I am so devastated knowing that deep down, GMIL knows this will very likely be the last time she sees her daughter. GMIL is in her 90's and can't travel easily. We are definitely going to have to get uncle up to date on technology so we can video chat."
"My wife and I have been married for over 45 years.  The last couple of years I have seen a decline in her memory/cognitive abilities.  Our family primary care physician noticed this too.  A year or so back he tried to refer her for testing but she was in denial and would not go.
But lately, in the last few weeks, there has been a significant change.  She has begun speaking to me about myself in the third person.  She is confused about who I am.  She told me that she wished that I had known her father (I was with him the night he died).  When I pointed this out to her she became afraid and we had a good conversation.  We agreed to go for testing, which we did a few days ago.  Spent 5 hours with a neuropsychologist, who gave a tentative diagnosis of mild dementia.  But she also wants to order a brain scan before she adds Alzheimer’s or some vascular issue in the brain to her diagnosis.  So we are waiting on the scan.  She is afraid.  I am wondering if this rather sudden change in her memory and cognition may be indicative of a rapidly developing case of dementia/Alzheimer’s.  Hopefully we will learn more after the scan. Any info or wisdom appreciated!"
"Hello :)  
My mother has been showing cognitive decline for about 5 years now.   They mostly manifest as short-term memory problems, loss of concentration.    However lately, she has been showing signs of deeper agitation.   She calls her sons up and says she want to divorce her husband, that he's not a warm man, etc.   This is her sweetheart of 40 years.   Her caregiver in many ways.   She also has moved out of their shared bedroom.   


The pandemic (and my divorce) has caused her circle to shrink.   She has been with her husband in their small bubble.   He is going deaf and is vain about getting a hearing aid.   I've been imploring him to get one.   My mom is so intuitive and sensitive.   When she calls him cold and too focused (only in the last few weeks), i have to connect that with his lack of hearing / awareness.    


Anyway, I set up and appointment with her neurologist today.   The purpose is to get her into see a neuropsychiatrist and this is the first step.   Perhaps there is some medication that she can take to help her depression (i know the dangers of treating dementia patients for depression).  


The problem is, that we've been mostly shielding her from our thoughts about her 'delusions'.  She does know she has a bit of memory problems...but that's it.   She always resists the medications (namenda) and visits to any doctor that is connected to cognitive decline.   It's as if her pride and indignation are coming to the surface with this condition.  She thinks she's a 20 year old superstar. 

Do you guys think it makes any sense to bring up my concerns with her in the room?   Or does it makes sense just to observe her visits, and have a follow up call with the doctor.   I just know that if it was me who was the patient, I would want to have agency and awareness about it.   

Thanks!"
"I have been taking the night shift with my non-mobile grandmother (93) 2 nights a week for the past month. I am in need of some advice on a few things. 

1. My grandmother remembers me and all her family but does not remember that we are at her house, where the bathroom is, basically any short term memory (if she has eaten today, that she has asked the same question every 5 min for the night).... Is this a stage? Like what to expect in the next stage or will everything just go away all at once?

2. I have a toddler and must admit that my visits prior to helping out were short. I feel that my grandmother is getting worse during the time that I am here and she says things that make me know she feels lost without my aunt.... Do az patients get worse when something changes? I don't know that this really matters because my aunt was basically the sole caretaker and she has a lot of other things to handle so I can't stop. Just wondering if I'm pushing things faster than it should go. 

3. When something terrible happens or she gets sad about something it returns like a broken record. For example, my uncle fell down the stairs one night (typically nothing is retained longer than a few minutes) but that night she awoke every 30 minutes in a panic because she was worried about him (he's fine.). Is there a way to help some other things stick? Like I considered putting a sign up that says bed time 8 pm with a clock near it so she would stop fighting me to go to bed at 6. (In all actuality, I don't think staying up later makes her get up less throughout the night but that was what I was told.) 

4. My grandmother gets mad at my aunts (1 main care taker and 1 helps periodically) and will get aggressive and mean to them. With me she doesn't do that at all, but with her and my uncle needing help and feeling like I'm struggling with my toddler and work and life, I have snapped at her 2x. I never have gotten like actually mean but for instance when she keeps on saying she was going to turn off something I told her to go ahead, knowing she can't stand on her own. And when it dawned on her that she couldn't I felt terrible and cried a lot that day when I logged onto work. How do you keep from snapping when you are tired? You can't walk away, you can't explain like you can with a 2 yo because its gone a minute or two later. What do you do?"
I'm a student of a biomedical illustration/communications program and am creating a patient/caretaker education piece for my Masters project. My grandma has Alzheimer's and my family has found it very difficult to find succinct resources for patient care. I'm wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences and what resources you'd find helpful.
"I’ve gone for years like the dog in the meme in restaurant that is on fire and he’s saying “This is fine.” 
It’s not. My mom is starting to go down hill. It’s become so painfully apparent. Her identity and memories are like sand in an hour glass and I feel like I’m doing whatever I can to slow the inevitable. Grasping and grains! 

She’s misplacing things regularly. Having a harder time finding words. Getting more confused. She gets disoriented in the evening about her room being a different room. Her hygiene is declining and I have to remind her to bathe and brush her teeth. She does weird stuff like put her coffee in a Tupperware container or a Netipot  and drink from it. She once put Neosporin in her eye instead of eye drops. She rummages through our trash and pulls things out and hides it in her room. The list goes on. 

Lately she has been stressed and sad and I see the pain in her eyes. I found a new neurologist that we really like who is active in the disease with books and studies. Compassionate too. He recently put her on a Rivastigmine patches at the lowest dose and I’ve noticed she has become more depressed and restless. She has been having episodes almost daily. Saying she is miserable and she wants to go home. To park her things and leave. She has lived with me for years.  It’s so disheartening and stressful. 
I wanted this medication to work for her and slow down the disease. It’s not been easy. 

I’m at a loss here. I want to help her. 

I’m hoping that we can up her lexapro by another 5mg. She’s on the lowest dose at 5mg. She’s always had depression, anxiety, and mood swings. Always made threats. She has history of instability, and for once she found that with me because when she moved in with me I told her she needed to take her medication for her depressions. 
Over time we found a balance with only an episode once or twice a month where she is upset and locking herself in her room for a few hours. Now that the rivastigmine is in her system for the last two weeks it has been almost daily. I don’t want to give up on it yet. 

Any advice or insight is appreciated. Thank you for reading this far.

ADDING: 

She recently became more disturbed with the introduction of Rivastigmine. Trying to find balance but I know this battle is not an easy one."
"Today dad moves into assisted living. I can’t help but wonder how long he’ll be there. He’s entering stage seven, and he’s seen such a rapid decline over the last two years, I kind of hope he doesn’t have to stay long. 

My childhood home will have to be sold. My dad will never live in his house he and mom paid off years ago. All he worked for has been reduced to a studio apartment, a small amount of possessions, and a failing mind. 

Such a sad day."
"My nan has Lewy Body dementia. She is prone to violent outbursts which include hitting, kicking, pushing, throwing things, etc. a couple of days ago she attempted to pick up a chair and throw it. No amount of reasoning, talking, or yelling gets through to her in these episodes. How do we intervene in these situations? If we can remove the object she’s using as a weapon we do but sometimes she’s after you herself hitting and kicking. How are we supposed to handle this? Does anyone have any advice? 

Also, we are actively trying to get her in a home but none of the homes in our area will even return our call. We have tried showing up in person and still no is is available to help. It’s a frustrating situation, I just think they don’t want another Alzheimer’s patient in their care."
"I hate Alzheimer's . This diesease is heartbreaking. Currently we have my father in a licensed assisted living facility ... but his condition is worsening faster then anyone thought. Some of my family want to begin talks about him going into memory care... as he showed his first sign of Sundowners... obsessing over a document and refusing to eat and staying up for 24 hours because a ""document told him to do so."" What can be done? What is sundowners?"
"Her mom has voiced her concerns with her dad's recent behavior - being forgetful, worsening reading comprehension, short fuse and saying things that are rude or hurtful then moments later wondering why he'd say those things. My fiance is wondering if she should contact his job to find out if he's been having any issues at work. 

Would this be something that is okay to do? What are other steps she could take instead of the above? Any help is appreciated."
"I wasn't there to see it, but my mom brought my nana a baby doll and acted like it was a real baby. My nana absolutely loved it. she was rocking the baby, singing to it, even stroked its cheek. I'm sad I wasn't there for it, but I'm so happy that she had a good day"
"Hi all, I'm located in Nova Scotia, Canada.  
My 78-year-old mum was finally formally diagnosed with Alzheimer's dementia in January. I say ""finally"" because her symptoms have been progressing rapidly for the last 18 months but  my father, nearly 86, her primary caregiver, kept dismissing everything - including delusions, confirmed by her family doctor - as age-related memory loss.  My sister and I were hopeful that once an expert told him it's something much more serious, he'd be more open to seeking supports like a meal service and home care. He's trying to care for mum and manage the house and just failing dismally; they developed a fruit-fly infestation before Christmas due to the state of the kitchen, couldn't stay on top of kitty litter boxes (the last cat has, mercifully, passed) and Mum is not bathing on a regular basis.  
But...having gone through the MMSE with a score of 10/30, and despite a very clear and specific report from a geriatrician emphasizing the importance of home care, dad is still in denial. He says he'll look into home care ""when he feels it's appropriate,"" despite fully admitting that he will do anything to avoid conflict with mum, which results in her not bathing or eating regularly; and that he struggles to stay on top of laundry and basic housekeeping (hence fruit flies.) My sister and I spent most of last week cleaning the house, sorting and cleaning mum's clothes, and generally decluttering the house to make it more navigable; but she adamantly refused to bathe; we also had several very tense discussions with dad in which he repeated all of the above or just insisted he was managing and then stopped talking to us.  
He grudgingly contacted the provincial Alzheimer's society last week at my/my sister's insistence (and I should mention that the society apparently reached out to him after receiving a referral from the geriatrician - but he didn't return the message and tried to claim he'd never heard from them, which we have verified as a lie.) The society could be his link to home care resources and other supports - but my concern is that he will continue to downplay/deny mum's condition and refuse any and all supports.  
So...I have medical power of attorney for both of them and our province has a legal mechanism to revoke his guardianship but I'm in need of some help to determine when to exercise these nuclear options. He's running himself ragged and not caring for mum appropriately; they're bound and determined to stay in their home, but we don't have any confidence at all that that's a safe option unless he agrees to regular home care. Should I consult an attorney? Contact the province with concerns about his guardianship? Wait to see if he agrees to homecare? If so...how \*long\* do I wait?Many thanks for any insights, and my love to everyone else dealing with the many, many facets of this condition."
"Hello all. My grandpa has Alzheimer's, and honestly it hasn't gotten to a very bad state yet. But heres the issue my family is facing. My grandpa always thinks he has already eaten. If you ask him, he says he already ate, so he ends up not eating unless we give him food. He will only drink tea and eat a piece of bread otherwise. Does anyone have any advice for calorie dense foods i can give him, just so he doesnt starve himself? Hes from Bolivia, and he goes there for a few months in a year, and this last time he came back so skinny, basically skin and bones. But at the same time, because hes from another country he thinks any american food will kill him. So we can't give him the average american meal thats is usually calorie dense."
"My Nana has had Alzheimer’s for 14 years, (I’m 17) and I only really noticed how bad it was when she moved into memory care. She couldn’t come over for Holidays and has bad sundowning. I learned this week that she’s declining fast and has been getting angry with the staff (NOT like her at all) and now she can barely verbalize. She’s 83. Im terrified of the day she forgets who I am? Please, I need to know how to get through this."
My nana’s aging specialist recommended it for my papaw and I was wondering if it would be a helpful read or if anyone knows where you could find larger prints.
"...but after we hung up the call, I burst out crying because I know where his disease is taking him. I put it on speaker and recorded the call on my laptop just so I can have it. life is unfair, it always seems to put us all in the worst possible situations. I hate this."
"My dad (69) has been dealing with early onset Alzheimer’s for about 7 years(ish) now. His neurologist thinks it’s directly related to the massive scar tissue he has from a brain aneurysm he suffered when he was 29. His decline has been rapid in the last year, with his days mostly consisting of sleeping/resting for the last few months. 

Yesterday he had a grand mal seizure. My mom called an ambulance and they took him to the local ER. He was released later that night on anti seizure meds . She’s set up appointments with his GP and neuro for the next few weeks. He thinks it’s 1992 and is very, very confused. His speech is all over the place and he’s far more regressed than he was two days ago. Has anyone else experienced this with a loved one? Did they “recover” back to where they were pre-seizure? Just trying to wrap my head around what to expect."
I realize this may be asking for a magic pill for those with Alzheimer's.  Has anyone heard of a method that can help them regain their taste (other than adding salt) and sense of smell? My family member has practically a complete loss of both. Ty
"Hi /r/alzheimers - i'm not sure where to go to ask for help. Last month my mother moved her father into memorycare down in Florida. He had been living with my aunt and uncle at their house with my grandmother (his wife) in the West Palm Beach area, but it got to a breaking point of not being able to care for him. Today we were told he is being kicked out after physically assaulting a nurse for a 2nd time resulting in the nurse being sent to a hospital. My mother is scrambling to find a new facility that can care for him, as moving him back into my aunt's house is just out of the question. Does anyone have recommendations in Florida, specifically near the Palm Beach area for dementia/alzheimer patients that may get violent?"
"Anybody here have experience with their loved one with Alzheimer's being used, dumped and sued? 



Why are some people such garbage humans?"
"My 80 year old five-year-old gets into everything... respects nobody's boundaries (constantly pulling things out of my dresser)... dumps his pills into his pill water... puts trash in the recycle bin... but wants to stay at home... keeps changing the settings on our TV (currently the language seems to be Dutch, note, we are not Dutch!).  The toll on my sense of agency is rather large.

Don't worry, guy, it will take some time to get you a memory care slot.  But I'll be so, so ready."
"Hi all!

We are a group of graduate students at Stanford looking to better understand patients' experiences with clinical trials.

Specifically, we’re working on a project that aims to match people with trials more quickly and easily than many of the existing, cumbersome methods.

We’ve created a survey (below) that we hope gives you the chance to voice your own experiences finding therapies that work. We know that living with any disease or chronic condition is exhausting (never mind finding a trial), so we’re extremely grateful for the time you take to fill out this survey.

Of course, your privacy is extremely important, so all information is collected anonymously (unless you choose to provide your email for followup). Please let us know if you have any questions or suggestions.

"My mom will only eat thing that are warm, soft, and sweet. And more and more, if it's not sweet, she won't eat it. She always has room for ice cream, for example, but is just ""way too full"" to eat another bite of soup. We rely heavily on Ensure (which she's now starting to pour into everything she eats) and she's well past the point where we're worried about getting her a healthy or even balanced diet.  We need her to eat, period. 

But... I'm wondering if adding stevia or something similar to her soup or potatoes would help her appreciate them more. Have you had any success with this? Appreciate any tips!"
My grandfather phoned the police twice reporting my grandmother missing. She died a couple nights ago… fuck Alzheimer’s
"My grandma is progressing and speaking with her on the phone absolutely sucks. She was given a new phone that is a wall phone but since the buttons are on the phone, she accidentally pressed them just to confuse herself and hangs up thinking it’s someone else calling her. 

I’m one of the few grandkids (she’s very luck and has 15) she still adores and remembers. I actively call her once a week and the conversations are getting increasingly harder to follow. I’m very patient and she can still form thoughts but it takes so much longer. She also really only talks about what is actually in front of her. She doesn’t remember what she’s eaten an hour before or who she spoke to today. 

I know she loves the phone calls so of course I’ll continue especially since I know she won’t be able to talk or communicate at all. Im just so mad that the last of “easy” ways of communications are going to shit. It’s so sad."
"my mother was codependent with my father before he passed away.  they both exhibited narcissistic behaviors as well.  she gained some friends before her dementia really increased, and then she effectively stopped all of those relationships because of paranoia.

So now she shadows me (i’ve lived with her since my father passed away) and is just continuing her codependent behavior with me.

this might seem a silly question if i read it myself, but when you’re in the situation sometimes you can’t see the forest for the trees.

is the only way for me to reduce her shadowing and codependent behavior (toward me anyway) by removing myself physically from her presence?

i want to ask for some companion care help to start coming by, with the idea that a) it’s another person and b) they might take her on outings to meet even more people.  but i have the feeling that while she still has me to concentrate on, she won’t give other people a chance.  she also already dismissed adult day care centers as “babysitting”.

i want to stay home and get things done.  but should i be looking into moving out instead?  it seems so drastic, but…?

TIA.  bless you all for hanging in there."
"I’m on mobile so the formatting will be bad.

So I was driving back from a neighboring state today because my dad had to pick up his motorcycle from his parents and I drove back. We took my mom with us so she was in the car with me on the way back. I was doing really well until my dad had to get gas.

I parked in a good spot and was really proud of myself because it was kinda small between the rows of places. So when my dad was done, I began to back out. The car stopped and I thought “oh, I’m probably close to a car or something” (even though the beeper didn’t go off), so I put it in drive and slowly turned. Long story short, I ran over the curb on my front and back left tire. I was pissed because I was doing so well and fucked it up.

When I had to make upturn when we pulled out of the station, the 4 wheel drive turned on and the car was making a skidding sound and I couldn’t move faster. My knee is where the button is and my knee probably hit it. There was a car coming (not fast and in the left lane, I was in the right) so that just fueled my anger and I was obviously pissed. My mom then said to me, “you don’t need to get upset about it. You’re doing a great job.” She didn’t raise her voice, there wasn’t any anger or irritation in it at all. It was calm and reassuring. She didn’t say anything bad about the mess up and told me to focus on how good I was driving.

I haven’t heard her talk like that since she got sick. It was the clearest I hard her in years. Yeah some words were jumbled, but it was like she was normal again. It was like that the rest of the way back home. Before we pulled into the gas station, she was gasping when I would switch lanes and when we’d go by trucks, but for some reason the gas station is where she changed. Obviously when we got back she went back to how she has been, but holy shit it hit me hard. As we driver back, I kept it going because I wanted to experience her somewhat older self for as long as I could."
"Hi all, 

My dad was dx with early onset Alzheimer's in 2013. By last April, he had stopped walking, eating/drinking and all the end stage business. He's not verbal.

He went into a memory care unit and has been under hospice since. 

In hospice he ""recovered"" a bit, insofar as they feed him enough to keep him alive. But he's still nonverbal and in a wheelchair. I visit him 1-2x a week. I wish I could see him more, but I work, have a husband and 3 kids. 

I'm just kind of struggling with this today. He was a great person. An incredible, intelligent, awesome dad and a good partner to my mom for nearly 40 years. He doesn't deserve to suffer as he does. And I feel selfish saying that I'm tired of being gutted watching him go through it. 

Any advice?"
"We have been fighting for a diagnosis for my MIL (67) for years and the doctors dismiss it. She also vehemently fights it insisting we are all conspiring against her.

Long story short, we all know her well enough and spend enough time with her to know she isn’t right and we don’t need a diagnosis to tell us what’s happening.

What advantage is there so continuing to pursue a diagnosis? It creates a lot of conflict and tension for my FIL to fight that battle. The only advantage i can think of is if the medications are effective but the reading I’ve done makes it seem like that’s questionable? I’m happy to be wrong about this though…"

From what I gather St Johns Wort is beneficial in relieving alzheimers.  I've been trying it with my mother on and off for years, though haven't noticed anything substantial.  

Even if it does help someone else's family even slightly it was worth the post."
What can i do to help and support???
"I spent years taking care of my pap and I couldn’t bear watching the disease take him anymore. He basically slept all day and couldn’t function much at all. Towards the end of last year I started to feel upset as I watched his skin start to break down, I tried my best to tend to his body. I was also fighting with my dad because nobody wanted to put pap on hospice, I did the brunt of the work and we all needed help. 

On January 4th I sat down and wrote a post to this group. I was broken, sad, and feeling unheard. I could only be so grateful for the advice I received. I remember sitting in the bathroom in tears typing back to all of you, and then I prayed to God. That he would please take my pap so he could rest. He seemed miserable and I couldn’t do it anymore. Immediately after, he started declining very fast. 

Early in the month he began shutting his eyes more and barely wanted to sit up. I’d have to hold him up while spoon feeding him, all with his eyes closed. The week of Jan 17th I noticed his chewing get slower, and slower, and slower. By Jan 24th he was just holding the food in his mouth, getting just 1-2 bites down each meal. By this time pap wasn’t talking for weeks, just mumbling. But when I laid him down that day I told him I loved him, and he said I love you back as clear as day. By Jan 26th he stopped swallowing liquids and food completely. I worked those two weeks straight and stayed by his side. After that, the doctor said all we had to do was lay him in bed and wait. By then he was very weak and stayed asleep all day. By Jan 30th, I admit I was scared. He was losing weight so fast and he looked worse by the hour. He was nothing but bone, I remember how light he felt. I was hoping he wouldn’t linger to long. I arrived the next day and found him resting peacefully for good.

Wherever you are pap, please stand by me. I’ll miss you terribly. For all of you out there, stay strong. Everything comes to an end eventually. Please wish me luck as I’m trying to find my next job. Help me out pap! Lol."
"Hi, I was a domiciliary carer in 2019 for 12 months, so spent time with clients with alzheimers and dementia, the experience of which has been useful for my mom, because her neighbour has been diagnosed with alzheimers - and the poor woman is getting very little support. Mom, herself 81 years old, does what she can, which is admirable, considering her neighbour has been horrible to her well before the illness even began.

I know things can't carry on as they are, so I'm joining groups for support and advice, and in time, I may be able to help others."
"My mother is 57 and I’m worried about her. She is her normal self, but over the past years she has been a little bit forgetful and she doesn’t care too much about cleaning as much anymore. Is there a way that she can be diagnosed early? If she is found to be in the early stages is there anyway to slow the process?"
"My Mom was very recently diagnosed in January—up until just the last month or so her issues have been mostly benign and memory related, but now she has come to believe I stole something from her house.

At first she wouldn’t even say what it was, just that “I knew what I took” but she was mad enough she nearly hit me. Eventually we got it out of her that it was a two pages she had taken out of a magazine—needless to say I hadn’t even seen them let alone took them.

I know this isn’t an uncommon sort of thing with Alzheimer’s… what I’m not sure about is how to get her to move on from it… it’s been many weeks now and she keeps sending me angry emails. Obviously she’d didn’t believe me when I told her I didn’t take it—any strategies for what to do now? Do I just wait it out until she forgets about it? Will she forget about it? Do I “admit” to taking the pages, tell her their destroyed and beg forgiveness? Is there some way I can give her a resolution to this?

It would be awesome if we had some idea of what they actually were or what magazine they came from, but there’s no hope of that—she’s become obsessed with cutting stuff out of magazines and putting them in binders and on display all over the house so there’s no chance we’d be able to track it down."
"Her condition is getting worse, beyond what we're equipped to handle. I knew we'd get to this point, I just didn't think it would happen so soon. We haven't had nearly enough time to get our ducks in a row and it's come back to bite us in the form of a last-minute scramble. 

My dad needs to call the lawyer about Medicaid so it's on me to look for potential long-term care facilities. Any suggestions on what to ask? I am in a daze. He said to ask about what care comes standard and what is extra, and I want to ask about how they handle meltdowns, but what else should I be looking for?"
"This is long. Thank you for taking time to read.

So my dad has always been a little neurotic, has had mild OCD and control issues, he has achieved great things throughout his life and his identity is tied with an immense knowledge of a million things. His mental functioning has declined noticeably from all his family members, he forgets most things like appointments (he has used a calender for years so that helps) but he says things now that aren't true, for example he says he talks on the phone to my brother frequently but not true, he said he was at Verizon for hours and his new wife said they came 30 minutes before closing, or he tells stories about his life that are way exaggerated, I don't even know if any of it is true) and recently doing anything with him has been like dealing with an insolent teenager (for example, his cell phone wasn't working right- there was a lag on the line where after he would finish speaking it would go quiet and if you talked it cut off the first 2 seconds of your reply. He blames Verizon who has excellent coverage but it was likely the phone, he did superglue a beeper tracker to the top. Who knows why but either way he wanted to switch carriers, so I take him to T-mobile and 6 hours later we leave empty handed because he complicated everything since it's his way or nothing at all, and he doesn't understand the way things work. He needed to set up a Myverizon account and he didn't remember anything about his account).

Whew that was a lot to say, but everything he needs to do is like pulling teeth, he will not listen or let me help him with simple things, and he is so confused, he doesn't remember or understand that when you get a new phone or install something for the first time you have to log in, he thought it was a scam when I went to the google play store and downloaded the mail app he uses. 

He gets obsessive and fixated on little things that he doesn't even understand how it works and is overwhelmed because he gets behind on the important things like moving into his new house.

He just turned 75. He has has weird nerve pain, was diagnosed with polymyalgiarhematica from a rhumetologist and is on prednisone (and has been for about 8 months but after lessening dose it came back hard), and now is taking hydroxyquinoline.

Long story short, he was sent to a memory specialist or something like that to do testing a couple weeks ago, there were 3 sessions, and now he is going to a memory center (outpatient I assume) my sister says, she thinks it's because his new wife who is a very loving and supportive person (my sister doesn't know her very well but I have spent a lot of time with this lady, even just us, who was his gf for the past few years and I know her well) my sister thinks she is trying to deem him mentally unfit, he made her his power-of-attorney after they got married a few months ago.

My sister thinks basically it is fishy and the should have put him on a medicine to make it better, she is an RN, and thinks it is fishy he is being sent to a memory center for day rehabilitation. 

Is this the normal process? He must have had a neurologist refer him there, right? 

Sorry. This was long. Please give any advice you can, it's hard even getting any information from my dad and I want to compare it to what his wife says.

Thank you!"
"The reasons for grandma not going to bed are getting longer. Tonight she says - sat in her chair, in front of the TV, in the living room - that she’s already in bed. 
Wonder if she’s going the same way as my other grandma and slipping into full on dementia."
"He is 87. My family has had suspicious based on his behavior in the past couple months, but now that it's official, I am devastated. He overheard the doctor tell my grandmother and when they got in the car, he told her that his ""life is basically over."" That shatters my fucking heart.

He finished cancer treatment in February of last year and was basically on the brink of death due to the huge toll it put on his body, he was put on hospice and we all had pretty much realized and accepted what was going to happen. But he miraculously pulled out of it and everything was going well again until now.

Has anyone had a family member diagnosed around this age? How quickly did their condition deteriorate? I'm terrified and don't know what to expect at this point.

Thank you all in advance"
"My dad has early onset Alzheimer’s. I have toyed with the idea of getting tested for the genes linked to it. There are 3 genes linked to it and from what I’ve read, it is almost guaranteed that you will get early onset. I’m not sure if getting tested will give me relief or change my life and how I live it. Or maybe I’ll start taking medication for it at a younger age. Can anyone share their experience on whether or not they’ve decided to get tested for the EARLY ONSET genes?

*I wanted to stress that I’m talking about early onset because with the other genes related to late set Alzheimer’s, the chances of getting the disease, even if you have the genes, are significantly lower than in the case with early onset. Also, obviously, with early onset, at least for me, it seems more terrifying since it typically cuts your years more than late onset. I know nothing is guaranteed and that cures could come and yada yada."
"My mother is slowly approaching her 50th birthday. However, I am scared that she will Alzheimer. She don’t show the symptoms but I am scare that she will get it and soon forget me. I want to her lessen the chance of getting Alzheimer. I know none of my family have dementia or Alzheimer but I am scare by the fact it could be there.

I know physical exercise and dieting can lessen the chances but what other stuff could help? Reading the sun has gotten more worried about my mother health, she very important for me! I don’t want my mom to forget me"
"Hi. This regards a man with Dementia but I thought it was close enough to hopefully relate to someone's experiences here. 

Background: I am the caretaker of my friend C, a 78 year old man with Dementia. I am very close with and work alongside his bio son who is power of attorney and between us, we handle C's life for him. 

About two years ago we went through all of C's credit cards and shut them down, or so we thought.  There were about two cards that we did not know existed and subsequently missed paying them off and shutting them down. The initial charges were small, about $100, but the late fees really piled on.

These cards over the past two years have substantially destroyed C's credit. We are worried that this destroyed credit will ruin his availability to get in to a nursing home of his choosing, which is a scenario that is approaching quickly. Do we have any availability to challenge these credit damages, on the grounds that C's Dementia has taken away his comprehension? How does this work? Do we have any options to get back his previously stellar credit score?"
"My mother is 69 and lives a sedentary lifestyle. She decided to divorce my father at 57 and move to Vegas way far away from anyone else.

"Hi all, my (34F) mother-in-law (89F) got diagnosed with Alzheimer’s just after I met her, about 5 years ago. She’s been living in her home with my boyfriend and I, and while the whole experience has been frustrating (feeding the dog 6x per day until she throws up, feeding the dog human food, throwing away food we just bought, buying tons of batteries/cottage cheese/cabbage, anything left on a surface “put away” never to be seen again, shadowing and sun downing, etc) we’ve been rolling with the punches.

Last December she had hip surgery and had to sleep in the study on the ground floor. We thought maybe this would turn into a permanent stage, but beginning with the first night she was home it was catastrophic. The exit alarm we put under her mattress seemed to go off twice an hour. We had blocked the stairs to the second floor with chairs and signs, but she fought us to get to the chairs, bit her son, called us a bitch and bastard and that she would never, ever forgive us for this. Every morning she was back to her sweet self.

Fast forward to two weeks ago and she was exercising in the kitchen with her home health worker (they are in the house while we have to work from roughly 11am-3pm) when we think she stood up too quickly and fainted. She fell and hit her head and broke her humerus just below the shoulder joint. Spent 3 days in the trauma center of the local hospital before being discharged to a rehab center. She’s doing better with the pain (not sure if healing or they’re just doing a good job staying on top of it with the meds) but mentally and emotionally it’s been horrific. We tried to visit as much as possible during the first two weeks, but she is fixated on the thought that we are doing this to her and we want her out of our lives. She doesn’t even know her arm is broken and it’s impossible to have any kind of rationale discussion with her because facts are only valid for a few fleeting moments at a time.

All of this is complicated by the fact that when she was younger, she uprooted her own mother (who had dementia but no Alzheimer’s) from her home and brought her to live with them, but then had her children drug her ice cream and drop her off at a senior living center when it became too much. She keeps saying “I would never do this to my own parent, I would never do this to someone I love.” I can’t tell if she’s feeling guilty or honestly believes that.

She has a doctor’s appointment this afternoon and I’m kind of dreading either outcome— staying at the rehab center or being discharged home. I know I will have some more specific questions depending on what happens, but for now I think I just needed to vent."
"My dad was ‘misdiagnosed’ with AD in Feb 2019 at age 57.  He started showing symptoms in his 40s. Summer of 2020 he was then diagnosed with CBD which is a progressive disease that affects movement, speech, and memory. For him, its short term memory. he could tell you everything about his childhood, college years, anything up until maybe 5 years ago but doesnt remember falling last weekend. Hes losing his ability to talk and think of words. When hes trying to think of a word, he’ll explain it but then forget the original story. God it hurts. I cannot think of anything more painful than seeing your smart, funny, intelligent, and hardworking dad become a different person. 

I suppose im just wondering if any redditors out there are familiar with it!"
"I need to ask here because my sister and I have exhausted all other options. My father passed away 2 years ago (63 aneurisms) My mother 73 has moved from her home (Africa) to split living with me and my family (Europe) and my sister in the UK.  She had been saying her memory was bad and my dad had been saying it for a few years before he died. Now she is living with us it is clear how bad her memory is. She is in very good physical health does not drink or smoke. 

Her memory of anything recent is non-existent. She claims it was brought on by trauma from my fathers passing, but it's not that. She is very educated and use to read about 3 books a week. Now she doesn't. She cant remember anything she forgets to eat lunch and brush her teeth. 

We have had her seen by a phycologist who put her on a mild antidepressant - no change 

She had an MRI scan - All Clear 

She had her blood tested - All clear 

She was asked questions by a specialist but she answered them fine. She knows things like who the Priminister is and how to spell words backwards. 

What do we do now? It comes to a point where she is not able to be left on her own as she can't remember which garbage goes in which recycle bin etc. 

I realise Reddit is not the place for medical answers but I just don't know what more to do. I don't want her to have Alzheimers but I can't understand what is happening to her."
"My dad has been having memory problems for 2+ years and slowly declining. I've been assuming it's alzheimers and mentally preparing but he lives in a different state than me and I can only do so much between visits. He recently stopped attending our weekly video/phone chats (a month ago) and I've been trying to call/text/email/any contact him for a week now with no response from him. 

Some context:

The only person in his town he has any contact with is his ex-wife, who tells me she still drops by or at least hears from him at least once a week. He's doing 'okay' (i.e. no safety concerns but lots of other concerns). He often doesn't pick up the phone because he doesn't hear it or thinks he's 'busy' and doesn't want to be bothered. He used to consider me his 'favorite' and would only talk to me if he wouldn't pick up for others, but now no contact at all from him.

My brother and I are both on a durable POA for him. We both live several states away. No other family to help besides ex-wife. He's more and more paranoid and is quite distrustful of strangers these days.

He kinda hoards and doesn't clean his house and has ferrets he takes care of. I'm starting to get worried about the animals if he is not talking to me anymore; clearly something about his routine changed.

Before he stopped talking to me he had been telling me stories about seeing people in his house (which he couldn't describe), thinking they could take care of his pets and then realizing they weren't real, thinking they were kicking him out of his house so he got locked out one night and couldn't remember how he got back in, etc. He has gotten lost more often on his walks (he has basically chosen to stop driving due to eyesight, thank god). He misplaces items all the time and buys new versions so his house has massive quantities of basically everything. So it seems he was getting bad and now he's probably worse.

I just found out THIS WEEKEND from his doctor that he missed his last neurology appointment a month ago and that LAST APRIL the doctor has diagnosed him with 'probable alzheimers.' This whole last year we had no diagnosis to try to do anything with; now it feels we are suuuuper running out of time. His ex-wife has offered to go to an appt with him but if he won't pick up the phone (and he often doesn't answer the door for her even when expecting her) how do we even get him there?

He lives in Albuquerque, NM--a city with limited resources and a police force known to abuse citizens, especially those with mental health problems. So I refuse to call the police for a wellness check. However, he has a gun in his house (no idea if he even remembers he has one) so all concerned are not willing to be forceful when they try to drop by or check on him and he's not answering the door.

He has always been ridiculously stubborn nothing is wrong. He has said before, when he was a bit more lucid and we were talking, that if something was wrong with him he wouldn't want to know about it anyway. I think he realizes he's getting worse and trying to distance himself from people, but I feel soooo responsible because I have POA and he's my freaking dad.

I'm feeling very stuck and helpless and I don't have a lot of time/resources to be traveling back and forth between multiples states (especially when he won't pick up or even answer his door). I either need somebody to give me ideas on what I can try to do or somebody to tell me what a reasonable mental limit is on the responsibility I place on myself. This whole thing is the worst."
"FIL 72 seems to be starting with this. His mother suffered from it, so it wouldnt be a surprise. My wife might be the one who will need to deal with everything because MIL is almost blind. But he is not willing to do anything now, not about the things he own or his health, I am just wondering whats gonna happen when. 
Any help is welcome, personal experiences as well. 
Thank you"
"Hi everyone! I hope you’re all doing well. We’re a group of PhD and Master's students from Melbourne and we’re conducting research on people living with dementia and their caregivers to develop valuable resources and tools.

"Just got done with the blood draw. My neurologist ordered a genetic test done for all the known alz and dementia variants since my late grandfather had alz hit early, my father is worried he has it, and there’s concern for it to potentially be the fun and rare familiar kind of alz. Doc was glad to do it, especially since I’m only in my 30s and the earlier we know, the more we can try as meds as research improve.

I’d rather know the risk than not, it’ll make planning for the future while both alive and dead easier, and I view it as a higher quality of life since I wouldn’t miss any of the moments I want to experience before anything should happen, but damn. The weight of it all hit after the blood left my body. 

I don’t know really what I’m looking for by posting, if I’m honest. I’ve done the research, my doc is great, I’ve got genetic counseling, I’ve experienced the decline and fall of alz in my own family, and I know nothing is guaranteed even if I do light up the dementia panel like a redneck christmas tree. I guess it just feels like y’all would understand more than others and sounding off into that kind of ether felt right.

Anyway. Now I just wait. And probably worry, despite all the reasons not to."
"Hi, there I am looking for places to find recommendations for beneficial products and services for caregivers or LO's of those living with dementia or Alzheimer's? Thoughts"
"My Mom has had Alzheimer’s for the past eight years. She will pass with the help of Hospice in the next few days. Even though I knew this day was coming, I feel so unprepared and hurt so much. I don’t want her to suffer anymore, though. She is in another state. I am trying to decide whether to fly and be with her or say goodbye on the phone because she won’t be aware with the drugs she will be on. I kind of want to remember her as she was our last visit. Is this disloyal to not want to be there. She has my three brothers. I don’t know what the right thing to do is. Please give me advice."
"Ghoulish anniversaries have been haunting my days. 

[https://www.stumpedtowndementia.com/post/there-s-a-whole-lot-of-her-missing](https://www.stumpedtowndementia.com/post/there-s-a-whole-lot-of-her-missing)"
Everyone I’ve met with Alzheimer’s was kind of a sour puss before they were diagnosed.  With my grandpa he saw his father die as a young child and never talked about it. He still knows it happened but doesn’t want to talk about it ever. With my uncle who has passed he always acted smarter than everyone in his life and almost looked down on a lot of his family for never leaving their small town. So a theory I have about Alzheimer’s is that it forms from not being honest with yourself and keeping feelings trapped inside for so long the materialize as the brain disease we know as Alzheimer’s. I am starting to notice little things with my mom now (who was touched as a child and hates to talk about it). I am wondering if any of you have had problems with someone who has had a “good” life because everyone I know with it has been blocking things from their consciousness for a long time which leads me to believe that has something to do with it forming. I’m going to start going to therapy so this doesn’t happen to me.
"My mother is 64. My family is increasingly concerned about dementia. She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 30+ years ago which was fairly well controlled with lithium for decades until the lithium damaged her kidneys (she was taken off at the end of 2017). She now takes seroquel, topomax, and clonazepam, as well as blood pressure medication.

We have noticed more memory and cognitive issues in the last year or so. For example:
- difficulty following storylines in shows and movies
- frequently misplacing items and believing unknown others are taking them or messing with her
- repeatedly asking the same questions or telling the same information
- when filling out a medical form, she stared blankly for a while before finally leaning over and asking me what the year is
- difficulty grasping sequences of events or multistep processes
- difficulty using her iPhone
- multiple, repeated small car accidents that culminated in an accident that totaled her car in October 2021 (fortunately she is no longer driving and no one was hurt)

These cognitive issues seem to wax and wane and sometimes are more apparent than others. But generally she does not seem to be where she was a year or two ago. 

More debilitating is the nightly terror and paranoia that really sets in in the evening. She is unable to stay alone. Her first episode with paranoia that required mental health hospitalization was in September 2020. That paranoia waned a bit but since the spring of 2021 it has been plaguing her almost every night. She has done much better during the day, but she does get anxiety in anticipation of the evening. We have home health aides coming in to stay with her at night but we are pursing assisted living. 

She can dress herself, shower, go to the bathroom, and even cooks sometimes but seems to be incapable of “running her life.” She is not eating well. Her house gets dirty.
She is currently in the hospital for the second time in three weeks. She took Ubers there both times concerned about herself having a stroke but both times they ran tests and determined that she did not have a stroke. They weighed her and she weighed just 105 lbs and she is 5’9” tall. (They have had her there since Wednesday this time and after explaining to the physical therapist all that is going on, they are recommending skilled nursing for a couple of weeks while we figure out next steps… we are awaiting insurance approval). 

It’s hard to tell if these are mental health issues or cognitive decline (or both). We are interested in having her evaluated for dementia or at least a new psychiatrist who has a fresh perspective on her mental health. Her current psychiatrist does not seem to be helping and just sort of shrugs his shoulders. She is open to seeing a new psychiatrist. We are not sure, if she does in fact have dementia, whether the medications she is prescribed are appropriate or exacerbating things. 

Does this sound like your loved ones’ progression and symptoms?"
"Definitely needing some advice, my uncle was recently found wandering off, doctor says he has dementia, very middle stage. He is currently living with my parents and they have found a wonderful memory care facility for him. He refuses to go, and the facility says “they don’t have people for those that refuse”My Mom has a full power of attorney, what can they do?  He’s very argumentative, and verbally aggressive. My Mom has a heart condition and the emotional toll is already ruining my parents, but they don’t know what to do now."
"Hello,

My dad has pretty advanced Alzheimer's. He can remember our names and who we are but he is not the same person...you all know how it is. I recently got engaged and my partner and I are wrestling with the decision of whether to have a smaller ceremony sooner or go with our original plan next year September. Has anyone had any experience dealing with this? I just don't really know what to do...how will I feel if he progresses and isn't aware of who I am? Do I care about my wedding that much - it's just a day? But he wants to see us get married so...? So many questions. 

TLDR - dad has Alzheimer's, worried if I wait to get married he will forget who I am and miss it."
"Hi,

Just wondering what the sleep cycles are of your loving other with alzheimers?  Do they wake up when the sun rises or shortly after, and stay awake for the majority of the day?  

Reason being I have just read this post that the clearance of amyloid-beta plaques are linked to a healthy circadian rhythm sleep cycle.  In general my mother sleeps in quite a bit, and if we don't wake her up for breakfast or a shower she would naturally sleep until around 2pm in the afternoon.  On the odd occasion where she has to wake up very early for a doctors appointment, we would expect her to be overly tired, but she actually seems more alert.  I'm going to try to force early waking up with extra light, vitamin d, music, coffee etc in the hope to regain a normal sleep pattern and see what the effects on her alzheimers.

So just wondering what the sleep cycles are of everyone elses, parent, grandparent, spouse etc.

"I am looking at something to manage Mom's medication routine better. She's done well with us sorting them into a standard daily sorter, and her taking them throughout the day. It's become obvious that she's struggling with the routine. I've been looking into devices and have found the MedReady MR-357 ([https://www.medreadyinc.net/products/medication-dispensers/monitored-medication-dispensers/medready-mr-357/](https://www.medreadyinc.net/products/medication-dispensers/monitored-medication-dispensers/medready-mr-357/)). I was wondering if anyone here has experience with this device (or a different model).

I primarily picked this one because for a few reasons. It offers the ability to plug it in, meaning that she will have to leave it where we put it and not take it to her chair, bed, or wherever the current sorter keeps appearing. It doesn't have to be tipped to remove pills; she drops the pills while dumping them now a lot, and she doesn't have finger mobility issues to have problems pulling them out instead. It has the option to sign up for a monitoring/emergency notification service now or down the road. The alarm will encourage her to keep a better medication schedule than she currently does (which is ""whenever""). The monthly fee is more reasonable that other options I've seen.

What I'm hoping is that it will also have a phone app or web site where we can see her activities. This may only be available if paying for the monitoring service, but I can't tell for sure. I would appreciate any and all input from this awesome group, including suggestions if you are using something with your person that might work as well or better. Thanks!"
"It was a bit of a fight but my fathers condition declined and he experienced a increasingly frequent difficulty with eating and swallowing (especially with thick liquids) over the last year.  


I best describe it as his having a ""tip of the tongue"" issue with  **initiating the coordination** that is involved in swallowing.  He wanted too swallow (whatever was being fed to him) but a combination of a fear of aspiration and inability to get past some hurdle involved in starting the swallow caused him to not be able to eat or drink.  


He was hungry and thirsty and would hold something easily swallowable like apple sauce in his mouth until he all finally leaked out (he got tired of holding it).   


Now once he got past that hurdle (on a good day) he would eat hungrily and swallow everything just fine but those became less frequent and he started a slow decline in his maintain weight and staying hydrated.   


Knowing my father, his wishes and how he would have handled this for other family members in the same condition I went ahead and advocated for his having [a feeding tube (PEG Tube](https://www.asge.org/home/for-patients/patient-information/understanding-peg)) put in place.   
I was not offered by his (former) primary care physician and when I mentioned it's installation she replied that a ""PEG tube did not extend their life"".  Which reeked of a blatant lie she use her nursing staff to inform me of.

My retort was ""How can proper feeding, hydration and  the giving of medication NOT extend the *quality of life?""    I even went so far as to state that the denial of food and nourishment is something the Nazi's did to people.*   Despite this, the argument of *""quality of life""*  was one that they couldn't get around.  
That it was about the quality of life and how my father wanted to eat... but was in fear of choking.  
We had to change doctors within the hospital system and eventually got multiple referrals from everyone from the speech therapist on up to his new primary physician.   


Then I had deal with multiple refusals and roadblocks from the gastro dept.  


It was the same counter argument from the surgeons in the gastro dept.   
*""It doesn't prolong their life""*  
To which I not only replied that the family is unanimous in it's desire but it's entirely in the keeping of my fathers wishes to have a PEG tube installed so as to  


***""Prevent hunger and to provide proper care and comfort, that it is a matter of good medicine in the alleviation of pain and suffering from hunger""***  


The PEG tube surgery was approved and successfully accomplished as a same day procedure and has been used ever since.   


I'm happy to report that my fathers overall condition has **noticeably improved.**  
He's  alert, his meds and food is given on a regular schedule, he's well hydrated and gaining good weight on his body.  His pressure sores have all healed and he's doing very well (all considering).  


He's  had recovery in his presence of mind and ability to communicate his wishes.  He's also **regained his ability to eat on his own and swallow without difficulty.**  

So he now eats for pleasure and I give him what he asks for...    
(we play 20 questions with a list of foods until I say one that he likes)   
He loves oranges and other fruits, little snacks like [beef jerk](https://www.amazon.com/Kirkland-Signature-Steak-Strips-Ounces/dp/B01K30Z326/ref=asc_df_B01K30Z326/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=241869531501&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=5218741398513562805&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9061183&hvtargid=pla-668855256888&psc=1)y and has no problem with things like slices of Pizza.  He does this without the risk of choking and the swallowing is perfect.  
This is all on top of his liquid meals that are easy to serve along the meds [I crush in a mortar.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H7DRSM6?ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details&th=1)  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  


I feel that the doctors in the system often opt for *giving the families an out* and to offer this excuse for not going this route and allowing people to starve as they would in a hospice situation.   It's also possible that the for profit hospitals have a policy to cut costs in care as my father who was in danger of being starved to death is now out of the requests for placement into hospice (meaning that he's no expected to die within 6months time), he's back into the care of his (new) primary physician.  


*One might wonder why I had to fight over 3 months to get this feeding tube installed?*

IF someone starts to experience a difficulty with swallowing due to the progression of the disease I strongly urge you (the family/caregivers) to keep this in mind, that IME, the HMO's will put up roadblocks against a PEG tube as a excuse to withdraw proper care and for the HMO's to save money by lessening the time caring for a patient (legally speeding their demise)

  
It's system wide IME, I've seen people in a memory care facility where they lose the ability to feed themselves (the family gets charged through the roof for the extra time and ""feeding"") The client/victim's get starved over time and when they become weakened, they'll be shuttled off into hospice where they are gone within a month - because they won't try to feed them there.  


Sorry if this hard for some people to read, it's not my intentions.   
I love my father and it hurt me knowing that he was hungry and unable to eat.  
How he felt was clear in his gaze and angry frown as well as his expressions of frustrations at repeatedly trying to initiate a swallow..  and not being able to do it.  


That is torture.  


Now my father is much better off  than he was 2 months ago, he's well fed and comfortable with improved health."
"My loved one is in final stages, no longer eating or taking meds. She had a stroke and lost ability to speak coherently. Her pupils do not respond to light. Yet she does not seem to be in distress -she mostly sleeps. One thing she responds to is music especially when someone sings familiar songs. She tries to sing along.  I found out she likes Tupelo Honey by Van Morrison. I hope the rest of her transition can continue peacefully."
"Hi lovely people. I am new to this community and could really use some clarity/some help in how to deal with some sundowning. 

My grandmother is 91 and has dementia. The Dr. now suspects she also has Sundowning. She's not at the point where she can't remember her family etc. It's mostly little things. But the biggest struggle is the sundowning. And it's not the typical sundowning I've been reading. She's not forgetful, but she becomes unconsolable in some way or another. Our typical symptom is 'i feel weak' and that she's going to die. Her head starts to hurt to the point of uncontrollable moaning and then she gets so cold. For about 3 hours she's hysterical crying that she's not feeling good and screams over and over that she's cold. Her ears start to ring and she's almost going mad. She never forgets who we are or where she is. She paces the house moaning and screaming and crying and using saying 'why is this happening' 'whats happening' It's terribly unsettling and really taking a toll on everyone. She's usually ok by 7:30/8pm and will go to sleep. The next day she does wake up drained from last nights episode and will cry and be depressed most of the day. By like 12pm-3pm she's pretty good. 

Has anyone else dealt with this type of sundowning before? What are some ways to help her? Calm her down? Is there anything we can do before hand to make it less severe? Since we know the time it's usually going to happen I feel we can try and chase it. Some days she's perfectly fine. My mom is her caregiver and tries to keep her as busy as possible during the day. Giving her little tasks she can handle. Last night the dog jumped on her lap during a very bad episode and that helped a lot. However, I don't live with my parents and her full time and the dog is mine, so thats not always a solution. 

Cheers and love to everyone going through this."
"My MIL is in a bad spell lately. My husband has for the past year been visiting her regularly for 2 week stints, working from home there and giving his sister a break from checking on her... During his current trip, she has asked why he's staying so long, why we aren't with him, are he and I getting a divorce, we must not even miss him, etc. She doesn't seem to remember that he's been doing these trips regularly for a year. I'm tired of seeing my husband's siblings not try to help and him afraid of upsetting the apple cart, so started looking up resources in her state. (We live 2 states and 9 hrs away.) I did find a care program that may be of help? To be eligible, a person has to meet 3 of the following: 
 (some she is questionable on, other I think a case can be made for)

1. Basic communication skills – such as using a regular phone, mobile phone, email, or the internet.

Well-- she can use the phone. But often dials a number thinking she is calling person A, and in reality it's person B. And she will forget she has called people, to the point of calling daily and not realizing it's not the first time. She uses NO other technology. Computers are for spying and are evil. We've heard from family members that they call her and she doesn't know who they are.

2. Transportation – either by driving oneself, arranging rides, or the ability to use public transportation.

She lives in a rural area. Doesn't recognize many locations even though she's lived there over 50 years. Talks about several times she's gotten lost. Has even told us about going on a ""Sunday drive"" to see Alaska -- one state west. (No, that is Colorado) 

3. Meal preparation – meal planning, cooking, clean up, storage, and the ability to safely use kitchen equipment and utensils.

She only really uses a microwave. Occasionally uses an electric skillet. Doesn't seem to know how to read packages for cooking info or how to follow a recipe. Will purchase 2lbs of hamburger to make herself a burger and leave the rest to rot in the fridge. If she doesn't later make a meal from spoiled meat. Will go through the trash to pull things out if we clean out her fridge. Has told my husband things like she's never seen pork chops before & doesn't know what they are. Her diet is mostly chicken nuggets, corn dogs, toast, coffee and tea. And driving to town for tacos or burgers.

4. Shopping – the ability to make appropriate food and clothing purchase decisions.

Has little concept of appropriate amounts of food to buy, and it's like shopping with a 5 yr old. She can buy clothes when needed. But suspect she is with her daughter when she does so.

5. Housework – doing laundry, washing dishes, dusting, vacuuming, and maintaining a clean place of residence. 

Mostly ok, til you consider the pipe delusion -- she had a cracked sewer pipe last year. SIL had it repaired. She still swears it's broken and dumping raw sewage under the house. Tells us she needs to crawl under it and clean up, and will pee in a cup, and poop in a bin with a sack in it and throw it in the trash. (Though this delusion hasn't been brought up during husband's current stay) Aside from that, housecleaning is something that she is fanatic about & seems to be muscle memory.

6. Managing medications – taking the correct amount of medication at the correct time. Managing re-fills, and avoiding conflicts.

She has been on blood pressure meds for decades, but if she had to add something new? She cancels Dr appts if they call to confirm with her, so her daughter has told Drs to confirm through her instead of her mom. She doesn't really know why she is seeing any particular Dr. 

7. Managing personal finances – operating within a budget, writing checks, paying bills, and avoiding scams

My husband says she can still do this. Til I point out his sister actually does a lot of the bill paying and management of her bank account. She can't really avoid scams; she thinks phone company reps are trying to scam her, yet has almost fallen for several scam calls til my husband or his sister step in. She only uses checks, but now that many places don't take them, she gets frustrated easily. As when getting groceries.

So! If you've had experience with assistance programs, does all this sound like enough to qualify her? It's really hard on my husband, and I am hoping to find an answer that doesn't mean declaring her incompetent but that eases some of the burden from him."
"Hello everyone, new to the sub. Just looking for some advice from more experienced caregivers and maybe some encouragement that we didn’t make a horrible choice. 

My MIL is 66. Alzheimer’s ran strong in her family- her mother and sister both passed away from it before age 75. I believe her sister only lived for 2-3 years after her diagnosis. My FIL passed away in November 2019 (she was 64 at the time) and she was exhibiting pronounced odd behaviors and executive functioning/memory issues during the aftermath of his death. At the time her kids attributed it to grief and stress. We now suspect that her symptoms started much earlier and that they both (FIL and MIL) took steps to minimize or hide them. So it’s possible that she would have been an early onset diagnosis but we don’t know for sure. 

She sold their home without any plans for her living situation. She moved in with her daughter but they have never had a great relationship and it caused her significant stress and depression. So she moved in with us. It became apparent to us very quickly that she should not be living alone without assistance. We are a young family, our first child is 19 months and we do plan to have more. She has now been living with us for a year. During the year she’s been here we have managed to confront the deficits in her functioning. She went to primary care first, where she scored an 11/30 (I believe) on the memory screener. She went back 6 months later and did just as poorly. She was referred to the senior health and memory center. Her initial appointment was with a social worker, they gave her the test again and she did worse. Her next appointment was with the geriatrician 2 months later and she took it again and scored a 7/30. They were very concerned as she was a teacher with a master’s degree, although she also wasn’t trying very hard and she gets very angry and distressed during those tests. They asked for a CT scan to rule out stroke or tumors and it was normal. They then asked for a paper and pencil memory test. The accumulation of appointments (Gyno, primary care, routine screenings, etc.) really got to her and she refused the test and any more appointments. She began saying that she cared for her mother with Alz, that the memory tests are demeaning and degrading, that there is nothing they can do for her, and that she will not spend her remaining time going to endless appointments. They closed her referral and to my knowledge never officially diagnosed her.

When all of this was happening, we decided as a family that she could live with us permanently. She is fine money-wise, so she contributed half the cost and we are building a new home where she has a bedroom and bath on the entry level. We move in July. She is able to pay privately for some in-home assistance if/when we need it. We have set up her PoA for medical and financial, set up a trust for her kids. Right now she is doing okay. Her physical health is great. She can still handle her hygiene needs, her appetite is okay, she doesn’t wander or hallucinate. I work from home so I am with her at all times. She does drink wine every night (1-2 glasses) after we go upstairs to bed and she gets extremely defensive and depressed when we suggest she should reduce her intake. We are trying to walk the line of giving her autonomy and when to step in and control things. 

I am just so worried about keeping our children, and her, safe and happy as this progresses. She wants so badly to spend her last years around family and her grandkids. She loves playing with my son. I just don’t want her to put anyone’s safety at risk, I don’t want to cause my kids unnecessary distress, and I want her to feel comfortable. But I don’t know what the next steps are. Am I overthinking this too soon?"
"My grandmother who’s 87 was been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s many years ago, I never actually knew my grandma. I never felt the connection that grandmother and granddaughters would normally share, I never knew what she was like before her Alzheimer’s set it. All I knew is that she was a very distant woman with her family and never contacted them unless she needed money. I never learned to love my grandma. Fast forward to todays timeline, my grandmas Alzheimer’s has gotten worse. I have many uncles and aunts, out of my 4 aunts only 1 has been able to take care of my grandma for about a year until she got fed up and now my grandma bounces houses between my uncle and dad. This of course confuses my grandma even more. The neurologist tells them it’s unhealthy for her to change houses every 2 weeks but my uncle and dad are very stubborn. But what hurts me the most is to see my mom struggle with grandmother. My dad hardly if ever lends a helping hand, I try to help to my best of abilities but I can only do so much. My dad pokes at my grandma to make her upset sometimes because he finds it amusing and the one who has to deal with it is my mom. My moms mental health has declined so much. This morning I woke up to find her with red eyes, I knew she was crying at night. I know my mom doesn’t want to take care of my grandmother. My dad obviously doesn’t care enough to notice. He tells my mom that he’s fed up with her for not wanting to take care of her mother-in-law. My dad can’t comprehend that my mom isn’t cut out to take care of someone with such a disease. My grandmother isn’t friendly either the other day she was claiming to everyone that she hasn’t eaten and proceeded to hit my mom once she was told she had just ate. And my dad? No where to be seen to put the situation at ease, the only one that can really calm her is my dad. And when my dad gets fed up with her he yells and throws a tantrum, but my mom? God forbid if my dad ever sees my mom frustrated with my grandma. My mom was diagnosed with depression not a few weeks ago and I don’t know what to do or say or how to help. I just don’t know anymore. Everyday it’s the same my grandma would pee on the floor overnight only for my mom to find it and clean it up in the morning, bickering between my grandma over whether or not she ate, she’s constantly checking everything to find something, everyday something goes missing because my grandma will hide it, we can’t take my grandma anywhere because she has a habit of stealing or calling people mean things. I hate all of this"
"She’s finally at her apartment as we reference it. It’s brand new but the company has a great reputation. It couldn’t have happened at a better time too. Due to the stress and progression, she has started to hallucinate. Her speech has gotten significantly worse and she’s forgetting the people she sees daily. 

I love her so much and I hope that this week she has a few good moments. It’s going to be a hard transition for sure but I’m grateful for the place she found. 

What I’m even more grateful for her is that since she is one of the first people to move to that unit, they exempted her from the “move in” fee. I found out that that’s normal but at her place it would’ve been $6,000. 

Looking forward to seeing her at the end of the month. Even with all the drama and family issues, I’m taking today to be proud of her from afar and hope she sleeps well."
"Hi All -- 

New here as it only occurred to me to look for a community on Reddit now. I'm in that place (that I've been for a long time) where it's all feeling so heavy, too heavy, and I'm alone. 

My mom had early onset FTD in her mid-40s and died at 59 (my age 10 onward). I'm the youngest of 3 and my 2 older sisters (both mid 40s) have early onset Alzheimers. One much worse than the other.

I live on the other side of the country from them all but my entire life is now thinking about this disease, either about my sisters or about my own potential to be next (yes, I know there are tests. I haven't decided what I'm going to do about that yet). 

I'm exhausted, I'm angry, I'm sad, and I wish I had support + people who understood the heaviness. 

Thank you for letting me have this moment to share and I promise to read your many posts before mine and give thoughts and encouragement."
I'm scared that I'm going to get it. I don't want to forget my life. How do I prevent myself from getting this?
"My MIL was diagnosed over 6 years ago. It's been a slow progression, buthas now reached a place where she can no longer be taken care of in a safe way 24/7. My wife and SIL decided that memory-care was the best option.

Does anybody have any advice on how to manage the transition? She's on the waiting list and realistically that could be months before she moves in. Based on past experiences, is there anything we can do to help prepare for the move? Any way to make that transition easier?

Thank you!"
i found out today that my grandpa has Alzheimer’s and its really shocking and i dont know how to react my dad is not taking it that well and i don’t blame him. the only thing that keeps coming in my head is that he’s going to forget me and everyone else and i just dont know how to feel right now is there any advice that you guys can give me on how to deal with this and be there for my family
"My moms case has been fairly slow in progression for the previous 5 years but has started to ramp up since 2020. I haven’t yet decided if that’s a blessing or a curse.  She is 84 so hopefully old age takes her faster than the disease. My 85yo dad is her caretaker or should I say gatekeeper.  He needs support to continue to manage her but ultimately he lets her make the decisions. She needs reassessment but …. “I don’t want to push her” “She said no” “She changed her mind.”

She wanders the house all day rearranging things: “I’m downsizing” She hoardes food in her room, makes grocery lists - and yet there are 8 containers {48in total} of Costco muffins in the freezer. Why? Because she insists on sending my dad - who will do anything to please her- out into the world. I’m certain he enjoys getting away to some extent.  Who wouldn’t, but often returns to petulance…. “I was dressed and waiting at the door, calling, why didn’t you wait?” (never true.) Did I mention he has End Stage COPD and a pacemaker?  In a pandemic. 

She’s hidden all of the family’s generational jewelry, gawd knows where. 7 days ago she soiled her pants and tho she still had the presence of mind to change, she has hidden them in her room. To that end, I’ve never seen her wash her own clothes (they smell of course) but washes dad’s compulsively.  

She is incredibly possessive of her role as a (barely capable) homemaker. She mistreats anyone (me) who tries to help after watching her struggle for 3 hours in making grilled cheese sandwiches.  She has taken to drying linen tea towels in the oven as it ‘cools 😮 I made dad buy a fire extinguisher but it’s still in its original packaging… in the car… 3 months later… in no danger of being useful if needed. Why? Because “mom won’t like it.” With his COPD he couldn’t get to it in time or he’d collapse trying. Can I have a ‘WTF’ here? 

She is incredibly possessive of my father and has jealously threatened him that it’s either her or the cat. She doesn’t care if we (herself included) starve until dinner but if I prep a breakfast or lunch for dad and I, she petulantly exclaims that she was going to surprise him with xyz meal (not so)

What I didn’t anticipate was the way I’d resent this angry, mean, manipulative, paranoid woman who has snatched my mom’s body and taken the family hostage.

I feel terrible for complaining but I’m basically her punching bag & it hurts. 

Vent over 

Edited for spelling."

"I've lived with my grandma my whole life (33 years). She always gave me food, shelter, and even helped pay for college. We are a poor family and I'm the first to get a bachelors in my family thanks to her. We've lived in this trailer since I was 1 year old. These days she acts like she's in another world, she cries frequently, she can't form sentences, she obsessively picks at the carpet, she's forgotten her husband (died 1996) and parents and me, and she requires assistance with everything.

Today when I finished feeding her, I asked if she remembers all the times she said ""I had the best grandma"". She said ""yes"". I told her that ""I think I have the best grandma"". I told her how much I appreciate everything she's done for me in her lifetime and that I love her, and I already miss her so much. Her response was half of an incoherent sentence before she took a bite using her invisible spoon. I told her I would go get her some ice-cream.

I went to the kitchen and bawled my eyes out and still as I type this. I was a robotic, monotone, and mildly autistic person my whole life so being vulnerable is difficult for me. I don't even know why I'm typing this, I guess I just want to hear what everyone has to say and maybe hear some relevant experiences."
"Hello all, I’m sorry if this is the wrong place to post. Would appreciate a redirection if so. 

I’m a bit concerned for my mother, 57, but I’m not sure if if my concern is misplaced. I don’t live near her, I’ve come to town for a visit. I’ve only spent a couple hours with her so far.  

1. I asked if she could take me to a dental appointment (I know, weird because I’m visiting, long story). I asked her this over text, she understood, she used the phrase dental appointment. She picked me up, but when she arrived she was shocked to be driving to the dentist, she genuinely thought I was heading to an interview. 

2. I asked her to remind me of my sisters street address, she couldn’t remember the street name. She was absolutely distraught that she couldn’t remember. She seemed like she was about to cry. 

3. She said, spontaneously, sometimes she tries to think and it’s like there’s some block. She can’t remember things or understand things. And again, seemed distraught. 

4. She misremembered a conversation we had, but at the time she did not seem confused. She asked if I had my own car insurance, I told her I did. Two days later, she tells me she’s concerned because, she found out I’m not on their insurance, when I had, according to her, told her I was. 

Now, she’s been sending rambling scatterbrained texts for some time. But I assumed that was just a ‘boomer using technology’ thing (sorry if this offends). But after these 4 events that, again, occurred just in the past couple days over a few hours, I’m deeply suspicious there’s something going on. Is this enough to insist on a trip to a neurologist? I’m not sure I trust her to remember to bring it up with family doctor."
"My grandmother has Alzheimer’s and I live with her and my mother. In the begging I though it would be the sad story we know regarding the disease. She would forget everything and everyone and it would be really painful. But thank god she didn’t forget everybody, but she forgets everything and asks the same thing over and over again and it is driving me crazy! She doesn’t like to do anything! We try so hard to make her do any activity so she at least exercise her brain. Activities like painting, reading, playing games, watching tv but she does it for some minutes and stop and choose to look at the wall and DO NOTHING! And she asks the same thing more than 10 times in less than 3 minutes. I don’t know what to do. I love her so much but every time she starts to ask the same thing repeatedly I get really annoyed and I feel bad for that. I don’t want to be mad at her or be rude to her. I know it’s not her fault she can’t remember things but it is in fact extremely annoying. Do you have any advices on how to not get annoyed by it and what can I do to make her do something, like what activities do you guys recommend?"
"Today marks one whole year since I quietly moved my mom in with me, a literal blink of an eye decision after her third doctor’s appointment as we were starting to explore her cognitive decline at the end of 2020. An appointment where I had been given the response to a decision that I had been needing to make, but knew that no one but myself would actually be able to make that decision; the response given by her new doctor to me with nothing more than a firm, but sympathetic look in the eye. It was truly unspoken. My life has changed dramatically fast this past year, and I’m honestly still spinning in a daze of surreality and grief. Some things I’d like to share that I was in no way prepared for when starting on the last journey that I ever expected, nor would I have ever wanted to be on:


The way she has become fixated with things like constantly pulling her socks up to her knees or pulling her shirt down over her knees while she’s sitting. Or when she’s not pulling her socks up as high as she can, she’s taking them off and wearing them on her hands like a sock puppet. Or how she constantly has to hold the shirt or jacket she's wearing from the bottom like she's carrying a security blanket when we're out and about.


The way she started sucking on her fingers and how that turned into full on thumb sucking for comfort just in the past couple of months and weeks. Or just how talking to her in general sounds and feels like dealing with a child. Coming from someone who loves and is really good with children, having to treat your mother like a child, and being in a ""child has become the parent"" scenario is brutal beyond belief. I have no one to take care of me the way a mother should anymore, and I supremely envy those who still have perfectly self sufficient and capable parents.


The way I have to take things away from her, like the cap to a drinkable yogurt bottle, so that she doesn’t put things that don't belong in her mouth.


The way she has become so possessive. If I pick up or move anything, even if it’s so simple as taking her clothes out of her dresser to get her dressed for the day, “that’s mine!”


The way I have to plan my entire day around her, and the fact that she now has a strict 8:30 pm bedtime that I enforce religiously just so I can have some time to myself before I need to go to sleep. Or the way I truly feel like there aren’t enough hours in the day for things she needs, I need, or someone else needs. Or the way she showers once a week now, because I do not have the energy to do more than that, and she doesn't want to. I’m lucky if I can shower every other day. Or the way I have had to decline opportunities to do fun things with friends because I have to be mindful of her needs or the fact I don’t have anyone who can watch her for me, and she can't be left alone. 


The way I’ve made decisions on her behalf in general, like her bedtime, not being able to drive or work anymore, taking her phone away from her, selling her car, donating things we have no room for that she's had forever but doesn't need, and the way she resented me for every bit of it at the beginning as if I had completely betrayed her. 


The way I basically have to carry a diaper bag and a change of clothes for us to go somewhere for the day.


The way I constantly have to repeat myself for something as simple as directing her take off her shoes when we get home, or telling her to put her shoes on, but she’s got one on her foot and her hand in the other. Or how when I’m getting her dressed and say “put your leg in,” I’m constantly having to try to get her to understand that usually the leg I need her to put in, is not the one she has already put in. Or the way when I’m trying to get her to take off her pants to change her, it’s a good two or three or more attempts of her pulling them back up after I’ve pulled them down before I can actually get them off of her. Or how she’ll say “okay” in the most annoyed tone as if she’s already doing what I’m asking her to do, but hasn’t budged an inch.


The way I have had to put my hand in places and clean things I'd rather not.


The way that she will act as if something right in front of her is completely lost and out of sight. “Get in bed, please” or ""put your shoes on"" (that I have set right in front of her) becomes “I don’t know where it is.”


The way she will wander around the room moving things around for no reason, or does things like taking her clothes out of the dresser, or the drawers out of her nightstand, pictures out of frames, or pull the blankets up from the bottom of the bed while she's laying in it, for reasons completely unknown to her.


The way she blames everything she does (that she shouldn't be doing) on the unnamed figures she hallucinates in our home, because “they did it,” or “they told me to,” or the way she blames not having done something that she used to do with ease claiming that “no one ever told me.”


The way she’ll ask me where her parents are, and they’ve been dead for decades, or the way she calls me “mom” as if she genuinely means it. 


The way she throws a tantrum and can’t find her words like an exasperated two year old who hasn’t even learned all of their words yet. Or the anguish in her voice when she says things like ""I'd rather die,"" ""I'm going to die,"" etc., when I've asked her to stop doing something or when she is just genuinely upset for reasons unknown to both of us.


The way I read emails from daycare as if I were reading a progress report about a child. “She has a new friend named Sharon, who she is very compatible with.” Or, ""we need more diapers for her locker.""


The way that I have had to keep things in the kitchen out of reach to avoid things like cookies having bites taken out of them and being put back into the container, or a whole bunch of bananas bought the night before meant to last the week, demolished and consumed (or in that one case, half under her bed and the other half on top of the toilet tank) within 30 minutes like she’s never seen them before.


The way I had to childproof my deadbolt locks and door knobs to keep her inside and safe.


The way I got so emotional on the phone with the phone company representative and afterwards, over canceling her cell phone plan and losing the number she's had for 20 years because there's no point in keeping it if she doesn't know how to use her phone anymore, and she gets more spam calls and texts than anything else.


The way I thought friends of hers we would be able to count on, who said they would be around for her or at least call to check on and keep in touch with her, very quickly faded into oblivion as if they never existed and without a word, but occasionally will send the thoughts and well wishes that I have no use for. The unofficial goodbyes that she never got to have and were taken away from her while she still had the chance to have somewhat clear and concise conversations. She was and is so lonely. I hear ""no one likes me,"" ""no one wants me,"" ""I have no one,"" more often than I want to.


The way I miss my mommy, who is right in front of me nearly 24/7, but is a completely different person. The one person who I never wanted to imagine life without, and thought I'd have around as we both got older, but who I now pray for relief for and from, so that we are both at peace in different ways.


The way hugs became an act that make me cry instantly, because they’re not hugs from who I want them to be from. They’re lifeless, like I can truly feel the energy and bond we shared for so long between us is gone.


The way she tells me she likes me instead of she loves me. I was prepared for her to eventually forget me, but I was not prepared for it to happen as fast as it did, within 6 months of her moving in. Or the way she doesn’t associate me as being the little girl in our old family photos, that little girl is *her* shady-pines-ma. Or especially the way she knows who my cousin and her young children are, but not her own child. I know I was loved so much, I know how much the real her loves me, but it doesn't hurt any less.


The way I became someone who takes hours or days to respond to messages like it truly is the bare minimum I actually can do.


The way I came to understand the type of depression where you just don’t want to get out of bed for the day, where things that used to bring joy brought stress and felt like a chore, like decorating for holidays and seasons. Last year was the first year that I didn’t decorate for anything, and it made me so sad, but I couldn't do it. Or how I have no desire to do anything related to my less than two year old small business that I was so proud of and put so much work into, launching at the start of the pandemic no less. Or the way things that are actually chores that I had no trouble with maintaining a fairly regular schedule for became unbearably overwhelming; like dishes and laundry or mopping the kitchen floor.


The way that I have felt the anger and grief that quickly started to fill my mind, body, heart and soul faster than I could release it; like being trapped in falling sand in an hourglass, become something that makes me fear for my own physical health. Or the way that I have let words spit off of my tongue like hot venom with the intention to maim because I can’t hold them in, knowing full well it’s her Alzheimer’s I truly hate with a passion, not her, and the guilt I’ll forever carry that comes afterwards for not holding them in.


The way I have started to dread people asking me how I’m doing because I usually have nothing good, positive, or worthwhile to share. It’s always just a big pile of sadness. Or the way some people will ask how she’s doing, and not ask how I’m doing. It’s very contradictory, and I hate it.


The way I internally reject compliments or words of encouragement for taking care of her as if I really had a choice. I know I had a choice, but I also know that I don’t think I could have lived with myself if I chose to abandon her. And believe me, I contemplated it in the beginning. I feel like an indentured servant, and according to filial law, I kind of am.


The way that I feel like I haven't and will not have done my best at making the last memories my mom could retain, good ones, after everything she has ever done for me.


I wasn’t prepared for the long goodbye and I wasn't prepared for the different goodbyes to happen so soon.


If you read all of this, thanks. If you’re going through this or have gone through this, my heart goes out to you. If you’ve never gone through this, I truly, from the bottom of my heart hope you never have to. This is the cruelest existence I never thought I’d be living in, and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone."
"Apologies if this ends up being a huge wall of text, but I've recently been facing the reality that something serious is going on with my mom.. and I just need to vent and get this off my chest. She's 70 years old and in decent health and I can't say for certain what exactly is wrong with her, but I'm fearing the worst.

I was at dinner with my parents the other night, and she mentioned that she was having trouble sleeping because there's man in the next door apartment that's been yelling and screaming. My mom has always been sensitive/annoyed to sound disturbances (some very valid, others perhaps a bit exaggerated) - so initially nothing seemed too out of the norm. But then my dad said he wasn't hearing these things (to which my mom offhandedly commented that my dad was just ""deaf""). He said they used a phone to try and record the sound - I listened to the recording and couldn't hear anything. She then went on to talk about how it was actually a man that was arguing with/abusing a woman. Apparently, she went down to the front desk and spoke with the super to complain, and they told her that he lived alone. She's now saying that the man is ""making up a woman's voice"" because he's crazy. When I ask her why we can't hear anything in the phone recording, she says ""well the sound isn't coming through the walls"" - and then when we counter with ""well if the sound isn't coming through the walls, how can you hear it?"".. she just, sort of avoids the question? Just repeats that ""this guy is totally psycho."" It's like logic isn't working at all on her. I spoke with my dad the next day to honestly ask what he thinks (he is a very logical, smart guy with a good head on his shoulders), and he confirmed she is experiencing auditory hallucinations.

My dad also told me she has started double locking the door to the apartment because she's afraid he might break in. It's horrible to know she actually is in fear.

She completely believes these hallucinations are real (which I understand), and at even the slight suggestion they might not be, she completely shuts us down. I asked her ""when was the last time you spoke with a therapist?"" (she has a history of depression) and she said ""don't even go there"" - as she knew what I was implying.

Before continuing, I do want to say we have reached out to her doctor. The doctor is planning to give her a call which my mom surprisingly seems receptive to. I suppose what happens after that conversation remains to be seen.

What concerns me beyond this is other little cognitive/personality changes I've noticed creeping up the past few years. My dad also mentioned a few things he's been noticing as well.

The big thing I've noticed, is having a conversation with her is sometimes a bit odd and difficult. She changes the subject frequently, interrupts us in the middle of talking (to yet again change the subject) - and sometimes we have to ask her a question multiple times before she answers (she'll respond to the question by sort of repeating things she recently said, but EVENTUALLY will answer). For example - my dad said he asked her when her doctor's appointment was. He had to repeat himself a few times because initially she wasn't giving him a direct response. But after a few times of my dad asking very directly, she was able to tell him. She didn't *forget* the date, but it's as though we had to get her to *really* focus on what we were asking, as though she wasn't paying attention. It's almost as though she just can't hold her focus on a single train of thought for long. Or she's talking and not really paying attention to us sometimes. It's almost like you can sense some sort of agitation and restlessness from her. She constantly has to get up to do things like she can't sit still. She's never been a particularly patient person, and has always been a big talker, but this lack of ability to focus during conversations is definitely out of the norm.

She's always been a light sleeper but my dad says it seems like she's waking up a lot during the night. He says when he gets up to use the bathroom he'll see her glued to her phone. She recently sent me a text at 3am to confirm dinner plans.

She seems to have lost a bit of her social filter. Like she doesn't grasp certain social tact and norms. My mom has always been eccentric, a big personality, chatty brooklyn gal that people sometimes find abrasive - but my dad said when they go on her walks she goes up to strangers multiple times to make small talk. She's always very nice (she's never rude or weird), but it's odd and not really in line with NYC social etiquette. We went out to dinner once and she decided to strike up a conversation with the people at the table next to us. These are things she used to not do because she understood that isn't really appropriate.

My dad said she's becoming very aggressive in her driving, to the point he refuses to ride as a passenger with her anymore. Again, she's a brooklyn gal and has always been one to honk, sometimes flip the bird or mutter profanities. But my dad said recently a guy cut her off, and she followed him for a bit just to pull up next to him so she could roll down the window and scream at him. That's very extreme for her.

My dad says that when they watch TV together she's often on her phone and will ask him to explain what's going on in the plot. I don't think it's because she can't *comprehend* what's happening, but she's on her phone because she just cannot concentrate for long periods of time, so she misses what's happening in the TV show.

Nothing really stands out in terms of dramatic memory loss, but she does like to have the same topics of conversation when I see her (which is about every 2 weeks), and will repeat things she's told me before. Not within the same evening, but she'll say things like ""You know your uncle is coming for passover"" (and she's told me this the last few times I saw her). Maybe she feels like she needs to remind me. Or she'll tell me stories she's told me before, show me things I've already seen. And I can't tell if it's because she's *actually* forgotten she's done these things, or if it's just things she likes talking about and is excited when she shares them with me. She's been really fixated on her father's death (he passed away decades ago) and the circumstances surrounding it (he didn't want to see her as he was dying) and it's almost like she's processing this grief all over again. I got a random text from her out of the blue that said ""your grandfather took his own life because he couldn't stand the pain."" (Which she has told me multiple times).

But she's still capable and independent. She recently read a book I got her. She uses photoshop on her computer. She drives to her studio each day to make art. She still posts on social media, uses her e-mail, her phone and can have conversations about complex topics (even if she can't stay on the subject for long). She still has passion and hobbies and things she enjoys doing. She can whip up a good cheese plate. She seems in good spirits when I see her, although sometimes she can get easily agitated.

All of these little things have had me suspicious and unsure for awhile (like, is she just getting old?), but the auditory hallucinations feel like the final nail in the coffin. Her mother had vascular dementia and I've read conflicting information if there's a genetic link. One of my biggest fears has been my mom getting alzheimer's or dementia, and I'm in shock that it actually might be happening.

I'm worried I just won't be able to keep it together around her. That eventually I might break down in front of her and upset her. The idea of having to stay strong for someone who forgets who you are seems impossible. I'm afraid one day maybe she'll get so angry she'll say horrible things to me. I worry that she might eventually understand what's happening to her and become terrified. I worry maybe she'll refuse to accept what's happening, will refuse to accept my help and refuse to accept the care she needs.

I know I'm probably getting ahead of myself and need to wait on what the doctor says, but I can't help feeling like I need to start preparing myself emotionally. Sorry - this definitely turned out to be a bit of a novel."
"How important is diet in mid-stage dementia/Alzheimers?

My uncle, 78, is firmly in the mid-stage of dementia/Alzheimers. My mom, 75, is his primary caretaker. Her biggest concern: that he’s not eating properly. Though he gets (and eats) meals on wheels usually twice a day, he also buys packages of cookies and chocolate. He’ll eat a whole package in a day or two.

I understand how important a good diet is when you’re young and healthy, but does eating this much sugar at this stage/condition in life have a huge negative effect?"
"Does anyone have a getting lost plan? It happened to a loved one recently and never want to experience that again.

"My wife has been diagnosed with early onset (PCA) and can no longer drive. Her symptoms are still fairly mild, I think, but the problem is she’s stuck at home while I work and basically sits on the couch listening to NPR and dwells on not being able to do anything. She does laundry and dishes but has nothing to stimulate her mind once those are done. She’s never been an artist so she doesn’t want to draw or anything like that. Does anyone have any suggestions for us that may be helpful?

Update: I really appreciate all the responses. We will probably explore volunteering at the senior center or animal shelter. I also plan to get her an Apple Watch so she can walk around the neighborhood and I can see where she is."

"I'm just wondering (as the title suggests) how everyone else deals with their anger over this illness and the ongoing process of grieving a loved one who is still alive?

My mum's in a care home now and doesn't recognise any of her loved ones, even just as people she knows. She's not herself anymore. She's not my mum anymore. 

Even though I don't have the stress and responsibility of caring for her anymore, I'm finding that my mental health is quite probably the lowest it's ever been. Visiting her is taking a toll on me. I used to try weekly but after a succession of bad visits, I don't think I can keep that up any longer so I'm going to aim for visiting every 2 weeks. I feel awful about that, even though I know I shouldn't because it's important to keep myself mentally healthy, I can't help but feel guilty. 

Anyway, I've been feeling so much anger building up inside me, just at the unfairness of the whole damn thing (I know, I know, the world's not a fair place). My mum's so young, she's only 64, and I feel like I've missed out on getting to know her as an adult. She was diagnosed when I was in my early twenties and I feel like I've missed out on that crucial part of a parent/child relationship where you start getting to know them as an equal, as a fellow adult, rather than just ""mum"" or ""dad"".

I'm so, so angry and sad all the time, and I have no idea how to get on with normal, every day life whilst feeling like this. How does everyone else manage these feelings?"
"i’ve had a neighbor who lives in my building who has never been friendly, when i first introduced myself she purposefully ignored me. i continue to say hi and leave it at that when i see her, but she never says anything. the other day my partner and i discovered she has alzheimer’s or dementia, after an episode where we ended up having to contact our old neighbor, who is her daughter. obviously i don’t want to see this lady get hurt, or put herself in a dangerous situation, so if i notice anything i will continue to contact her daughter. however i’m curious if i just shouldn’t continue to say hello to her? i don’t want to scare her or confuse her further, but prior to this incident i just assumed she was rude or didn’t like me and i was just trying to be kind and approachable."
"Dad has been terrible with sleeping for the last year, my mom and sister are at their wits end because no one is sleeping anymore.  He is so restless and wants to go to the bathroom all night (he also wears a diaper constantly). He was diagnosed 6 years ago in his late 60s.  My sister was wondering if CBD oil made for sleep assistance would help.  Anyone try this?  We are trying to get him into hospice, but he is getting the run around from the VA.  They have tried melatonin gummies.  Any advice would be great!"
"I have APOE2/4 genotype (https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Gs270) and I'm having trouble finding information on the risk of this genotype because APOE2 is rare and known to be very protective, but APOE4 is well known to increase risk of Alzheimer's. So what is the relative risk of the 2/4 genotype? Does one or the other dominate in this scenario? Is it unknown? I'd love to hear any research anyone has to share.

I know APOE genotype is just one risk factor. I am fit, healthy, don't drink or smoke, eat a relatively low sugar/low carb diet and get a lot of exercise. I'm not sure if any of my family would have gotten Alzheimer's because most of them died earlier in life from other factors (smoking, dangerous life, whatever). This is more of a question out of curiosity."
"Has anyone had the experience of having a parent with Dementia/Alzheimer's become completely bedridden where they can no longer move their limbs? My mother started showing signs of dementia way back in 2006, and by late 2016 she was obviously at stage 7 (stage 6 about 3 years earlier). By 2018, I moved back home and quit my job, and lived on my savings and traded stocks on the side to care for her. Trying to preserve her estate while I'm the sole heir made more sense financially while I cared for her compared to paying outright for a memory are facility. Medicare and plan D supplemental insurance already covered the in home visits and care from nurses and her doctor. At this point she was wandering around the house in circles mumbling and completely oblivious to her own surrounding not even realizing she was in her own house.

At the end of that year she forgot who I was being her only son (44 years old at that point). Sometimes asking where I was when I was still at a baby age. She also asked for her own mom (my grandma) who passed away 40 years earlier. The following year was the worst, where she would have what seemed like schizophrenic episodes where she would get violently angry and scream at us, a housekeeper we had, and curse at furniture, throw stuff across the room or turn a room into a complete mess with old mail, house decor, magazines, etc., sometimes after 2-4am when everyone was long asleep.

This carried on for about 18 months until the end of October 2020 when she suddenly lost her balance and could no longer walk. She would swing around the bed and changing her diaper was painstakingly hard. After the summer of last year her limbs became almost completely paralyzed and her body has been mostly motionless ever since. Diaper changes obviously became much easier at that point. We got a hospital bed after bed sores became an issue, and they did heal with help from the nurse. She mostly mumbles and calls out for my dad and ginger ale (her favorite drink). She is fed with sippy cups, baby food squeeze packs, and Ensure blended with protein powder and meds. She is very frail at this point and bedridden for 15 months now at age 87. She gets swelling in her arms and her face is developing nasty sores.

We never thought she would make it to 2022 including her own doctor, yet here we are (she was put on hospice in early 2020 and recently taken off for outliving the time limit). Has anyone else dealt with a case this extreme? I can't imagine how much longer she can live like this, it's absolutely awful and I wish this on no one, but here I am watching my mom rot away ever so slowly. I did some online research and it seems 2 1/2 years is longest it goes on like this but that usually includes stage 7 dementia which for her started well over 5 years ago. The doctor and nurse both told me in early November last year she only has about 2-3 months to live. Now they won't even say. Can anyone else out there relate to this? My mom told me decades ago she never wanted to live like this, but now it's not her choice anymore."
"My grandmother is 93 and was diagnosed many years ago. She's the strongest and kindest woman I ever knew, she was kicked from her home country in the 1948 war in Palestine and thrown into a refugee camp where her only option to survive as a woman was to marry my late grandfather who was an absolute dictator. She lovingly raised 11 bright children despite enduring so much horrible bullshit from my late grandfather. She's my idol and a symbol of strength and hope. 

It's been well over 10 years since she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, and has been suffering from late stage symptoms for a few years now. Nowadays she sleeps once every three days and medications only make it worse and cause more problems and she can't communicate her pains. When I think about it my heart breaks, it must be a pain worse than death to be in that state, and she fell and broke her hip a few months ago.

Despite her age and her condition, she's blessed with a curse which is good health, all her tests are good and she has no problems with her heart, liver, kidneys etc. The emotions I feel are extremely complex, I feel really guilty, even though I'm not her caregiver and now I barely see her because I study abroad, it has been a very long journey and I secretly wish she would just pass and be relieved, she endured so much bullshit while sane and now this! I don't know what to think or do anymore and I just want it to end. Is there something wrong with me?"
"My sister-in-law has early onset Alzheimer's. It runs in my wife's family, but only affects the women. Her grandmother, mother, and oldest sister died of the the disease and her next older sister is pretty far along. She is at the stage where she doesn't recognize her own home or her son but can still form thoughts about those things and wonder where they are.

She's staying with us for a week while her son is away for work. They live pretty far out in rural Canada and it's expensive for her son to hire in help while he's away (he's a geologist and frequently travels for  surveying) so we figured we'd have her with us while he does a job here in the States. (BTW, getting folks into a govt-subsidized facility in Canada involves years-long waiting lists) Plus, she's been having him call my wife frequently over the last months and saying how she wants to come visit.

My wife is doing her best to keep her engaged and keep her from becoming anxious but it is getting stressful. What is the best way to interact with someone who is repeatedly asking about the same things over and over? (who brought me here? how am I getting home? Is someone stealing my house? Can I drive home?)

Any help would be appreciated.

Edit: Thank you to those who are trying to help. It's been a stressful day. Probably for her as well because she's not in familiar surroundings. Her son has, unfortunately, had to cut his work trip short so that he can get her back home. We would take her but the documentation explaining her condition only references him so we can't get her across the border to get her back home.

We still have another two days with her so I will keep everyone's tips in mind. Thank you to all of you!  


Second edit: Well, she's with us for the full week now. The good thing is that, thanks to all of you, we've learned how to communicate to her in a way that keeps her from getting too anxious. We agree with her for a lot of stuff but redirect when it comes to her car, going home, or leaving. It has reduced the tension in the house but I can see where it would get extremely tiring to have to do long-term. Her son is due to return on Friday but have to wonder if that will actually happen as we are due for another winter storm Thursday that will definitely affect air travel.  


Again, thanks to everyone for their tips and stories. It has helped more than you know!"
"I take care of an alzheimer patient in her home. I work long LONG shifts(12-20hrs) of no sleep (cant trust her). Shes not a good person and was abusive to everyone her whole life. I only got hired on to help take care of her 3 years ago.


Anyway, im going to be vague (in case anyone i know is reading)


Its very normal for her to be combative,  physically and verbally. Sometimes everyday a week, sometimes once a week. Usually its for something silly like changing clothes or taking meds, in which we can just say ""okay!"" And try again in a few minutes/hours.


Last night there was a fire alarm in the building. We're 6 stories up. The fire alarm was LOUD and when it goes off, 3 alarms are sounding off in each apartment while flashing lights, and about 10 in the hallways of each floor. It was late so i knew it wasnt just ""testing the alarms"".


Things got CHAOTIC. she was so weak she couldnt walk with her walker, i had to run to get the wheelchair, even the 2.5 seconds i ran to get it, she fell against the wall. She was clawing me, kicking me, cussing me out, hitting me, refusing to get in the wheelchair yet she could hardly stand and definitely couldnt walk. I had to think fast and grab her a coat as its about 0° out(again, gone for mere seconds and she was getting up trying to run away), when i went to open the door she kicked it shut and held her feet against the door so i couldnt open it. The elevators were obviously shut down, so we had to go to the stairwell, the whole time she is putting all her might shoving her feet against the floor so i could barely push the wheelchair, all the while trying to claw my arms. She wasnt acting like an ""out of her mind batshit crazy person just rambling nonsense"" but just straight up fighting against me while telling me to ""get the fuck away, fuck off!"".  When we get to the stairwell, she is trying to escape (but again, was too weak to walk) so i had to hold her as firmly yet gently as i could to stay seated in the wheelchair, otherwise all it would take is her to fall foward and tumble down the stairs.


The stairwell smelled like burning so i definitely knew then it wasnt a drill.


It took around FIVE MINUTES to get her out of her apartment. From where she was sitting to the door was about 15 feet, and it took 5 minutes!!! All the while getting beat up on. This isnt inckuding the time it took to go down the hallway to the stairwell.


Luckily the fire was contained but my whole body was shaking out of stress and out of anger. If the building had actually been in more serious danger of a bigger fire, i am 100% confident we would have DIED because of her. I have a small child who needs his mom,  i dont deserve this shit. Even getting her from the stairway back to her apartment once it was deemed safe and the alarm was off (20 mins later of combating me in the stairwell) it took forever and more abuse getting her back and into bed. She was yelling obscenities at me telling me to ""get the fuck away"" while kicking me and dragging her feet. 


All we did was evacuate to the stairwell and stayed on the flat part that was connected to our floor. In NO WAY would i have been able to get her down the 6 flights of stairs had it been necessary for survival, as i am petite and she is so combative and too weak to walk.


Next time, i will not die for you. Im sorry i wont."
"My dad now needs round the clock care and has progressed drastically since having kidney issues. He’s running out of money and applying for Medicaid has been a bit of a nightmare because I didn’t control his finances until a bit after he was diagnosed. The things he was doing financially before that has been a nightmare to figure out. On top of dealing with that, I’m so stressed about actually finding a nursing home and putting him in there. He was in a rehab not long ago and it was absolutely awful. He lost over 20 pounds in three weeks and was getting sores from them not changing him properly. I’m so worried I’m going to choose a nursing home like this again. I live on the other side of the country and am his only family willing to look after him so I wouldn’t be able to go there all that often.

How do I deal with this? Is there any way to ensure I’m making the best decision?"
"Several scientific data show that psychedelics help increase cognitive performance. Two recent reviews strongly suggest that psychedelics would benefit Alzheimer's patients. In summary, microdosing would increase synaptic plasticity, generate new neurons and decrease the amount of beta-amyloid after microdosing. These structural changes would help to alleviate the deficiencies that this disease produces. The microdoses for psilocybin would be 15mg per 70kg. This would be about 1g of psychedelic mushroom, if 1% of its weight is the psilocybin compound. I hope it helps those who wish to have an alternative option to the conventional one.

Hey guys I think I'm gonna make a video about my dad who has early onset and just wanted some inspiration on some good questions to ask him so I can treasure his responses and have something to remember him by before its too late for him to remember any stories or be true to the answers he would typically give! So what would you ask your loved one?
"For background, I just moved to a new city for college. I have babysitting experience and was looking for something along those lines. I found this woman who was desperate for any type of help with her husband. At first the Alzheimer’s didn’t seem like a big deal to me, he was so sweet and had the basic needs of any old man. I thought things were getting better when I reintroduced music to his life, by trying to re-teach him ukulele, and seeing his world light up when I found songs he used to love that’d we’d sing together. He even remembered my name for the first time recently. Then the other week his wife told me that he had an “episode” and is now on another medication. And now, I just got a message from her saying he’s very sick… and not the kind that’s contagious. She would always tell me that he doesn’t have much longer and now I’m afraid it’s coming true. I just wish there was something I could do to help both of them."
" My grandfather in his 70s is now facing the problem of properly using a washroom its not that he cant use his reflexes its just that he does NOT want to enter toilet he wants to do wherever he wants . Its has become harder to force him and we dont hit him we try not even raise our voice ofc have a force with hand but to some extent we try our best to talk to him sweetly but we dont have our best days either we have life of our own too . He used to sit on toilet at first but these few months we are trying to make him atleast go to the washroom and pee while squatting (that's how he does no matter what) on floor and he does but now he's doesn't want to go in there at all we have to change his clothes two times a day lets not even talk about when he has to poop. There's is sudden rapid decline in his intrest to go to bathroom at all and we are not prepared for it at all he wants to do whatever he wants and he gets annoyed when we tell him what to do in best case ,in worse case he will hit. We cant use diapers too because he has a habit of taking off his trousers first ,we did try and as expected he it off.Anyone knows how to deal with this situation? any smaller suggestion helps alot . Also mind that this whole thing starts happening in few months"
"my grandmother has it, and every time my mother forgets something I get worried out of my mind she is developing it. Hell, sometimes when I forget something myself I get scared and I'm young. Does this happen to others a lot?"
"I have been wondering if my mother is developing Alzheimer's, the problem is that some of the symptoms are part of how she's always operated so I can't really tell the difference. Also, her increasingly severe memory loss has strongly contributed to behavior that fit symptoms.

One thing that has stood out to me recently is repetitive questions. Now the difference to what I've read as the typical presentation of this symptom, being repetitive in the moment, is that her repetition is with every new interaction. Almost like a script of questions she asks every time we speak, but she doesn't seem to realize or remember that her questions have been repeating or that she has gotten those answers. Historically my mother has a tendency to not pay strong attention to conversations and so often forget what people say (unless it's gossip), this is why it's hard to tell for me if this is a progression of a normal habit of hers or a symptom of something else. I just wondered if anyone can share if this type of repetition fits with the symptom or an expanded definition of it?"
"Hi guys, this is a long read so please bear with me. 

Tl;Dr: my moms showing progressive signs of memory loss and I’m looking for ways to help her. 

So for quite a while (5-ish years) I’ve (F28) noticed my moms (46 at the time) memory getting weak. It started innocently. She’d forget something I told her a week or two ago. Or forget something from her docs appointment. I’d point this out to her and she brush it off with a joke. If I persisted she’d get defensive and say it’s no big deal. I didn’t live with her at the time so I figured that we weren’t talking every day so it’s normal for her to not remember everything in my life. 
She also has hearing loss, requiring hearing aids, so I chalked it up to her not hearing properly. 

But then my father (54) who lives with her started noticing it. And became not just things we’d say but things through text. Arguments would ensue, her insisting we didn’t tell her only for us to pull up the text she acknowledged. And then she’d get defensive. But it was always non-important things. Like telling her when I’d becoming for a visit and such. 

It’s slowly been getting worse, and now I’m noticing that she’s forgetting more recent things (I also live at home now, and she’s now 51) For instance yesterday she was trying to tell me something she saw on the news 1hr earlier and forgot most of the story. She now acknowledges that she does have a memory problem, but doesn’t know what to do. She doesn’t feel that her doctor takes this stuff seriously, and there are some days where her memory is great. 

There appears to be no long term memory loss. It’s just short term memory or creating new memories. She has recently started a new job in an office where she has a lot to learn, so I’m not sure if that’s affecting her. 

She’s constantly doing things to “exercise” her brain, like crosswords, wheel of fortune and jeopardy. 

Is there anything I can do for her to stop this getting worse, other than trying to convince her to talk to a doctor? She’s open to supplements (like neuriva) but I’m not sure if that placebo or if it does help. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, with my line of work (health care) I’ve seen the bitter end of Alzheimer’s and dementia and is like to avoid or delay this as much as possible."
"This is what evil looks like. 

Last summer, with pressure from the Alzheimer's Association and against the recommendation of their advisory committee, the FDA approved Biogen's new Alzheimer's drug, Aduhelm. Besides not being effective (the drug has failed to significantly reduce AD symptoms in clinical trials), it is also accompanied by some very unpleasant side effects, and a price tag around $28,000/year. 

This has prompted a tremendous backlash from the scientific community, and earlier this month, CMS decided that it would not cover the cost of Aduhelm unless the patient is part of an ongoing clinical trial to test the drug. 

Well, Biogen (who is one of the Alzheimer's Association's biggest donors) stands to lose a LOT of profit on this decision, and the Alzheimer's Association is now pushing back against CMS. They claim that CMS's decision discriminates against all people with Alzheimer's disease, and especially against women, Black, and Hispanic people who are disproportionately affected by AD. 

I disagree. I think pushing a wildly expensive, ineffective drug on a vulnerable population that is desperate for ANYTHING that can help them is nothing short of predatory. Claiming that this CMS decision is discriminatory is absolutely shameful.

"Hi all.  I’m looking for a good neurologist / memory specialist / dementia specialist for my mom (76) in the Sarasota, FL area.  All my siblings and I live in the Midwest, so we need a doctor who could evaluate my mom and also one that is willing to do remote appointments so that we can “Zoom” into any appointments.

My mom is just having minor memory issues, but we have a history of Alzheimer’s in our family so we would like to get a baseline eval of where she is at.  Thanks for any recommendations!"
"My father has developed a behavior that is equal parts amusing, baffling, and frustrating.  It is the clothes he decides to wear.  Our whole life, our family has always gifted him clothes that will work together because fashion has never been his strong suit.  However, as his symptoms get worse, he doesn't wear things that fit or are even his.  He's taken to wearing my mom's clothes quite regularly.  Not anything obviously feminine (he's not living out his dream of cross dressing) but rather her jeans.  They're 4 inches too short and her shirts are way too tight, but he wears them as well.  The family finds this part amusing.  The other day he put on his grand daughter's yoga pants that were left at his house.  She's 11 years old.  I'd call this part baffling and is an image no one wants in their head.  Then recently he found a bag of clothes left in the woods by, presumably, a homeless person.  He acted as if he found treasure.  He washed and cleaned these clothes (they were way way too big) then tied them on with rope and shoe string so they'd stay up and wouldn't fall off.  He only wore these for a few days, until we disappeared them.  They were just too out there for anyone encountering to treat him with dignity and we felt the need to protect his dignity.  On Wednesday, we had a speaker at our church's men's group.  The speaker had a hat that he put on a table.  My father picked up the hat and wore it home.  Fortunately my father left his coat at church so he and the speaker were able to make a swap (coat for hat) and my dad felt like he got a great deal out of the event.

Anyway, this is just so strange that I can't wrap my brain around it.  I try to hard to laugh and have fun with the things that are harmless, but as this behavior amplifies it is just sadder and sadder.

Anyone else's loved one have a favorite outfit that they found in the woods?"
"My mom (72/F, divorced) is approaching the stage at which we’ll need to consider memory care within the next few years. And while I’m aware of spending down for Medicaid, I have no idea how this would be possible given that her federal retirement income is nearly $6,000/month (increasing 2-5% every year for cost of living) and she has nearly $400k in assets (two homes and many acres of land) that she planned for me to inherit after her death (“bye, bye” to that). That said, because she’s coasted on her high retirement income, she has nothing in savings, and the homes/land aren’t exactly liquid.

Given these considerations, would we be better off getting her into private memory care and using whatever money we get from selling her homes/property to cover any costs over $6k/month? Or should we just try to somehow spend down so she can qualify for Medicaid?

My husband and I do pretty well combined, but between my $100k student debt and nonprofit salary, we don’t make enough to meaningfully supplement her care without eventually going bankrupt."
"The burn out has become greater. Grandma's volity was gotten worse. 

Her mood swings have gotten worse, a few months ago we had to wean her off of trazodone which she had been one for 4 decades. Bc she was taking PM pills in the AM then sleeping all day, in the dark house so her body clock was completely warped. She picks out the Low dose Effexor from her case, bc thats not the right pill, and she thinks if she doesn't take it then she will met grandpa at the pearly gates faster. 

My mom stopped by to get her trash, she was still in the clothes she had on 4 days before hadn't bathed since. Ran out of pajamas and didn't bother to do her laundry which was piled in front of the washer. So she had been sleeping in those clothes too. Her excuse was well I wasn't going anywhere so I didn't see the point. *sigh* but you literally left 4 times to get something to eat. 

She refuses to allow us to have a home aid come in and do the cleaning she refuses to do. She gets super agitated if anyone remotely tries to clean.. Im a single parent working 2 jobs, my mom has 2 jobs. One uncle is pretty hands off, the other does what he can as the golden child. So the burnout is definitely affecting us mentally bc its like a 3rd job. 

We are inquiring to see if med management is possible for someone that's is living in the independent cottages on the nursing home property. Unfortunately she isn't to the level of needing the dicated dementia wing, and she would put up one hell of a fight if we got her a placement into the assisted living wing. Even though she would have weekly house keeping and a kitchenette. 

I'm about to tell my mom book her for the next available appt with her neurologist, and we are having a come to Jesus meeting. Bc something isn't working."
"I’m 36 and my dad is 77, he just started having memory issues. 
His life partner broke up with him and this is the first time he has lived alone. 
He has never been alone, he has always had someone to take care of him from his mother, to my mother, to me, to girlfriend to girlfriend to his ex. 
He still drives, he knows how to do basic living like showering and dressing himself but he struggles with cooking. He set the fire alarm off 3 times in his apartment so he isn’t allowed to use the stove anymore. He does not get technology or new things, he literally leaves his TV on because he is afraid he won’t be able to turn it back on. I bought him a tablet and he cannot figure it out. I have to fix his phone constantly.
I’m almost certain he may have a learning disability too with the way he struggles with learning new things but I’m not sure. He also went way too long without being able to hear properly, he has hearing aids now but I swear it’s like he still doesn’t pay attention. 
I get calls from people in town periodically stating that they saw my dad and he looked confused. I check on him and he denies this. 
I feel awful because I know he is too independent to want to accept a higher level of care and he wants to continue living his life like there are no issues such as going to Florida alone. He used to always go with his partner who would do the driving and I just am not comfortable having him go alone.
He just recently had me take over his finances because of his memory issues. He said he just forgets names and sometimes when things are happening. Like he misses doctors appointments so I have to have them tell me when it is. He still goes to them alone but I’m afraid he isn’t retaining what they are saying due to hearing and memory issues.

I’m feeling stressed and worried all the time. I’m in the prime of my career and I cannot afford to not work and stay with him and I also don’t want to make him feel like I’m taking away his independence 

Today when I told him I wasn’t comfortable with him going to Florida alone he got very upset and said he will do what he wants.

I have no siblings to help me and I hate to burden my husband.

I feel selfish and guilty all the time 
I’m hoping someone else understands this and maybe we can lean on each other?"
How on earth do people pay for this?  My mom has Alzheimers and she has 2 pensions and SS and still can't afford it.  Me and my sister aren't really in a position to help her either.  We both have kids and and households of our own.  This is so stressful!
"My dad will leave an empty pan burning on the stove top and walk away from it.

Lately it's been happening almost every day. Sometimes several times a day. We won't know until the smoke alarm goes off.

I already put child safety caps over three of the four stove top knobs. Just to prevent him from bumping into them and turning the gas on that way. Which was a problem. But we couldn't stop him from being able to cook for himself completely because he would throw a fit whenever we try to control him like that.

So how can we let him use the stove without killing us?"
"Hi guys,

I was wondering what medication or supplements someone you know with Alzheimers is taking, and have there been any noticeable improvements? I was looking at spermidine as a supplement to take for my father who's been diagnosed, but I'm wondering if anyone has used anything different that's made them better? 

Thanks in advance"
"Hello hello,

I am 29 from NYC. Writing at an ungodly hour as I cannot sleep, and thought this would be a good opportunity for my first Reddit post. 

My mom was recently diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's at 60. Needless to say, it was one of the saddest doctor's appointments I had ever been to - I was gutted. 

To make matters worse, two years ago I had done the 23andMe Health+, unwittingly opening pandora's box of genetic predispositions. Turns out I have 1 variant of the APOE4 Gene. 

My questions are below:

How did you cope with a parent's diagnosis at a young age?

How seriously do I need to take this APOE4 carrier status?

"I've made a post already on another sub going into detail. I'm just wondering how young you can get alzheiners, dementia or any other memory problems. Any advice is appreciated, thank you."
"The father of a really good friend of mine [23F] has Alzheimers, I don’t have any experience of family members with it or having it myself but I’d like to get her something that represents her father while he is still functioning well. It’s been really hard on her and I want to get something for her that might help. I’m sorry if this isn’t the place for this, please remove the post if it is disrespectful. Thank you in advance."
"I’m 20 and my mom (55) was diagnosed almost a year ago, but she’s been dealing with symptoms for 4 years now. I’ve become a mom to my mom, she comes to me for all her needs and wants or for a chat. I want to move out and have my own life though, I’m only 20. But I’m staying at home because I feel guilty, and I worry I would feel worse if I move.. what should I do?"
"If anyone is interested in potentially exciting new discoveries re AZ symptom mitigation please read on: I lost my mom to AZ a few years back and in the process I turned the internet upside down looking for solutions. It is too late for my mom but a lot of exciting stuff is going on right now focused on probiotics and the microbiome in Europe and Asia. We can see lots of converging evidence correlating consumption of B. Breve 03 or A1 with decrease in Mild Cognitive Disorder and mitigation of AZ symptoms. I am presently getting it sent from the UK by a friend, and the only thing I can say is that it definitely increases my energy and creativity.  Why is nobody selling this in the US? Oh, of course, it would drive the manufacturers of those scammy AZ pharmaceuticals out of business. You know, the ones that shift the MMSE by 2 to 3 points out of 30.

Anyway, these are the most relevant studies including wide ranging systematic reviews. They do not yet provide 100% proof of effectiveness but probiotics have very few serious side effects so what do we lose?

"How do you all deal with the mood swings and the guilt? I have days where I feel nothing at all, days where I almost forget the horror of this disease and feel normal, and days where I'm wracked with guilt about whether I could have done/be doing more, guilt from just wishing it was over? It feels like I can't talk to anyone about it, mom is dealing with it from a spouses pov, my brother chooses to just not think about it, my sister gets a ""pass"" for some reason. I'm always the one my mom calls, and I have my own family to deal with. What do you do to get through the days where it seems like anything makes you break down and want to give up?"
"I realize this is all part of the disease,  but my mother exhibits anger towards my father on a daily basis. He has less and less time to himself. 

I’m a young father who tries to balance everything and help both of my parents as much as possible. When I am not there, I am always thinking about their situation. 

She’s not in a position yet where she needs full time care, but it’s nearing the horizon. I feel horrible wishing that it would come sooner so that my dad can get a break. Can anyone relate to this experience? Does the pain ever go away?"
"I can't shake this gut feeling I have that my dad is at the end of his fight with Alzheimer's. He was diagnosed 8 years ago at 70 years old. Medications had worked for years to keep it low progressing. 

The past 3 years have been hospital stays and increasing falls. 3 of which have put him in the hospital/rehab. (Rehab took a toll and actually caused a broken hip requiring surgery) 

He is now barely there he has maybe 2 good days a week at best. 

My mom brought him back north to see his new grandson, his brothers, myself and siblings and basically our whole family saw him this year. They stayed with my husband and I. I haven't been able to shake this feeling that I'm going to get a call any day now saying he's passed away. Even though just yesterday my mom said he had a good day and hes in the background talking to me through the phone.

I literally can't shake it, I cry every day because I just feel it. I'm not sure how to handle this. Has anyone dealt with this feeling?"
"My dad has moderate to severe AZ, and this week has been rough. 

He’s been staying with my sister, but she and her husband work. I live hours away and can stay for the weekend, but I’ll need to return home on Sunday. 

Dad spent the evening in the ER. He need some assistance now. How are we supposed to pull this off so quickly? He went from bad to worse so quickly. 

What a mess all this is."
My dad was just diagnosed with Alzheimer's.  My mom also has a lot of health issues going on.  My sister and I are working with them the best we can.  I'm 2 hours away and my sister is 10hours away.  Has anyone found an app that is easy to use(technology is getting harder for both of them) that could be used to track what their meds and dosages are as well as all scheduled appointments?  I've thought about setting up a Google calendar that can be shared amongst us but not sure they will get it.
"My 82-year-old father was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and will be losing his licence in about a month. Him and I have a very difficult relationship. I have mental/cognitive / chronic pain /disability problems myself and I’m having trouble thinking and organizing this stage of his life. It’s on me and there isn’t much help from the state here in Canada. He doesn’t offer much input, either, except the myriad of supports he says he doesn’t want. He lives in an isolated community about ten hrs away and he can’t live with me. I have power of attorney and am currently sorting his bills and taxes out so we can apply for care homes. 

If there’s anything you could suggest as far as what we need to do to help him prepare or things to watch for with his property or finances or applications I really appreciate it."
"My 62 yo mom has been exhibiting symptoms of Alzheimer’s for several years now but she’s extremely reluctant to get professional help. Her dad recently passed away and his estate planning has been a real mess for his children. Because my mom now sees the value in having a plan in place early, I’d like to start the conversation about her own preferences when it comes to aging, death, etc. 

Question: does someone out there have a list of questions we can use as a guide for talking about hard-to-talk-about stuff? For example: 

1. If needed, do you have a preference for who you’d like to manage your finances/medical care/etc. (ie, who do want to manage your money and stuff?)

2. If needed, do you have a preference for the type of care you’d prefer if you ever get to the point where you cannot care for yourself? (Ie, is there a nursing home you have in mind or do you want to stay home no matter what if possible?)

3. When the time comes, do you have any preferences for when it comes to your funeral, burial, etc? 

There’s a lot missing here, but hopefully you get the gist of what I’m looking for. 

Lastly, any tips for having this conversation with loved ones? I know this isn’t dinner small talk but is it better to have a sit down discussion and hit as many questions as possible in one go? Or spread it out over time? I live in a different country so I plan wait til I’m with her in person but open to hearing others experience here."
"I recently moved in with my grandparents so they wouldn’t have to go into a nursing home. My grandpa has severe Alzheimer’s and dementia to the point where he can barely watch TV or do anything that requires more than 5 min worth of attention. I basically just play cards with him, do word searches and watch westerns and WW2 docs with him all day. Thing is he gets very antsy around 3 or 4pm everyday thinking he needs to go somewhere or do something. When I ask him what we need to do he just says “I don’t know” and gets angry. He loves to work. He unfortunately worked everyday for like 45 years and I believe his brain thinks he needs to go just out of habit. I am wondering if there are any jobs I could give him? What’s like a manly job he might enjoy doing?  Any suggestions are appreciated!"
"My Dad was diagnosed with vascular dementia about 6 years ago, and 4 years ago had the 'full blown' Alzheimers diagnosis. He was 62 at the time.  


Of course - this upended his life. He was a 767 pilot - and now he wasn't allowed to drive a car.  
As a result, he's medically signed off permanently. He claims benefits (he had no money, but we'll get onto that).  


He has a support team - they are excellent and I can't praise them highly enough.  


For various reasons he had to declare bankruptcy - again the support team were fantastic about that.  


Me and my younger brother are registered as Power of Attorney for him - something he was keen on. The majority of his stresses are financial, and we wanted to take that stress away from him.  


Bankruptcy - sorted. Benefit payments - sorted.  


Now, the spanner in the works - he forgot he had pensions. A letter comes through the door telling him he was a £38k pension waiting for him. I panic. If the benefits office find out about this, then they will stop his benefits.  


A helpful family friend helps my Dad by connecting him to his tax attorney - Dad now figures ""Hooray, I have £38k coming, I can start looking at a holiday, or buying some shiny new tech"" (he loves his tech).  


Meanwhile my brother and I are... concerned. He spends all sorts of money in some sort of black hole - we have no idea where it goes (though we're looking to rectify that now we have the LPA). The benefits aren't great, but we don't understand where his money is going. He's always short every month by ""a few hundred... can you loan me?"" and I always do, accepting it's not a loan.  


Also - yon family friend hasn't ACTUALLY ""sorted it"" like Dad seems to believe - he's expecting thousands of pounds to just end up in his account.  


I now have to be the ""bad guy"". It's his money and I'm not taking it away from him but I have to try and explain he's not suddenly going to ""rich"" - I'm going to try and ask him what he needs it for, how it potentially has to last for a few years yet.  


He's expecting to just have a load of money in his bank, and I'm going to have to be the one who says ""Look mate, that isn't happening like you think it's going to happen"".  


He's going to be upset with me - which is fine I can take it. But does anyone have some good advice around how I soften the blow a little bit?"
"Hi, 

My grandmother has had Alzheimer’s for around 2-3 years now. She’s my literal role model and the strongest person I’ve ever know in my life. She has gotten quite severe and im not sure how to communicate or conversate with her anymore because I don’t want to aggravate or annoy her. I was wondering if anyone has any tips and advice. Thank you all, and God bless you. Thanks"
"Hey guys,

I was just wondering if covid 19 makes Alzheimer's worse even after covid recovery? I was wondering if anyone has had any experience of a loved one with Alzheimer's, catching covid 19 and what the outcome was? 

Thanks guys,"
"After a living with Alzheimer’s for 3.5 years my 74 year old dad passed away peacefully on January 15th, 2022. I’m struggling with waves of sadness.. trying to stay busy but then having to lay down for an hour because I’m crying non stop. My Dad was my best friend and I thought I had more time with him, and it doesn’t feel real that I will never see him again. I am 24 and have no relationship with my mom and I’m just feeling so alone and sad."
"Hello, sadly my mom’s memory is going quickly. We are awaiting official diagnosis but early onset Alzheimer’s is here. He’s trapped in her head, he goes to store, she freaks cause he’s gone and she can’t remember where. Was thinking of one of those google home things. My thought is she could ask… “Where’s Bob?” And it would say he’s at appointment etc. is this possible with google calendar? Thanks"
"My girlfriend’s grandma has had alzheimers for 10 years with the last five plus years having no mobility or speach. Everyday she is cared for in such an incredible way that she manages to continue to survive. Her grandma can still manage to kinda swallow enough to eat and she still opens her eyes and makes completley incoherent mumbles but can sometimes make eye contact. She is now about 50lbs and she was 76lbs a year ago. Her circulation has been really bad lately and her feet were swollen, after medication the swelling is down but her toes are starting to turn black. My question is how do you know when the time is over? How and can you make the call to end suffering? Is she suffering? Are people with alzheimers understanding of their condition in regards to pain? Seems like a tough questions but everywhere on google says that she probably should have passed 8 years ago, but due to the immense ammount of care she recieves that hasnt been the case."

"Next weekend I’m going on holiday for three nights. First time being away from grandma since she was diagnosed 3/4 years ago. I seem to be writing overly extensive notes to the person who’s standing in for me. (Do “A” if she says this but “B” if she doesn’t unless “C” happens etc)…
Gran seems to perk up a bit when someone else is around. You can tell she tries harder to be “normal”.
So my question is. Should I give the person who is standing in all the notes and stick to the structure? Or do you think that tearing them them up and making grandma work a little harder for a few days with a different routine be better?

Edit: grammar."
"Hi, currently I have a grandma that is suffering from Alzheimer.

The progression has luckily been very slow, but it's starting to get to a serious point of day to day memory loss, no short term memory, confusing and mixing facts together.

We have a full time carer and mom has sometimes to go at night and help her out. Grandpa just broke his femur so he can't help much.

I was wondering if there is a professional figure I could pay to go to her and soothe her / improve her mental state, anything that can help in that sense. What would this be called?  


Also any books you would recommend that I could give my mom / grandpa on ""how to live with someone that has alzheimer""? I just realised no one in the family is really informed on anything and we're just going with the motions. Surely some knowledge wouldn't hurt."
"Sorry if this is all over the place but I just wanted to seek some help from the community. Will try to give as much context and background as i can.

My Dad (73) probably has Alzheimers. My Grandma had it and passed away from it, he is displaying symptoms for the past year as I understand. At this stage, he remembers the larger things like who I am, who my mom is etc but he forgets everyday events like what he ate, any plans we discuss for the day and he will repeat the same story that he has already told us. He is also angry most of the day. He will shout at my mom over the most trivial things and asks her to kill him so she can get rid of him. He doesn’t want to go and meet anyone outside the house (refused to go to another city to meet his daughters and grand kids and his own sisters and brothers). He still wants to drive even though he really can’t. He handles all his finances and makes poor investment decisions and doesn’t tell us until after. If we ask him to stop driving or stop handling his own finances he gets furious. He has a very specific daily routine and he does not stray from it. 

I live in another country, along with my wife, and at home it’s just my mom (68) and my Dad plus one of my sisters (29) who works full time and lives with our parents. 

I know that the first step should be to have him diagnosed so we know which stage he is at and how to care for him but he refuses to see a doctor and have any tests done. I’m currently visiting my parents and took a career break for the past 2 months to be close to him and get him help and help out mom. Tried taking him to the doctor but he fought with me and it got ugly. Without an official diagnosis I suspect everything else will be difficult ie treatment but he’s stubborn and I can’t get him medical help without his consent.

My parents live in a country which is not very developed, is conservative and they are very religious. I mention this because talking about this type of a disease is taboo here. I was too young at the time but as far as I recall no one talked about my grandma’s condition and she got limited medical help. My mom was her caretaker and I don’t want her to go through that experience again with my Dad. My sister also cannot be the caretaker as she is likely to be married in the next year and will move out. There is no concept of nursing homes in my country so my dad will live at home. I want to care for him but that means both me and my wife give up our life and move back home. I’m not sure I can ask her to do that. I can afford to hire help at home but worry that Dad will get angry at them and make them leave. 

My mom has experience with this from my grandma’s time but she doesn’t want to talk about a structured way of helping Dad. She does not want to treat him like a patient (probably scared and hence in denial).

What do I do and where do I start? How will his disease progress and what can I expect? How do I make him happy and care for him?"
"We're not there yet, but I wanna be ahead of the curve. I feel like if she asks, responding with ""I'm your grandson"" would make her feel really crappy for forgetting such a thing, but I can't imagine lying would be the right response either. She hates being patronized in general so I don't know how to best navigate that transitional period where she's starting to get bad, but not yet bad enough that she can't recognize her own decline."

"My mother was diagnosed ans she is in stage 4-5. 
She’s taking her medecins and I hired a caretaker to stay at home with her, while I am at work.
I’d like to get resources recommendatios for mental exercises.
She used to love craftmanship, crochet, embroidery, sewing, reading and movies. However, her attention span is quite reduced now. She can made small repairs in clothes or prepare her own sandwich, but it’s hard for her to follow a movie or read.
Could you recommend some resources for mental exercises, please?"
"My MIL is now under hospice care as of Wednesday. I was told by my FIL and SIL that she was jaundiced, which can be a natural progression as she nears the end, but actually seeing her with deeply yellow skin and yellow eyes made me very sad. We’ve been told she has about a week left at most. 

It helps me to share so thank you for the outlet."
"I can’t hide how jarring it is when dad says something indicative of him slipping away. It might come out of the blue when he’s had a good day or week. How do I keep it together when he says something that shows he’s losing his grasp on things? He’s also becoming fixated on my visits and asking my mother when he’ll see me again. Despite speaking 5 or 6 times every day and frequently for an hour every evening (either on FaceTime or on the Portal TV) I still have a sickening feeling that I should be with him all of the time when I know that even if lived locally, I would need to work and couldn’t be with him, all of the time. I see him for 5 days at a time every three weeks or so, is that enough? He doesn’t need caring for as such right now and my mother is more than capable to help him out with the small stuff he does need a hand with, it’s more the behavioural changes that are so brutally painful to stomach right now."

"I'm not really asking for advice this time. I'm just venting.

Woke us up around 3am shouting about coffee. Time has no meaning to him anymore. The day starts when he wakes up, ends when he goes to bed, regardless of what time it actually is. And he expects everyone else to be up with him.

He was out of coffee. Yelling at my mom about how he's ""constantly getting the short end of the stick"" because he's convinced he's the victim. He's convinced that she's depriving him of things on purpose. He's out of coffee because he drinks too much. 

3am to about 430am. 

Eventually he stopped shouting. He's angry anymore. At least no worse than usual. But he keeps waking her up. Going into her room (they've had separate bedrooms for years) and keeps bothering her about stupid petty shit. 

My poor mother is sleep deprived. Depressed and anxious from being yelled at all the time. And anytime she tries to leave the house, even for just a few hours, he'll call her over 20 times. Making up reasons to yell at her or leave angry messages when she doesn't pick up. Or, he'll get in a car and drive around trying to find her. 

We can't stop him from driving. Tried. 

This type of thing has become the new normal. Practically a daily thing.

I feel so bad for her. He was an asshole long before the disease took over. It's hard to feel sorry for him or to have any sympathy when he's always been a loud, selfish, raging asshole. But the disease amplified the worst of him then times over. And now he's this abusive burden we're stuck with. 

Can't afford to put him in a home. He's not far enough along to qualify for it anyway. Plus they'd prob kick him out for being an asshole. And we can't afford to move out and just abandon him. (my mom's guilt would never let her go through with that though)

If things keep going the way that they are, I'm convinced she'll kill herself just to get away from him."
"Tl;dr my father (87) diagnosed with dementia Alzheimer’s currently lives at home, I am his caretaker. I have durable PoA, medical PoA, and so on. He wants to move to VA with me, where I live full time. My brother is now taking me to court for guardianship though he rarely visited my parents before they got Covid and I came to help. Can I fight this in court?

My mom and dad both came down with Covid in November of last year. They ended up so bad that my mom fell onto the floor and since my dad is so deaf when he takes out his hearing aids he didn’t find her until the next morning. He was so weak he could not get her up, so he called my brother to come help. He had to break in to do so, and mom ended up in icu in the end and passing away. Dad ended up that same week in the hospital for a week as well. He fortunately made it through. 

Now, at the time I lived in Virginia and had called my brother and told him that mom and dad were very sick, sicker than they had ever been in their lives and he needed to go check on them. He never checked once. He lives 11 minutes away from their house! My eldest son was getting married that week but I would have missed the wedding if I knew how serious it was. 
He called them every day, left messages every day, but I would think that the fact that they never answered the phone, knowing they were sick, he would have come over to see what was up. But yet, not once.

Fast forward to when I got here, mom and dad were in the hospital and mom told me to go to the bank and get paperwork done so I could pay the bills as they had not done that in November, being sick . So I did that and they both signed it, after I explained to both of them what it was. Them being sick I just wanted to make sure they understood. I had to have dad talk to the bank associate so he could acknowledge what was going on.

Moving forward dad is home, mom has passed away and with dad’s diagnosis, according to moms will I am her executrix, so I have a durable Power of Attorney, and Medical Power of Attorney made up as well. I have Notary come over to the house so he doesn’t have to go out and it is signed by witnesses and the notary, depending on what is needed for each form.

Moving forward again, I’m going through the house my folks lived in for 50 years, getting rid of ancient paperwork, old childhood stuff, just crap that is not necessary or needed. My nephew comes over and his kids start grabbing stuff of my moms and wanting to take it home some without asking. Now my mom was very organized, and had taken me on “ death walks” through the house for years, telling me who got what when they were gone, she labeled stuff on the  bottom so I would know who get it. And here comes a 15, 12, and 10 year old just grabbing shit. I was upset. 

So, I’m having to take my dad to the doctor for a checkup after getting out of the hospital, my brother comes along, ok whatever, I could have called you with the results. A month later dad seems to be having an UTI so I make an appointment and I go, my brother tags along again. At my request, they do some tests for dementia as my brother has stated that he has doubts dad has it, he never heard mom talk about it and he feels dad just has Covid fog.  He has also stated since mom died that since she is gone her words have no weight anymore. So they do the test and the doc states he does have dementia just like his file already shows, it doesn’t get better or go away. That he cannot live alone.

Somebody in the family has now filed a DHS report on me stating I was under medicating him (did not pick up a prescription of prednisone at the pharmacy, shock and awe, I have the receipt, the bottle and so forth), that I am over medicating him ( he has a tree nut allergy, and he got into something with tree nuts, so I asked the pharmacist what was the best thing for him, he told me Benadryl. Now know this might not be true, and am calling my allergist!), and that I was using his money  myself (please, that is ridicules, my dad has so little money, and when I mentioned I found cash in a lockbox, my brother kept hammering me how much was it. I told him it didn’t matter as I put it back in his savings.

Today I was served with papers that said I need to be in court in Feb as my brother is filing for guardianship over dad. He wants to put dad in a nursing home, whereas I can provide him a home with family, an entire home, his own room, 3 porches, home cooked food, and so forth. He can save his money for later when he needs memory care.

On top of that, with guardianship comes finical responsibility of dad. My brother and his wife have not filed taxes in three years. Their home cannot pass inspection to get insurance and they refuse to fix it to get insurance. His wife is on the state child abuse and adult dependent registries, for child abuse against my niece. My brother smokes weed at home, at work, and in his vehicles. I don’t normally have an issue with weed, but don’t smoke it at your place of employment unless your boss is super chill lol and yea I’m going to use it against him when it comes to protecting my dad from him.

Present times: my dad is upset that my brother never talked to him, made false allegations and so forth. Dad was appointed some random lawyer from a different town, he has a lawyer just down the street he has used for years.

What can I legally? Can I file the same paperwork or just present my facts in court that day? Can he be made to do a drug test?

If you read all of this, thank you, if you have advice, thank you!"
"I live about a 3 hour flight from my grandparents, so I only see them a few times a year, but I call every 2-3 days. The calls have gotten harder recently. She’s always pleasant and upbeat, but she can’t answer any questions or tell me much of anything. She repeatedly asks me when is the next time I’m visiting. Usually I say I’ll be there very soon and I can’t wait to see her. Then she asks again when it’ll be, I’ll give an exact date and tell her I’m excited to cook with her, take her to the library, or something new. Then she’ll just keep asking. I’m not sure if there’s an answer that would satisfy her. When I call even the day after a visit, she’ll say it’s been a long time since she’s seen me. I just apologize and say I can’t wait for the next time. And the cycle continues.

Sometimes she tells me she was just reading a book so I’ll ask her about the book and she can’t tell me anything else, so we talk about how wonderful reading is. She likes music and dancing, but these don’t translate over the phone as well. In person, I can get her to tell stories about her childhood but I have trouble engaging her over the phone. Sometimes I’ll just ramble about my day or my life and if I laugh, she laughs too. Eventually she gets tired of talking or listening and I can hear her trying to pass the phone to my grandpa. Every time, I hear him respond “say goodbye first”. Then I tell her I love her and she says it back. I’m not sure she even knows who I am during these calls. 

tldr- I have a phone routine with my grandma and I’m not sure what I can do to make it better. Alzheimer’s sucks"
"My family has hired an additional person to watch him full time, one on one, at the care facility. Despite that, when he’s alone, he falls."
"My (31 F) mom, 64 with early onset Alzheimer's was officially diagnosed July 2021, and by August, had already started to forget me (we'd been wading through her symptoms until official diagnosis for a over a year at that point). I knew that we were going to get to the point where she'll start to forget me and others eventually, but I did not expect it so soon.

Every day, I'm either ""mom,"" ""what's your name,"" ""why don't you tell me your name,"" or ""you're nice, I like you."" Very rarely anymore am I her daughter or my name. 

I know 100% it is the disease and not her, but these past couple of weeks, it has really been hitting me hard, and it sucks. How did the woman who loved me so much forget me? How did the woman who had an endearing nickname for me since childhood, and who signed everything with ""I love you to infinity and beyond,"" and verbally told me she loved me any chance she got, forget me? How does she remember who my cousin and my cousin's children are, but not her own? It just makes me so sad I can't stand it.

I'm still really struggling to even accept our reality at this point. I understand it, but it is still so surreal. What happened to that woman I loved so much and could never fathom life without? Why did she leave me so soon? The woman that is taking up space in my house and my life is not someone I can really even stand to be around, and I don't like myself for it. I have no one. I am both of our parent at this point, and I cannot wait until the day this is no longer my burden. But the thought of carrying this grief with me for the rest of my life is heavy, and I feel like a piece of me already has died with her and who she used to be, and I will never get that back. I miss both of who we used to be terribly.

Also, for anyone who had a loved one who seemingly progressed (and I mean truly progressed this fast within a few months or a year; my mom doesn't really know how to eat without using her hands/being messy, is completely incontinent, speech is dwindling, no longer based in reality at all, does nothing with reason or logic, has lewy body characteristics and hallucinates people and conversations that aren't there/didn't happen) this fast and has already passed, how long did it take from diagnosis until the end? I know it varies, and I know there's no way of truly knowing, but I can't stop thinking about how much I'm already ready for her to go. This is no way for either of us to live. The fact that we don't have many options but to suffer without paying an exorbitant price is cruel."
"My dad (70) hasa diagnosis of cognitive brain impairment and symptoms that appear like Alzheimer's. My mom (68) has been caring for him and is accepting some of his mental changes, but she needs help. She can't do it all. 

He doesn't need to be ""babysat"" all the time, but he is getting to where he should be. He isn't wandering but he sometimes makes weird decisions and shouldn't drive. 

I'm happy to help my parents and I love hanging out with my dad. But my mom needs more help. How do we find an adult daycare for my dad that he might like? He is still fairly self aware and I believe would be defensive to being left to be babysat. He would understand what that means, when he would rather be doing other things. Thank you."
"On the 2nd, my grandma (74f) fell out of bed and was showing stroke symptoms. She's had Todd's paresis in the past but I still figured I'm better off to call 911. Unfortunately, due to covid restrictions my mom and I were kicked out. I'll call this hospital E, this has been our main hospital.

Hospital E has been pretty good with updates. However, they are very much a ""money first"" hospital.  She ended up having her test for a stroke come back negative along with her CT. An MRI was never done because even with her on meds she wouldn't stay still long enough.

We decided to just make her comfortable and being hospice. This is when problems start happening. Hospital E wants her out ASAP claiming they don't have a hospice program. We're given a social worker and told our only option was a nursing home nearby costing $9000 a month. We knew there other options because we live in a very senior heavy town. I've known that Hospital E receives money for referrals there.

Eventually, we find a good long term care and hospice facility I'll call BG. My grandma gets transferred after 5 days at Hospital E to BG. She really likes it at BG, they play music and have snack time (her words). She's there about 2 days when I get the call there is two COVID cases at BG. No big deal, they isolate her and the other patients. Day 3 she begins to act up and refuses to leave another patients room. BG wants to send her to get a psych eval so she can be on the right medication. I agree with it and she's sent to Hospital G, a hospital with a good psych ward as known from personal experience.

Hospital G receives her and immediately tests her for COVID as a precaution. She's positive. This means she either caught it at Hospital E or before hand. Not at BG, as she wasn't there long enough for her to test positive for it.

This makes my mom and I go through all of her charts to see if she was tested and when. Hospital E marks her oxygen was low and her lungs trashed. Only 1 rapid test was ever done, an Abbott test that has been more likely for false negatives. My mom and I test for covid, I'm negative my mom is positive. She has had covid since she ended up in Hospital E, now 8 days ago.

Hospital G has no more COVID beds and needs to transfer again. BG's sister location, BW, has a covid isolation area as it's much bigger. She's sent to it and  finally I can relax. She's in a good place, I trust them.

Tonight I get a call at 3:50am. My grandma is hitting and scratching everyone she can at BW. They need to transfer her as they are not capable for psych patients. She's being transferred to Hospital S. Immediately, I'm worried. My grandpa had gone to Hospital S after a stroke where he was mistreated horribly. That was 23 years ago, hopefully things have improved.

After looking into her charts from Hospital E, I'm glad she's not there. Since June, my grandma has been to Hospital E five times. Only once did they do a urine test. One of the most common tests for seniors. As well, she was brought in on the 17th for extreme aggression. Not a single test was done. In June and two other visits (can't remember exactly when) I brought her in for rectal bleeding. Once again, no tests were done as her very quick exams showed she wasn't bleeding anymore. In August, I finally got them to do a more thorough exam and she's diagnosed with cancer. Hospital E looks like such a nice caring hospital but they are some of the most incompetent doctors I've ever met.

I'm so frustrated because most of this could have been avoid if Hospital E actually ran the tests she needed. This isn't the first time I've had issues with them but I sure hope this the last.

TL;DR grandma went to the hospital and nobody ran any tests and she keeps getting transferred"
"My dad is 66 and was diagnosed with FTD two years ago and a different doctor decided Alzheimers a couple years ago instead of FTD. Either way my father had been getting worse and worse recently. My mom is his primary care taker and I help out along with one of my in laws. Currently my dad is having more and more bowel issues. He is currently wearing a depends 100% of the time because is loosing control more and more, he will often make it to the toilet but not always. 

One of my hardest struggles with helping him with his battle is also helping my mother keep her sanity and also getting my mom to keep my father at home for as long as he can be. There was a 6 month stint a little more than year ago where my dad went to the hospital and then to a nursing home to help them figure out meds correctly. This was extremely hard to deal with because it was covid time and nobody was allowed to see him. My mom was also more than happy to take a break from my dad at this time mainly due to the disease and my dads hallucinations at the time. I felt really bad because he was completely pulled from the world he knew and put into a place he completely hates. He also hates a nursing home and the time that he was in there he was so young compared to everyone else in there :( I also feel bad for my mom because this is a lot to handle and deal with. After the 3 months of being in the hospital and then 3 months in a nursing home he came back home and has been there since. Him and my mom have traveled often and I will go with them at times to help with my dad as well. So he has been doing ""decent"" but is getting worse and worse.

Fast forward to today he is having issues making it to the bathroom all the time and isn't always getting cleaned up after going and not always getting cleaned up in the shower either. Mom said today that he was very sore down there so I feel like he's probably not ever getting fully cleaned up. Mom was talking to me about getting him into a nursing home again and was going to call up a local place that we had previously talked about to see what it entails to get him in there. I will always push for him to stay at his home because this is where he is comfortable and wants to be but I think my mom is getting to a point that it is beyond her level of care ability. 

My question is, what are the options that we can look at for in home care/assistance vs placing my dad into a nursing home again? Thanks for any help :)"
"My dad is 59 years old and he's been really forgetful lately. Its not as serious, he isn't confused, disorianted nor does he have any symptoms i found online, but he forgets stuff like something we talked about recently or things i told him. Sometimes hes on his phone while i tell him my work shifts or simmilar and at first i thought he wasnt really listening and that might be the reason, but at the same time he did carry the conversation normally at the time. Yesterday he went to turn off the heating in the house and i dont know what he did but aparently he forgot in the meantime to do it, he wasnt absent for unusual time either. He used to have troubles remembering what grade i am in school or some stuff about my life but i guess that he just didnt care about it, dont get me wrong hes a great guy and i never held it against him. Im just trying to say he always had great memory just not about stuff he didnt find interesting i guess.

When i point it out he just jokes that he got old, but hes not that old. Hes super stubborn and he wont go to the doctor about anything yet alone for this to get checked out. My grandma got senile around age 82 and i had memory issues from an early age, simmilar to my dad i just couldnt remember things i didnt care about no matter how recently they happened, like homework and much more. I dont know if that matters."
" 

Despite our best efforts, our father P (77 M) continues to be completely enmeshed with his new girlfriend N ( 72 F) , who he first became involved with last summer.

From speaking to him, he believes he has MCI (Moderate Cognitive Impairment), instead of stage 5 Alzheimer's, which he was diagnosed with in 2019. I understand lack of insight into their own condition is a common feature of those who suffer from Alzheimer's. 

Unlike last holiday, P did not get his once beloved grandchild anything despite sending my aunt a card with all of our names signed (except his grandchild) and proudly centering the name of “his Girlfriend N.”

He also had his caregiver drive him to the jewelry store and purchase an engagement ring. P proposed to N on December 22. 

Around the same time, my aunt D (70 F) and brother J (51 M) worked with a family law attorney to arrange for his doctor to give P a capacity test. J got P to the doctor’s office but P would not go along with this test until he saw it was being given by a beautiful blond woman. Now he was really into taking the test and impressing this woman. He also volunteered to her that he didn't have a girlfriend. Needless to say, he failed the test. J then went back to lawyer with test results and got his name back on the trust, which P had removed back in October when N told him to cut us off. 

P also had a visit from Adult Protective Services, who reported that he seemed confused during questioning about his relationship with N and told the social services worker he was not planning to marry N or anyone. As far as we know, P did not report either the test or SS visit to N as he seems a little scared of her reaction. (we found that if the person is competent, SS will not take the report. P was found not competent).

After a break for the New Year, we have learned that P & N are now working with an attorney to create a new will and trust for P, who did his will in 2019 after the death of his 2nd wife (named N also) in 2013. Once P tries to move the money to N, he will learn what J has done and P & N will not be happy.  

We do not know how she will react, but the lawyers are standing by with an injunction in case she moves on P’s trust, which she will as she is utterly relentless. We also plan to air this person out to P's whole community, including friends who could have a positive influence. We hope."
"I’m am just having a lot of trouble dealing mentally with my father’s Alzheimer’s right now and could really use some advice/support. As the title mentions he’s always been stubborn but ALZ has made it ten times worse to the point of creating animosity amongst his loved ones. He makes up entire stories in his head where he told someone this or this is how an event happened and it’s not at all. The arguing takes a toll. It could even be as simple as us watching a show and him claiming he saw it and knows how it ends (like a cooking competition) but that’s clearly impossible because all episodes haven’t aired. He’ll insist of rewatching every episode available and gets mad when there are no more proving he was incorrect but never admits it. While this is annoying it’s something one can learn to live with. But the stealing assertions are just wild. He’ll misplace his debit card, forget his password or don’t know how to use cash app and turn around and accuse mainly me (his daughter) of stealing his money. He’ll call and I can be out in public listening to him rant about how he’ll send me to jail and he doesn’t care who I am. I’ll get long drawn out text messages saying the same thing. Then when he finds it there’s no apology or anything. My thing is and maybe this is where I falter in understanding is I can’t process the behavior because in my mind he should know right from wrong. Admittedly, from my perspective I really only think of Alzheimer’s as a memory disease. What am I missing here? I remember my mom telling me about how my grandma treated her. She said that others told her that patients usually treat the person who does the most/closest to them the worse"
"Hi I am relatively new to this community and this is my first encounter (I was very young with other encounters) with altzheimers. My grandmother is living in a 80% care facility, the other 20% is up to the family. This works quite well for now except that she struggles with going to the toilet. She does not recognize the toilet as usable, this leads to some accidents. Previously in her old home and when she visited mine this was not an issue. Does anyone have any advise to help her. Already tried a paper sign with toilet written on to it. These accidents create insecurity that stick by her like a bad feeling, so I hope I can help her out."
"Hi everyone,

First off, sorry for the super long post!

My grandma (78) was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in the past month. She is in early-middle stages according to the doctor. In general she is really forgetful and will ask the same things over and over again, forgets that conversations already happened, forgets how to fix a problem with her phone after I've told her many times how to, tries to tell my mom directions while driving even though she already knows the way and has said so, etc. 

She had needed a bit more help because she had some major surgery and became less independent because of it, but then when covid happened you could really notice a difference where she became super forgetful and kind of confused. Like for example she saw a reflection of lights in the window and thought there was a car driving towards the house. 

She also gets worried when things don't go according to her ""routine"" like if someone leaves the lights on, if my uncle doesn't close the door behind him in his room, etc. She fixates on that kind of stuff especially the lights and the door to the point where she will tell everyone in the house multiple times a day to watch out for the lights & door.

Finally a big problem she has is getting dressed and showering. I'm not sure how much of that is Alzheimer's, because she has pretty bad mobility in general and arthritis so I think it is more difficult for her to put on clothes but she refuses on principle instead of saying she can't move or whatever. She says ""I'm old and I'm not going anywhere"" or ""I don't want to take a shower it's too hard"". My mom has asked her questions to get her to elaborate like, is it hard to step in the shower? Is it too hot or cold? Do you need a shower chair to sit in? Is it too difficult or painful to reach your body? Etc and my grandma just says it's too hard. We currently have her showering once a week ideally but it can go up to a month before she will do anything, and usually does not change her clothes more than once or twice a week in addition. She is super stubborn about it. I've read that is a common thing in Alzheimer's but I'm not really sure why or what we should do about it.

What I wanted to know was is there anything we can do to help her/make her less confused? We have a schedule of the days events written on a big board next to her bed with all the things she has to do. She also frequently texts us what are our plans and we go over what everyone will be doing that day. We already take care of all her food, laundry, and cleaning. I thought maybe it would help if she had a hobby to help keep track of time or make days different from each other but she is very ambivalent towards everything and says she has no preferences. Currently she mostly watches TV, but she sometimes does crossword puzzles. Although she said she's having more difficulty with them recently. I figured something like crossword puzzles would be good for your brain so we encourage her to do them. 

Is there anything else I should know that would be helpful???  Any advice, suggestions, experiences welcome! My mom doesn't really like to talk about it so I want to see if there's something I can do myself or we can do as a family without putting too much burden on my mom."
"My father has early-stage Alz. He is mostly with it, but there are fixations that he just can’t let go of. In this case, I have his .22 rifle. He has asked 20-30 times over the past couple of years that I bring his rifle. I have ‘forgotten’ it every time. My sister and I don’t think it’s a good idea for him to have a weapon. He not only has alz, but also a pretty severe tremor. Having a weapon with the amount he shakes would not be good. 
It feels like it’s time to be honest with him. His building does not allow weapons and he has a bad tremor. Bringing up the ALZ is a non-starter because he can’t see that he has it. 
I’m going to emphasize listening to him. Acknowledging his feelings on the whole thing. Telling him I love him. But no, I’m not bringing his rifle.  It’s going to be a hard day.

We took a trip in November for 5 days together for the first time in a long time. He was very with it. We bonded better than he have in a long time. I’m worried this is going to damage the closeness we have gained.  

I guess I’m conflicted. All the advice about alz is to lie to avoid conflict. Use this verbal judo to redirect the person. But that isn’t working either because he isn’t that far gone. He knows I’m lying to him, so that’s damaging our relationship too. 

Alz and parents getting older just sucks."
"I've gotten back in touch with longtime friends I'd drifted from, and the husband is probably [stage 5-6 by this scale](https://www.healthline.com/health/stages-progression-alzheimers#stage-5) at the age of 59. I've been able to spend some time with him so she can go to appointments and such. He is still an absolute sweetheart and remembers me most visits, if not necessarily immediately, but his short-term memory is super-limited and he can't follow the complex narrative of a joke or a reminiscence and he doesn't respond well to new visuals. Mostly we sit and talk about the pretty view or their nice cats or how great we both are (like I said, absolute sweetheart), and occasionally we have a snack, which he loves. While I do think that this is a fairly soothing interlude for him, which is no bad thing, I'm wondering if there's anything people have found somebody at that level of Alzheimer's might enjoy that I'm not thinking of. Winter weather is foul here and he's afraid of the cold, so going outside isn't a possibility at the moment. Or maybe I should just stick to our hours of affectionate Zen?"
"Hi everyone,

First time poster who has benefited a great deal from all the advice and support over the years reading through various posts and comments.

MIL has advanced Alzheimer's. We are having trouble with her bowel movements. She gets very constipated for a couple of days, during which time we give her Senekot, fiber gummies, milk of magnesia etc. Then she will void herself but the problem is that the timing of this is uncontrollable. We try to sit her on the toilet throughout the day but she does not understand the concept of pushing. 
On a few occasions she has voided herself in her diaper at night and then reaches in and pulls it out. Needless to say it is a big mess.  Last night was a really rough night for my FIL and we rushed over to try to help with the cleanup. Clean up involves trying to avoid her touching anything, disinfecting the entire bed area, while also getting her into the bath which as you know is another big challenge for ALZ patients. We do notice that she is constantly reaching into her pants at night. Any suggestions for how we could solve this problem? We are going to play around with the times of day when we give her the laxative but it seems as if she is not on the schedule at all with her bowel movements.Thanks in advance for any suggestions you might have."
My mom turned 60 today and she is suffering from early onset Alzheimers. She had her diagnoses at 54 so we are in this hell for 6 years now. We all didn't expect her to make it to this birthday. But now she has and I feel really terrible. Every time she has a birthday or I have mine I miss her. The woman she was before the illness. How do you celebrate a birthday with this kind of situation. Because of covid there are only 4 people who can visit her today. So 2 of my aunts and my oldest brother and my stepdad are going there today and I feel like I should go to her but I'm also scared. She's not the woman I want to remember when she passes away. Is that selfish from me? I don't know what to do
"I'm wondering what options, if any, an elderly US military veteran has as their Alzheimer's progresses, and they get worse. Does the government pay or partly pay for assisted living, or veteran's home stay depending on the state? If not, what other options do they have for care and assisted living?

The VA of the current state I'm in told me they do not allow Alzheimer's patients to stay in a veteran's nursing home, and they only offer caregiving services for a few measly hours a week once the patient is no longer able to dress or bathe themselves, which my loved one is fortunately still able to do, but who knows when that will end? Thank you all."
"My grandmother is 88 years old and lives in a separate house on our property. She's been diagnosed with ""moderate"" alzheimers and the doctor said she should really go to a nursing home but she refuses and we're ok with her living at home as long as it's possible, although we'd wish she would go to a nursing home for everyone's sake.

She doesn't take care of herself (hasn't washed her hair in god knows how long), doesn't take her meds cause she's suspicious of what they are (we bring her the medication twice a day but she cheeks them and spits it out), feeds her cat random things and doesn't clean the litter box so now we do these things for her as we don't want to take away her companion, she either refuses/forgets to eat or eats more than 1 loaf of bread a day and even cat food and shes incredibly stubborn, verbally aggressive, thinks we steal from her all the time, etc.

She doesn't want any help with cleaning, bathing, cooking, anything. She even gets mad that we help with her cat cause it makes it seem like she's old for goodness sake. She won't go see our family doctor for her prescriptions unless we force her to and we've tried having him come to the house but she just locks the doors and leaves the key on the door so we can't get in. It's miserable.

Another thing is that she's costing us a lot of money atm. She keeps breaking her tv by messing with the cables, unplugging them and then trying to plug them in incorrectly resulting in having to get it fixed cause she messes up the ports. She also messed something up on her toilet causing the water to keep running for 14 days resulting in a €1000 water bill. Besides that she always turns off all the lights and sits in the dark 24/7 to save money. Literally whenever we go check on her she's sitting on a chair in her kitchen -lights out- curtains closed - pitch black. 

Any advice??"
Has anyone donated their loved ones brains after they passed away. I honestly don’t know how much longer my husband has and have been thinking about this as an option. I would hope that just maybe we could contribute to getting rid of this awful disease.
Hi everyone. I really like Reddit but sometimes I wish there was a virtual community specifically for Alzheimer’s where I could get more information. Does anyone have any suggestions?
"My dad is almost completely dependent on my mom for dressing. This isn’t a huge issue, but when using the bathroom, my dad is having a hard time pulling pants and underwear down/up. He can otherwise toilet independently and values doing so. Any advice/has anyone found any tricks for this? It seems like he forgets to pull up his underwear with his pants or loses his underwear in his pant legs."
"I find it is easier to ""manage"" my spouse with Alzheimer's if I can keep him in a good mood.  To this end, I will do things I know he gets enjoyment from.  Such as:

* A good steak dinner
* His favorite cookies
* An ice cream sundae
* Eating out, or in Covid times, just eating at a drive-in (I call it ""going for a burger with my honey"")
* Any kind of gift - even though we are downsizing, got him some new gloves at Christmas which pleased him
* Grooming the cats
* Watching an interesting drama on TV
* Reruns of the Carol Burnett show (he likes her, I don't, but I'll survive)
* A pedicure
* A drive in the country

Etc.  Now I know we all feel run down and depleted, so not telling you that you should do MORE.  It's just that things run better if we can keep the mood positive.

What rays of sunshine have you given your difficult loved one?"
"Mum got diagnosed around May last year. We think she's had it since late 2016 though. I just can't deal with her anymore. I love her because she's my mum but by god I just can't stand her anymore. Walking around the house muttering to herself how we're all assholes. 

Her dog (lab) I love her to bits, but she likes to get in my daughter's face when she has food or is upset or has just woken up and when I tell her to back up my mum loses her ever loving mind. Like I have some kind of vendetta against this dog? I love this dog. She's great. But she's a puppy and doesn't understand boundaries. Still working on it though and my daughter is 19 months old. 

I guess all the shit I do for her doesn't matter at all. I have no clue why I'm the bad guy constantly in her eyes but I can't take it anymore. I'm a single mum and I'm struggling to keep my head above water for my daughter. Nothing is ever enough. I'm working on moving out and in the meantime I have to work out how to keep walking on eggshells and not snap at her. Because then I'll definitely be the world's worst person because mum has Alzheimer's and she can't defend herself according to everyone around her.

I'm not posting for advice. Just to vent."
"Preface: My grandmother was diagnosed about 4 years ago and has slowly progressed.  I have not physically seen her in a year. We took her to the hospital for a fall and she has been in assisted living since. I've attempted to visit her only one time and was turned away due to the worlds current events. 

My family has been nearly begging me to go see her. My brother recently went and called in tears telling me I HAD to go see her and that she wasn't getting any better. But mentally I have not felt able to make that move as I was always the closest to her. In a way safe guarding my younger self and memories. Due to my family's pleas I know I will need to see her soon. I began writing a eulogy today for her. And I can't tell my family, husband or friends because quite frankly it is so extremely morbid. But I wrote and got all of the thoughts and memories that I know when the time comes I want people to know. I think this is my brain's way of memorializing or cementing the person she was and is to me so that when I go to see her it's as if maybe she's a different person and doesn't cloud the previous memories."
"Living with grandma for 4 years. After she fell, the paramedics came out to clean her head injury. 
They sent out someone who stitched her up in bed so she wouldn’t get freaked out having to go to hospital. 
They put us onto a therapist who came out for 6 weeks and did specific exercises with her to improve her balance.  
They put us in contact with a social worker who would ring me every so often to see if I had any problems. 
They’ve been talking to the district nurses on my behalf. I didn’t know about this until Christmas Eve. 
They’re going to send someone out one morning for the next 6 weeks. Will wake, wash, dress and feed her so I can have some time off.
How much does this cost? £0. 
[NHS: Free at the point of delivery](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-nhs-constitution-for-england/the-nhs-constitution-for-england) I 💙 it. And it needs protecting."
"Hello, looking for some advice.  I have been trying to work with my siblings in terms of support our parent who has Alzheimer’s.  The road leading up to the diagnosis revealed how poorly we do work together, but I’ve tried my best ignore the crap and snark and support my parent as best as I can.  However, the control and gaslighting from the siblings has become too much for me, it has affected my mental health.  I pulled out of group texts with them and said I will communicate via email to support our parent, but will no longer deal with them in other ways.  All the time I strongly reiterated that in NO WAY was I stopping helping our parent.  Now the email communication has also become borderline abusive - especially if I am not in agreement with something.  For example, I think a place different levels of care is what should be considered so we don’t have to move our parent when the Alzheimer’s progresses more care is required.
Part of me wants to go no contact with the siblings and help my parent when they need it, not in consultation with the siblings.  Thoughts?
This puts my parent in the middle so to speak, but trying to work with the siblings and maintain a decent level of mental health is almost unattainable.
Thanks"
"First it was he was going downstairs to look for something.  We live in a one-level condo built on a concrete slab - there IS no downstairs.  I finally figured out he was thinking he was still in his other house he had before we got married.  After a few days, I think I had him convinced that there was no downstairs here.

Then a couple days ago, I asked him to put something on the bed.  ""Which bed?  The bed upstairs?"" he asked.  (We only have one bed.)  Once again, we live in a single-story flat, no basement or cellar, no upper story.  I told him we have no upstairs.  He seemed stubbornly surprised.  ""I think you're confusing this place with that other house again,"" I said.  He agreed he probably was.

But then he has referred to upstairs another time.  Now I'm just rolling my eyes and going with it.  ""Yes, the upstairs bedroom.""  He can wander around looking for nonexistent stairs, it gives him something to do.  

And on the subject of something to do - he has been unable to get the telephone, the automated cat feeder, the lift recliner, and the dishwasher to work (they were not broken) so he took them apart.  Which, you know, sure didn't make them work any better, since he can't put them together again.  So now I have decided his habit of taking clean clothes out of the closet or dresser and putting them in the living room is small potatoes - makes more work for me, but at least it doesn't break anything.

I feel like I have descended into the pit of madness with him.  Why fight it.  Trying to see the funny side."
"My mother was a chef her whole life and is now showing symptoms of Alzheimer’s, could her career have exacerbated this disease?"
"My grandmother lives with my mom, and this morning she texted me to tell me that she woke up to her bathroom flooded after my grandmother had attempted to flush something down. It was a total mess, and she used all of my mom's good towels to try to clean the mess. My grandmother does not remember what she tried to flush or for how long the toilet had been overflowing. Thankfully, it is just effecting the one toilet and doesn't seem to be causing an issue with the septic tank!

My mom already has childproof locks on the toilets in the home \[because of my niece and nephew that also live there\], but my grandmother knows how to operate them. The ones she has right now are the swing-arm ones with a button to release the arm so that you can lift the seat. Are there any better options? I tried looking on Amazon, but I'm not seeing much beyond what is already in place.

Any help is very much appreciated. Thank you."
"So my 75 year old engineer father has progressive supranuclear palsy.  Original brain injury was a brain tumor 15 years ago. We moved him into assisted living last week. Up until now he has loved his iPad to play simple games with and on. But now it's an unsecured device in his assisted living facility. 

Has anyone gone through this and figured out how to protect an iPad device but also allow him to keep using it?

Thanks in advance."
"Had my (36M) parents (60M, 63F) over for dinner tonight and the night ended promptly after the meal finished and my Mom started talking about trying to kill my Dad and blaming my wife (34F) for hitting on my Dad during dinner.  This fucking sucks.  Over the past couple months, I've come to realize that I don't really have a Mom anymore and my kids don't have their ""Nana"" anymore -- she's just a patient now.  She still mostly knows who we are, but she doesn't seem to remember anymore who she is to us, and she's been going through these real nasty waves of just being downright miserable to my Dad. I don't know... sorry for the hostile rant, it's just been a lot to try reconciling with lately and I don't really feel like I have anyone I can open up to about this stuff."
"Magnesium Glycenate is suggested to be good for sleep quality. We have been trying the supplement before bed with my mom, who has advanced Alzheimer’s. She typically will keep her eyes closed on the morning. Since starting the supplement she opens her eyes in the morning and seems more alert in general."
"He's become unbearable to live with. 

My mother's left literally shaking and crying from being yelled at on a daily basis.

But we can't kick him out. He would never leave. We can't afford to leave. Don't have any money in savings. I can't pull them at home, can't afford it. Even if we could they would kick him out for being too abusive to the staff.

It's heartbreaking to see so many posts on here talking about how they're losing a loved one. Where as I'm just stuck with this fucking asshole I can't get rid of. Some kind of unbearable burden.

I'm at a point where I'm expecting it's going to get bad enough that we'll have to call the cops on him. If we're lucky, the cops will take him down or take him away.

Update: his temper got so bad today that I actually called the cops on him. And while I was waiting for the cops, his defibrillator went off. So called an ambulance. 

Now he's in a hospital and I don't know what to do next."
"We suspect that her mom(60s) has AD, just now she had been losing short term memory, small things which can be easily remembered, but what's alarming is she forgot that her husband does not sleep with her but sleeps on their new house alone(her husband lived in the new house 3years ago until present). 

Can we please have tips or things to do to slowdown or reverse it? And know what we are dealing with?

Happened around 8pm , im not sure but i think i heard somewhere that AD gets worse during the evening?"
"Hi everyone! I’ve been lurking for a while on this sub while procrastinating forcing my mom to go to a doctor for what I believe is Alzheimer’s or dementia. Each time I bring up going to the doctor, she becomes extremely defensive but that is a story for another day. I’m posting because I’m at a loss for how to search for a doctor that can evaluate her. I took her to PCP and he wasn’t very helpful in recommending a doctor for this.

Does anyone know if there is a resource online, or better, recommend someone? We live in NJ. Thanks!"
"Hello Reddit,

My grandfather (75) was diagnosed with Alzheimer's a few years ago. As with this awful disease, he has been slowly declining since then and we have now run into a problem that my family and I are struggling to solve.   


My grandfather lives with my grandmother (73). This past year has been harder than most with his decline. My grandmother has begun to worry about what would happen if something serious happened with her and my grandfather needed to contact either a family member or emergency services. The issue we run into is that my grandfather has a difficult time using a phone. He cannot dial 911, search contacts (or find contacts), or remember to use Bixby voice (he has an android phone). As a family we do work with him on these things, but unfortunately it is really hard for him. He can get frustrated/flustered very easily. Here are certain things we have tried/thought of: 

* Adding an emergency contact number to his lock screen on his phone, all he has to do is hit a ""phone"" icon and it will dial directly from the screen to the emergency contact listed. Unfortunately my grandfather didn't understand how to press the ""phone"" icon. 
* Setting up Bixby voice. All he needed to do was say ""Hello, Bixby"" and then ""Call (whomever)"". He really struggles to remember the name ""Bixby"".
* Getting him a life alert. We haven't done this yet because he is unsure he will remember that he has it in a high-stress situation, even if it was on his person at all times. 

We are concerned that if a situation did arise involving my grandmother and she WAS NOT able to call for help herself, that my grandfather would be too flustered to remember some of the things we have been working on. Does anyone have some advice or possibly a solution they have found themselves?"
"Hi Everyone, 
Thanks so much in advance for anyone has the time to comment. Dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in May. He had an MRI which showed a moderate level of shrinkage, mild micro vascular ischaemic as well as two small haemorrhages. With COVID, I didn't see Dad until November and noticed a change but it wasn't major. Fast forward to December and he seems to be declining really rapidly. The doctors said that his Alzheimer's could be moderate- advanced based on the fact that he would have been extremely high-performing to begin with. I really don't understand what's happening. Last week, he was able to have solid conversations; this week, he can't seem to sustain a thought. He still has a very impressive vocabulary but it just seems to be going down hill quite quickly. Had anyone seen this? What's happening? x"
"Hi guys,

My father (66) has been recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's, he hasn't forgotten much so to say, can talk perfectly fine, although sometimes gets hiccups in what words to choose. When he forgets something, usually an event in the past decade, I gently remind him of something related to it and he remembers the event completely and can describe specific details, anyways I've been reading up a lot about it, what caught me was that early onset Alzheimer's has a rapid progression compared to late stage. However as I was reading it says people with early onset are usually under the age of 65, sometimes in their 40s, and 50s. Does this mean first symptoms? Or does this mean like if you were diagnosed at 66, it means it's been affecting them way before hand and therefore is considered early onset? 

Thanks in advance for the info guys, really appreciate it and want to get my head around this and what to expect, I know it's not going to get easier."
"My future FIL is in the pretty late stages of Alzheimer's. It is important for my SO to have his father at our wedding, so we are trying to finally get married in a few months. We had plans in 2020, but then COVID as we all know. 2021 involved a lot of moving and job changes.

We are planning an intimate ceremony and reception of only 22 people, just siblings and parents and my best friend and her husband. 


For the ceremony, I am planning on soft, classical music and I also plan on speaking to siblings with young kids to have a caretaker on the day of wedding as I am trying to maintain a quiet environment for FIL. 

I don't really care much about music or dancing, a quiet dinner with maybe the first dance with my dad and then husband would be enough for me. I also want cupcakes or mini pies, so there won't be any cake cutting ceremony. 

I just want some advice on if my ideas I have so far are solid, and asking for any additional advice or ideas that may help the day be as comfortable as possible for FIL. I figured if the younger people wanted to continue the celebration later on, we could all do so at the hotel bar. (Our parents and siblings live all over the US, so there will be a fair amount of traveling. We will also be traveling to future stepMIL and FIL for the wedding so stepMIL doesn't have to deal with the stress of traveling with FIL.)

I don't want my SO's stepmom to feel left out of the fun of the wedding, but I also don't want to agitate FIL. Please help."
"Hi!  1st reddit post here,  please be kind.  My husband's grandfather was diagnosed with Alzheimers at approx 75 y/o. We had noticed during the most recent visit that he was repeating questions, but in a conversational sort of way. The last 2 times my 65 y/o MIL has visited,  we've noticed her repeating questions in a rapid-fire way, where we can't even finish our sentences.  It doesn't seem forgetful so much as really overbearing.  However, so also was struggling with children's games (understanding the skip symbol in Uno, the wild 2 in Dos, drawing a new card after every turn in the kids version of Cards Against Humanity). She's much younger than her dad was,  and didn't seem to be having any issues functioning. 
Could this be the beginning?  Should we be concerned?  Any tips for starting a conversation?  I don't think she'll hear it very well.

Thanks"
"I realized one of the very few gifts that my grandma appreciates immensely  was a photo of her dad. Why was it special? The original photo was extremely tattered and ruined with scratches and a few rips. I’m a designer and photo retouching/restoration is something I really enjoy. I surprised her with the photo cleaned up and she cried. Since it was digitally I made her a few copies so she could have it in different places too. 

I wanted to open my services to everyone here in this community! If you have an image that you’d like to be restored please DM and I can give you a timeframe when I can get the image done. Typically getting an image restored can cost $100s but I’m offering it freely since I saw how much joy it brought my grandma.

I am able to: remove scratches/rips, burns, potentially enhance some of the colors, and provide you with a jpeg of that image after being restored. Timelines will vary pending on the image and I’ll confirm that I’ll be able to bring the photo back to life. If you have any questions feel free to DM me directly!"
"When is the right time to have someone with dementia living with someone? My grandmother lives alone, everyday one of us visits her. We buy groceries, meds, take her to the doctor, etc. but for most of the time she is alone. She does the laundry by herself, she prepares her food and pretty much can take care of herself. She communicates okay, only she sometimes repeats herself. One time she went a bit far from home and she felt lost. The police called us and we picked her up from the station. Right now she doesn’t go out on her behalf but I wonder when will it be when she will need a person with her all the time before it’s too late (before she hurts herself or she gets lost)."
"Hi, my grandmother has recently started to wander off during the night ( while people she lives with are asleep) and may be while they are gone. Is there some sort of permanent bracelet that can track her or have her information. What childproofing things could help?  ( locks have been changed and she figured those out).  Other things are she hides stuff and calls people at random times."
"After Christmas, grandma will happily munch on the leftover nibbles in small amounts in the fridge all through the day. She’s recently been refusing what she says are meals too large to eat. (A jacket potato for dinner is “so big” she won’t even try to eat any of it).
Today she had 2 pork pies, half a quiche and 3 jam tarts over the afternoon. 
Should I get back to making her meals that are good for her, or continue to buy the ready made nibbles she currently likes?"
"My mother has a living will and I don't understand how that works when she stops feeding herself. It says not to give her artificial nourishment if she has a terminal illness. 

I have a friend who said her mom just said ""I'm not eating any more"" and died a week later. 
Has anybody else been in this situation? I'm want to be mentally prepared for it because I'm her medical POA and I have a combative sibling who I will have to be dealing with."
"Recently I became aware that my grandpa is having some memory issues. I’m not sure if he’s been diagnosed yet, but he definitely knows that something is wrong most of the time. He has some mobility issues and basically just watches tv all day. I was thinking of things I could get for him to occupy his time, and I remembered that he used to play old NES and Sega games when I was a kid. I am thinking that playing games might stimulate his brain and help him regain some focus.

After some searching online, I found some studies that support this theory. Furthermore, 3D games are potentially more helpful, because they require spatial navigation and result in more learning. I want to get/make some way for him to play games, but it needs to be super accessible for him (both the system and the specific games). Any issues or frustrations getting the system to work will likely cause him to give up on it.

Does anyone have any suggestions for games? I was thinking about certain “walking simulator” games, because they are not action-oriented but still have the player navigating a 3D space while also telling an engaging story.

I don’t know of any game system that exists that would be accessible enough for him, so I would probably have to build something custom. My first thought was a retropie, but I don’t think they would be able to play the more recent 3D titles. Any suggestions here would be appreciated. I really want to do something productive to help him and potentially others. Thanks!"
"So my mother is fast losing her short term memory. Nothing has been diagnosed but I think soon it will need it. I don't know if it's Alzheimer's or dementia but I'm finding her company is exhausting constantly repeating things I said a couple minutes ago and her having zero recollection of things we have been doing. The exhaustion I feel is coming from the digging deep for my patience. I am and have always been a person who doesn't talk for the sake of talking so repeating myself is hard. 

I understand how hard/frustrating this may be for her but when myself and my father try to give her strategies to help she refuses to listen and then also of course she forgets.

I guess I'm looking for a vent but I'd love to hear about people's coping mechanisms...this is so hard to deal with and it's really bringing my mental health to a very low level. Any advice, tips would be highly appreciated!"
"I have noticed cognitive decline in my nan for a few years after my grandads passing. She struggles to uphold a conversation, particularly because she is hard of hearing but mostly because she doesn’t understand some things she used to understand. 
As anyone who has little knowledge on neurodegenerative diseases would do I asked her to draw a clock. 
Her clock was a circle with the number 4 in the middle. 

I asked her again a little later and her clock was a circle with a U shape in the middle. 

I have told my dad to get her to the doctors but he won’t listen to me, she is also afraid of being put in a mental health hospital again so she would refuse to go. 

Please can someone advise what to do"
"My mom went out this morning like she does every day. Usually my father is alert but this time he fell asleep. When he woke up my mom wasn't home yet so he checked her location with an app and she was far from home. He called her and explained how to come back. She came back with no issues but she had pooped herself. My theory is that she found every store closed because it's Christmas so she got confused and kept walking.

Anyway this is the first time this happens and it breaks my heart. Fortunately she likes taking her phone everywhere. I think she feels safe with it and my father always checks her location. 

Some extreme measures are coming :(

Merry Christmas everyone!"
"I’ll try to keep this brief…. Basically one of my parents is genetically prone to Alzheimer’s, has had some stressful triggers in their life and has shown a few other symptoms like forgetfulness, spacing out, repeating themselves etc. 

However one thing they tend to do is this really intense, but glassy stare. Growing up I had a bad relationship with them… but have restored it a bit. I want to be warm to them… but they just stare at me so intensely that I feel uncomfortable or even terrified… it’s like their eyes pierce my skin, I’m about to get in trouble, or it’s not my parent… like it’s almost as if I’m viewing a stranger when they give me this look. Their eyes scare me now basically…

Is this common to anyone? Any tips on how to get over it?"
"I grew up with my grandparents and love them very much. Since they live at the countryside I can only visit them when I'm on vacation. My grandfather's Alzheimers and Parkinson have worsened this year. My grandmother takes care of him but it's getting really difficult because he's also getting very snappy. 

Because of his Alzheimers he keeps forgetting where he put his stuff so since beginning of the year he's convinced that there's an imaginary neighbor's kid who's camping inside of his house and waiting for him to let his guard down so he can steal things like his glasses, tv remote and snacks. My grandmother keeps telling him that there's no robber but he won't listen. It's very painful to me because he's mentally not doing well since nobody in our family believes him. 

It has come to the point where he refuses to sleep and live his life. He just sits in a room waiting to catch the robber. Now he wants to install cameras and i don't know how to talk to him or handle the situation because I don't want him to think that he's crazy but also don't want to encourage him. I'm one of the only few people he trusts since I have a lot of patience with him and don't want to ruin that."
"Mom lives in a skilled nursing facility. Over the last few months she has been having behavioral issues (not my term) like going into other residents rooms and taking their things, being verbally abusive, making threats of violence, and on several occasions hitting staff and other residents. They put her on depakote which turned her into a zombie. After 3 weeks she adjusted to the dose and we had a few visits where she was much more present with me, even called me by my name. I could see that she was still agitated, standing up like she was going to go somewhere then laying back down repeatedly. This week her verbal abuse began again and she took a swipe at one nurse. So again the are upping her dose. Does anyone here have experience with this drug? Are there alternatives? For the first time in 10 years I feel like I can’t find a solution to a problem. Thanks"
"Mom is mid-stage (Good days, Stage 4, bad days, exhibits some Stage 6) and this month, she used up all of her checks.

We have FPOA & manage her finances. We let her keep the checkbook to ease the losing independence transition as she's not pleased about how much we've ""taken over her life."" It was no big deal for a long time, she mostly just sends birthday checks to grandkids, but over the last year as her condition progressed, she was writing checks to shady charities (looking at you, Fund to ""Save"" Social Security) and ordering supplements toting miracle cures. Last year's tally was about $2500 in bad faith charity donations & about $6k in supplements.

Since she ran out of checks a couple of weeks ago, we'd stalled, hoping she'd forget about it. But she's getting more insistent. We don't want to order more for her because $7-10k a year to con artists is hard to stomach, both financially & emotionally.

Has anyone else come up with a good solution for this?

We talked about ordering some generic checks online that aren't linked to her bank account & tell family to let us know when they get one & we'll venmo them. And while I am personally totally fine with sending fake checks to the supplement & charity scams, I'm worried it could be construed as fraud unless we figure out a way to make it clear the checks aren't legal tender, which she might notice if we print that on the checks.

Holding her mail isn't an option, unfortunately. She puts her mail in a postal box on her walking route."
"Not physically of course. 

I work as a cleaner and I clean at an elderly womans house who has the disease. While I'm there workers come to make sure she has lunch and takes her pills.

&#x200B;

 Anyway today the person came and helped her fix the plate but she kept saying she wasn't hungry. The woman was not having it. She didn't yell or anything and I get she only has so much time there but she was like 'no you are going to sit down and eat'. Really treating her like a 4 year old. Do they not know when they are hungry or something? 

I clean for around 3 hours and I can see that the woman is not completely out of it or anything like that. Is it normal to not let her decide things? I mean shes a grown woman not a child. I noticed her daughter does the same thing."
" Edit: my father passed away at 3:13 am holding my mother’s hand while my brother, sister and I were laying down five feet away. Collectively, we spent three days camped out in this room. Thank you for all your kind words and comments. 

Original post:

Alzheimer's/dementia runs in my father's side of the family. My grandfather died from it, albeit, gradually over 20 years. He was docile and kind the entire span of his life. So when my father, then 71, was diagnosed with mild cognitive decline 3 years ago, we very much expected him to take a similar course. That is absolutely not what has happened.

He declined so rapidly we could barely keep up. 5 months ago we finally chose (after touring dozens) a specialty Alzheimer's care center for him to go and live. He moved in and his memory and behavioral issues advanced. He began to become aggressive when his diaper was being changed or he needed to be washed, or put in new clothes. Soon after this began, his aggression became more and more frequent, until he had an incident in which he struck out at a nurse.

The care center put him in an ambulance and sent him to the hospital, who called us to inform us that my dad was in the ER. They submitted him to the Psychiatrics ward in order to try and balance his meds and find a proper combination of antipsychotics that would allow him to continue living life in a comfortable manner. I should note, he was physically healthy. Big guy, just slightly overweight, had worked outside his entire life. The doctors said he might be there for a week, and due to Covid, no visitors were allowed.

A week passed and the doctors were very transparent about informing us of all the different drug cocktails they were trying. None were working. He was still aggressive while nurses were performing CARES and it often took 3-4 people to restrain him. One week turned into two, and eventually five. At the end of the 5th week, they suddenly permitted my mom and older sister to visit him for one hour. We were puzzled. The next day they asked for a meeting and explained to us that there was nothing they had tried that worked, and no care center would take him back in this state. They explained that over the last five weeks he had fallen very deep into the dementia, and insisted that the best option was to begin heavy sedation, rendering the body unable to eat or drink until it shuts down. My mother, as power of attorney, agreed to this. They gave us each one hour to visit and say goodbye while he was still alert and began the sedation the next day. This was one week ago.

He has not eaten or drank for at least six whole days and we have been by his bedside for almost 48 hours. There have been so many moments where we just question, over and over again, how this is legal, and this is the only solution. Aren't we literally killing him by sedating him to death? Has anyone else had this experience? Please shed some light on this for me."
"Hi, so long story short, my grandma currently has Alzheimer's, and my mom and I have also lost a dear family friend who was also like a grandma to her to Alzheimer's a few years back. I'd wanted to donate to the Alzheimer's Foundation for a while and in November, I was able to raise a lot of money that I will be donating. 

Here's where I need advice: My mom has had a harder time with this than I have and has been more directly affected, so I want to make this donation special to honor everything my mom has done to support the two women in our lives who have had it and to honor my grandma and our family friend. 

I'm not sure of the etiquette of this and I don't want it to be interpreted wrong. When I first ran the idea by my brother, his immediate reaction was 'Well Gram isn't dead. Don't you do this stuff after they die?' and now I'm unsure of the best way to go about anything. I know 'In Honor of' is different than 'In Memory of' but if both names are on it then will that be interpreted wrong? 

I'm probably overthinking it all, as I do with most things, but I've never done anything like this and I don't want to mess something up."
"My mom called today and said there was a man in the house she did not recognize.  I asked if it was my Dad and she responded by saying her Dad has been dead for years. I asked if the man in the house was ****, my Dads name, and she had no idea how I knew him.  

My heart sank and I’m finally having to face how bad her memory has become.  This is brand new to me and I have no idea how to deal with this.  Please provide any and all advice you can; I would really appreciate it"
"I’m caring for my grandmother this winter and while doctors have not given her a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s she has some pretty serious memory problems. 

Her husband died this summer and it took her a very long while to be able to remember that for more than a few minutes at a time. They were married for 50 years and became very codependent so his passing has been extremely hard for her to deal with. 

I am not able to live with her during most of the year meaning that she is often alone for most of the day. I have begun to monitor her when she uses the computer because she routinely enters google searches like “find *husband’s name*” and ends up on very risky “background check” websites. I am fairly lost concerning what to do because I don’t want her to be taken advantage of but I also don’t want to put up a sticky note reminding her because every time she is told about his passing she shuts down for hours at a time. She also would remove any sort of note in order to “tidy up.” I am also unable to place parental controls on the internet browser as she still uses the AOL desktop application which removed parental controls in 2017.

I am very worried about her because, as mentioned I will not be able to be with her all day starting in the spring and the rest of my family works during the day. My father (the power of attorney) has also been highly resistant to getting some form of home healthcare because he greatly underestimates the amount of care needed (because he has never had to care for her).

I really don’t know what to do so any advice is much appreciated. Thank you and have a great day!

Edit: Thank you all for your suggestions and encouragement. My mom is planning to bring the family together and talk about how we can improve my grandmother’s care. Wish us luck that the meeting goes well!"
"My mom has Alzheimer's and in early November was placed in assisted living.   
The issue: in October my brother had his attorney draw up a POA, which she signed and this was witnessed by 2 people.  His attorney claims this was legal to do.

Mom can't remember things past a 15 minute timespan.  The POA she signed gives him complete control, that is, he is not a conservator for her estate.  

He now is acting like the house and all her items are his to dispose of as he pleases.   For example, after eating dinner at the local diner, he offered her items to the waitress.  

As her money pays for her nursing home care, these items should be sold, not given away.  When I pointed this out, he got super angry at me, told me to get out, then called the police on me when I didn't (and yes,  the cops came and told me to leave, which I did).

I don't think he's acting in her behalf as she would wish.  

Shouldn't someone with POA work in the interests of the trust? 

Does an absolute POA grant the power to change her will/trust?

Ugh, he has all the money so I'm unsure if I could even afford to contest his POA.   

Thank you in advance for any advice and *thank you*."
"Any advice on dishwashers? My dad loves to putter in the kitchen loading or unloading the dishwasher, cleaning counters, and hand washing large items. It's been his job since I was a kid. Mom would cook and dad would clean.  Recently, I noticed him putting dirty items into the clean dishwasher. And mom caught him trying to put dirty items back in the cupboard. 

I would hate to take this activity away from it because it seems to give him purpose and he seems to enjoy puttering for hours over a 10 minute cleanup. :)

I bought one of those clean/dirty signs but I'm pretty sure he isnt capable of reading/comprehending it. Should my mom or myself stand in the kitchen with him like a drill Sargeant inspecting his work? Should we tell him we will be doing it from now on? Find him another activity every time he tries to do dishes? Switch to paper plates? Is there such a thing as a dishwasher lock?"
"Hi Everyone, 
I'm sure I'm not the only one finding the lead up to Christmas especially hard, does anyone have any suggestions with how to cope? 

My husband and I live in a different state to my parents and now that we're staying with them I'm finding it really upsetting to see how much Dad has declined over the last year.

Dad always asks where I see myself in 10 years' time and usually I give really elaborate answers. Today I responded by asking where he saw himself in 10 years and he said that he didn't think he'd be around. I got so upset that I burst into tears and asked him not to say that. He patted me on the shoulder and said that it would be okay but he'd had a nice life and we all had our time.

He has a few other conditions and I had this horrible moment of realisation that he probably won't be here for too much longer. 

Even though I'm in my thirties, I don't feel ready to live without my father. What strategies do people have to avoid getting so upset?

"I mean no disrespect by asking this question, I tried googling it at length but found nothing. I know someone who was diagnosed recently at only 60 following a stroke after years of alcohol abuse and well I am wondering what the future holds for him. This is someone I’ve been interested in for a long time and now I fear it may never happen for us. Thank you"

My dad has Alzheimer’s disease.

My basic readings suggest that this terrible disease can have a large genetic factor.

Hello all,

Mom has been deteriorating pretty rapidly and can't be left alone anymore. She has become more confused and irate than in my last post and I don't think I'm able to provide the care she needs anymore. I've made a couple visits to facilities and will keep researching until I find the right fit (slightly overwhelmed in the different ways they provide care). However, while I'm searching I have also been feeling out how her reaction will be - and it does not bode well. Two weeks ago I took her to a doctor appointment and she asked ""You're not going to leave me here, are you?"" Which of course just crushed me knowing I will be leaving her somewhere soon. We had a great conversation last week where she was initially sad about the idea of moving to a care facility, but then came around. She became slightly optimistic and was at least interested in learning more. Unfortunately, that conversation did not stick. She has since mentioned that she will refuse to go anywhere else and once threatened to kill herself first. She's been experiencing a lot of emotional outbursts lately and I really have to be careful how I speak with her to avoid any issues. I really wanted this to be a mutual decision, or at least with her understanding slightly what was happening but at this point I think I'm going to have to surprise her. Which really sucks. 

So with all that - how did it go with you? Did you pretend the facility was something else? Did they read the sign in the parking lot and flip out? Did you stay for a while or leave immediately? I've heard that it's recommended to not visit for a couple of weeks so that they can get adjusted to the change. 

Thank you in advance!"
"I’m looking for some advice or personal experience maybe? My mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s two years ago and moved into a memory care home three months ago. She has had a hard time adjusting - says her life is over, she can’t believe her kids did this to her, everyone steals from her there. It’s actually a very nice place and we all visit often (there are three of us within an hours drive and we all go weekly).  I’m the youngest, I am married with a 7 year old daughter and very apprehensive about bringing mom home for Christmas. I know how awful that sounds. We brought her home for a weekend and it was a disaster by the second day. We brought her to my home again for Thanksgiving and she just ends up spiraling and crying and saying her life is over and she wants to die. The thought of my mom waking up alone on Christmas morning makes me ill, but the thought of having our first Christmas in our house be so chaotic and upsetting also makes me ill. I don’t even know if she would care that it’s Christmas. Am I making this more than it is because of my own guilt? It’s very upsetting for my daughter when my mom gets so upset and says the things she says. It’s a long story but my other siblings aren’t really willing to bring her “home” so it always falls on me. I feel so conflicted and just plain sad."
"I posted a comment here recently in which I mentioned my mother's upcoming neurology visit and MRI. I'm a nine-hour car ride away, so I couldn't be there for the appointments, but my stepfather tells me the doctor enrolled her in a clinical trial. He couldn't give me many specifics other than that it involved an IV medication taken monthly. According to information available on her neurologist's website, the study is for Donanemab.

Is that typical for early stage Alzheimer's? I mean, I love science, but I also want to stave this off as long as possible. I have concerns that this is because Mom and has junk insurance until she's eligible for Medicare at age 65 (July), and her plan won't cover anything else right now. I'll save my rant about US healthcare for another time.

Thank you. :)"
Dad has a mild case of Alzheimers and is considered to be a candidate for Aduhelm.  I know there is some controversy around the FDA's approval of this drug and side effects.  Can anyone advise if they know of anyone who has had a positive experience with Aduhelm?
"My grandmother passed away about a week ago from her long fight with Alzheimer’s. Her and my grandfather were married for 62 years. Before her passing he would have slight hiccups in his mind (usually at night time but nothing serious). But he cannot retain the information that she has passed away. Is he subconsciously blocking it out? Every day multiple times a day he asks where she is. As his family, it becomes overwhelming and heartbreaking having to keep reminding him and see him react as if it’s his first time hearing of it. Has anyone else experienced this? Is the grief of her loss effecting his memory?"
"Almost a year ago, my grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. She’s young, only 72. We drew up some durable financial POA papers, making my mother her POA and listing me as a secondary if my mother fails to perform her duties.

Around the time she was diagnosed my uncle started asking her to give him one of her twelve acres to put a mobile home on. We did a little research, realized how much she could end up losing and said no. He had a pretty big fit. My mom told him to please not ask for anything from my grandmother because with her Alzheimer’s it isn’t right. 

Over the last six months, my uncle has poisoned my grandmothers thoughts. He has convinced her that she doesn’t really have Alzheimer’s and that my mother is tricking her. He says my mother, who works in healthcare, got her “cronies” at the hospital to lie. My grandmothers Alzheimer’s has progressed so rapidly and she believes him. She’s very angry with my mother and has even created more paranoid ideas about her. 

Friday night, my mother went to visit my grandmother and check on things. She does this every Friday and arranges her medicine. My grandmother told her that my uncle took her to the mobile home place and she signed the papers. Mom blew up and my granny told her to get out. She told her she knows she’s tricking her, she doesn’t have Alzheimer’s and she doesn’t want anything to do with her. She said my uncle took her to see “a man” who changed it so that he will get everything when she is gone, and mom will get nothing. 

My mother says she is done. She is very stressed out and doesn’t want to be responsible for her anymore. I wish that was not the case, but I also understand that she is overwhelmed. I told her that I will take over now. 

So here is my plan. Please tell me if I am doing the right thing. And if you have any wisdom please share it. 

Tomorrow morning I am reporting my uncle for elder abuse. I am calling the mobile home business as well to notify them that she has Alzheimer’s and they cannot move forward. I will also call and make an appointment with an elder law attorney. I need the attorney to either remove my mother and make me the primary POA, or ask a judge to choose a conservator for my grandmother. 

Is there anything I am missing? Does that all sound correct to you? I just want to make sure she is taken care of. She is so young and I’m afraid we could have a very long road ahead. I live 2 hours away and just had a baby 3 months ago (who despises car rides) so I can’t be with her right now. I’m hoping that when the time comes for her to need full time care (which seems to be drawing near) maybe I can get her into a nice assisted living facility where I live so I can look after her and be with her. I’m scared for her. 

Also, I know that reporting my uncle has to be the right thing to do, but I’m worried that she will not be allowed to talk to him anymore. That would be devastating for her. He is an absolute monster for doing this, but she loves him and I’m afraid she won’t understand.

Any advice or encouragement would be so appreciated."
"My grandpa has been getting worse recently and calls me all hours of the day. It has gotten worse recently and my schedule is pretty packed with my masters program, internship, and work. He calls me any hour of the day or night and it disrupts my sleep as well. I feel bad for not being able to talk but I’ve explained my schedule multiple times and he has my schedule next to his calendar. Is there any way to help this?

Thanks in advance."
"My aunt has had a dramatic personality change in the last 5 years. She’s 59, no medical history besides depression (on an SSRI), college-educated, works in consulting, and lived an upper middle class lifestyle while raising 3 kids with her husband. About 5 years ago, she divorced my uncle stating she wasn’t in love with him anymore. Their family has lived several states away my entire life but about a year ago, she impulsively decided to move back to her home state (where I live as well as the rest of our extended family). As such, I’ve been spending much more time with her. Here are some weird things I’ve noticed: 

- horrible with finances, bought a nice home here that she cannot afford payments on, can’t afford car payments, talks about waiting for payday very often. She is still working as a consultant
- two separate car accidents within a year. Both single-vehicle incidents and involved crashing into the median. Couldn’t provide her location to a family member after the first accident but she was on a common highway and should’ve known where she was. First crash totaled her car, second resulted in needing all new tires 
- doesn’t remember the names of two cats she adopted a year ago. Each time they’re brought up she gives different names. It is not an act and she is not concerned about this 
- obsessed with dating. On every dating website and spends an excessive amount of time on them. Romanticizes every interaction she has with men (including mailman, security system repair man)
- doesn’t speak much when in a group. Almost seems like she’s having trouble following the conversation 
- her home is very messy, her dog is always so dirty and smelly 
- overall aloof and has expressed no concern about any of these situations, talking with her always just seems off 

All of these examples are out of character for her. I’m in med school so have brought up my concerns to my parents. Her paternal grandma had typical Alzheimer’s but mom is healthy at 81, dad was killed at age 42. She also has a 24 y/o son with Bipolar II. I’m particularly worried about her lack of awareness of the issues. It seems like early-onset Alzheimer’s to me but looking for outside input. Does this behavior remind you of your experience? Any other signs I should look for? Would love to hear anyone’s thoughts."
"Hello All...

Maybe some of you can help me. My mother in law was diagnosed with Alzheimers about two years ago. She lives a couple states away from us (about a two hour plane ride), and we are her closest family geographically. She has insisted on staying in that state, and now she is enrolled in a state funded program that covers the costs of her memory care facility/all other medical expenses. At this point it would be very difficult to relocate her to our state, as she is very fragile, and would become ineligible for the program covering her costs.

She recently began to decline and went to the hospital. She had very low blood pressure, had lost a lot of weight, and doctor's think she had a stroke. She is not eating much at all, is refusing food, and is rapidly losing weight/strength. The doctor's will not put it a feeding tube as they say she is still of sound mind and can make her own choices. My husband panicked and flew to see her in the hospital and has been successful getting her to eat some bites of things. He is afraid that if he leaves, she will stop eating again. At this point, he is willing to fly to her every few days to feed her, but this is not sustainable for us. Flying is very expensive, and we have young kids, and no help nearby. I know he wants to make sure he does everything in his power to help his mom survive as long as possible, but I'm not sure what to do about this. Anyone have thoughts/suggestions?"
"My mom just moved to memory care from assisted living a week ago. We set up her room, tried to make it homey. For the last 5 nights, my mom has had falls trying to get out of bed in the middle of the night. EMS has been called. We went to the ER one night. All labs were normal and the CT scans showed no trauma. The problem is it keeps happening and I’m worried she’s going to break something. She goes to bed way too early, like 5 pm. I’ve asked the staff to try to keep her up, but they said they can’t stop her from going to bed early? They recommended a hospital bed. Does that help? I got no slip socks but she won’t keep them on. Got her a no slip fall mat too. Her primary care doctor has not been helpful. Still waiting to hear back from her memory care doctor. Has anyone else had this issue? Any recommendations or ideas?"
"Hi there.

I'm wanting to get opinions on a gift idea for my MIL who has been diagnosed with Alzheimers. She currently lives about a thousand miles away from my family and my spouse is her only child. Her birthday is a few days before christmas, so I was considering making a special album for her with pictures and descriptions of everyone. It will include current pictures of our family (with her two grandkids) as well as some other pictures that my spouse has from childhood. 

Would this make a good gift, or do you think it could possibly upset her? She has good days where she knows us all, and other days where she doesn't remember her mom or my spouse.

Thanks for your help and advice!"
"Is it just me. I’ve figured out all the mirrors, windows and glass fronted pictures in the house. So I can stand in a lot of places and check on grandma through reflections in the building. E.g. I can see what they’re watching on TV from my bedroom. I can see they’re asleep when on the bog. And can see them in the kitchen when doing the laundry. Am I being over protective?"
"My father in law has a tendency to take off as soon as my mother in law leaves the room.  He's 80, alzheimer's diagnosis was 8 years ago.

Is the a way to keep him in his chair when she needs to use the bathroom?  Something like a seat belt for a recliner."

from the article:

 

“Sildenafil, which has been shown to significantly improve cognition and memory in preclinical models, presented as the best drug candidate,” said Dr Feixiong Cheng, the study lead. Viagra is the brand name of sildenafil.

Researchers then used a database of claims from more than 7 million people in the US to examine the relationship between sildenafil and Alzheimer’s disease outcomes by comparing sildenafil users to non-users.

They found sildenafil users were 69% less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease than non-sildenafil users after six years of follow-up.""

and later they caution:

 “Importantly, this research doesn’t prove that sildenafil is responsible for reducing dementia risk, or that it slows or stops the disease. The only way to test this would be in a large-scale clinical trial measuring sildenafil effect against the usual standard of care.” 

Other articles today say that getting cataract surgery was associated with a 30% reduced risk of alzheimer's 

[https://www.upi.com/Health\_News/2021/12/06/alzheimers-disease-viagra-sildenafil-cataract-surgery-study/8981638800935/](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2021/12/06/alzheimers-disease-viagra-sildenafil-cataract-surgery-study/8981638800935/)

From the article:

 

In more than 3,000 participants 65 years old and older, 853 developed dementia, with 709 cases of Alzheimer's disease, the data showed.

Approximately half of the participants had cataract surgery, and those who had the procedure in either eye were about 30% less likely to develop any form of dementia over at least the next 10 years, the researchers said.

Vision loss has been associated with an increased risk for all forms of dementia, due at least in part to its effect on independence and quality of life, so surgery to correct it may help keep older adults active and mentally engaged, according to the researchers."
"As we know, a diagnosis during life can only be ""probable"" at best. What are your thoughts on this? Anyone here got a post-mortem diagnosis for their loved one and felt at ease? Can they tell you when it started? Is it a healthy idea to try to analyze how far back she stopped being ""herself""? Can there be negative implications for your own life insurance or long term care insurance policy?

"I just wanted to rant because I’m so frustrated and angry at my grandfather. He is 91 years old and has bragged (after a few drinks) that he has managed to acquire a million dollars through saving and investments. My grandmother is mid-late stage at 88 years old. They still live alone. My parents and aunt worked to get a part time caretaker and he didn’t give her any tasks to do and refused to bring in another caretaker. 

We found assisted living and memory care facilities they could go together. My grandmother fell about a month ago and had to be in the hospital for 6 days. She is becoming incontinent, and she cannot walk without a lot of help. She rarely remembers anything that happened five minutes before. They only eat okay because the rest of the family brings prepared meals they can reheat. They sit and watch movies all day in a dark room. A healthy young person is incapable of providing all the care she needs, let alone a 91 year old man. He CAN AFFORD BETTER and chooses not to so he can pass on an inheritance to his children who have been getting by without his money for years just fine. I am horrified watching him mistreat his wife of over 60 years when he could easily afford the care she needs to live out her remaining years with some semblance of dignity. 

I’ve talked to him about it repeatedly, sent other resources, got other opinions, and he just says he’ll take it into consideration and does nothing. I call them both to chat multiple times a week but I live halfway across the country and it feels so hopeless knowing there is nothing else I can do to help my grandma."
"Just wondering- anyone have a parent diagnosed when they were a young child? And had to live with them during the progression of their Illness?

My dad was diagnosed when I was in the 5th grade. Rapidly declined while I was in 6-8 grade and lived at home. Put in nursing home 9th grade. Died in 10th grade. I am 33 years old now and just now learning how this trauma has affected me in to adulthood. Living with a parent that was sick in the way he was was horrible. Wondering if anyone else experienced this? Most stuff I see is young kids with a grandparent with alz."
"My mom has Alzheimer’s and it’s reached the point of delusions and hygiene issues. Getting her to bathe or put on new under wear is difficult because she is uncomfortable undressing, especially in front of my dad who is her primary caretaker and he’s at a loss. She seems to think men are coming into the house and stealing her underwear and laughing at her her but she keeps hiding it or throwing it away. She can’t be convinced otherwise and trying to reassure her doesn’t work either. So beyond buying new underwear every couple of weeks I don’t know what to do. I wash her hair in the sink and use wipes for her underarms. I can convince her to get in the tub maybe twice a week but she won’t wash her hair or clean herself just sit there. 

I’ve considered the disposable adult underwear because she does have some incontinence issues but won’t use her pads anymore cause she thinks “the guys will laugh at her.” 

Any hygiene or delusions tips would be great this is a new stage I’m struggling with 

Sorry if this isn’t the right space for this question, I just love my mom and want to maintain her dignity and cleanliness for as long as possible.

Edit: also going to talk to her doctors about antipsychotics or I’ve read good things about Nuplazid/Pimavanserin for the the delusions, studies are promising there. I’ll comment back if any progress there"
"Hi all. My dad’s mother is currently battling Alzheimer’s. It’s definitely been a challenge but we’re managing. We’re able to keep her laughing, which helps. 

My fear comes from the fact that my mother’s great grandmother had the disease, as well. With  it running on both sides of the family, I worry for my parents and their future. I also am worried about my own. 

Coping with losing the woman my grandma used to be is very difficult. It’s harder to think this could be passed on to either (or both) of my parents. This may be a very selfish way of thinking. I just really want to know if anyone has experienced these fears or has any information on the genetic side of it all?"
"I received some very bad news today, that made me extremely sad. My mother, who it’s hard to even call her that anymore, seemed to have a moment of being able to relate on some level, and tried to comfort me. Which was nice and much needed.

The problem is, she’s not my mother anymore. All her worst characteristics have become so enormously magnified, to the point where sometimes, I feel as if I’m being gaslighted in my own home. It’s so bad, that I wonder if she is feigning frailty and a bad memory. I know how bad this sounds, trust me.

This news was confidential from a family member. I told her it was not to be discussed or repeated (I also know how stupid THAT sounds, telling someone with Swiss cheese for brains that you must or must not do anything…). If I hadn’t been so distraught, I would have never had this interaction with her. Anyone whose parent lives with them knows how hard it is to remember that this Alzheimer’s person isn’t the person that you used to know as your parent.

In the short time I had left to go to an appointment, she had called the family member to talk about this thing, breaking my trust with this family member. I do not know how to fix this. I just now know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the mother I once knew is gone forever. No more confidante, friend, or source of comfort. Just a shell with some automatic nerves firing that make her do things that make everyone a tiny bit more crazy than they would be otherwise. I apologize if I sound a little over the top. I have no other outlet for venting the pain and emotion that come from daily living this nightmare."
"After many good conversations with family and friends, I've come to the point where condolences and a willing ear are enough for me to work through what's happening.

**Can anyone recommend how they were able to work through and process an immediate family member's decline?**

I'm 34 and I've been dealing with her decline for a few years now (which is relatively young to be watching your mom slip away).

I've realized there are some things I haven't quite worked through or gotten over regarding the situation and they're taking their toll on my life (escapism, avoidance, substance abuse, depression, guilt, resentment, indecision, etc.)

I'm willing to try whatever it takes (books, therapy, groups, whatever).

Thank you."

for context, i live with my grandma. i went downstairs to get breakfast and my entire family was there. my grandma asked who i was and i immediately knew she wasn’t joking. 

i think it might’ve been an episode because later i asked if she knew who i was (which upon reading this subreddit i now know i shouldn’t do i think?) and she said my name and that i’m her granddaughter. i haven’t stopped crying though. it’s getting bad.

i don’t even know if she actually remembers me or if she feels bad and is pretending.

"Hi everyone, 

I have been working hard over the past two or three weeks to arrange residential aged care for my mother, who at first  was dead set against it. She has been in hospital for two months due to a huge delirium eposide followed by the diagnosis of her Alzheimers and other health issues and the doctors would not let her go home, saying she now needs 24/7 nursing care She has severe COPD, a movement disorder which makes her fall, incontinence and now Alzheimers.

She got accepted today to a really great place  - perfect for her. She even agreed on this choice (from the brochures) and was looking forward to getting out of hospital. She was due to go on Monday.

Then today the hospital called and said she has a COPD exacerbation, which is being treated with antibiotics and they are hoping it will improve by Monday.....but they are not sure if it will ever get better - it could turn into pneumonia or they just might not be able to get on top of it. They gave me the 'talk' about how much we think they should treat her and all that goes with it. We hope it doesn't come to that. This doctor was hopeful that because her oxygen levels haven't changed that she will rally, but oh boy, she sure knows how to throw a curve ball!

Thanks for reading. Not sure what I am feeling right now."
"My grandma has moderate Alzheimer’s and recently she has been telling everyone she can’t breathe. After 7+ visits to the doctor and the emergency room this past week, she was given a machine for oxygen. However, she still states she can’t seem to catch her breathe and she insists that the machine isn’t working correctly. She was without oxygen for a few hours yesterday but had no idea that the temporary tank they gave her ran out.  (She was fine during this time and didn’t complain) she keeps insisting on going back to emergency to which the we doctors tell me that she is fine and that her oxygen levels are fine. I could really use some advice as we are all out of ideas. TIA"
"it's constant. she cannot walk on her own, and they've put her on Ativan 2x day and a sleeping med at night, but every waking moment she is trying to get up and (if I help her stand) immediately sitting down again. I don't know how to help her feel more comfortable. I'm just at a loss and she's so agitated. she can't remember why she wants to get up but she wants to get up literally every waking second. has anyone else had a similar experience?"
"My grandma was crying again just before because of general confusion and I gave her a long hug, and just kept saying ""You're okay, it's okay. It's going to be okay."" So I put on The Wizard of Oz, which always seems to cheer her up. She saw it in theaters in 1939, when she was seven years old. She became a lifelong fan of Judy Garland. Just last year, around this time, she watched it and loved it. The next day, she was sad and said ""I want to watch The Wizard of Oz again."" 

2021 has been a devastating year for her. Around April, it was becoming more and more obvious to all of us that she was hitting a new stage. Now, I'm just feeling so awful. I was saying at the beginning ""Look grandma. It's The Wizard of Oz. Your favorite movie."" No reaction. One good thing was when Judy Garland was singing Somewhere Over the Rainbow, I said ""It's Judy Garland."" She smiled and said ""Yes! You like her?"" I said yes. But for most of it during the first 20 minutes, she wasn't into it. In fact she just said ""This on the picture, it's cute. But it's enough."" Then she wanted to go back upstairs. This has got to be the cruelest disease in the world."

"Our mom has Alzheimer's. It seems to be progressing pretty fast. She pretty much needs 24 hour assistance. She currently lives in a small town with a friend of many years. This friend has become her default caretaker. We have arranged someone else to come in 3 days per week to help with showering and housework as well as to give the other lady a break now and then. Both my mom and her friend are in their late 70s to early 80s. It has become evident that her friend is no longer able to provide the supervision necessary for my mom, and living in a small town there are no good options to get her competent 24 hour care. 

We are currently starting the process of fixing up the house next to my brother's house. He bought it a while back and was planning on renting it out. Our plans were to move her in there which is closer to a big city and we should be able to get competent help as well as having her close to my brother and his wife, me and my wife, and my brother's daughter and her husband and child. She also loves animals and would be able to spend time with my brother's dogs and I would take mine over to visit on weekends. 

We just recently found that she has been trying to roam at night. I had to put up door chimes because she went outside naked at 4 am. I then found out today that when her and her friend were at the hair salon she went to the bathroom and walked back out naked. She should not have been going to the bathroom alone anyway, but it happened. 

I am starting to question whether 24 hour home care would be better than moving her into a memory clinic. They are set up for people with dementia and I am hoping would be able to work better with her doctor to treat symptoms and recognize symptomatic behavior than a non medical home care giver. They also have a routine and she would be around people in a similar situation, so she might not feel so embarrassed all of the time. 

She recently inherited enough money to pay for any care that we decide to go with assuming she is not some anomaly that lives to be well past 100.

I would prefer to move her into the house and be able to visit whenever we want and feel like she had some independence, but I am concerned that this inclination, much like letting her stay in her house with her friend caring for her is what is easier and will make me feel less guilty, not that it is what is best for her. 

I also worry that making the decision to put her in the clinic is more or less because it would be cheaper than 24 hour at home care and once it was done, would be less work and decision making on our part. 

We need some unbiased input. I am looking for a doctor that specializes in memory care in our area and hope to see if they will give any input, but for now thought I would ask here.

Thank you if you read all the way through, and doubly so if you have any input."
"I am her POA. I was allowing her to keep her physical credit card but she keeps losing it and her drivers license. They are somewhere in her apartment but I can't find either and neither can she. I hate to do it but I think I will report her credit card lost, and then keep the new one and only order her groceries online. She also keeps losing her cash, her wallet, etc.

How have you guys gone about this without making the person with AD hate you? I already feel like her AD has ruined my relationship with her. I took away her car, I made her move into senior living like her doctor suggested, etc.

I'm so sick of being the bad guy."
"My mom cared for my grandma who passed away from Alzheimers a number of years ago and now I have the honor of caring for my mom as she navigates her own bout. 

Oddly, the techniques I use to help my mom, I learned from her as she cared for my grandma. 

A thought I have, that always makes my eyes well up is that if she was totally aware of what was happening now, she'd be super proud of how I'm caring for her and would probably laugh at all the goofy stuff she says and does because of this disease. 

For those of us that are caring for our parents, I hope you know they're proud of you too."
"Hi all - my name is Lisa and I'm reaching out to share a giveaway that's currently open for entries by Nations Photo Lab for 50 free Custom Memory Books.  The books are intended to be given to a loved one with Alzheimer's, with the idea that photos can help stimulate memories.  As someone who watched three of four grandparents suffer from Alzheimer's, I hope these books can help spark a little joy to whoever needs it most.

Having suffered watching family members be destroyed by this disease. How do you deal with the fear of or plan for what may happen to you.
"Some days can be really, brilliantly, good. Today grandma was really talkative, even asking for her hearing aids (that she normally refuses). Did all the exercises without complaints.  Learned how to use the new TV remote. Ate at relatively sensible times, even made herself a snack when I was distracted on the phone. She remembered a friend is coming tomorrow so has to go to bed at a sensible time.
When I made dinner, she gave me a big smile, said she knows she is awkward sometimes and thanked me for looking after her.
I had to run off and have a happy cry…"
"My dad passed suddenly today. Yesterday we were told he wasn't eating much and today the same. Not an hour after I spoke to the hospice nurse, they called back to say my dad had passed. He was 71 and had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2018. We had just moved him to a new facility a little over two weeks ago after a tumultuous experience with his old facility. The hospice nurses were with my dad when he passed. Unfortunately I nor my mom were there as I am waiting to pick her up at the airport. I don't know how I'll tell her. She'll never forgive herself. Thank you for all the support. You all are lifesavers."
My father-in-law is starting to show signs of Alzheimer's. He keeps accusing my dog of peeing on the floor but my dog isn't. We tell him that the floor is dry and my dog didn't pee and my father-in-law yells at us and says we're accusing him of lieing. He gets really mad at us. How do I handle that? It's not the only thing he does that with.
"Little bit of background: In early September of this year I became the primary caretaker for my uncle. I'd only met this man six times in my entire life, so it's been a whirlwind of change for everyone involved. He's been very independent in his life and despite being diagnosed with Alzheimers and moderate cognitive decline, he is living in his own studio apartment in a retirement community. As he progresses, I'm hoping he'll have enough money to move to their assisted living and then to their memory care. Well just have to see. Anyway, having had little contact with him over the years has presented a bit of a challenge as I don't know his routines, likes, etc. And his decline is much more readily apparent since he's been under my care because before he was living alone on a 20 acre property in a rural community and worked hard to keep himself together. 

I recently put an Amazon Echo Dot in his apartment. It allows him to play music he likes, find out the weather, simple things like that. I've also been able to find out that he often asks if I'm safe and where I am, so I set up routines so when he asks those questions he gets answers that give him comfort. I also set up a calendar to include activities offered in his community, with reminders and information about the location of the activity. This has been helpful to remind him when he needs to meet my mom (his sister) for a ride to the doctor, when his beloved Cowboys play and on what channel, etc. Just a note that I changed the default wake word from Alexa to Ziggy because he can remember Ziggy much easier. 

Yesterday I set things up so he can use the Echo to control his Christmas tree lights and his lamps by his couch. Next is the light in his ceiling fan and for Christmas I'll be setting up his television.

We still have issues with the product, but are finding this helps him maintain some independence, so I wonder if anyone else uses it and how it's used. Thanks!"
":: Today, while watching the Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade ::  

Nobody:  

Mom: “Oh look! Here comes Santa and his slaves!”"
"When I was little I wept at the end of Mary Poppins, when she floated away. My mother found me and asked why I was so distraught, and I didn’t really know, until now. I have been watching my mother get smaller and smaller over the past 2 years. Today she could barely open her eyes and squeezed my hand. I think we are close to the end, she was Mary Poppins to me I loved her. The sky some how seems more empty without her."
"Thanks everyone for your replies… my dad did apologize and I’m working on dealing with my sadness…

My parents and I have had a difficult relationship since I was a teenager due to my mother’s rage fits, which my father enabled. For many years they weren’t a part of my life and it was very hard. In the last ten years, I have reconnected with my dad and during the pandemic we became close, talking multiple times a week. More recently I am working on building a relationship with my mom. It is hard because I do get triggered around her, but things are getting better. 

For the past few months, I’ve been going through a conflict with my parents where my feelings got very hurt. My father has been crappy to me and has hardly called. The conflict was about me trying to come and spend more time with them and how to pay for that. My mom and I worked it out. 

Just now I was talking with my dad and explaining to him that my feelings were hurt by how he’s treated me. He said “well I was upset because you said some disturbing things about your mother.” What did I say? “You said you wished she was dead.”

I never have, and never would, say such a thing, particularly to my father. It killed me that he invented this memory about me (and no one else in the family) because I have been trying so hard to be there for him and be with him. I was also always the scapegoat for problems in our family. He has never said anything like this before or had an untrue memory before. Ithurts that I’m the first one. Looking for some support"
"Hey everyone, my dad has early onset alzheimers and we were looking for certain activities that help him with memory or basically just hobbies. Sudoku and puzzles didnt work well, so any ideas would be appreciated. Also, whoever is reading this who has a loved one with Alzheimers, or knows anyone who has it, you are not alone and focus on your loved one, not how awful the disease is, and you are not alone.

Edit- Wow, I was not expecting all of these helpful tips. Thanks to everyone!"
"My dad got his official Alzheimer’s diagnosis a few months ago after years of “generic” dementia. He lives with me in my home where I take care of him financially and also am his only caregiver. He can shower and feed himself right now but not much beyond that. 

I’ve been given no POA, no medical proxy, nothing. He’s too sick/stubborn to see he needs help and yet I am entirely responsible for him. Currently I commute an 75 minutes each way so he can stay in this town but I want to move and I don’t want to be responsible for him anymore. My therapist is shocked I’ve done as much as I have when it’s causing me crippling depression and anxiety. 

How do I get social services in? They’ve said I can’t call and request any services because I don’t have POA. I can’t get POA. I’ve spoken with the doctor and he said he can’t do much either. Sometimes, especially recently, I am tempted to leave him in the side of the road so a silver alert can be filed and he can get put in social services radar. 

Right now I’m hemorrhaging money and time. I’ve given up jobs, relationships, and financial freedom to care for him and I can’t kick him out. He had zero retirement, savings, or assets. 

At what point can I just say it’s too much for me and social services step in because I’m there. What would happen if he hadn’t already lived in my house I inherited when this all went down? I’m 100% alone and it’s beyond caregiver burn out. He needs to be someone else’s problem because he’s just mad at me for trying to take care of him."
"My mother has early onset Alzheimer’s, she was diagnosed maybe 3ish years ago but has been exhibiting symptoms for maybe 5 years prior to her diagnosis.
In the last 6 months she has had significant cognitive decline. I can see it really affecting my family, especially my father who at this stage is her main carer but still works a full time job. 
Me and my sisters take turns and going over and spending time with her. Today I came over and she seems especially bad. She won’t get out of bed, she seems to have increased confusion and isn’t eating. She told me she threw up this morning and all she wants to do is sleep. I’m so worried about her and I’m also worried about my own mental health. Her decline has had a serious effect on my own person struggles with this terrible disease. 
Can anyone lend any insight, advice or kind words to support and help me and my family?"
"I posted earlier about suggestions for a new tv remote for Dad & thanks to some great advice I got him a Flipper from the alzheimer's store. 

Problem now is he thinks the remote is a toy & only gives him pre-programmed tv shows & not what is actually on tv at the moment. Is there any way to solve these kinds of problems when they come up."
This article brings me hope. I truly hope we find a treatment within the next few years. https://www.nj.com/healthfit/2021/11/biotechnology-brings-new-approach-and-fresh-hope-to-alzheimers-research.html
"Mom has moderate Alzheimers and has some days where she's far more confused than others. Today was a bad day; she was difficult, sometimes angry, demanding food after forgetting having just eaten. At the end of the night though she unknowingly lightened the mood by announcing to the family that she thinks she might be pregnant. Sometimes you have to laugh to cope.   
Edit: Apparently this is called ""Delusion of pregnancy"" and is an unusual symptom of dementia."
"So I'm looking into memory care for my dad. He has difficulty speaking (was weirdly the first thing to go) needs help dressing, keeping on top of his hygiene, and obviously making sure to eat. He's still very mobile but obvious can get confused easily. He doesn't wander but who knows if that would change in a new place.

Money shouldn't be a problem as I'm currently paying out the ass for home care and it will end up cheaper to move him.

My questions are, what have been your experiences with the more standard nursing home vs the more residential based care homes? Also how much one on one time can be expected? Will someone make sure he gets his meals and does activities? Do they limit how many personal items a person can have? How do you tell when a place is giving you an honest set of expectations vs bullshit?

I know it's different for every place but I'm interested to hear personal experiences."
"Due to our past, I just can't even deal with her stubbornness. She digs her heals in on anything. I'm here to help, but I can't force her to take a cognitive test, though there are some signs of very weird behavior and confusion.

The first thing she brought up was that they ""take you away to a nursing home."" I tried to assure her, if that even happens, it would be for people who wander in the middle of the night and you find them across town. Nowhere near where she's at. 

I tried pushing the line of any just being ""elderly"", it's a good idea to get a baseline test. Reassuring that she's totally fine. Met with resistance, ""I don't need to do that."" 

She filed a police report about neighbors for, it's confusing, but I think using her youtube account to watch movies? She's focused on these neighbors a couple other times.

Not sure what to do really. Mostly she's all there, but I suspect something. But she's really resistant to getting any kind of cognitive test. My father has also noted concern about her, and himself too. I was hoping it could be a low-key ""everyone get a cognitive test because of age"" thing, but I was met with a lot of resistance. I tried presenting it as a ""You're fine, nobody's taking you to a nursing home, let's just get a baseline"" but it was met with a lot of resistance and shut down immediately.

Not really sure what to do."
"I'm 27 y/o and my dad, who is 58 y/o, was formally diagnosed with early onset back in February. It's probably been about 3 years since he started having issues, and at first he was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment. It's been hard. 

I really don't think my mum is coping well, she's always been one to take things out on other people and doesn't have a ton of patience. She's dealing with her elderly parents as well. That's not to say she isn't a wonderful and caring person, I just think a situation like this tends to exacerbate a person's less than great traits. 

My dad still drives, he's still self-sufficient, but he's been getting more and more confused lately. He's been a musician all my life and was in a duo when I was younger and has recorded two albums. He's always played with friends and has had jam nights, obviously less now due to COVID. The other night he was at a jam session at a friend's house, and he told me he just couldn't keep up and was really down about it. 

I guess I'm just looking for any advice, or even to talk to someone who is in a similar situation. Most support groups I've found are for caregivers or teens with a grandparent who has it. I guess I'm just trying to get a handle on what to expect, and if there's even any sort of rough timeline for this. I've just been thinking a lot lately about whether my dad will be around for my wedding or if he will get to meet my kids one day (I'm single, so it isn't like any of that is on the horizon). I like to have an idea of the process and next steps and what I can expect (I'm a lawyer, hazard of the trade). I just feel lost.

If you've made it this far, thank you, I really appreciate it. Just felt like I needed to get this off my chest."
"My father has early onset Alzheimer’s. For the most part, other than irritability and forgetfulness, he’s still functioning very well right now. 

He was on a horse today and the saddle wasn’t on correctly and he fell off. Some facial numbness, short term blurry vision and not remembering the fall came right after. He’s on the way to the hospital to get checked out now for a concussion and everything. 

My question is will this affect his Alzheimer’s or make it worse in any way?"

"My grandma recently got alzheimer, how can i deal with it?
Im not the most patient person in the world, and it is getting to my nerves she askin the same thin 4 times a day and every day, forgeting all the medicinrs she has to take and lot more things, do you guys have some advice? 
I'm young and don't want to throw my life away tsking care of her full time."
"My dad (58) has been progressively getting worse. He's always been verbally abusive to me, my mom and my sister. I know for anyone who has a loved one with Alzheimer's, it often makes the person irritable, verbally abusive and even aggressive to a point where they don't recognize their loved one anymore. For us, it seems to just amplify what was already there, with the addition of having conservations with himself, wandering, and unable to toilet himself. My mom has a caretaker while she's at work and she's paying out of pocket for that. We are in NJ. She has been trying for a place since August/September. The first 2 homes turned him down because he needs a nursing home and NOT assisted living, which they were. TO be honest, I didn't know there was a difference at first. My dad is becoming more verbally aggressive and was screaming and cursing all day. He was never physical before but now we are super concerned it will get worse. He also randomly starts dancing in between the screaming, it looks almost manic.

&#x200B;

Is there a way to get an emergency check in at a nursing home that can handle him? We can't officially apply for Medicaid until a place takes him and some places wont take him while it is pending. Are there any other emergency options?"
"This is a difficult question, and may not fit with the group/might offend someone and I apologize in advance, it’s not intentional. 
I need an opinion on something and I’m not sure the right group of people to ask, I thought someone here might have an opinion/advice to offer. Sorry for the length. TLDR at the end 

So my mum was diagnosed a few years ago, she has early onset and is now 66. She’s pretty much a toddler at this point, has little short term memory etc. My dad is her primary and she’s on the list for LTC, she was actually accepted to one faster than he was expecting, so turned it down, he wasn’t ready and she’s not at the point where she needs to be in a home just yet. We’re thinking she will be there in a year or so. 
The last few years of not having my mum in my life, specifically because of COVID, but also because she’s not calling me or being super involved in family things like she used to, because obviously she can’t, has made it incredibly clear how much of a negative impact my mother was on my life and mental health. As I’ve worked to improve many aspects of my life, get myself medicated properly for my depression and anxiety as well as being recently diagnosed with ADHD (making so much of my life and childhood make sense finally) I’ve looked back on my childhood and the memories I have of my mother are truly awful. I’ve come to the realization that she was a massive narcissist, and unfortunately, I was her target. My older sister was her favourite and I realized that all the abuse I received from my sister was learned and groomed from my mother. My saving grace in all this is that my sister grew out of it and she and I are best friends now. She has addressed her behaviour from when we were kids many times over and I have forgiven and we have grown so much closer together. She received some of my mothers narcissism when she had her own kids (mostly because I was older and she could no longer get to me) and that pulled us together, because I could help and support her. I told my sister stories from when I was younger, things that she did to me that either she was unaware of or that she remembers, but having it put in perspective from an adult looking back, has horrified her. 
So my issue is this. I’m having a very difficult time feeling any empathy towards my mother, to the point that I want little to do with her. I’m very supportive of my dad and want to help him where I can, but I’m struggling even looking at it trying to talk to my mum. All I feel is anger and resentment when I look at her.
My question, should I sit down and talk to my dad about this? My sister and I have a really good relationship with him. I feel like I need to let him know where I’m at and why. But I don’t want to offload more stress on him. I know that he feels bad about the missed ADHD diagnosis, as I struggled my whole life not knowing what was wrong with me and if they had actually been hands on parents they may have caught it when I was a kid. 
As caregivers, what would you think is a good direction to go? Is this too much to put on someone’s plate who already has a lot? 
TLDR: my mother screwed me up and I’m having issues feeling empathy for her/wanting to help her. Don’t know if I should let my dad know what’s going on."
"My dad (69) was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s about a year ago. He was a psychiatrist before he retired, so he’s very hard on himself and knows what’s coming better than any of us. To me, he still appears fine. He’s very well spoken and smart, just slightly mixed up about unimportant things. He’s always been forgetful. Recently, however, he’s given up reading and driving and said he feels like he has no life. He’s struggling with audio books and word games. I’d like to get him something, either now or for Xmas, that he can enjoy. The only thing he really does is watch TV (though his wife says it’s hard for him to follow sometimes) and gardening, but it’s getting to be cold and less enjoyable. Anything I can get him that he can do long term to fill up the day, and won’t have to give up for a long time? Especially something that makes him feel “proactive” with the illness? I live far away, but I’d be willing to start a similar hobby or activity from where I am so he has someone to talk to about it. I’ve thought about learning a language with him, but he wants to learn Polish and that’s just too hard for me at the moment. He also seems to start and stop hobbies out of frustration. But maybe something like that, to build his confidence? 
Thanks!!!"
"My parents have long term care insurance, and my dad has Alzheimers.  In order to trigger the long term care insurance, we need certification that he needs substantial assistance from another individual in 2 or more ADLs (Activities of Daily Living).  If you asked him, he doesn't think he does, but if you ask Mom she says otherwise.  But we are talking about the more borderline things... like cooking.    He can still shower and all that kind of stuff on his own.  But can't remember where he is often.

Anyone have any experience triggering long term care insurance?  Can you say how hard or easy it was?

Thanks"
"Hi! I am currently working in a recreation department at a nursing home. I entertain and play with a group of people with dementia and/or alzheimer, ranging from around 75 to 98 years old. We're usually 12 to 15, all of them sitting on couches in the shape of half a circle. They never get up during the activities.

I'd like new ideas for activities I could do with them. Drawing/writing doesn't work, and they don't really like it. They want to move, think, have fun.

I'm not a fan of singing songs or reading stories, but at moments there are guests that do so. I almost always put music in the background of my activities too"
"Obviously I hope that everyone in the home who has it is ok but other than that, I don't know how to feel.

Mum doesn't have it and she's been double vaccinated, and other than her Alzheimer's she's in pretty good health (she's only 64). Part of me hopes, well, I don't know if ""hopes"" is the word I'm looking for... part of me feels like it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if she got it and passed from it, because she's confused and anxious and stressed all the time and this would be a much kinder way to go than however many months or years she has left with the Alzheimer's. 

But it feels so awful and selfish to think like that about your own mother whom you love and miss dearly and are actively grieving for.

I'm really struggling with how I'm feeling to the point where I just feel numb because I can't figure it out."
"I’m staying with my grandparents to help care for my grandmother while my grandfather recovers from a hip replacement. Her nurse mentioned that soda is linked to Alzheimer’s and I did some research and see it clearly is. My grandmother drinks almost nothing but soda all day. And always has. I want to tell my grandfather that I want her drinking other things because it’s known to cause and make Alzheimer’s worse. Should I not say this to him though? I don’t want to upset him and have him thinking they’ve been messing up all this time. But he is the type that would prefer to know truth and not be Sheilds to protect feelings. Is it okay to say “grandpa, I think we should have grandma not drink as much soda, as it is known to cause and worsen Alzheimer’s.”
None of my other grandparents were soda drinkers and they’re all sharp as a tack and close to 90. The only other person I’ve known with Alzheimer’s was a woman who got it at 65 and obsessively drank soda. Is it worth telling him? I worry it might not be worth it since she’s so far gone already and it might make him feel like they did it to themselves"
"Watching the repeat of the ceremony at the cenotaph from earlier today with grandma. She's having trouble contemplating that it's a repeat of something she missed earlier. (""Why is it light there, but dark outside"")? 

But she loves singing along to the tunes the marching bands are playing. it seems to bring something up."
"Partner (senior) having difficulty completing tasks. They tried to explain it to me and they said, they will be doing a task but the other part of their brain tells them to go on to a different task. So they don’t finish the current task and move on to the next. Sometimes it feels like they’re going in a circle. Does this sound like Alzheimer’s? His family doctor prescribed donzepil but his heart doctor told him to not take this medication unless it’s absolutely necessary. I haven’t noticed anything strange yet but it’s worrisome. And he won’t go to an actual specialist. :("
"I haven't really talked about this with anyone outside of my circle or with clients who needed to know why I wasn't available. A month ago, my dad had a stroke. He had a stroke last year, too, but it was a small one and we thought he was just declining in his alzheimers. He bounced back relatively well from that one. This time, he didn't.

He's been spending a lot of his days just laying in bed, eyes closed. We celebrate any times he opens his eyes or speaks clear words. He is getting in-home hospice care, which is exactly what we all wanted for him when his time would come - to pass away peacefully at home.

Today he had a really good day, and that kind of scares me. I know that terminal patients can rally when they are close to death. They can act almost like normal, even, which seemed to be what my dad did today. I couldn't get to the house soon enough to witness it myself - I only saw the after math once he had tuckered himself out, and he did seem more energetic.

Here's the crazy thing - and I say this as a person who no longer entertains the super natural... Our dad's caretaker who has been with him for almost 9 years now, told us a few months ago that dad grabbed her hand, and said very clearly (despite his tendency to mumble after the first stroke) that he would die on November 18. Again, I try and take these things with a grain of salt but with his burst of energy today and knowing that patients can rally before death, I'm kind of freaking out a little. It doesn't help that two days ago, the only clear thing he said to me all day was, ""Don't be afraid"". Again, kind of had the opposite effect.

I don't know why I'm writing this. Thers been so much on my mind and I can barely keep up with my own life because of what's happening. Every day just kind of looms over my head, and I never know what the last day will be. We're all just kind of taking it a day at a time and looking towards Nov 18 with a skeptical eye. I want to tell myself he's doing well and who knows what will happen, because he's always been strong. But he's 91 and an alzheimers patient... The ironic thing is that he didn't believe in spiritual or supernatural things, either. The irony.

Anyways... I just kind of wanted to write something out. I know most of my siblings understand what it is to ""rally"" but my half sister takes a good day and seems to think he'll be fine, and I hate having to listen to false hope. When my mom died, so many people had false hope, but I was the one who spoke to the doctors and knew what was going on, but I was dismissed when I tried to exppain that to people because, ""you never know what will happen!!!"" And right, you don't know, but we have a pretty good idea of where this is heading.

Like I said, I have no idea why I'm posting this. Just trying to work out my jumbled thoughts with other people who know what alzheimers does to someone. For ten years, I kept thinking I can't mourn my dad anymore, and then he gets worse and there I am, again. I didn't expect to feel this way when he was closer to passing away. I thought I would feel relief that he wasn't suffering anymore, but he had his small forms of happiness that he enjoyed. I was still happy when I could buy him something he'd like to eat, even when he couldn't swallow solid foods anymore. Sure, he could no longer appreciate the birds outside, but I can't count how often I'd catch him petting the cat or dog. He seemed to be at peace for those moments.

Now I'm just happy if he opens his eyes slightly if I speak to him.

It just sucks I can't appreciate that he had a good day today without worrying it may be his last 'good' day. I hate thinking like that. Anyways, thank you for letting get that off my chest."
"TL;DR: the title. Dramatic, sudden decline - anyone else have experience with delirium in a loved one with ALZ?

My MIL, who I love dearly, has early-onset (diagnosed at age 60).  She's 30+ years divorced and has lived alone since my husband, her only child, moved out. No other family close or close by. She knew something wasn't right but hid it for a long time, and unfortunately jumpstarted her noticeable progression by abruptly stopping taking antidepressants, which she had been on for over fifteen years. Her symptoms began progressing with a vengeance. We knew something was up, but this was right as covid got serious early last year, and it was incredibly difficult to visit her (she lived 7 hours away) and pursue a diagnosis, as most medical facilities in the area were closed except for emergencies. So it was some time before we received a diagnosis. 

We dropped everything when we finally knew for sure what was happening, sorted and took over her financial situation, sold her house, sold her car (both after *numerous* discussions with her and after assuring her full consent, meanwhile keeping her friends apprised of each decision and why), moved her to be near us, into a very nice apartment building. My husband sees her every day before and after work. We have respite car visits all but one day a week, twice a day for some days. I visit her often, make her a lunch every single day. We do things with her on the weekends - drives, walks, rock-hunting. We've done, in short, absolutely everything we can to make sure she's safe, healthy, and as happy as you can be when you know you have Alzheimer's.

She's been here since last August, and for the *most* part had seemed to have plateau'd. I mean, there's always good days and bad days, and the slow but noticeable decline, but overall things seemed somewhat sustainable. Last month we began to get serious about arranging assisted living - MIL was still okay, but we could tell things were beginning to approach that eventuality.  And then, a week and a half ago, she just.. fucking tanked. Waaay more confused, losing words at a MUCH greater frequency, making things up, getting lost in her apartment, crying a LOT. She stayed up all night a few days ago and 'packed' about three-quarters of the stuff in her apt because she was 'moving back home.' My husband has had to leave work twice today - once because she had hidden her phone in the dryer and wasn't answering, once because she managed to call him, crying, because she didn't know where she was. I'm probably going to have to go and stay with her after I write this, in all likelihood.

This is *drastic*. We're trying to get hold of her neurologist, but this looks, feels, and sounds a lot like an episode of delirium to me. Around the time this started, she started a new med - the antidepressant that she had been taking before this all started. She also is very stubborn about eating and drinking sometimes.

Has anyone else experienced delirium with someone who has Alz? Are there other telltales? Have you also experienced a much more rapid decline in the person even after it was addressed?

We moved like lightning (thank god we'd already started planning) and are moving her in to a facility next week, but I'm trying to get a better picture of what the future looks like after this - I'm afraid it's gonna be different than what we had anticipated before.

Thanks in advance. Love to all you guys - I hope your strength does not fail you and you remember to love yourselves too."
"Just putting this out there for any good karma, prayers, or wishes I can get!  

She is 86 and fighting, threw her tray at them when they confined her to her room.  Go mom!  

Word is some staff were refusing vaccinations though required by NY.   

Best wishes and all good returned to all of you going through this double nightmare."
"I'm a 36 year old who's mother is beginning to progress down the path.  Her mother had Alzheimer's, her sister has Alzheimer's, and although she has seen several doctors, including some specialists, she is yet to be diagnosed.  However, she forgets things minutes after having lengthy conversations about them.  This finally came to a head this past weekend when I made the two hour trip to see her for her retirement party.  She's in her mid 60s and I think she would have worked until she dropped dead, but I'm suspecting her work is ""*suggesting*"" she retire now.  Anyways, we were at dinner and as she was looking at the menu she kept asking if she liked a particular item. Over....and over....and over....   

While we were there, she mentioned that her neurologist wants to get her to use this newer drug Aduhelm.  I've read quite a bit of controversy about this.  Including someone who died here very recently, potentially from brain swelling (a known side effect.

I told her I feel like we should get her a referral to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MINN.  Anyone have any experience with this?

Sorry this was a little scattered and rambling."

"In 2017, shortly after our 23&Me test came back showing that my mom (now 72) and I (now 38) had one copy of the APOe4 Alzheimer’s risk gene, I began to notice odd blips in her communication, namely, constantly reversing pronouns (always “he” for females and “she” for males) and becoming more easily tongue-tied. In addition, she became confused in the airport when traveling to visit me in NYC and was increasingly paranoid that her debit card had been hacked, thus carrying massive sums of cash to avoid using it.

However, she still scored 28/30 on her MOCA in 2018 (not great given that she was once a brilliant engineer), and there was no noticeable further decline until the pandemic and with it extreme stress, isolation, sudden weight loss/frailty, and a catastrophic series of spinal fractures from rapidly progressing osteoporosis. In just 8 months, mom looked and sounded like she’d aged 10 years. A trip to the gerontologist in fall 2020 revealed her MOCA score had plummeted to 21. The doctor suggested early-stage Alzheimer’s. Mom went into furious denial and refused follow-up appointments. We did, however, manage to stop her osteoporosis progression with Reclast and hormone therapy.

Fast forward to now: Mom struggles terribly with communication, garbling or  substituting “it” for a given noun every few words. 

For instance, when trying to explain the switch between standard time and daylight savings, she said to me: “it’s up and it comes through now in the bedroom and then after it’s the same time but less of it.” When what she means is: “The sun comes up earlier now, but in the evening, it’s dark earlier, too.” 

Additionally, she’s forgotten my (her only child) middle name, my birthday, that I was married for 14 years, and massive amounts from her own past (like that her lifelong best friend died of cancer 21 years ago. Mom was at her bedside). She’s also unable to recall her medications for a doctor, use a computer (insisting it’s broken), or set up her own appointments. 

But at the same time, her house is immaculately clean as is her hygiene. She scoops her cat’s litterboxes and feeds them like clockwork. She drives to the post office and grocery store nearby with relative ease and still manages to pay her bills on time (I carefully monitor her finances). She also keeps track of both my partners, their jobs, and my own job search — enough to hold a conversation with me despite her many missing words.

I’ve done several assessments online to figure out her stage, and I’m completely stumped. They all say she’s MCI or very, very early stage Alzheimer’s. But doctors, when they speak to her, indicate to me that she’s much further along given her tangential speech, missing words, and memory gaps.

Indeed, I can’t find any description of Alzheimer’s in which language and long-term memory are the first to go. Has anyone else experienced anything like this with their loved one? I’m so afraid that her early loss of basic words will render her unintelligible to me or her caregivers years before her body gives out."
"How do you deal with patients when they don't want to do something that could be good for them? 

My mom has always liked singing and belonging to a choir. Since she has Alzheimer she's no longer able to do this, so my sister had the idea of calling a music therapist to improve her life. She offered it and my mom refused. There was no way of convincing her. She even randomly called my sister (sometimes she remembers stuff) to tell her not to force her to go to ""music lessons"". 

Is there a way to do this anyway? We can't force her, right? This is not like medication where she also refuses but after some arguments she takes them anyway.

Anyway, how's everyone else's experience? thanks in advance."
"TL;DR Moved mom in with me and the family to take care of her and protect her assets. Starting to feel like a bad move. 

My mom was a single mom starting when I was three years old. She had a high school diploma and an hourly job. We lived in someone's basement for a couple years after the divorce, then to the second story of a crumbling two flat. Mom was frugal, used old bed sheets for curtains, shopped the generic aisle almost exclusively (the old school black and white generics), dressed me entirely in hand-me-downs from cousins and neighbors. She still managed to provide an amazing time growing up for me. A week long vacation every year, a ticket to Great America once a summer, even found an NES under the Christmas tree in 1985.    
Mom worked for the same company for 42 years before retiring. She managed to own a small condo outright, owned her modest car and had a decent retirement account.    
After a personal tragedy to her 20+ year boyfriend, I started noticing the little things that indicate a problem. Forgetting days, dates, the time; an occasional shirt on backwards or inside out; some crazy stories that in hindsight I believe were hallucinations. I didn't think there was a problem at this point but wanted her closer to me (she lived an hour away) so she had daily interaction with my family. We sold her condo, she bought a townhome and things were supposed to be good.   
Having her closer and interacting with her more, I realized there might be more to what I thought were just quirks. After a couple years I realized she was forgetting to make meals, had expired food in the fridge, was getting lost in her car, was having difficulty getting dressed and had a small issue with incontinence.    
After considering the options (in home care, assisted living or moving her in) and consulting with an estate planning attorney, I decided we'd sell her place AND my place to move us all into a house that would give her space and allow us (my wife, three older kids and myself) to help her.    
A small aside here. As I began raising my own family I realized the struggle it must have been for my mom to raise me alone. I also found out my grandmother (her mom) criticized my mom for dating when I was young, telling her I was her main responsibility and dating would compromise that. I felt terrible for my mom and promised myself I would find a way to pay her back. I saw moving her in and caring for her as my opportunity. 
Additionally and the be honest, I was also selfish about securing what mom had worked her whole life for. *stopped typing here to help her with going to the bathroom, she had a bm in her Depends*. My mom had a small retirement account and owned her townhome. Liquidating that for private care in a memory facility would maybe cover four years. I thought it would be better to save that money and buy a joint property with some of our combined assets.     
Here we are now about six months later. Mom has declined quickly. She has both urinary and bowel incontinence, can't dress herself, can't bathe herself and can't follow very simple instructions. Caring for her has become a strain for my family. We were ready to interview an in home care service tomorrow but now my son and my mom have tested positive for Covid making a difficult situation worse.   
I love my mom beyond description but this is terrible. I created this am full of regret. We can't just move her into a care facility now without covering her portion of the property and don't have the assets to do it without selling the house we just moved into. I made a deal with the devil."
"Hi friends, I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/qlvg3k/nearing_the_end/) a week ago about getting my dad on hospice. It's been a whirlwind. His facility at the time had been oscillating between asking us to find my dad a new facility and then saying for over a month he could stay. My dad had started having issues with aggression and hurting staff and residents. Hospice got him on dilaudid 3 times a day and my dad is barely affected by it. His facility said he could stay ""for the rest of his life"" and then the next day flipped again and said he needed to go. We have REALLY struggled with finding another facility willing to take on a man with ""behaviors"". Well, we found one and pulled the trigger despite knowing a move would be pretty catastrophic for my dad's behaviors.

Well, we moved him today to the new facility. He hadn't even been there a few hours before we got a call from the hospice nurse that he's punching people and throwing things. Sigh. I just am hoping he doesn't have to suffer long like this but I just am so worried he's going to go on like this for years. He is completely unable to give direction to, he can't focus on you, you can't get his attention, he is forgetting who my mom and I are, he speaks almost entirely jibberish now, he's completely incontinent and falls a lot. He needs assistance with all but feeding and that's becoming a challenge. He can pretty much only eat with his hands. I just don't know how much longer we can bear this and if his new facility will work with us and keep him. I'm just amazed the dilaudid isn't really doing what hospice expected. He has zero quality of life. It's so depressing. I just hope he can stop suffering soon."
"Our mother is in a memory care unit for Alzheimer’s and has escaped from two different facilities. Her current unit is very responsive to breaches, but they have to maintain fire egresses and she’s still able to read exit instructions and get out onto the street.

We’re considering getting an Apple AirTag or some kind of tracking device we can tie onto her shoelaces. Has anyone used tracking devices to keep track of their loved ones in this way? Any suggestions on how to minimize these safety risks?"
My girlfriends mom has Alzheimer’s. On Halloween she took a bad fall. I’m worried that it will take a huge emotional toll on her if/when she gets worse. I watched my mom take care of her own mother as she went through a similar situation. It was incredibly hard on her and I fear the same for my girlfriend. Any advise on how best to support her would be greatly appreciated.
"I am dealing with something perhaps someone out there has advice on.

My mom has Alzheimer's; it was hidden from us for years, and has now become unavoidable.  They're on the young side, she's 67 and he's 70.  She has hallucinations most days.  Short term memory loss.   
 She's starting to forget who we are at times.  And cannot get dressed herself.  Her hygeine is questionable.  We do not know what stage she is at because she forced my Dad to drive to her neurologist and cancel every upcoming appointment.  He obliged.

Their house is in absolute shambles; the grief has caused my father to start projects around the house that he does not finish.  There are piles of tools and screws and saws and dust on literally on every single surface.  My mother doesn't have anywhere to go and will sit on the couch playing with a ball of yarn that she untangles and re-tangles.  It's so crazy to type something this disturbing, as our upbringing was generally pretty happy.

We do not know if she is taking her medicine, but I doubt she's taking it properly. My father is not administering it.  She took her wedding ring off on Halloween out of fear it would fall off when handing out candy, and it seems to now be lost.  

My sister and I are trying to pick up the slack by finding an elder care lawyer, locating a new neurologist, scheduling the appointments, and even arranging to have my aunt take my mom for a walk when we need my dad to be available.  We've also talked to the elder care resources in their county for a home visit and to possibly set them up on wheels on meals.  (They lived a very blue collar life.)  But every once in a while, I need a piece of information from him, and he can't make himself available.  He texted me today saying that I can no longer call him on the phone for these matters, because it makes my mother upset when he steps away for a period of time.

I think his grief is profound, and his house feels like quicksand.  This week for the first time he broke down crying on the phone and hung up on me when I brought up trying to get them Meals on Wheels.  There is a lot that I still need to do, but he does not return texts, does not return emails, forgets to bring his cell phone with him, but does not answer it.  It's like trying to help a brick wall.

However, he will reach out when my mom has a catastrophic episode in the hopes that we can help get her mind off the task at hand.  This happens every three days or so where we'll get an urgent text telling us he needs one of us to call immediately.  He can't get his mind around telling therapeutic fibs, and is constantly getting into arguments about how there are ""no other people living in the basement.""  Last week I was so worried about my father I gave him the number for the Suicide Prevention Hotline.

I am doing all that I can, and taking a pretty huge amount of my week trying to help (I live on the west coast with two kids and an unstable career, they're in New England).  But the guy needs medicine, therapy, and group counseling.  And my mom needs even basic care.  I have a feeling my situation isn't atypical, and curious how anyone else has helped ""lead a horse to water"" as I'm trying to do in such desperate situations.  Or whether or not this is severe enough for me to fly home for a few months, and take legal guardianship over my own mother from my dad.  (Though I have no idea how I would swing that financially.)

Thanks in advance for any perspective!"
"My Dad has dementia (neurologist believes it's Alzheimer's but no solid diagnosis yet) & using remote for his tv has become impossible. I show him which buttons turn power on, change channels, turn volume up at least 50 times a day & 30 seconds after telling him he can't do it anymore. I can't sit on the couch next to him 24/7 to change channels etc. 

Does anyone know of a SUPER simple remote that will work in a situation like this?"
"7/8 years ago my dad was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s. 

He was a VP at a company and dealing with a very stressful time in his career, working impossible hours abroad. My mother was aboard with him and couldn’t work so made friends and created a support system for herself. My dad felt like she wasn’t supporting him properly emotionally and that she was just out having fun while he was working non stop. Im not here to judge that situation as I wasn’t there and I can see how it would have been hard on both of them in their own ways.

My dad was diagnosed when they returned to the US. He is now retired & on disability. He often connects his diagnosis with the fact he felt she didn’t support him and that’s why he had this mental break. Since returning home, for the past 7/8 years, he has been depressed and irritated and while sometimes this is directed at the diagnosis and his declining short term memory and focus, a lot of it and majority of anger is directed at my mother for their time abroad while he was working.

He cannot or will not let go of the issue while they were abroad and has emotionally been quite abusive to my mom for the past 7/8 years. He won’t or can’t move on, says it’s just constantly in his head and that his heart and trust is broken for the emotional abandonment. He’s made her apologize multiple times and has only just “accepted” it recently when he made her write it out - but he still can’t move on. They have had (and are still having) therapy and counseling, he has a hypno therapist and he is on medication - none of this seems to help. He wants to switch therapists whenever they want to keep talking about what happened or when they mentioned that he shouldn’t keep trying to claim to spot of victim. 

He’ll go from wanting a separation and being depressed/angry for a few days to telling my he can’t live without her and she’s the best. If my mom suggests separation he says she’s selfish and that’s the easy way out for her because he’s sick. She doesn’t want to leave because he is Ill and will soon need someone to care for him but this has taken its toll on her. He’s like Jekyll and Hyde. 

I try to be there to help and emotionally support but there is only so much I can do. I feel so bad and don’t know how to help the situation. I know Alzheimer’s affects emotional and behavior stuff as well as mental faculties but is this it for the next 5/10 years?"

"My dad has always had a temper. He's always been angry. He's always been an emotionally and verbally abusive to my mom.

Edit: I realize now that I'm ranting and venting more than I might actually asking a question. I'm sorry. Not a lot of people you can talk to about this sort of thing


But it didn't used to be that bad. He kept himself in check. Throughout most of my life I didn't even realize how much of an asshole he was until I was in my mid 20s

But now that he has early onset Alzheimer's, it's amplified all of his worst qualities. Angry all of the time about things that don't matter. And then once he starts on a tangent, he starts talking in circles, and he's yelling about things that don't make sense, and he usually forgets what he was angry about in the first place but he still continues to be angry.

He's not far enough along for us to put him into some kind of care home. And even if he was, they probably kick him out for being abusive to the staff.

My mom should have divorced him and left him decades ago. But now it feels too late. Part of it's the guilt. She doesn't want to leave somebody who's dealing with something he can't help. She'd feel like a terrible person for abandoning someone in need. And he has no friends. And his family doesn't like him, none of  his sister would take him in.

And because he doesn't have any other support, anywhere else to go, I'm convinced that a restraining order won't be enough. He'll forget and keep showing up at the house anyway.

She can't afford to just pack up and leave him. Even though that's probably the best and only option. And hell, part of the reason why we don't have anything saved is because of how you're responsible he is with money. He's not far enough along for us to get power of attorney. We can't stop him from accessing his own bank account. So every time is disability check comes in, he immediately takes cash out and buys pot. And now he's at a point where he'll smoke everything he buys almost immediately, forget that he bought it, and then try to buy more. He's taking from money that should go to the car insurance or the mortgage

I've seen so many stories of people losing a family member to Alzheimer's. Somebody tragic stories of people talking about how they're watching their loved ones slip away. And it's heartbreaking. But that is not been my experience at all. This asshole has become an incredible burden.

I mean, I'm damn near 40 and I'm still living with my parents. I moved back in after his first heart attack to help him out. But before things got stable enough for me to move out again, that's when his Alzheimer's started showing signs. And now I just don't feel safe leaving her alone with him.

TL;DR, how do you deal with someone with Alzheimer's when they're Alzheimer's amplifies all of their worst qualities to the point where you wish they would just fucking go away?"
"Hello all, thanks for all your advice and comfort during this shitty journey. I feel we are nearing the end. My dad began getting aggressive and agitated a few weeks ago. Last week hospice was called and we began hospice. The hospice nurse has been talking to me about terminal agitation and that she thinks that's what he's experiencing. They still oscillate between dementia ""types"" but my dad had been in a rapid decline the past several months. I hadn't noticed it as much but my husband had. My dad became completely incontinent, complete lack of facial expressions (just a slack face), I can't get or hold his attention anymore (even with tapping his hand, giving him a hug, etc), he didn't recognize my mom for the first time last week, he seems to be eating less. 

I know everyone's final stages are different. It feels like it's been rapid but I don't think that's too uncommon. Hospice has begun dilaudid to keep my dad comfortable. They do not suspect he has much time left. Any thoughts/experiences you all can share when your loved one got to this stage? My dad has not had any quality of life for some time now so I am mostly at peace with this. I know he would be so mad we even ""let"" him get to the stage where we had to move him in to memory care. At this point, I know he's just suffering. It's still a very painful decision. Thanks, friends."
"I'm 27 and I've been dealing with my Dad's early-onset Alzheimers in its late stages for the last couple of years now (incontinence, aggressive behaviour etc), he's suffered from Alzheimer's for the majority of my adult life. However, his living situation isn't usual. He has a live-in carer, in a house that's nearby to his sister & her husband. They cover the carer's breaks each day - something I find crazy considering how bad things are getting - there isn't a desire from them to remove Dad from his home and into a care facility (sister has power of attorney). Anyway, I cover a long break every other Sunday. This is becoming harder & harder for me. I feel like the anxiety I get is ruining my week before, I'm on edge the whole time I'm there & it's taking me 2-3 days to recover once I get home & back into my routine. I feel like this is down to the fact I have to change Dad when he soils himself, try to calm him down when he's very distressed, screaming, trying to hit me etc. My auntie & uncle are insistent that he's getting the best care, in the best situation, living by them, whereas I would much prefer to visit him maybe more frequently in a professional care environment & remove the anxiety of making sure I'm doing a good job keeping my Dad clean & safe. I don't feel Dad is under any threat or that he's in danger, but for me it's becoming too hard to enter that environment. I'm just wondering if anyone has experienced something similar, how you've dealt with other family members, or can tell me I'm not an awful son for finding this situation extremely difficult to manage."
"I'm questioning if she really needs to go into 24-care now, even though she's in late Stage 5 Alzheimer's, and I was really sure about it when I made the reservation for her. I'm scared about the process of tricking her to get there, because she won't agree to go, and having to lie to her. Has anyone else had this experience?"
"Has anyone set up an Amazon ""echo show"" device to keep in better contact with a loved one in a care home who has dementia/alzheimers?

We are going to be moving my step-dad into a care home this month, and so we're trying to find a way for him to stay in contact with his kids and wife.

He is not able to use his mobile phone very well, because he has arthritis in his fingers and he forgets how to navigate into the phone screen, etc.   (Plus he often forgets to charge his phone.)

I thought perhaps it might be easier for him to just say ""Alexa, call \[person\]"". Then each of us can have our own echo show device in our homes.. and we can do video chat, etc.

What do you think? Is there an easier way to keep in contact with someone in a care home?  


Maybe something like Facebook portal?  [http://portal.facebook.com](http://portal.facebook.com)  (I just heard about this one, but I don't know anything about it, so I'm not sure it would be super easy to use like the echo show?)

Thanks!"
"Starting down the path with my Mom so many of you have already tread. Thanks to this sub in advance for putting yourselves out there. A lot to learn and a long ways to go. 

I’ve been avoiding my Mom’s cognitive decline as long as possible. I thought I was hiding from the warning signs with her. I thought I’d been following her lead and she would bring it up when she was ready. I thought she was scared and didn’t want to tell anyone, and so the best I could do was just make sure she was comfortable. I thought I was hiding for her—I was doing it for me. 

I have avoided the issue more than I even knew. I wanted to believe she was capable and understanding of what was happening to her. I wanted to be supportive without forcing her to do anything she didn’t want to do. I talked to her about “letting me know if anything is ever wrong”, having great conversations and being ready to tackle the issue when the time came. And so long as she wasn’t telling me there were any issues, I pretended it was fine. I feel so dumb now. 

It occurs to me now just how little she might understand of what is happening to her. How scary it must be. Shes not hiding from it; it’s now hidden from her. She can’t fully bring it up because she doesn’t know. She’s still my mom, but the part of her that’s missing is the part I was not fully prepared for.

It started with erratic decision making about six years ago. Big decisions unlike her. Major cross-country moves to places she didn’t know anyone. Suddenly. She had some personal trauma, so erratic didn’t seem so far off at the time. I didn’t know. 

Three years later and the longtime forgetfulness and other behaviors were noticeable in a new way. Conversations became more repetitive, shorter, less depth and breadth. Questions were repeated. She became more deeply fixated on a fewer number of things. She got nervous easily. Still didn’t know. 

Two years ago and Mom was reluctant to get together for the holidays. I forced her to come see her family. She was nervous and uncomfortable. She seemed unable to follow the basic plan. She missed the first shuttle to come get her because she just lost track of the days. I chastised her for it and got her on the next one. I was confused how anyone could mess it up. She was a bit difficult the whole time. She repeated conversations to a more alarming degree. I knew something was wrong but didn’t do or say anything. 

18 months ago she completely reversed her cross country move but the planning and execution were a mess. She planned for
Months. A week before her move she called me asking me to fly out and move her because she had no plan. I scolded her for being so careless. Five days later she had driven 7 hours to my doorstep on the way to her destination. She was just standing there at 10:30 pm unannounced. We could not get a hold of her the prior four days. I yelled at her because I just didn’t understand what was happening. It was so erratic. She said it was stress. I thought about it later and started talking to people about cognitive decline and realized I had been less than helpful to her by scolding her. I still didn’t do or say anything. She seemed better and manageable for a while and I was just scared. 

All through covid we had been in touch but the calls became so short. I had been supportive but not direct with her. She would just repeatedly ask if we had gone back to work yet or if our state had been opened back up. Every call—Usually 3+ times per call. And I just kept asking if she was okay. We just kept repeating ourselves. She also started becoming very suspicious and her Facebook turned into a Qanon feed. Our calls dwindled over the last six months. 

Today I got a call from her landlord. He stopped by to get rent. Mom couldn’t figure out why he was there. She wasn’t sure what she was supposed to do so she asked him to write the check out for her. I logged in to Facebook to see two of her friends had reached out to tell me they were worried about her cognitive decline. She had gotten very sickly looking too. That she had withdrawn from everyone lately. 

I called my Mom right away. She was puzzled and upset by her TV not working and that was all she would talk about. Nothing else. I asked if she was okay. She said she just couldn’t figure out the TV. Over and over. Told her I was going to come visit this week to see if she is okay. She told me to wait til the TV was working. That we will talk tomorrow when TV works. I have never had a conversation like that with her. It’s like the echo of a person. There’s just someone distant and strange on the other end talking about the TV. It happened so fast. I had to get it off my chest. I feel guilty and stupid for not understanding the gravity and acting sooner. 

Tomorrow I will be calling her again and making plans to travel to her. I will be reaching out to Alz support tomorrow and to her doctor hopefully as well. 

And for the first time I am seeing what this really is and how terrible and confusing and frightening it must be for my Mom. 

The end. If you suspect an issue, don’t wait. Don’t hide. Have an honest conversation about it."
"My dad has moderate stage Alzheimer’s. He has been in the hospital and rehab for over a month now. He is going home soon and he is now asking about his dog. His dog passed away shortly after he went to the hospital. Is it better to just directly tell him the dog died? Should I just tell him the dog is ‘away?’ I’ve seen conflicting information online, and I really can’t figure out what’s best."
"My mother (63 years) has been sick for many years now. My father cannot manage taking care of her anymore, so tomorrow she’s moving into a care home next door from my father. She doesn’t want to move now, even though she initially said yes. She is in need for professional care, and my father is so so tired and worn out from taking care of her. 

She has been so angry with us all day today, and she even said that she would kill herself if she had to move. 

I’m so sad for her. And him. I live in another part of our country, and have a family of my own, so it’s not possible for me to just stay here and take care of her. Right now I’ve taken some time of from my job, left my husband and two small kids at home, so I can be here when she is moving in tomorrow. 

I hate Alzheimer’s. I hate that it took my mom. And I wish she was happy and didn’t feel sad and anxious all the time."
My grandmother lives in assisted living because her dementia is too far gone to live on her own. My mom and her sisters take turns visiting and caring for her. My nom hates visiting because my grandmother doesn’t know her anymore. I’ve never seen my mom be emotional but she’s cried about it before and I know she dreads visiting and feels like a bad daughter because she doesn’t go as often as she should because it’s so hard on her. What can I do to support her after these visits? We aren’t really a family who talks about our feelings a lot and that wouldn’t be comfortable for her. How would you want to be supported? Is there anything I can do at all to make her feel better? It breaks my heart.

Hello Redditors

Thank you on behalf of my fam for your input on Part I. We are listening and open to any ideas you may have.

Update:

Since last post, N (F 70) has spent a great deal of time with my Dad, P. (M 77) who has moderate / mild Stage 5 Alz. This woman is still pushing him to complete redecoration of his condo, which at one point  discombobulated him so much that his caretaker reported that he left the condo thinking it was someone else's home and then headed for the curb where the car he hasn’t owned since 2018 should be parked. The redecoration was estimated by his finance person to cost him 40K.

We had originally decided that indications he was going to marry her would be our redline, warranting us getting a lawyer to pursue conservatorship to protect him from further exploitation and perhaps even annul the marriage? The family that would help us to get this lawyer is not financially connected to P.

However, that redline had to be redrawn because N did something so incredibly outrageous that no one really expected it - she got him to open a joint account at his bank and transferred over 16K into it. This opens the floodgates to N having him transfer every penny into this account which she can then empty, this being a far more efficient way to fleece my Dad than waiting months to meet the two requirements of a confidential (not on public record and hidden until his passing) marriage in CA: changing her residence to his address and calling herself Mrs P.

At the same time, P also spent several hours calling the credit card companies and cancelling the cards he had sent to his adult kids back before N. came into his life. Apparently he is having cashflow problems because of the condo redecoration and enormous 9k per mo caretaker bill. N told him it is your kids and the credit cards you gave them so problem solved.

Thing is, P. has real problems keeping track of all the CC he has opened over the past few years, and the ones N told him to close because of his kids also pay for his utilities and caretaker expenses.

It is likely that the utilities and bills will stay unpaid until they start coming due and then there will be darkness and silence in my Dad's condo and no one to answer any questions because the company that runs the caretakers are hardasses and will pull them out asap.

The best part is the CC were all known to his accountant and monitored and paid through Quickbooks. Any new cards he ordered now will go straight to P and not be monitored. So far, N has removed the physical devices meant to keep him safe from running off, and has now removed the accounting system which kept him safe from financial scams.

Today the fam did a call and we decided that J (his youngest son M 50)  would offer P. a chance to voluntarily accept conservatorship so he can be protected and still do whatever, including getting legally married to this “person” if he really wants.

We expect him to tell N, who will pressure him to resist, making her the only person telling P to not cooperate with his fam. She has already advised him to tell us to fuck off and that it is his right to get married to whoever he wishes. He is 1000% in love with her and will do whatever she asks.

The plan is after he tells us off, that's when we hand this off to a lawyer and say to a court or judge that given his diagnosis is there any way to at the very least stop him from moving money around and first explain where it is going and why.

I have to say I don't see much hope here. This is actually the THIRD time he has been involved with such a difficult and demanding woman like N. His first marriage after he divorced my mom was to a N. He was totally lovestruck and acted pretty much the same long before his present diagnosis.

We appreciate any thoughts or impressions you may have.

"Can anyone point me in the right direction of where to fax / send Health Care POA for purposes of U.S. Medicare / Medicaid?

I called Medicare and they said to contact Social Security, because these are benefits, but Social Security is having long-term issues with their telephones, and, thus, can't get through. (I tried several times and they have a notice on their website about this.)

All I can find on the SS website is a form to fill out for someone who still has their faculties about them, and have also seen somewhere that they don't recognize POAs. My loved one has Alzheimers and it's too late for them to fill out the form.

I just want to fax the Health Care POA related to Medicare / Medicaid, so I can contact them on behalf of my parent in the future.

I don't have an urgent need to contact them right now, but am wanting to fax / transmit these to all who I might need this to be in place for. I've got a 7-day trial of an online fax service, and have faxed to all parties/entities but Medicare / Medicaid. LOL"
"When grandma was a kid, her dad said she had to turn off everything at the wall at night to stop the power “leaking out” of the sockets. 
She has got it into her head (again) that this is true. 
I don’t mind her unplugging e.g. the toaster, obviously. But anything with a clock has to be reset every morning so she doesn’t get confused about the time. She will also turn off the washing machine and dishwasher in the middle of an overnight cycle so I get a mini flood when I open them.
More seriously, she turns off all the nightlights so she can’t see going to the loo. She turns off the phone base stations (sometimes we’ve missed incoming NHS calls because of this). Has even turned off the power of her emergency contact box “so it doesn’t call anyone”. That box detects it has lost power, and rings EVERYONE!

So, my problem is, that U.K. plugs are arguably the the safest in the world (https://youtu.be/UEfP1OKKz_Q). I want to make them less safe so grandma can’t turn them off at the socket or pull them out of the wall. Is there any box that can be fitted over the socket to stop her disconnecting the things that are supposed to help her?"
"I’m hoping this question is appropriate for this forum. I’m not asking from a management perspective ; but rather as another human being and a co-worker who cares because It’s clearly impacting their day to day.

I’ve read through many posts in this subreddit and they are both heartbreaking and heartwarming. The amount of support i see brings me to tears. 

What can I do in my position to help this individual? Or should I just leave it alone and  not mention it bc it’s not my business?"
"Dad (71) has said he think he has early-stage Alzheimers.  He stopped working part-time over a year ago now because he made a major mistake. He often looses track of where he's going when he's driving. Today he didn't realize that there were cars waiting at a light in front of him. My mom had to scream for him to realize they were going to crash, then swerve into another lane to avoid hitting the cars ahead. Today we discovered he'd ordered some boots from a fake company. He thought it was Etsy, but it was actually a look-a-like site called Etsy-Center.  Normally $300 boots being sold for $59. It's strange he didn't question if that was too good to be true.  He often forgets things, like he'll make a full pot of coffee and then leave.  He says that there's other things he's been hiding.  He's always had trouble remembering things, and needs to keep lists and reminders and to keep himself on track.  Social skills and language skills are very good.

I accept that there could be some kind of dementia that may be setting in, but I guess it's hard for me to accept it could be Alzheimers.  He's also a health nut, loves the gym, eats very mindfully and takes all manner of supplements. Everything from green tea and coconut oil to lifetime extension supplements.

I started looking up information on how to plan for a family member with dementia or Alzheimers. And it's all very vague, euphemistic stuff about considering your options and the individual's preferences. Tell it to me straight - what do we need to be doing now and in the coming years?  I have a young child and live nearby but I can't take on too much myself."
"Hello nice people. I have a question that may sound silly, but I am kind of a person who would prefer talking to real people if not paid doctors rather than internet articles.

Do you guys remember the first times you were aware that you started forget things? 

I am 29 and I started to forget the names of the foods that I know very well, the district names of my hometown etc… These kinds of things. 

I lost my grandmom a while ago due to this disease, and I am a little afraid if I may have it too. I don’t sleep early at all since 5 years, always 3-6 am, and I sleep 10 hours. Or sometimes I am up for 2 days and sleep 18 hours. Due to nature of my work. 

I appreciate any response. Take care!"
I’m a wreck. that’s all. seeing posts here where i used to check for help breaks me even more.
"I’m 36 and my dad was diagnosed with alz last year, at 76. He lives a 25 hour drive or flight away, and I am the primary caregiver of 2 kids under 6, so visiting him regularly is not really possible. 

I’m struggling because his primary caregiver (long term partner, previously known as my step-mother) is a toxic person. I won’t go into the whole back story because it would be way too long, but for the first year after he was diagnosed, she and I spoke regularly and she kept me up to date on his progress and was open about her feelings. Then in the spring they sold their home and moved closer to her daughter (which I was very happy to hear, as previously they were very isolated). But during the move she started avoiding my calls, saying she was too busy to talk. Which I’m sure she was. 

But now it’s been nearly five months and she still refuses to talk to me. She won’t answer the phone and she hides whenever I am talking to my dad, so if I ask to speak to her, he just wanders around calling her name but she refuses to come to the phone.

My dad is lucid and seems happy, but I am well aware this is not the whole story. He has never been much of a conversationalist, and now our discussions are limited to a few high level ideas he repeats - mostly how nice his dog is, and how dry the weather has been.

I just... have no idea if they have any support. I have no idea how his symptoms are progressing. I have no idea how she is handling the stress of being his caregiver. Based on her behaviour over the past 25 years, I am fairly confident the answer is “not well.” I have suspected she has undiagnosed bipolar or manic depression for a long time. 

I worry she will not tell me if / when he begins to decline. 

I don't even know how I would be able to coordinate a visit to go see them. Do I just book a flight and show up at their house unannounced? 

Anyway... thank you for listening. If you have any advice on what I can do, I will gladly listen."
"My dad is the full-time caregiver for my mom. Mom is progressing rapidly and we're trying to get Dad some help. What do you have your in-home helper do?  

My mom is super-resistant to the idea that she needs help - but Dad can't get anything done around the house when she's there and home.  We really just need someone to distract her, but Mom's not going to sit and talk calmly with anyone for a couple of hours, nor will she let anyone give her a bath or do chores she thinks she can do (dishes, trash, clean, etc).  

Thanks!"
"Hey all, I know these stories are a dime-a-dozen (I've read through all of them on this subreddit) but here we are with another. I'm really struggling with this. My dad suddenly had a bout of aggression a couple weeks ago and there were a few incidents of him harming residents and staff. He was good for about a week and the facility said they would keep trying to balance out his meds (he's been checked for infection, etc), that we had time and they'd work with us. Well, another incident happened yesterday and we are being asked to find him a new facility IN ADDITION to hiring a 24/7 caregiver to be there with him until we can move him. As you may know, caregivers are expensive so it'll run over $800/day plus the facility costs right now. 

I, and the facility, have called many places for help; they wanted to send him to the hospital but we have his advanced directives as ""comfort only"" and the EMT's said the hospital wouldn't do anything; not to mention most hospitals around here are on divert because of COVID. I've spoken to all the local geriatric psychiatric units and NONE of them deal with folks with dementia. We need someone willing to help us balance out his meds AND take in a man with an aggression issue. Thankfully the facility has decided he qualifies for a hospice eval (we all suspect he's stage 7) and I should be meeting with them tomorrow. I'm hoping hospice will have some resources for me. There is one skilled nursing facility who said they'd be willing to take him but it's $12,000/month and WAY out of our price range. 

I'm really stuck. Anything I haven't thought of? My local area agency on aging has not been helpful and neither Alz Association. Thanks, friends. Elder care in this country is a disgrace."
"Title says all. All the memories I created with my dad, he has forgotten. Every 10 minutes he asks who I am and where I’m from. I always put a smile on my face saying its your son dave!! and he gets all happy about how he raised such a good son, and then it just repeats thruout the day. It’s getting difficult keeping a smile on my face. All i want to do is cry"

My grandpas wife just recently passed away. He has had Alzheimer’s for a few years and can never remember new information. Every morning when he wakes up it feels like the movie 50 first dates when we have to update him on everything. When he asks for his wife is it healthier for him just to lie and say “she’s out right now will be back later”? I just can’t stand watching him go through the mental pain every morning grieving the death of this wife of 68 years.
"So he's having hard time with working memory. He works as a sales person at a pastry shop and I noticed he does mistakes in calculation 2/3 of times. Especially when there are multiple orders. I

"Hello,

I've been lurking here for years and finally feel the need to rant for a little while. My mother was diagnosed 11 years ago at age 60.  Overall, up to the end of last year it's been a very slow decline, which I understand is somewhat rare. Usually every six months or a year there was maybe a 1 point drop in the cognition test provided by her doctor. I was able to go to work and she could function at home (she proactively gave up on driving pretty early on, and finances were monitored for her) while being checked on throughout the day. Thankfully due to this sub I could read your stories and mentally prepare myself for what's to come - as much as possible anyway. I am very grateful to those who post their experiences on here. I'd like to do the same for future subscribers.

&#x200B;

In the last year we've seen a significant decrease in cognitive ability. Her last test a few months ago resulted in a 6 point drop which really surprised me. She's now struggling for words and thoughts and will need to have someone present with her pretty much at all times. Thankfully so far bathroom and hygiene practices can still be done without supervision, but I know it's only a matter of time. She can dress herself but will do things like mismatch earrings. I try not to correct small things like that as it will only agitate her.  Irritability and frustration are at an all time high. She has the desire to do things around the house but gets so mad when she can't functionally perform a task. Any attempt to help causes more confusion and thus more frustration (now directed my way). I've tried multiple approaches to helping and now think it's just a no-win scenario. My best solution at this point is to just be as proactive as possible in house chores to avoid the situation completely. 

&#x200B;

The last two weeks though have been especially rough. I keep saying it would be so fascinating in how the mind works with this disease if it wasn't so damn tragic. There was a benign event that led to some significant chain reactions in thought patterns that no one could have predicted. It goes like this: Our neighbors cut down a tree in their yard. No big deal, right? Well, seeing workers outside in *their* yard made her believe they were in *our* yard cutting down *our* tree. She would frequently go outside in the backyard to check on her tree. In a day or two the thought process morphed into her believing the old neighbors moved out (they didn't) and new ones moved in that wanted to cut down the fence and take over our yard. I explain that is not the case but it's useless. A few more days go by and the fixation on the ""new neighbors"" morphs into her wanting to say hi to them. At least it's not negative paranoid thoughts anymore. Now, after a few days of wanting to meet the ""new neighbors"", she is under the impression that it is us that recently moved in. I keep getting questions like ""Do we live in a town?"" and ""I'd really like to see the schools and what downtown looks like"" in a city she has lived in for 30 years. There's been casual mentions of wanting to go walking outside to look around, which is very concerning. Is it time for child proof locks? Probably. 

&#x200B;

I suppose this stage was inevitable. I just find it so interesting that we got here from a goddamn tree. It's almost funny. Now when she looks around at a house she no longer recognizes as hers, it brings thoughts of insecurity and more confusion. This disease took most of her personality a long time ago. Now it's taking her sense of security and comfortability in her own home. And again, this has been overall such a slow decline over 11 years. Now we are hitting warp speed. I quit my job a few months ago to stay home. I don't believe she would respond well to caregivers that she doesn't know. 

&#x200B;

And this is terrible - but I just want it over with. I sincerely don't want to be insensitive to those who lost/are losing their loved ones quickly. My heart goes out to you and I apologize if I come across as uncaring. I can't begin to comprehend your struggles when I read about them here. But I can't help but be envious to some degree. This has been so prolonged. I just want to rip the band-aid off and get it over with. In my mind, the person who was my mother died a long time ago. I've already grieved her death and made peace with it. However she was replaced with this deteriorating broken shell who is clearly suffering, but can't be fixed. It's a mind-fuck. Literally. And the guilt! I feel guilty for even writing this. That is SO weird. I feel guilty for having these thoughts. I feel guilty for making it about me and not the person with the actual disease. It's crazy. And it's no wonder care-giver depression is a thing. I wish I understood that early on because it combined with the general mental health crisis from the world today is really taking a toll.  

&#x200B;

So, with all that, thank you if you are still reading. I apologize for rambling. I again want to say that I am grateful to those who post their experiences on this sub. I really appreciate the stories that allow for much needed perspective on the timeline/milestones of this disease and all of the advice on how to cope along with it. I wish you and your loved ones all the best."
"Hi everyone; I'm new here, so forgive me if I'm overlooking posts on this topic. My grandma is living in a senior living facility that I find to be garbage. She is getting neglected, being served terrible food, everyone who works there keeps getting annoyed at her for wandering despite telling us they needed to charge more to move her to a ""memory care unit"" (in other words, a smaller room that is now shared with someone worse off where she can't really watch TV and is barely being monitored, despite the higher price tag). There is no special memory care being provided. She has now had multiple falls. I believe staff is stealing some of the items we send. No one can tell us what's happening or why she is falling. Supposedly they have cameras everywhere but the rooms (okay? So what goes on in the rooms if staff are abusive?), but every time she falls or someone hurts her, they ""don't have cameras in that area"". Just pure B.S. and she deserves better than this. I am trying to figure out ways to get money coming in so I can try to figure out a better situation (her money for this facility is running out quickly), but I have health issues that make a lot of jobs very difficult. I guess I'm wondering a few things:  


\-What is the typical cost (in California) for live-in care? I wonder if it might be cheaper to rent a small house or apartment and hire someone, but it could be more? I mean, her current facility's costs are exorbitant, but I don't know if it would be cheaper to hire someone and pay rent for a little place instead.  
\-How do you find a really wonderful caregiver? How do you make sure they treat your loved one well? Cameras?  
\-Does anyone find that there are people who would be happy with some kind of arrangement where they get free rent (or low rent) in exchange for providing care services, or something like that?   
\-Her house is in shambles. I'd like to find a way to fix and rebuild it; and I'm looking into starting my own building/design firm or trying to get investors to build some new, unique kind of senior care facility that's really nurturing and innovative, but I don't know what I'll be able to pull off. It obviously costs money for all of these options.   
\-I cannot find a facility that seems good for less than what she pays for this current one, which is crazy. Maybe I'm not looking in the right spot but hers is over $5k a month. I would think that we would be able to find a solution for less than that, one where she is happy and well-cared-for, where people actually love her instead of neglecting and snapping at her. Our family is just at a loss and her money is running out fast. We don't want to sell her house; it's been in our family for a long time and we love it. I would love to be able to fix it someday and bring my future children there; but it might take me a few years to be able to buy it. Right now, my older relatives feel like they might have to just sell it. We don't know how to look for other places to move her to. My doctor just started this amazing place, but it's $12k a month...Impossible right now. Where can I look for better facilities that don't cost so much? How do we know they're reputable beyond Yelp? Any ideas?  


I know this is long, so thank you for reading. I would be so grateful for any help, resources, ideas or a direction to look in. I guess I will ask the Alzheimer's Association, too. I hope you all stay well and safe. Thank you!"
"Hello, I have been taking care of my grandmother for quite some time now. She has suffered from depression, anxiety, chronic pain, and recently broke her hip and leg in a fall last year. 

Recently, in August, she began to complain of hearing voices/conversations about her, hearing people knocking on her bedroom wall from the exterior of the house, invasive thoughts about homosexuality and pedophilia, and extreme, extreme anger. She’s very conspiratorial and secretive.

Initially, I was told that she was suffering from Opioid Induced Delusions; she has been in high doses of morphine, gabbapentin, trazodone, along with sertraline, levothyroxine, and lisinopril. 

I began to taper her down from all of these per her doctors orders; she was taking 4 morphine 15mg tabs per day, and 5 gabbapentin (unk mg) per day. I have successfully tapered her down to 1 15mg morphine per day at night, and 2 100mg gabbapentin per day. But I haven’t seen any improvement, in fact things have gotten worse.

I am starting to become worried; she has so many ailments that I don’t know where to start. She is 72 and prone to UTI’s due to catheter use, and I have read that can cause similar issues. She also has issue with liver function due to high amounts of OTC Tylenol in the past because the morphine wasn’t working, and I have read that can cause an issue as well.

Now, I was told my a friend who works in asssisted living that she believes it may be Alzheimer’s; all of the early symptoms seem to be there, except for the forgetfulness (she knows how to do stuff, but she will forget words or how to use her tv remote, or she will forget what you just told her, like she asks what’s for dinner 3-4 times).

I was hoping that maybe I could get some insight from those who have dealt with this first hand, does what I described fit any of the criteria? Any help is appreciated."
"No idea if any of this will make sense, I'm just putting words down and hopefully it means something. Maybe it just feels good to talk about it.

My wonderful, loving, charismatic, brilliant father has been on the decline over the last few years and was diagnosed with Alzheimer's earlier this year. It wasn't a surprise to anyone, but it hurt to hear out loud none the less.

He's confused, unable to fully track conversations, and agitated by things that break his routines, but he's still my dad right now. He still knows me and loves me and lights up when I walk through the front door just like he always has. The dad I knew my whole life is deteriorating but for now it's still feels... small, I guess? minor? It still feels like if he could just stop declining he could live a happy life with his family. His condition impacts his day to day, but it hasn't had a major impact on our relationship yet. 

I'm so proud of him for how gracefully he's dealt with this so far. I know he feels shame, embarrassment, frustration, and pain with his diagnosis and what he's losing, but he has stayed so positive and has been so vulnerable in describing the way things are making him feel. His eyes well up with tears when we talk about the future. It's heartbreaking. He knows he won't be around for all of it. 

I'm trying really hard to stay positive too. I'm so grateful that I was able to move back to my home town and that I get to spend so much time with him. I think about people who's parents died or will die unexpectedly - a car crash, covid, cancer - and feel so lucky that I've been given enough of a warning that I get to cherish him for a while more. I give him longer, tighter, and more frequent hugs than I ever have before. I'm not sure if he notices. I hope he doesn't because I know it would make him sad to think about why. 

Yesterday it occurred to me that this sub probably existed and I went down a several hour rabbit hole of reading through hundreds of posts here. I just read and read and read and couldn't look away. I cried a lot too. I think it made me face the reality of what my family and I have ahead of us. I'm at the tip of a painful iceberg and reading the posts here took from me any hope of downplaying how massive the iceberg really is. 

I'm really fucking scared. I'm scared of how hard this will become. I'm scared of how much pain my dad will go through. I'm scared that my mom will sacrifice her physical and mental health taking care of him. I'm scared it will be too heartbreaking for her to watch her life partner, her best friend, her lover, her first line of support, her biggest cheer leader, her everything, slowly slip away leaving a shell of a person for us to care for. I'm scared it will be too heartbreaking for me. I'm scared that by the time he dies, I'll have watched him suffer for so long that I feel relief more than anything else. 

All of that said, I can't explain how encouraging it is to see everyone here supporting each other the way you all do. This sub scared the shit out of me, but I'm so glad I've found it because I know I'll have a community of people I can talk to, ask questions to, support, and be supported as each of our own personal tragedies unfold. 

Thanks for reading :)"
"We had our wedding in June, but mom can’t fly/be around too many people because of the disease. So we’re having a private ceremony just the 3 of us! Mom used to love getting dressed to the nines, so I’ll make that happen, but any suggestions for how to make the ceremony memorable? Almost thinking to make it “her” centric and have amazing pictures and good memories with her (I’ve already had my big day!). Thoughts? We’re going to dinner afterwards at a nice restaurant"
"My mom (64) is now entering the territory of asking about people who have been dead for years as if she's wondering what they're up to. Last week, it was her uncle (her mom's brother) who has been gone since 2008, and today, it's her mom, who has been gone since 2004.

I'm terrible at the lying to try to redirect, and obviously telling her they've passed away years ago is an emotional roller coaster and not easy either. Also, the lying to redirect makes me uncomfortable, because what happens when she says ""can I see/talk to them?"" I know she may just forget after we've changed topics, but she still has some slight short term memory, and the way some of these conversations are repeating, it wouldn't surprise me to be asked tomorrow ""hey when can I talk to my mom like you said I could,"" or some variation of that.

If you've read my other posts, you know I'm struggling in general with the care of my mom and coping with her Alzheimer's in general. We've been at the point for two months now, where she doesn't realize that I'm her daughter, and she is constantly asking me what my name is. Last night, she told me she wanted to ""go back to dad's"" because she wasn't having ""any fun here."" Here is our home, where she's lived with me for nearly 9 months, and there hasn't been dad to go back to since 1977. It really feels like she's in early-middle adolescence with the way she'll say or ask for things. The going back to dad's comment makes me feel like her parents sent her to stay with me for the summer or something and she's homesick. Today, that kind of echoed after she asked about her mom and said ""they told me the whole reason I was going to come here was to have fun, but I'm not having any fun.""

She knows obviously who her mom is, but ask her who I am, she'll say I'm her mom. The wires are crossed so badly, and it's both sudden and unexpected, while still being expected. The progression she is riding through is unreal. The way she's just so nonchalant about everything scares me and makes me so sad. I know it's all real, but it still feels so unreal. Like I'm waiting for someone to jump out and say ""gotcha!"" I'm just having such a difficult time coping. Any advice is always appreciated.

Oh, one more unrelated thing, her toileting accidents are becoming more and more frequent, but the last two times now, she has been so adamant that she didn't do it as if someone else peed all over the bed and the floor, or that someone else pooped in her pants. I really just have to pretend like it doesn't matter and go along with it, don't I? I know there's really no point in arguing, it's just such a struggle for me to let go."
"Yes grandma you’ve been in bed all day. No midnight is not the time to get up. I was hoping to get some sleep. I’ll give you an iPad to watch “your telly program” in bed. Well if it’s too warm there why did you want a hot water bottle 15 minutes ago? If you wouldn’t get out of bed for the nurse because you’re too ill this afternoon, you don’t need to be up now."
"When grandma complains there are too many vegetables in her meal and she couldn’t eat it all. I take away her pudding. Because she can have it tomorrow instead.
She quickly says it’s all fine."
"Here's a summary of posts today
1. Dementia is not necessarily hereditary, but you can still get it
2. No supplements can treat Dementia but can help relieve some symptoms
3. Smilz oil/gummies could help calm them, relieve anxiety and improve sleep
4. NZT-48 could help improve memory and reverse symptoms of early onset dementia
5. Magnesium is also good for the brain. 
What else am I forgetting?"

"I'm not sure how to convince my dad to get the flu shot and COVID booster. He refuses to go because he thinks he doesn't have insurance. I just need some advice to understand my dad's thought process so I can counter it.

I've tried explaining that every month he gets medicine from the pharmacy and it's covered by insurance. The nurse that comes every week is covered by insurance. He thinks that's something else covered by the state. At one point he understood that he has insurance so the medicine and nurse are covered, but thought his insurance just got canceled a few days ago...so he can't get the vaccine now.

I've also tried saying that we can pay for it because the flu shot is like $25 and the COVID booster is free. He thinks I'm lying about the cost. I've tried showing him the cost online, but he can't really process what he reads. Sometimes it takes him days to understand a few sentences.

I said he hasn't paid for anything in years, so I'm not sure why he thinks he would even pay for it. We handle all the bills. Then he goes off onto how nothing has ever been paid and the government is going to come and seize the house. I've said that we pay all the bills. If we didn't then they would shut it off. He cannot process that. He just knows I'm wrong.

I've also said that if he doesn't have insurance then it would be cheaper to just get the vaccines because the hospital bill would be very high. He just ignores that and goes back to ""I don't have insurance so I can't get a vaccine.""

I just don't know what to say to convince him."
"I am a mentally ill 34/F and both my uncles and mother have left me the primary care of my grandparents who both have dementia. I cannot do anything without being harassed by my grandmother. Since I'm the only one that is always with them my grandma takes everything out on me. I can't go out of the house, i can't do anything i like, i have to be within her eyesight all day. I am trying to complete my college degree and nothing angers her more than me leaving for class and coming back past 3pm. She screams that she is more important than me obtaining an education. Last night she was being verbally abusive and I tried to choke her. I feel like shit."
"So a few days ago I found a camcorder my parents bought years ago and decided to charge it and see what was on it. It had videos I don’t remember recording, things I remember happening but not remembering they were recorded. Everything was from 8 to 10 years old.

So as I went through them, there was a video I recorded of my mom and it was pointed at her face. I watched it and I started bawling. Hearing her talk, laugh, make facial expressions, move around, and just look like a real living person broke me. I just rewatched a bit and I’m full on crying while trying to type this. She looks and sounds so much different it’s terrifying.

There was another video I took of my brother being silly and he walked into our kitchen and she was in there too. Seeing her opening the refrigerator, walking to the sink to grab wipes from underneath, and speaking doesn’t even seem real. Comparing her from then to now is crushing. 

I’m so fucking pissed this goddamn disease literally killed my mom. She doesn’t even resemble the person she once was and it’s so scary. I miss her even though my memory can only remember how she’s been in recent years. I miss my mom and who she used to be. It’s not fucking fair my mom is now a walking corpse and a shell of who she was. I just want my mom back."
"Oh. My. Goodness.

I think it's always best to leave family members (who don't want to help) out of the care situation entirety. 

It's not good to ask, or expect anything from them. It only causes hardship.

Summary is that my heart breaks for my wife who has two sisters, one who is very helpful and another who isn't at all...and refuses it. However unhelpful sister likes to make comments about decisions that have been made regarding care giving. 

The family politics and drama is insane. I'm sure I'm not alone in this."
"Xplora X5 play smart watch for kids- great for wanderers/walkers who forget their phone. Lots of videos on YouTube 

Edit- the geocaching is all of a sudden working and I am getting notifications when he leaves his safe zones. I did an app update and it has started working today!

My dad has Alzheimer’s but is still able to live alone but we are on the last hurrah of independent living because he has always been an avid walker/hiker and it is the “dangerous” activity that is only a matter of time before he becomes disoriented. Right now he still knows his routes and neighborhood. He has recently started forgetting his phone when he sets off for his walks and I stress when I can’t get him on the phone or track where he is through his phone. We recently got him a smart watch that is geared for kids so it is user friendly enough for him to use but looks like an adult smart watch. From my research you have to be careful when you buy these watches as they don’t work in every country and you have to make sure your cell phone carrier can support it. I am located in British Columbia Canada and I was able to add a line to my Rogers cell phone plan to get a SIM card and phone number for the watch at an additional $50/month on my plan. When I went into the store the Rogers sales associate told me he couldn’t guarantee that it would work perfectly and it might be glitchy. He told me he could only guarantee that an Apple Watch would work perfectly. An Apple Watch is too complicated for my dad and has too many features he doesn’t need and it doesn’t have the ability to geocache “safe zone notifications” like the kids smart watches do. The one we got is called the Xplora X5 play. He wears the watch and I can monitor him through the app on my phone. The watch allows him to send and receive calls, text messages,instant messages, take pictures and it is VERY accurately GPS tracked. I am able to set up “safe zone notifications “ in the map from my map so I get a notification if he leaves his home or if he enters the shopping Center. I find the geocaching isn’t working very well (I am not getting notifications when he leaves the safe zones I have created) but it is new so I might not have set it up properly but according to reviews I’ve read that function hasn’t worked for a few people. It isn’t the biggest deal though because I can always see where he is regardless if I get the notification sent to my phone that he is on the move. The gps is so accurate that if I drill down on the map when he is at home I can see what part of the house he is in. When we were running errands I kept my eye on the accuracy of the gps all day and it was bang on every step. When we were in the mall I could drill down on our location and i could see the name of the store we were standing in front of on the map. It has taken away all my stress that he will forget his phone at home and get disoriented on a walk and I can’t reach him. If he falls- his phone is right on his wrist. I can always call his wrist and track where he is and the routes he has been taking so I can see if anything starts becoming outside of the normal (like he goes off course on a new route I didn’t know about or if he all of a sudden starts going for out of character 2am walks around the block. I’ll see it the next morning when I wake up the first time it happens when I check the tracking history from the night before. So far we are not there yet but when things change they change fast and I want to be ahead of the safety game. If I can get the geocaching notifications to work I’ll know if he does it in real time I will be alerted if he steps out of his home which I cached as a “safe zone”. The geo caching should work and maybe when they release an update it will work for me on my iOS). It is also handy when I am meeting up with him somewhere outside the house- he doesn’t have the stress of trying to describe where he is or give directions to me which is something he obsesses over. It’s one of his “things”

The battery lasts 8 days on standby. This appears to be accurate. With all day constant use the first day we got the watch and played around with it more than it would normally be used it still only used up 30% battery in the first 24 hours. You can see what the battery life of the watch is at through the app which I find handy in case I am not with him I can see if his battery is low and remind him to charge it. A full charge takes about an hour.

I find the calling, texting and gps features work perfectly and the only issue I’m having is with the geocache notifications. However, this watch is android and I have the app that runs the watch on my iPhone. I wouldn’t be surprised if android cell users would get the geocache notifications. But it is working like a peach considering it’s an android and I’m controlling it from iOS- only the geocache notifications are glitchy and that is okay.

Dad always liked Star Trek and he is GETTING A KICK out of holding his watch up to his ear and mouth to talk on the phone. He says he feels like a futuristic Star Trek character. The watch is plain black so it doesn’t look child-like at all like some of them do. The speaker is loud enough that you don’t have to put your hand up to your mouth or ear when you are at home talking on the phone but when we tested it in the mall he had to put the watch right up to his ear and he could hear fine and I could hear him fine on my end. The ringer is quite loud (his hearing is fine) and it also vibrates AND rings when someone is calling so it would be great for people with hearing issues.

This watch would be useful for Alzheimer’s because really the only function they need to be able to do is answer a call on it if someone calls. The gps will always work. Even if they can’t understand how to dial out as long as they know to hit the green phone button to pick up you can be in contact. That’s ALL they really need to do to make this useful. The screen is very basic and user friendly for kids so it is the better option to adult smart watches. Dad is struggling a bit but IS getting MOST of it. All the important parts. He can dial in and out. Hasn’t mastered the voice text messages yet- that’s a new one to him. He has even been sleeping in the watch. I asked him if it bugged him in his sleep and he said not at all. I find comfort in being a dial away on his wrist while he is laying in bed.  I wish Apple would make a smart watch for the elderly. It would be SO useful. I have a list of a few functions I think that would be useful for the elderly that would be different than kids needs. A 2 way radio function where you can hear their surroundings even if they don’t pick up and communicate where they don’t have to press a button on their end? Or a notification if they try to spend over $500 on a banking card that is linked? Can someone please make a call and make this happen?

If phone scammers ever become a problem we will cut off his cell phone and just have him use the watch. The reason for this is that only phone numbers that I put into the contact list on the app can call or receive calls from the watch. It’s a safety feature geared for children but it will be great when he gets to the point he might fall for a telephone scammer. The watch holds 50 contacts. Right now it is important he still has his own phone and he can track his kids whereabouts from the app on his phone still. It is only fair if we can track him he can track us and his phone is part of his independence. He has just never been remembering to bring his phone with him. He will leave it upstairs and go downstairs or outside all day and I sit at work with my stomach turning. This has taken that stress away completely.

"My grandmother is 88 years old and lives in her own separate house located on our property. She's been diagnosed with alzheimers about 1 year ago and since then she's been rapidly declining. Today she was out with my mother and I got the job to go take a look around her house cause we have the feeling she hasn't been taking her medication (we put her medication in a pill box every day and hand it to her in the morning and she brings us back the empty box in the evening).
She has forgotten to take her medication before and then quickly emptied her pill box out and put the pills in a drawer so that we wouldn't tell her off, so I checked there first and there was 1 pill. I moved some papers aside and there was a whole cup full of what mustve been 30+pills. I was sorta shocked.
I decided to keep looking around and when I checked her pantry my heart sank. I found all kinds of medications tucked away between kitchen towels and food. 3 boxes of aspirin, imodium, codeine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, paracodine, boxes of her blood pressure medication.. I don't know how she got them  cause they're not expired so they can't be that old. 
I left everything the way I found it and I guess we'll just tell her doctor about this. 
It makes me wonder if she can be trusted to live on her own anymore and if maybe it's time for her to go to a nursing home. Moving into our house isn't really an option, this situation is already extremely stressful at times. 
Is this a common thing with alzheimers? How do you make someone take their medicine when they just lie about it? We've tried to make her take it while we're standing there but then she gets offended and says we act as if she's a child."

"I’m not sure how far along he is in medical terms. I’m too afraid of upsetting my mother by asking. I’m 20 and in college and rarely have any free time to travel up and see him. I see him maybe once a month. His memory is foggy but he still remembers his loved ones and most important things. I’m worried that his memory is going to slip by before I have the chance to spend enough time with him. I’ve never experienced anything like this in my life. I know the worst is only yet to come and I am terrified of that. 

He told me that I should pick up the piano again. I am so exhausted by my degree that it’s hard to do anything outside of it. I need to try for him, though.

I don’t know exactly what I’m here to ask. I just want someone to hear me, I suppose."
"I’m really worried for my mom (55) lately she’s been forgetting more and more regarding simple things. Like if she locked the door, put away food, closed the water faucet.

My grandmother also had Alzheimers so I was wondering, is it hereditary? I’m just really worried for her and was wondering if you all could give me some tips to know if she’s developing Alzheimers and how I could aid her. Thank you!"
"Thank you for your help. This is my second post ever. (My post was to post this one in r/legaladvice)

My father-in-law (FIL) was recently diagnosed with brain and lung cancer. It's expected that he will be gone within a few months. The stress of this news has rapidly progressed what we believe to be dementia in his wife (mother-in-law - MIL). Before my FIL's diagnoses, we had been unsuccessfully trying to get my mil to a doctor for proper diagnoses, but she hates ""traditional medicine"" (anti-vax, anti-everything) and refused to go. We were trying firmly, but there didn't seem to be a massive urgency since we were only seeing small hints of dementia and my FIL was healthy and of sound mind.

Since FIL's diagnoses, the stress of everything has *rapidly* accelerated her decline. She has entirely changed in less than 4 weeks and now can't be left alone. My FIL has taken care of his affairs, but everything gets left to MIL. MIL has a paranoid delusion that everyone wants to steal her stuff. She will NOT sign a will, power-of-attorney, or any other end-of-life/post-life documents. And she will NOT go to receive any medical care. It's important to know that she has very few assets to worry about. I make more in a year than she has total. So she's not protecting a fortune. My wife just needs the authority to take care of it all when she's gone. And, the most important part, my wife will most likely have to pay MIL's bills and take care of all other daily affairs after my FIL passes. MIL cannot manage even a few hours on her own at this point.

We have no plans to put her in a home. We have space for her here and people around to help. But if MIL survives for a while, we may have to sell her house because it's an unmanageable hoarder nightmare. She can't live there. FIL kept an area clean and livable, but MIL was too much for him to keep it all nice. Now that he is sick, she has ruined every bit of that house.

My question: Without an official diagnosis, what can my wife do to take over MILs affairs so bills can get paid and the house can get taken care of?"
"Has anyone here heard of or had any experience with your loved one ever taking Vesicare(Solifenacin) which is used to treat overactive bladder but also has a significant risk of dementia in middle-aged and older patients.

"My mom (63) is taking care of my father (78) who's Alzheimer's has been   getting worst and worst quickly since he retired and the pandemic started. Lately he has not recognized her much and thinks she is ""another Rose."" He asks her to take him home most days even though he is home so he can go back to his wife Rose. Today my mom said he wouldn't go to bed and was mad that she wouldn't ""take him home."" He told her to make sure she closes her door because he might come and hit her. And that she doesn't know what she has done and that she has created so many problems.

My mom doesn't know what to do in these situations. Does anyone have any advice I can give her?"
"I recently began helping to care for my grandma. I noticed when something is out of place or wrong in some way, I try to fix it as soon as possible. Ie she's  running out of something, the hummingbird feeders need more food, etc. She gets stuck on that one thing until it is resolved, bringing it up a several times throughout the day. It's obvious she's worried about it. She knows she isn't able to solve those problems.on her own anymore. 

Now, I try to fix the issue immediately so she isn't stressed, but I am wondering if I shouldn't  do that? If  I solve every issue, is that going to make her less able to deal with other stressors I don't have control over? Or is it for the best to make her time that she is still aware, easier for her?

Any thoughts on this would be helpful!"
"A little bit of a back story. My grandpa wants to have a family vacation. Unfortunately my grandmother has Alzheimer’s. For a few years she’s shown decline but it all really went downhill during pandemic and shutdown. Her speech is really affected. It’s hard to understand what she is saying. She has anxiety. She’ll have good days but then other days where she thinks we’re trying to kill her. Her anxiety gets worse if she’s tired too. Fortunately she can still care for her basic needs like brush her teeth, dress herself, use the bathroom. She remembers who her family is even if she forgets our names. And she also isn’t violent or rude. She’s very sweet. Everyone at her drs office loves her. I feel like my grandpa wants to have this family vacation because he feels like it might the last chance he’ll be able to with my grandma. We’ve seen a decline since the pandemic started and we’re afraid that it’s only going to get worse. That’s why I was wondering if anyone has any advice on traveling with some with Alzheimer’s or maybe someone has good reasons as to why we shouldn’t travel with her. I’m really open to hearing any type of advice or suggestions. We live in the usa and we were thinking of traveling on plane somewhere close (like 3 or 4 hours away)."
"My question is 2-fold. One to offer myself as a study to help progress research in this awful disease and also to hopefully catch it quick/ early. I am a 38F with a strong family history of Alzheimer's. While I have not been diagnosed, I know that (based on my experience) that once you're diagnosed, the writing is on the wall, so to speak... and I see symptoms (possibly) already. Is there some research study group that I can join that may benefit the research and possibly give more data to my impending diagnosis that my help my own journey or (dare I say) treatment in the Central Texas area? All I am finding is studies for people who are already diagnosed..."
"I came on here a while ago because I was in desperate need of some support due to my mom’s diagnosis. It’s been an incredibly stressful year, although I’ve been experiencing profound personal growth that I sometimes feel guilty for even finding the time to explore. Taking over someone’s entire life paperwork and becoming a POA feels like second job, I’m burnt out half the time and I shut down for a week at a time after each new “task,” because it’s never just that, is it? It’s a reminder that my parent is deteriorating and that I’m preparing for some difficult stuff, it hits me like a wave and takes so much out of me. I stop going out, not interested in entertainment, leave my books half read, and I mean forget about working out, I can’t even lift my arms. Everything halts like a bad depressive episode. It doesn’t happen every single time thankfully, and I’m getting better at bouncing back.

I couldn’t continue with the support group, doesn’t feel right yet. I guess because she hasn’t progressed too much since the new meds, or the fact that I feel bad for people who have it worse, fear of hearing about what’s to come, or all of the above. My siblings and I have been venting and supporting each other through it so I guess that kind of took over as well. I appreciate that we have a more matter of fact approach about it with each other.

Does anyone else with parents with Alzheimer’s wonder about their future with the disease? Can we stop saying it’s not guaranteed to happen? I mean maybe it’s not… but I feel that in order to defy the odds, you better have a damn good life. I mean no trauma, mental stress or other mental illness (bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety), have good sleeping habits, diet and exercise. Some of that we can control. But I’ve experienced a lot of trauma, and it makes me wonder how much damage has been done. My mom’s came on so damn early. She had some signs as early as her late 40s and we didn’t even figure it out. Her fucking late 40s. I want a family but I could never imagine putting this kind of pain and stress on people I love. I feel like I should just enjoy the time I have and do some good in the world, enjoy my hobbies &amp; career, travel, and just make a decision about my quality of life later on if I notice anything alarming… sorry if that’s dark. But another part of me wonders if that’s just a fear based decision that will rob me of having a husband and kids, and feeling that completeness I always wanted under my own roof. Who knows."
"Just some good news that I really wanted to share with some people. 

Background: I am in college (19F), my father is (83M) and was diagnosed with Alzheimer's about a year and a half ago but has been suffering form memory decline as well as health issues for far longer dating all the way back to about my freshman year of high school. We've always been close due to the fact that we're very similar personality wise and his Alzheimer's has been hitting me really hard, especially since I'm so young and am currently in college so I'm no longer always there to help him. 

He's always loved music. He played in his school's band growing up and either has perfect pitch or something extremely close to it, to the point that he never learned to read music and simply listened and recreated it the next moment. His birthday was last month and I bought two tickets for him to see the symphony that was putting on a Beethoven concert in the city where I go to college (him and my mom live about an hour away in a smaller city that doesn't have these kind of opportunities.) 

I bought the tickets for him and my mom to go, intending it to be a sort of date, but my mom told me that I should go with him. I've always been musical as well, not to the extent that my father was, but it's always something my dad and I have been able to bond over. My mom, in comparison, is hilariously tone-deaf and readily admits so. So, I agreed and my dad and I decided to go together instead. 

I took my parents out to dinner beforehand and then me and my dad went to the symphony while my mom went to a bookstore. 

My dad loved it. 

Loved it is a total understatement. He was absolutely enthralled with the music. I bought the cheapest tickets available (college am i right lol) but they ended up being in the very front row. I was worried it might be too loud for my dad with his hearing aids, but he didn't complain or say anything. The entire time he was watching with so much attention and joy and wouldn't stop telling me how exciting it was to be so close to a real orchestra and how he'd never been to a symphony before. 

He cried multiple times. Tears of joy and not unusual bc my dad's always been more sensitive and his emotional regulation has gotten worse with the Alzheimer's. During intermission he sat and talked to me about how wonderful this was and would sing some of the parts from the symphony that he thought were particularly amazing. 

When it ended it was far later then my dad usually stays up (he's old and was a military man so he's usually in bed by 6-7 PM) but he was so full of energy afterward!! On the car ride back to meet with my mom he continued to tell me how magnificent it was, how much he enjoyed it, how grateful he was to me for taking him, etc.  I hadn't seen him smile that much in months. 

It was such a surreal experience. I was so happy that I could do something so good for my dad, bring him some joy in his life again. He told me hat it was something he'd ""never forget"" and even though I know that's probably not true, it almost brought tears to my eyes hearing it. My mom was glad that she got to take some 'her' time (she lives with my dad, is younger then him, and although my dad is still capable of basic functions my mom always cooks and cleans) and I was happy to have done something so good for both my parents. 

TL;DR my dad has Alzheimer's and loves music. I bought him and me symphony tickets and he absolutely adored it. It was a magical experience for my dad that I'll cherish forever."
It seems to be having the opposite effect. Have other folks had this experience? It’s getting to the point where the memory care facility might ask us to find another facility.
Been a full time caregiver to my gran for 3 years. The next time someone says “you should try looking after kids” I will scream at them.
"I just finished watching 'The Father', a new film released about Dementia, starring Sir Anthony Hopkins.  


It is incredible.  


Without saying too much about it, the film successfully manages to paint a vivid picture of this awful disease and how it affects both the patient and family members.  


It really hits home. Moreover, it has given me a much-needed boost of sympathy (which I hope will last). The next time i lose my patience I will try my absolute best to rise above it and imagine just how scary it must be.  


Go watch it and spread the word on this film if you can. The more awareness this awful condition gets the more chance it has that one day a cure will arrive."
"I've posted about my mom a couple of times before, and she's even worse since the first time I posted a couple of months ago. I guess I just need to vent. She's 64 and was diagnosed with early-onset in July after a year of suspicions, ruling everything else out, and trying to get to the point of diagnosis.

She has lived with me for 8 months as of last week, and I am really just trying to catch my breath at the realization of how bad she's gotten in this timeframe. She already doesn't recognize me, though she knows I am someone she is comfortable with. She thinks she has another daughter, another version of me. Earlier this week, she even tried to tell me she had kids, plural. It's constantly ""my shady-pines-ma,"" ""the other shady-pines-ma,"" but if I ask her what my name is, she'll say it's her name, or she just doesn't know. I asked her if she had other kids, why aren't they here taking care of her, and of course, she doesn't know how to answer that. Sometimes, she'll call out ""mom"" as if she is genuinely calling for her mom to come do something for her. Last week, she asked me if I knew where mom was. Or sometimes, she'll ask me where my mom is. I knew we would deal with that at some point, I just didn't know it would be this soon. She doesn't resonate with the way she used to tell me she loved me ""I love you to infinity and beyond,"" or ""you are my happy thought"" anymore. 

She'll ask me if I know her brothers (my uncles), or she'll ask me if I knew her parents, and then in the same breath, she'll threaten them in some way for ""not telling her"" about me as if it's some sort of conspiracy. It's so rough and surreal. I know she's basically Benjamin Buttoning, and I feel like we're in her teenage years right now, but also teetering on toddler. The way she talks back to me sometimes now can be incredibly upsetting, especially if I'm already at my bullshit limit for the day. I don't think I ever had the same attitude with her when I was an actual teenager. She has also said some incredibly awful and mean spirited things to me like wishing that I get Alzheimer's and die when she's really upset. I'm truly at the point where I wish she would just die already, and it hurts me so much to think that when I used to be terrified at the thought of life without her. I know it will be a bittersweet relief when she is finally gone.

She cannot be left alone, even if I'm only just outside for a short amount of time, and when I am able to get someone to look after her for a short while, she has major separation anxiety and just cannot settle down and is very restless. It's exhausting. I went out to organize something in the garage, left her with a show on, things should have been fine. Came back inside after 30 minutes, she had eaten 4/6 bananas that I had bought barely 12 hours before from grocery shopping last night. They were meant to last her the whole week. She also had taken her shirt off, but was very adamant that she only ate one banana and that I had told her to take her shirt off. The four banana peels in the garbage and the half of a banana I found on top of the toilet says otherwise. I now have what are supposed to be child proof covers on my deadbolt locks and child proof door knob covers on my doors in an effort to prevent her from wandering out unsafely and getting lost. I'm screwed if she figures out the deadbolt covers in particular. I'm really hoping the doorknob covers are enough of a deterrent as well, but I know she could totally figure them out if she really wanted to. We'll see about those I guess and hope for the best. 

I spent a good chunk of change on a really nice medical ID bracelet, and she does a great job of keeping it on 24/7, so there's that, but she really has no idea how to use her phone anymore, and there would be zero guarantee she could use it or even think to use it in an emergency. I almost feel like it might just be best to cancel her phone plan and direct anyone who wants to talk to her to call me. Does anyone have any input on that? I'm genuinely curious to know how you've handled your loved one's phone privileges. She also says she sees people and hears voices telling her things. It's always ""someone was here,"" ""they said this,"" ""last night when they were here,"" etc., but she can never actually tell me what ""they"" are doing or saying to her. She really can't tell me anything of purpose anymore, or when she does seem like she has something to say, it's never anything relevant, and it's all half thought out and incomplete with zero sense to be made of it. She still has most of her speech function, but it is limited and childlike, or just straight up delusional.

She is constantly moving and hiding things that belong to both of us. She won't stop taking pictures I have out of frames, especially ones of me as a child because they're pictures of *her* shady-pines-ma. She's lost two that I've now had on my refrigerator for years, and they're the only copies of these two pictures in particular that I had. I ended up taking everything decorative off of the fridge in defeat. She'll take things from my craft workspace and put them on her nightstand. She put a metal canning jar lid in the toilet. She took the finial off of her nightstand lamp one morning, I screwed it back on, and then later in the day it was gone and completely missing. The TV remote is currently MIA for the past few days. We can turn it on and at least watch streaming stuff through the other input, but it's stuck on one channel for now until we can find it. When she's not doing that, she's pulling books, CDs and DVDs off of the bookshelf and spreading them all over the room. I'm going to be boxing those up this weekend in an out of sight, out of mind, effort.

She can't bathe herself completely anymore. If she is supposed to be washing her hair or her body, she'll just pour shampoo or body wash into her hands and rub her hands together vigorously, but in the same breath, has no idea what she's supposed to do to wash her hands in the sink. She doesn't know how to brush her teeth anymore. She can't go to the bathroom independently anymore most of the time, I'm having to be in there pulling her pants down and making her sit on the toilet. My subconscious has learned to wake up in the mornings on the weekend when I hear her wandering into the bathroom, and I hate it. Otherwise, she'll just sit on the toilet fully clothed and pee. The disposable underwear can only hold so much. She pooped her pants again earlier this week (we're now on the third time that's happened, and I know that number will continue to rise), and stuck her hands in it, and then got it all over her pillows. Or she'll wander into the bathroom, turn on the light, and walk right back out. Or there was the time this week where she walked into the bathroom and dumped water from her glass into the toilet. Oh, and let's talk about how she wastes toilet paper and tissue now. She'll unroll toilet paper and just leave it on the counter or stash it in a drawer, but never actually uses it to wipe herself like she's supposed to, or she'll pull tissues out of the box and scatter them around so she can use the tissue box like a storage container for pictures or trash.


We have toured an adult day-care center, but she isn't able to go yet, because I can't do their specific pick up and drop off times with my work schedule. I had to fill out an application for our county's transit authority to be able to do that, but they sent back the application I filled out because I didn't provide proof that I had the right to fill out the form, so now I have to send proof of my POA and start over. I've also finally spoken with a company for in-home respite care, but it's going to take a few weeks for that to get in motion too. Memory care is the final boss, and the financial situation is overwhelming. It seems like I won't be able to avoid protecting her assets and we're going to have to do a spend down anyway before I can get any other assistance. Her money is going to go so fast. My sanity and making sure she has the proper care is a priority though, so it is what it is. I'm hoping to have her placed ASAP. Before spring comes if I can help it. Some of the referral agents I've spoken with are really recommending I keep her close by, but our area (Bay Area) is so expensive. I feel like the money would stretch a bit further if I get her a couple of hours away, but I've been attempted to be talked out of it in a ""well, what happens if something happens and you need to get to her quickly?"" manner, but at this point, I almost don't care. I know it will also limit how often I'm able to visit her and spend time with her, but I feel like I'm okay with that too. That's just how I feel about her and our situation right now. I don't know. I just don't know. Twice now, it's been recommended to me to just leave her at an ER and tell them I can't care for her anymore, but that seems like the worst thing I could possibly do. What would even happen if I did that?

She is just so far gone, and has the emptiest look in her eyes. She truly has no idea what the hell she's doing anymore. I almost just feel so gaslit, but I know it's the Alzheimer's gaslighting both of us. At the same time, I have completely detached from her as well. I love her and I hate her, and I hate that I hate her. I just miss my mom and it really sucks that she's still here but not still here. I want someone to take care of me. I am running on empty, and the only reason I haven't had a complete mental breakdown yet is because I can't afford to. I am in therapy, and trying to find actual support groups are still on my to-do list, although on the flip side of the idea of a support group, what's the point? We all just share our feelings? She also got denied by her insurance to try the Rivastigmine patch (Donepezil caused severe gastric upset and dehydrated her to the point she was hospitalized for three days shortly after she moved in with me), and we certainly can't afford it out of pocket. I don't even think it would make a difference at this point, though either. The hardest part about this too, is knowing that she could be on a fast track to the end, but completely plateau for years after all of this, until the actual end. Not having any kind of timeline or prognosis to the end is hard. She is moderate to severe though, I know that much. It has progressed that fast in just a year of first realizing something was wrong with her.

I'm so angry still, it blows my mind. I saw a post on FB a few weeks ago that read ""Someone said 'anger is sadness that had nowhere to go for a really long time' and I'll never forget it,"" and it's so fucking true. This is the most extreme sadness and anger that I have ever felt, and I can feel how utterly toxic and harmful it is. I feel like a prisoner and an indentured servant, and I know she feels like she's a prisoner too. I still just can't believe this is our life, and that makes me so sad. If you've read this, thanks."
"My grandmother is currently in a nursing home in Greece with Alzheimer’s (we live in the U.S.). When my grandmother was being diagnosed/treated prior to her move to the nursing home, the doctor apparently tested my mother for early onset as well and it turns out that she has it. This was maybe 5 or so years ago. My mom refused treatment and never told me or my brother. Over the last year she has definitely been showing signs of Alzheimer’s that my brother and I are all too aware of from taking care of our grandmother. On top of that, my mom drinks heavily (to the point of blacking out nightly) which of course doesn’t help with her symptoms. I’ve talked to her numerous times about her symptoms and the other day she finally admitted that she has early onset Alzheimer’s and refuses any treatment. Obviously I’m pissed and I have no idea what to do. She’s too stubborn to hear me out and keeps saying she will let me know when it’s getting bad and will go to a nursing home in Greece when the time is right. That makes zero sense though as we are all in the U.S. and we can’t afford to be traveling back and forth to Greece to see her. We want to come up with a plan now but she refuses.
On top of that, I’m pregnant with my first child (her first grandchild) and she’s super excited and wants to be very involved in his life. I can’t let that happen. She doesn’t even remember to feed herself so how could I trust her to feed/change a child if I weren’t around? She also doesn’t know current safe sleep practices for babies. I’ve tried explaining them to her but she keeps forgetting and suggesting I buy/do things that could lead to SIDS in my baby. So of course I can’t trust her. 
With the baby on the way, my husband and I will not have room in our home to take care of her. My brother and his fiancé are not financially stable enough to care for my mom so we’re all stuck in a predicament. 
Does anyone have any suggestions on what we could possibly do or how we could better plan for her to inevitably be placed in a nursing home?"
"Hoping this is the right forum for asking this question. I've read about a new drug - simufilam - that has started phase 3 trials, and although there seem to be some citizen petitions going on to delay the studies, the results so far seem very, very promising. I remember hearing about blockbuster AD drugs that did well in phase 2 but ultimately flopped in phase 3 ([this article](https://scrip.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/SC097113/Surprise-Its-A-Phase-III-Failure) lists those from Pfizer and Eli Lilly). 

I know nothing's guaranteed what happens in phase 3, but it seems like the FDA is very eager to do something about the AD epidemic, what with its controversial approval of aduhelm. I was wondering, though, if anyone could provide a medical or pharmacological perspective on if simufilam sets itself apart from other drugs that have come and gone in terms of efficacy or mechanisms, and if the results so far are to be taken very seriously. Thank you in advance!"
"My 78 year old mom recently developed significant short term memory loss. She's mostly functional (she can feed herself, move around, use the bathroom unassisted, bathe herself, prepare simple meals), but her memory suffers after about 10 - 20 minutes. 

She likes to stay active and I'm trying trying to find ways for her to fill her time. Reading doesn't hold her attention anymore, because she can't follow a narrative. Same with tv/movies. She putters around in the garden when the weather is nice.  I set her up with lumocity, which she seems to enjoy, but she can't do that all day. She spends a lot of time doing chores like laundry and cleaning. I don't want that to be all she does.

I'd love to hear any thoughts or suggestions you have. Thanks"
"My mom's partner has been showing signs of worsening cognitive decline for the past year. It began at the height of lockdown, when he was under a lot of stress, and started with sporadically forgetting random recent events while impulsively and passive-aggressively acting out. He's never been an easy person to deal with, so we assumed it was just the sort of stress and anxiety most of us were dealing with through the pandemic.

He was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment last fall and put on donepezil, and has been taking curcumin supplements as well. He has categorically refused to make any lifestyle changes though. He stays up for over 24 hours at least one day a week (he's been doing this consistently for over around fifteen years), and hasn't maintained a normal sleep schedule for the last several months. He's constantly awake. He complains about waking easily because of everyday sounds other people make, but will not use earplugs or a white noise machine as suggested. He's also been prescribed sleeping pills to help insomnia, but refuses to take them. 

My mom has tried for the past year to get him to exercise regularly, but he refuses - this includes light exercise like going for a daily walk. He will only go if she accompanies him, but she has her own health issues that leave her exhausted after work. His primary activities are basically watching TV dramas whenever he's awake (this goes on for 6-12 hours a day) and going to work. He's alienated his relatives and friends by being critical and emotionally abusive, so he also gets very little meaningful social contact.

On top of this, his diet is dismal. He has always refused to prepare his own food, relying instead on my mom to do it for him. She works full-time at a high-stress job, so she rarely has time to prepare healthy meals for him. She does buy brain-friendly foods (fatty fish, walnuts, greens, etc) for him to prep and eat but this is also someone who has, for decades, refuses to prep a meal and clean up after himself. Unless he has food cooked and served to him, he'll subsist off sugary, high-carb snacks and coffee loaded up with sugar and cream. It probably doesn't help that he also vapes nicotine constantly, or that he's been a lifelong smoker until a few years ago.

In the last few months, my mom has noted that he'll forget events that happened that day, and that he'll repeat the same stories and phrases over and over. He constantly forgets belongings like his phone or even his work paychecks. He also now seems to have trouble with basic things like knowing road rules, but has been able to keep commuting to work because it's a route he's taken daily for over a decade. He's always been a very angry person, but seems to have trouble controlling it effectively now. He vacillates between giving my mom the silent treatment for imagined slights, throwing temper tantrums, and begging her not to leave him. It has just been a lot to deal with.

He's now on both donepezil and memantine, but has shown no improvement. I guess I'm asking what we can do, or what to expect in the coming years, especially when he refuses to do things he needs to do to maintain his health. I don't know what we can even do for him anymore."

"Hello, I'm sorry about the long post..

(I also just want to preface before asking my question that I don't know very much about Alzheimer's  and as I haven't been directly involved with the situation so I can only explain what I've heard)

Some backstory first: My aunty has been living with my grandma for a very long time now (just for the convenience not so much because of health issues) and she began to notice sometime last year that my grandma (in her mid-90's) was showing symptoms of memory loss and a lack of appetite. My family does their best to call her and would visit regularly outside of quarantine, but each time they talk to her, her memory gets shorter.   
This afternoon my aunty called to speak to my mum and explained that she needs to come visit soon.   
My grandma's lack of appetite has gotten worse, to the point where she can no longer keep the few foods she was able to eat before down. Last week I overheard that my aunty got scared and almost called an ambulance because my grandma wouldn't respond to her questions - she just sat and stared.   
Another issue that they've been dealing with recently is my grandma forgetting to turn off the gas stove in the kitchen etc. - my aunty keeps having to watch her closely because of this.  


My grandma feels like she's being treated like a child and, to some degree, my aunty is doing just that.   
She understands that something isn't right but can't figure out what it is and when told, she can't remember it a couple of minutes later.   
Because my grandma still believes that she's able to take care of herself, they sometimes argue and a lot of tension has been created between them.   
A while ago my aunty started doing a course about Dementia and Alzheimer's, trying to understand it and some of the things that could help - but so far nothing seems to have worked or lasted. 

My question is, I guess, what do I do, or more like, how can ***I*** help?   
No one wants to involve retirement homes (I don't want this either) or a helper - although, I don't know what they'd be able to do to help other than ease my aunty's stress and provide emotional support.    
It just doesn't feel like there are many options, if any at all. Most of what I was trying to come up months ago (e.g. puzzles, colouring, reading, post-it notes around the house to help her remember or a note book etc.) aren't doable anymore because she can't focus.   
Food wise, my aunty's tried soft foods and smoothies, even sneaking supplements in, but they aren't really an option either. 

My family are trying their best with what they can do (especially with being in quarantine), but is there more we can be doing... or do we just keep doing what we're doing....?

Thank you for your time."
"Hello everyone. I previously posted about my grandfather [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/o4ylse/how_do_we_take_the_dogs_away_xpost_from_rdementia/). Things have progressed and I'd very much appreciate some insight. My mother is POA and sort of the unofficial caregiver, but does not live with him.

First of all, shortly after that post, one of the dogs was put down. We are unsure exactly what happened, but she was throwing up and apparently miserable. I believe Papa was talking about ""putting her down"" like, ""in the backyard"" if you catch my drift. This was alarming. My mom convinced him to try a medication the vet had suggested. 

The short version of this story is that the dogs looked very similar and the wrong dog was getting the medication and therefore the sick dog did not improve and therefore got euthanized by the vet. To say I'm horrified about this is an understatement. 

The remaining dog (11 year old yellow lab) is overweight, arthritic, currently has a double ear infection, and recently sprained an elbow. Supposedly she fell off the bed. She is 110% not getting medicated for arthritis, nor is she getting the care she needs for her ears, because Papa does not remember to do this. 

He loves the dog. But also apparently is starting to forget he has a dog. I guess he asked my mom last night ""where did this dog come from?"". But also still thinks he has two dogs sometimes. His GP and Neurologist seem to think it's good for him to have the dog. Do they know about the state of the dog? I do not know.

Papa is moving in to an assisted living facility this month. My mom is trying to work in conversations about the dog coming to stay with me/my husband while he moves in and then hopefully he'll just forget about her. My mom is convinced this isn't going to work and Papa will get belligerent. I guess she's brought it up a couple times before and it hasn't gone over well...the general idea of the dog coming to live with me. 

Quite frankly I don't give a shit if he likes it or not. This dog is suffering and needs to be taken care of and no one is taking care of her. Papa is already forgetting her and how many dogs he does/does not have. I know the doctors think the dog is good for him, but it's not good for HER.

What can/should I do? From what I understand about Papa's condition, he's going to be angry about it but probably not remember it the next day anyway. Do we take the dog and all the dog stuff out of the apartment at the same time and then POOF! she's gone from his mind?"
"My mother is getting deeper into this illness (Stage 5 or 6) and starting to display a lot of restlessness, agitation, compulsions (OCD!), and anxiety.

She expresses these anguished sighs one might make when very overwhelmed or stressed.

Every morning she has a couple cups of coffee.

I understand caffeine is advisable early on but this late in the game, I'm wondering if it's just making her symptoms worse.

We're certainly not saving her memory or anything at this point with a couple cups of coffee.

My father, while the primary caretaker, is very stuck in his ways. When I asked him about why she needs coffee, he kind of shrugged like ""well, that's just what she's always done...""

**What do you think? Necessary? Good for morale? Better to switch to something less stimulating?**

**P.S.** I could go into the science and my concerns about coffee and cerebral blood flow, cortisol, etc. but I want to first suspend my judgement and get your very much appreciated opinion."
"What is your experience dropping a family member off at assisted living? Do you lie to them? My dad will most likely be moving into a facility in the upcoming month and I'm not sure what to expect. I am sure it will be unpleasant as he almost threw a fit when he thought he would have an overnight stay in the hospital. 

&#x200B;

Although he is only 58 he is rapidly declining. He does know who is family members are, recognizes all of us when we come visit and is aware of where he is. However, he is in adult diapers and not aware when he goes to the bathroom, and often screams when it is a bowel movement and screams in the shower. He also will take the diaper off and go to the bathroom on the floor or couch and sit/lay in it. He has problems sitting up and back down as well as laying up and down and leans to one side when standing and falls often. That is why it has been hard to make the switch because although his body is declining, he still knows us and the house. 

&#x200B;

My mom is paying out of pocket for a caretaker when she is at work but I know she is up all night as he wakes up every half hour even with an increase in medication that is supposed to calm him and let him sleep. 

Also, do we bring furniture/items as if we are going to a dorm room? We thought we would tell him its like a rehab to make himself stronger and help physically. Not sure what to expect. Should we not visit right away? How long/often are your visits?"
"I'm only 40 but over the last couple years I've started to forget a lot of things. I can't recall movies I watched from 2 weeks ago (until I rewatch it and then it all comes back), I can't recall certain events in my 20s (like where I first met an ex-gf) and a lot of other things. However with numbers, especially telephone numbers or any set of numbers I can recall from way back in the past. 

Anyways I know this may be an early sign of potential Alzheimer's disease and want to know what I can do to slow down the process, if so. I have a pretty bad diet and don't really exercise much anymore. So I know I need to fix those things but are there any other pointers anyone can give me. I saw my grandmother go through a mild level of Alzheimer's where she would forget conversations from 5 mins ago and wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy. 

So far I have mapped out a plan with the changes I need to make in my life

1. Eat better
2. Exercise
3. Do math equations to stimulate my brain

If anyone can add anything else, that would be much appreciated."
"Forgive me if I’m doing this all wrong, this is my first post in Reddit. I’m 41 years old and my mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s (early stages) two years ago at age 74. She was relatively healthy otherwise. In the last couple of weeks she has had a sharp decline overall but still very high functioning. She was living with myself and my spouse and 6 year old daughter but she has a one track mind of getting back to her boyfriend in Canada. The boyfriend is not honest with her (they still speak on phone), but tells my siblings and I that he cannot take care of her. She blames us for keeping them apart, even though he isn’t allowed to come to US anyway due to Covid. Every day was arguments about pills and remembering to eat. She would get angry when we’d try to help her, claiming that us not letting her do these things herself is what’s making her “brain fail”.  Left to her own devices she is not capable of taking her pills appropriately or cooking a decent meal. She claimed she had all this money (she does not) and we must be stealing it. She would get verbal aggressive and the arguing started to have a real effect on my spouse and daughter (and me)!  We placed her in an “apartment style” AL that has a memory care neighborhood and she is irate. She claims she wants to die, she hates it, her life is over, we dumped her, and she’s refusing to take her pills now. I feel like I’m going crazy - the guilt and grief and sadness just never ends with this disease. She is truly high functioning for memory care but not appropriate for more independent assisted living or independent senior housing. So we are stuck in this cycle of her begging us to get her out so she can go be with her boyfriend in Canada, us gently trying to redirect, and her spitting venom at us again. It’s awful and heartbreaking. I guess maybe I’m just venting, or looking for reassurance or similar experiences? Thank you for listening and I’m sorry to all who love someone with this awful disease."
"Hello, 

My father was diagnosed with Lewy Body dementia 6 years ago - and I have started coming to my parents house once every few months with microphones and audio recording devices - to make recordings of his memories (his old memories are razor sharp - his new ones dont really stick).  I wanted to make recordings for him - so he can listen to his own stories - and I will get people who are in his stories to record their side - so when he is in the throngs of dementia - he can listen to his own memories and stories.  This is also so my and my brothers children will be able to see videos of him and hear his stories.  

I'm here to ask - what kinds of questions would you want to ask your father?  What are somethings you wished you would be able to ask - or things you would be curious about?

Serious and Funny questions - Here are what I am asking/planning on asking 

1. What do you remember about becoming a father
2. What if anything was something you stole - how did you feel after that
3. What was it like meeting mom - and getting married / having kids?
4. What was it like growing up durring the segregation movement ending?
5. Who was your first kiss - 
6. What was the most scared you had ever been?
7. Did you ever want to leave after you started a family?
8. What was your favorite trip you have ever taken?
9. What was your favorite memory growing up?
10. How has love changed as you have gotten older?"
"\*\*We are so sorry for the repost but we need more participants for this study and we greatly appreciate those who already did the survey and discussion posts! Thank you so much again!

Hello, 

We are part of a research team at the Emory University School of Nursing. Eun-Ok Im, PhD, MPH, RN, CNS, FAAN, School of Nursing, Emory University, and her colleagues are conducting a study to explore racial/ethnic differences in the attitudes toward Alzheimer’s Disease among midlife women who are family caregivers of persons living with Alzheimer’s Disease.

Currently, we are in the process of recruiting participants to enroll in the study. Please note that this is online-based research and does not involve human contact, so participants are free of COVID-19 concerns. 

We are looking for midlife women aged 40 to 65 years old who can read and write English; who are online; whose self-reported racial/ethnic identity is Hispanic, non-Hispanic (N-H) White, N- H African American, or N-H Asian, and who are family caregivers of persons living with Alzheimer’s Disease. Participants will receive an electronic gift certificate of 20 dollars for filling out the Internet survey and an additional electronic gift certificate of 50 dollars for participating in the additional social media discussion.

For more information, please visit our website below and/or contact us. Thank you for your interest.

"My dad celebrated his 72nd birthday last week, and yesterday he was diagnosed with early Alzheimer's. This disease scares me more than any other because he can't really fight it. I'm scared and sad and mad and trying to figure out how to support my dad and mom when I live a fair distance away. I'm thankful my dad is very tech savvy so we can use different things to help him with his short term memory, but beyond that I don't know what to do. I just need some support so I can help my parents."
"Can’t believe the day has come. I knew for so long. He’s been fighting this disease for almost 10 years. I thought I would be more prepared. This was prob one of the saddest  weeks of my life. I’m glad he’s not in any pain anymore, but I’m just sad that I will never see my dad again. It’s just not fair."
"I was wondering if anyone has had their loved one recommended PEG feeding tube surgery? It’s for patients who can not eat or chew, and a tube is inserted surgically into the stomach where you pump liquid food into their stomach. My grandmother had this done because she couldn’t eat and her veins had a blockage due to having IV fluids pumped into her for a long time. (Her arms were purple from all the IV injections). She had the surgery done and was sent home. We then saw she had trouble breathing like there was fluid in her lungs. We took her to another hospital to get the fluid suctioned out but they said that it would come back again. She only survived a day or two after that.  I read an article somewhere that this PEG feeding tube surgery can cause fluid buildup in the lungs. And that’s exactly what happened to her. Does anyone have a similar experience?"
"I work at a local credit union.

A week ago an elderly lady came in who very clearly had some advanced alzheimers going on. Infact, once we found her record and account it was apperent that her son was the one who was supposed to be taking care of her. I was told after I was very patient with her. 

I had to explain things to her up to 10 times over, and she often ended up in a cycle of questions about things she'd already told me about. It was a very emotionally rough experience I'm not going to lie. It was about an hour I was with her too.

We attempted to contact her son using the information we had on file, but could not get ahold of him. This lady did mention something about how he was probably at work. And then later she'd ask if we could call him, when we said we couldn't get ahold of him she asked why, we'd say 'he's at work' and she'd wonder why he was at work. 

I was rather annoyed with her son actually for not taking care of his mother or ensuring she's safe. She eventually decided she would go home and wait for her son, after a couple times of walking out, then immediately turning back in and forgetting the whole interraction. Fortunately, it seems she lived just about a mile from the credit union and down the road, but I did not feel really too good about how that was how the interraction ended.

So in the future, in case she comes wandering in again, or if I have a different credit union member come in who's showing that they're not entirely with it, is there any sort of number or service we would be able to call to ensure they can safely get home? I did not feel comfortable at the end of the interraction that she ended up leaving, still alone, and I would've really wanted to just escort her myself but my work's policies (and the fact it was a saturday with reduced staff anyways) prevented me from doing so. 

I live in the Salt Lake region of Utah if that helps. I was thinking during the interraction of actually calling a paramedic or doctor of sorts. We also left a note on her account to tell her son to leave us some other family member numbers as well, but there's no gaurantee we will get any from him."
"My MIL (85F) has Alzheimer’s for a few years.  At first her symptoms were light but it’s progressing now.

Recently,  her doctor ordered a driving evaluation.  This week, we received the letter that she is no longer allowed to drive. 

So my husband and I went to her apartment to meet my MIL and my SIL (62F). The plan was to tell her that we are taking the car away.

So my SIL proceeded to tell her that she is no longer allowed to drive and that we are taking the car away.  She was shocked and almost started to cry.  Saying no more car,  no more car,  then she calmed down.

15 minutes later,  we proceeded to take the car keys.  She then asked why?  We explained again,  that she was no longer allowed to drive.  Once again,  she almost started to cry, repeating no more car,  no more car.

My SIL stayed with her when my husband left with the car.  She asked why he was taking her car?  SIL explained.  MIL had the same reaction, sadness and resolution.

It makes me so sad to see her stuck in this memory loop.  I needed to share."
"Tomorrow (or today depending on when you read this) will be the first time I’ve been able to see my grandma in over a year.

It’s been a long hard road with her dementia diagnosis and she’s finally settled and comfy in her LTC. Rules have eased up for visiting so it’s easier to go and see her.

I’m just feeling anxious because the last time I spoke to her on facetime which was sometime late last year she still remembered me. Tomorrow I know she won’t and I don’t know how to mentally prepare for that knife to my heart. 

In part I’m more worried about my grandad seeing my pain because I know he’s upset about me seeing her like this and not in her normal “grandma” way. I’m scared I’ll lose my composure but I also know I don’t want her there by herself with me too chicken to see her.

So if you have any kind words or pieces of advice, I’d deeply appreciate it."
"Hi everyone, 

I’m 15 and my dad is 69, and recently he’s started to deteriorate, recently, he’s been confusing there and sometimes forgets where we are going, but there was one bad episode that was about 10 mins, he woke up and had no idea who I was, this was really a hit on me for a few days, but I got over it yet it still makes me cry. I am currently ok but this is slowly picking up and I am slowly losing my dad.. and this is so painful for me to watch it happen. He’s being moved to assisted living soon and this just pains more because despite his condition I think him going to assisted living is worse then his apartment currently because he will be around people in much worse condition. The point of this post is, does anybody have any coping methods? This so hard on me, luckily I’ve been able to manage it but with things slowly getting worse I need more help.. 
thank you."
"Has anyone ever developed a sort of 'coping mechanism' later on in life? I'm 31 and I recently started cracking my fingers. or more often, making the motions to crack my fingers because I can't crack them on demand. It started when my dad went into the hospital, and now I do it every time I'm anxious, stressed or nervous about something. It's like I need to do it, but sometimes I don't even notice I'm doing it. It's fucking weird."
"My father is 60 and has early onset Alzheimers. Since his diagnosis, he has been living at home with my family and I and care taking hasn't been so bad. In the last couple of days he has become suddenly violent, with the rest of my family and I being afraid for our safety. Because we did not complete his power of attorney documents, no facility that can better deal with his aggression will hold him involuntarily. I know that going through the process of getting power of attorney over someone in his state may take time, but I wonder if there is a speedier process for my emergency since we are afraid for our safety if he comes home from the emergency room today. (context I live in Virginia)"
"My father (80) has Alzheimer’s and his side of the family has a history of dementia.  Looking back it was probably Alzheimer’s. 

Today I just had the biggest space cadet moment I’ve ever had in my life and to be honest, I’m a little concerned that this may be the first sign of Alzheimer’s for me.

I just walked into the restroom at work with my mind preoccupied with some serious work challenges and I walked up to and started peeing in the trash can.  It only lasted for .5 seconds.  When I heard the sound I clicked immediately back into reality and stopped.  I’m not on any medication or other substance that would impair my thinking or judgment.

Perhaps this was just a stress fugue and spending time with my father is making me paranoid, but how can you really tell?  I’m only 48.

My dad just passed away and I’d like to request donations in his honor to an Alzheimer’s charity.  Is there a preference?  I looked at Alzheimer’s association and Alzheimer’s Foundation and the latter has better ratings on the charity navigator website.
"Cassava Sciences has started recruiting for AD clinical trials. Please assist them to enroll patients. I have reviewed their Phase 2 trial results, and the data is spectacular.  I am not aware of any medication date that has been as effective as Simufilm. I am optimistic about the potential (as an MD).  The medication is still undergoing testing, but based on the initial results the FDA has decided to expand testing.  Below are the results, more information, and the most importantly, locations of research sites that are enrolling patients.  Im not an employee of Cassava, but if you have questions on this thread, I'll be more than happy to try and answer them.

"Does anyone have an opinion/experience with a loved one who has Alzheimer's/dementia having surgery? Concerned about cognitive decline post op. Dad needs surgery on 2 hernias. Worried about the anesthesia, etc. It is to be done as an outpatient, and he will be under about an hour. Thanks!"

"My mother is 75 and has dementia.  She is literally sick nearly every day.  She had a heart transplant, kidney disease, osteoperosis, and several other health issues.  She can not manage anything anymore - meds, doctor calls, appts, etc.

I need to be with her at every doctors appt as she can not remember anything or even tell the doctor what is wrong if she is sick.

I feel like there is no solution.  Having a ""nurse"" come in during the day does not help."
"Hi there,

Is there some way to set a password / PIN for placing outgoing calls on a landline phone?  My brother compulsively calls strangers to ask them very personal and invasive questions.  I've been trying many different solutions to mitigate this behavior, but nothing has worked and now I just want to have the phone locked down.

(It is important that incoming and outgoing calls be totally unrestricted for those with the password.  That rules out services like ""TeleCalm"", which only allow filtering specific numbers.)

Thanks!"
"This will probably not be a very well structured rant but I don't have anyone else to ask for advice/anyone at all who supports or understands me regarding this matter.

Im 19 years old, my mom has been atruggling with Early Onset since I was 12. The progress was relatively slow but still drastic. Since my early teenage years I've been watching my energetic, social, charismatic and loving mom turn into someone who projected their whole anger about her illness on me. For a few years we would do nothing but fight.
I was already prone to depression and selfharm, this ony made my relationship to my parents worse. They were so busy worrying about my mom that they would completely forget about me. I was very lonely from around 13-16, with barely any friends and no emotional support whatsoever. My social skills improved with a lot of therapy (that I organised myself at 15) but that constant empty feeling and the inability to form close connections stayed.

I'm not feeling well as is. But the worst thing is, I feel so alone. Even though I have great friends now and a good therapist. They just don't understand. They can't help.

By now, my mom needs help with everything. From getting dressed in the morning, to putting lotion on her dry skin (which is gross and I hate it) to making every single meal for her to having to listen and accomodate to her constant nagging and little problems daily. Barely getting any sleep because she can't keep the rooms apart at night when she wanders and being woken up in the middle of the night by her just blasting into my room and starting to talk. My dad has it worse, he gets even less sleep because they have to share a bed. We don't have that much space.

I've asked my dad for over a year now for some help for my mom, just like a daycare or something like that and he just yelled at me for ""wanting to deport my own mother to some home"" and brushed it off. I graduated highschool this year so my head wasn't in a place where i could organise something like that for my mom, too. I'm just so exhausted all the time. And so is he. Lately my dad has been leaving me alone with her for days at a time like once a month. That worked out fine until a year ago but now i'd have to stay home 24/7 for her. She cries when I leave only for a few hours to meet my friends. Sometimes my dad starts to binge drink and is not able to care for her anymore. This always lasts a few days too but lately it has happened more often. I told him specifically how shitty his behavior makes me feel but he will just agree and then not change anyway.

He has been physically abusive in the past and frankly I don't like either of my parents. I would be a lot happier without them in my life, but they are both so dependent on me and I feel so sorry for them. My mom can't help being ill and my dad lost the love of his life, his wife of over 20 years. I understand the, but I hate them. And I don't know what to do anymore. I try to move out but I just can't afford it right now and I'm so scared of leaving them alone.

What if my dad starts to drink again, but this time, never stops because I'm not there to guiltrip him into stopping? My mom will be even sadder all the time because she won't understand that I'm a grown up now and I need to move out. They fucked my life over and I feel so bitter about the version of myself I would've become if Alzheimer had never affected my mom. Now, everyone in my home is just incredibely depressed and uncontent with their life. Family and former family friends all ditched us the second my mom's illness got serious..."

MIND diet is associated with better cognitive functioning independently of common brain pathology, suggesting that the MIND diet may contribute to cognitive resilience in the elderly."
"My dad was diagnosed about 3 years ago and is still in pretty good condition (has trouble conversing, can't follow multi-step directions, etc), and we're going on a family vacation next month.  We'll be staying at a beach house on vacation, and my sister and I are a little nervous about Dad having issues wandering around the house at night since it'll be a completely new place. 

My sister and I have each had experiences where Dad got lost in the middle of the night in our homes recently, and are wondering: does anyone have suggestions about ways to alert my mother if he leaves their bedroom at night?  Is there a sort of portable alarm system out there? Does anyone have any tricks they've used while traveling with an Alexander's patient? Thanks!"
"My dad is 73 and has rapidly declining later stage Alzheimer’s. He kept falling down a step or two at home, so we moved him into the memory care unit of a nearby nursing home 3 months ago. He started off ok, but is now refusing most food and liquid. This leads to him falling even more frequently, (3-5x a week) and he gets combative and aggressive with staff when they try to help. He just qualified for hospice today, but our issue is with him still being ambulatory, he’s a fall risk at all times. We don’t know what to do, as his risk of falling would happen anywhere, but we’re afraid he’s going to get kicked out of the facility. They said we can hire someone to watch him 24/7 and it’s an extra $700/day. 😑 Obviously this isn’t the first time this has ever happened to someone with ALZ, but we keep getting these emergency calls and not sure what else to do? Hospice is going to get him on seroquil, which i’m praying will help somewhat. Has anyone been through this before?"
"I have two older siblings and we haven't had the discussion yet of who wants to become power of attorney...  


Some questions i'd appreciate if anyone could answer:  


1. Is it possible that the position be shared? Would that be beneficial? What downsides would there be?  

2. What exactly is involved with being power of attorney?  

3. How easy is the whole process of getting started  etc?  


Thank you"
"My dad has been having memory issues and confusion for the last year or so, and he finally agreed to get it looked at. Turns out that he has early stage Alzheimer's. I'm still processing, obviously, but have worked in healthcare long enough to know that there are some things that should be handled early while he still has (most of) his faculties.

* He is in his mid-70s and lives with his wife (my mom) full time. Given his lifestyle habits and other comorbidities, I expect that his prognosis will be on the shorter end of normal.

* He is a practicing healthcare worker, but has been informed that his license will be revoked due to his condition. This is very distressing to him, since he found a lot of meaning in his work.

* My parents are middle class and both are still working, though they had planned to retire in the next year or two. They have a nest egg and were not particularly concerned about finances in their retirement life until now. Now, we don't know what to expect as far as medical needs, costs, etc. They own their primary home outright, and have a condo with a 15yr mortgage they bought a couple of years ago in preparation for downsizing. They have a financial planner who was helping them with retirement, but I don't know if she's familiar with costs associated with Alzheimer's.

* My mom has a much better health profile than my dad, and it's clear she was suffering from caregiver fatigue even before this diagnosis. How do we ensure that her needs continue to be met and that this disease doesn't negatively affect her wellbeing as well?

I guess my question is: What should we be thinking about right now, while he's still pretty aware and able to make important decisions? Are there any good resources that you recommend? Given how new this is, we still need to have a robust discussion on next steps as a family, but I would like to come to that discussion with a good sense of priorities and how to get through this."
In what ways did they act differently during early stages of Alzheimer’s? I’m wondering because I think my mom (63) might be in the early stages of Alzheimer’s but it’s hard to tell.

"Today we tried taking my grandmother into a nursing home that specializes into taking care for dementia patients, but she tried to run away. She was very aggressive and basically the home refused to take her in. We can't take her into another facility because the same thing will repeat again nor we can hire a nurse to look after her because of her behavior. She has been on antipsychotics, but they don't seem to calm her at all. I (25yo) have been her main care giver, but I can't emotionally handle this situation any longer. I am tired of having to chase her around the apartment building a few times a day, her trying to beat me or yell at me. My family also refuses to look after her. So this entire situation seems very hopeless. On the other hand I can't just leave her she is the person who raised me.
Has anyone been in the same situation? I now that I should probably take legal actions, but this will probably take months."
"I'm not the best at explaining things, so please bear with me.

My grandma was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and it's been hard on everyone. But most recently, she's been saying gibberish all the time. It is completely involuntary and uncontrollable. It goes something like this- ""babababbababa..."" There's also a lot of other noises and sounds involved, but mostly this. She goes on for hours at this and not to mention, it's extremely loud. I'm worried sick that her vocal cords might tear in the process. 

My mom and I are her primary caretakers now. We are trying our best to calm her down but it seldom works. Our doctor has prescribed sleeping pills, but we don't wanna give it to her everyday as it has too many side effects. My grandma is 80 and she can sleep on her own, most of the time. But, right now, it just went completely out of control. We tried to make her tell stories, whatever she remembers, and she tells it. But the moment the story is over, the gibberish starts. I don't think she is even aware that she is doing this. It breaks my heart to see my grandma like this. 

I would appreciate any advice on how we can deal with this. It's been weeks since my mom and I slept properly and it is just painfully exhausting for everyone.

I apologize for errors, English is not my first language."
"Hello all!
I posted a couple of months back about the doctor prescribing my dad alprozolam to calm him.
It made his insomnia,anger, wandering and delusions worse.
When we took him to the hospital they said that Xanax can be disinhibiting instead of the intended calming effect.For my dad, it was like somebody took the dial on all his symptoms and cranked it up.

I'm posting this for the purpose of information. It's not going to be everybody's experience, but I wish I had known this was a possibility when the doctor prescribed it for my dad.

Stay strong everyone. This disease sucks!"

"Hi all, first time posting so bear with me.

My 89yo gma is nearing the end, I think. She has been diagnosed with Alzheimers for several years, but her state has declined rapidly since the pandemic started, I think partially due to the elimination of her limited stimulation- church and bingo. 

My husband (25m) and I (29f) have been her primary caretakers for going on 3 years. In her normal life, my gma was always a friendly, cheerful person, typical grandma shit. I can't say we had the closest relationship, as she is pretty religious and I am not, but she was never a mean or malicious person. That has changed dramatically, and I'm at the end of my rope. 

My husband and I got married in dec2019, right before pandemic started. So during our still very new marriage, when we should be enjoying ourselves, the whole world went on lockdown and we were constantly caring for my gma. We have had to do the typical alzheimers things- she's completely incontinent, constant repeated conversations, locking the pantry/fridge so she wouldn't eat literally everything in the fridge (including jars of mayo or sticks of butter). She had been throwing some fits for about the last year and a half, but in the past month these fits have become violent. She has threatened me with a knife, swung a hammer at my husband, and today, broke my bedroom door by smashing her walker against the doorknob repeatedly, while I desperately tried to lead a meeting for my work from home job and couldn't get her to simmer down.

She spits on us, hits us, bites us, calls us horrible names, accuses us of stealing from her, lies constantly. I know it's the disease but my sympathy is rapidly running out. She doesn't quite qualify for hospice care yet, but I'm at a loss because my safety is at stake. I can't even reasonably defend myself, because if I push her off and she gets hurt, it's going to look really bad. 

The cops don't bother coming any more, they've been called several times due to her yelling and screaming at us. They know by now we're not abusing her, she's just completely off her rocker.

I feel very isolated here- my mom has been somewhat helpful but is also an extremely busy woman. Her siblings are almost no help- one never visits except for $ and the other lives really far away and can only come occasionally.  It is causing a lot of strain on my marriage, because when we first came here to help out this hecticness was not part of the agreement. I should also mention that we do not stay here for free and we are not freeloaders- in addition to giving her care, I pay rent and buy my own groceries, pay my own bills etc. I'm literally paying to be abused. I just want to go one day without being yelled at, called a bitch, etc.

I'm not sure what I'm looking for here. I guess i just wanted to vent. I'm wondering how close to the end we are- does anyone have any similar experiences? Thx for reading if you made it this far."
"My mom has been acting strange for a few years now. Having serious conversations and making life changing plans then saying we didn't. For instance when I was pregnant we had a big discussion about how she wanted me to move home to the farm and raise the kids and look after her. That wasn't my plan but we decided we would because she's on a small income and we could pay her bills. It would also save us rent money because she owns the home so it would help everyone.  That and not having to constantly drive back and forth to help her. I gave notice for my apartment and started to pack. Then she said she would never want me to move home and acted like I imagined it. Thankful my super gave me my notice papeback and said he'd forget I ever gave it to him. Another thing was she repeatedly told me I wasn't pregnant with twins because I wasn't fat. I was like a beached whale lol. I also had ultrasound photos. The babies are 5 months old now and she doesn't care about them at all. It's like they don't exist when she had previously wanted grandkids so badly.  She keeps referring to them as they boy and the girl. As if she doesn't know there names. I read online that dementia can cause lack of intrest in anything 
Do you think I need to put her in a care home? I can't drive constantly back and fourth I don't have time and she's not appreciative when I do come
Or do you think she doesn't like me or the babies?
I'm not sure"
"This past Friday we moved my grandfather to a memory care facility that specifically houses people with Alzheimers and dementia. He was becoming too much for my grandmother to handle on her own. He is still pretty sharp sometimes but he has started wondering off and leaving the house, which is what prompted the decision. 

Well apparently last night he left the facility without the staff even knowing he was gone! He eventually came back inside (thank god) asking where they had parked his truck. In my mind this is completely unacceptable. Another spot opened up at a facility that is closer/nicer but we are worried about moving him to a new place. We don't want to confuse him or upset him more than he already is, but we also want him to be safe. 

I don't have any experience. Is this a common occurrence? Are we overreacting by being outraged?"
"UK here. Our dad was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s about 10 years ago. He’s 71 now and is at the late stage where he can’t wash, dress, toilet or eat independently. He shuffles rather than walks, and will wander aimlessly if given the freedom to do so. His speech has deteriorated in the past year from a couple of words and whimpers to now only a word or two of assent with considerable prompting. He lost a huge amount of weight in the past year and was hospitalised last Christmas for just over a week. When he was released into our mum’s care, he spent days on a hospital bed downstairs, with her looking after him. We honestly didn’t think he was going to pull through, but he gradually did. He has a permanent urinary catheter and has recently started to wear Depends due to some fecal leakage.

Our mum is a nurse, 69 years old, and still works 2 or 3 night shifts a week. She pays local people to stay overnight with dad, but has refused any professional social support services. She lists a number of reasons for this - the cost, the inconvenience, that she doesn’t want strangers in the house - which change from day to day. Dad went into a care home for a few weeks last November whilst mum had an operation, and when he came out he had deteriorated so she is strongly averse to putting him in a home again. She says that it’s the cost, the concern, that she doesn’t know how she’d cope without him, and that she thinks if he was put in a home he’d be dead in 6 months. But she’s exhausted. She’s sleep deprived, angry, concerned, physically in pain, unable to make decisions, and trapped in a cycle of coping for a while, gradually sliding into a complete meltdown, getting a bit of a breather, and then repeat.

We called Social Services last year. She went ballistic. They reviewed things and eventually closed the case as ultimately he wasn’t in grave danger. He was fed and clothed and clean, and there are adults much more vulnerable than him. He remains on a care home waitlist but even if a place came up we don’t think mum would do it.

There are limits to what we (her kids) can do to help due to work, families, etc. We could possibly do more, we admit. But the worse dad gets, the more personal care he needs, and we can’t commit to that. 

Really, this is just a vent. There are no solutions unless mum gives in and gets professional social support. Or ends up dead or physically incapacitated herself (though honestly, we doubt even that would stop her). It’s a mess :("
"Is it different (and how) from regular alzheimers? Looking into internet resources I still don't get what to expect for a person with severe alzheimers at 63 years old.
Wondering if someone has useful/trusted resources to read on this matter?

* I am just trying to prepare myself."
"Has anyone left their career to take care of a parent with dementia ?    At what point do you move to assisted living?   My mother is 75 with dementia, heart + kidney issues.  

I have been taking care of my mother now for 5 years and she needs someone to remind her about pills, take to doctors appts, feed her, laundry, etc.    She has several medical issues that often require med changes or doctor visits nearly every week.  She know who I am but gets really confused about most things.  My other sibling has cancer and so I have 100% of care.

Assisted living with in memory care unit will likely cost $3-4k / month.   

Financially I can afford to take a few years off to take care of my mother, and wondering if I am crazy to pause my career to be with her over the next 1-2 years.   I would guess she will have to be in assisted living or nursing home in 3-4 years."

Hello, 

We are part of a research team at the Emory University School of Nursing. Eun-Ok Im, PhD, MPH, RN, CNS, FAAN, School of Nursing, Emory University, and her colleagues are conducting a study to explore racial/ethnic differences in the attitudes toward Alzheimer’s Disease among midlife women who are family caregivers of persons living with Alzheimer’s Disease.

Currently, we are in the process of recruiting participants to enroll in the study. Please note that this is online-based research and does not involve human contact, so participants are free of COVID-19 concerns. 

We are looking for midlife women aged 40 to 65 years old who can read and write English; who are online; whose self-reported racial/ethnic identity is Hispanic, non-Hispanic (N-H) White, N- H African American, or N-H Asian, and who are family caregivers of persons living with Alzheimer’s Disease. Participants will receive an electronic gift certificate of 20 dollars for filling out the Internet survey and an additional electronic gift certificate of 50 dollars for participating in the additional social media discussion.

"My partner of 25 years has Alzheimer's. I recognized the symptoms three years ago. She doesn't eat well enough. So I try to get her eat. Today, she asked for an specific item, a Southwest flatbread chicken pizza. The problem is that the deli that sells them had pared down their menu and her favorite is no longer on the menu.

But I had to try.

The girl, had years with the company, behind the counter knew the item, and put together an order with the individual ingredients and ""make a pizza"". My partner had her Southwest flatbread chicken pizza for.lunch. She ate her slice with joy. 

My caregiving plan is to keep her safe, healthy, and give her as many happy moments as possible, and this lunch touched all three."
"I hear her speaking to someone and nobody is there, she’s not on the phone. Her voice is strong and clear. She’s laying down with her eyes closed, very peacefully. I don’t know if she’s dreaming or hallucinating. Has anyone experienced this?"
"So Mom is stage 7.  I have her POA and am handling Dad's estate.  I have had 2 different financial institutions reject the POA.  It is so frustrating.  One told me I needed a new  one.  If she could handle her affairs well enough to make a new POA she wouldn't need a POA.  The other wants a guardianship.  It says on the first damn paragraph the POA is to avoid a guardianship.  Besides the guardianship system for seniors is riddled with fraud.

I am just trying to take care of my mom.  Why are these people making it so damn hard?"
"Bit of a weird question but when I think of how I would react (I'm a 24 year old guy with a hopefully normal brain) to forgetting someone who is saying they're my son/daughter or other close family member, it would freak me TF out. I'd be hurling questions around trying to understand who this person is and why I don't remember them.

But when I've seen my grandfather go through the same scenario with his children he seemed almost unbothered. He didn't start asking questions or trying to understand who the people in his house were he just sat there and asked his wife who the people were every now and then.

Do people who suffer from Alzheimers forget things so quickly that they don't have time to get scared or do they just loose the ability to think logically and rationally about situations?

I know it's abit of a hard question to answer but any answers are appreciated."
"I have an aunt who has dementia (I don't think she is aware but her family certainly is) so I looked around Reddit for a group to get some support and just feel a little less alone. So I looked at one of the groups here, which is titled ""Alzheimer's Group"" and the description says something like ""for people dealing with Alzheimer's to share fun new discoveries in their lives"". 

Upon looking into posts/comments, it became clear early on that it's just a bunch of 12 year olds posting dumb comics and poking fun at Alzheimer's/dementia. I made a comment explaining how frustrated it was and that my aunt probably won't remember my name somewhere down the line and how this is not funny and makes it harder for others to find legit support. They responded ""what you mean this is hilarious"". So I made one more comment, basically feeding the trolls a giant feast. It just makes me so mad. I even pointed them in the direction of a sub specifically for being silly and immature, and pointed out that I'm also subbed to it.

Is there a way to get this fake group taken down based on the sensitive and painful nature of the topic? Has anyone else dealt with similar in that group or others? Thanks."
"Looking for advice on how to be supportive to my dad while he navigates his mom being diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

In the beginning of this year, my grandmother was diagnosed and my dad is having an extremely difficult time navigating it. We were all together this weekend and when my grandparents left, my dad had a breakdown saying she's not the same and this person isn't his mom. You can imagine how heartbreaking this was to see and I just hugged him not knowing the right words to say. :( I could really use advice on how to be supportive to him as he goes through this, this was the first time he opened up to my brother and I about the toll it is taking on him emotionally.

My grandmother was always an extremely happy person, one of the greatest joys of my life. She now frequently gets angry and grumpy, and often times forgets about her diagnosis and will call my dad or aunt and ask about it. This is all truly gut-wrenching. I would greatly appreciate any advice you might have to offer"
"Hi,
My mother has moderate dementia. My father is taking good care of her, but every once in a while he just needs to get out of the house, which means my mother is alone for a few hours.

Lately, when I phone it's about a 50/50 chance that she will be able to answer the phone correctly and she often doesn't know how to hang up the phone either.

So... I'm wondering if there is a phone that would allow me to:

* call

* AND remotely answer for her.

* then allow me to hang up for her.

That's probably a tall order, but if anyone knows the answer, they're probably on this sub.

Thank you."
My grandmother has alzimers and she refuses to eat.  Not only that but she doesn't recognize me anymore so that doesn't help when trying to get her to eat.  Any ideas of what to do?
"It’s almost been a year since my mom was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s. She was diagnosed in September 2020 and was 53 at the time. Prior to all this, she was diagnosed with cancer in July of 2014 which then became terminal. I was 12 when she got cancer and was 18 when they diagnosed her with Alzheimer’s. We recently got an assistant (??) to help with her since my dad is the main provider for us and she would always bother him and could barely get any work done. It’s been extremely hard and frustrating because she’s just so difficult. I know it’s not her fault and she doesn’t mean it but we’re both combative at each other and I lose my patience very easily so we don’t have the best relationship. I feel like an awful daughter because I shouldn’t act like this but her personality isn’t the best either.

What makes it worse is she’s like a walking corpse. She’s physically here but not mentally and I can’t imagine how that feels. I feel like I don’t even have a mom anymore and seeing my friends moms talking and just doing normal things hurts so much. My mom can’t drive, make food, take a shower on her own, get dressed, read, understand people telling her to do things, or speak a normal sentence anymore. I’m just rambling at this point but I just feel so unbelievably lost"
"My nan has alzheimers, she’s the sweetest soul and last time I saw her she was perfectly standard - infact she hates that in her care home she’s the only mentally well (? - idk if thats the phrase) one there.

I saw her for the first time yesterday since COVID (so over a year), and her health has gone massively downhill.

She forgot my name, forgot my brother existed (he hasn’t seen her for nearly 3 years but I reminded her of it) and she kept saying how everyone thinks she’s guilty because she killed the head carer’s grandma but she know she’s not guilty but she’s being made to suffer (when she told me she was being made to suffer I had to pry it out of her and she still wouldn’t completely tell me- its definitely not the care home). She says the voices in her head laugh when she’s suffering and if she’s not suffering it upsets them. Her speech has also gone downhill (going from mumbling to mouthing words to talking normally)

She refused to go to the toilet because they want her to suffer. She even asked me to leave (which my nan would never do).

I told my Dad everything and he said he’s going to see how she is when he sees her in a couple of days. He said he’s going to get into contact with my uncle to let him know that the nana we once had is no longer there.

Honestly heartbroken, she’s 84 and I don’t want her to forget me, I don’t want her to go but we don’t know how long she has left"
Didn’t know how to handle a situation this morning. Mom has a yorkie we’ve been waiting weeks to get groomed. I had her looking a pictures because she didn’t like his last cut. She decided all the pictures were scams and they didn’t have dogs and a bunch of other things and refused to let me take the dog to get groomed. I didn’t handle it well. I had a headache and was feeling irritable. But I didn’t even know how to get around this
"Me and my wife live in a condo sharing a back wall with this kind little lady who we've always maintained a good relationship with. Over the last year, we've noticed a switch in her temper, she's become much more quick to anger, and her usual old lady forgetfulness was becoming more common and on more significant details. I got my first hint of something wrong when I noticed her dinner table covered in post-it notes and reminders.

Fast forward to yesterday and her grabbing me in the parking lot to show me her old wedding pictures, but confusing her wedding with her sister's. We invite her over for dinner, and she re-asks the same questions three times over the course of the meal, repeatedly expresses surprise that my wife has an accent (she's American), and when discussing the health care system differences between both countries, asks with genuine interest if the United States are a developed nation (don't worry, we held back the many jokes that came to mind at that moment). More importantly, she recounts an anecdote where she yelled at the pharmacist for writing on her pill bottles ""For Alzheimer's"", which made her incredibly angry, because she says she has a bit of a depression, not Alzheimer's, and she won't have anyone implying that her occasional memory lapses are Alzheimer's, she finds the idea insulting.

So, we're worried about her. We're not extremely close, we're just friendly neighbors, but we know that her family situation isn't the best. She's not on excellent terms with her only remaining daughter, which she accuses of only wanting her money; she has one sister she's still in touch with, and she accuses her of scheming with her father when they were kids to have her put in an orphanage. Don't know how much of these is true, she does show some signs of paranoia and seems to make up or mix up stories a lot. We want to make sure she has a proper support system in place and people to rely on when the Alzheimer's gets really bad, even though she's extremely hostile to the idea of a retirement home. We also obviously want to make sure she doesn't become a danger to herself, or others around her. We've been periodically bringing her food to store in her fridge and freezer because we know she only eats convenience store meals at the moment. But as her situation progresses, we don't know how much help she's going to need, and we're not even in a position to provide that help as we're going to be moving before long.

Would it be too nosy to contact her sister, or daughter, to see if they're aware of the situation and can take care of her? Especially considering that she certainly wouldn't want us to get in touch with either of them? It's a pretty delicate situation to be sure, and me and my wife are both unsure what to do, or whether we should even get involved, ethically speaking."
"I'm equal parts angry, scared, and sad all at once. He's only in his 50s, I'm only in my 20s, it all just feels entirely too soon. I don't know what to do.

Edit: I just wanted to thank everyone for your kind words of advice and nuggets of wisdom. I freaked out a little bit at first and now that I’ve had some time to read up on Alzheimer’s and talk to my parents I’m a little less frantic. It’s still a weight on my shoulders but you’ve all given me the realization that this is just another curveball in life, another cross to bear. We have tons of family photo albums and home videos that will keep him young in our minds and in his. And my parents recently retired and downsized houses so they have more time to spend together. It sucks knowing what will eventually happen, and my dad is still in a bit of denial, but we’ll confront it together. Thank you all. I imagine I’ll be here quite a bit in the future, so see y’all around."
"But I still had to clean it up and clean her up because she didn’t know what to do. And then I vomited and it was awful. Oh and there was a huge mess on the floor that needed to be cleaned in the bathroom on top of everything else. Plus the laundry I now am having to do. 

I have three different candles and two air purifiers running in my apartment. 

She is full time in disposable underwear for the past month because she started wetting herself and stopped wiping herself. As much as she wants to hate me for making her wear them, I know I’m right. And they still don’t save me from the fact now that she’s decided she doesn’t regularly have to use the toilet anymore. She peed her bed four times in the past week even with the disposable underwear. And every single time, it is at 7:00 am, which is exactly when I’m supposed to be online and clocking in for work. But no, I’m having to strip the bed, or mop the floor, get her into the shower and clean everything up. I’m so tired of it. 

And now we are really at my literal shitty nightmare and I can’t do anything about it other than pray it’s not a common occurrence, until I can finally get her in memory care. I’m working on it, but it is so overwhelming starting to search and the finances of it all is terrifying. She has a settlement she recently was awarded, and that is helpful, but it’s going to run out so fast. I guess my whole plan of putting it in a trust and thinking we could get enough assistance without having to spend it all first is not as attainable as I thought.

She had a UTI last week and started believing that I wasn’t her daughter, that she had a different one, and I was suddenly in her life like some sort of switched at birth conspiracy that was planned by her mom and her brothers she was going to “get them and sue them.” She’s a bit more back to normal now that she was being treated for it, but she still has brought it all up a couple of times like she was still questioning things. 

I hate everything. I just want her gone and I still hate that I would rather that over having her be here and being my mom. Mom has been gone for several months. She is truly just a shell now."
"My grandmother has Alzheimers. Her condition is worsening rapidly, but she refuses to take her medication also to go to her doctor's appointment. Can you give me some advice on how I can persuade her. Also I would like to thank you all . Having some sort of support from people who are going through the same thing has helped me immensely."
"This looks like an interesting webinar, so wanted to share it here:

Hi I am new to this subreddit my grandmother has been in the hospital for 4 days now with COVID-19 my family and I had expected some progression with Alzheimer’s but not like she is now. We got news from the doctors today that she has progressed in one week as much as she would have in 3 years she’s now being aggressive not eating using the bathroom or anything that she was doing before. My family is going to put her in an assisted living home because she’s going to need 24/7 assistance. I don’t know what to ask for as far as help or things that we can do to make my grandmas time better. Is there anyone with resources or help groups just anyone to talk about this would be greatly. Thank You in advance.
"My dad loves Activia yoghurts. He eats one/multiples day.
My mum bought some double cream to have with desserts. She came home from work the next day to find my dad had eaten the whole tub of double cream, he'd thought it was yoghurt."
"My grandfather has pretty progressed Alzheimer’s, going on his third year. He lives in a memory care unit and we visit him multiple times a week. He’s been an engineer all his life so he keeps trying to take things apart, I.e. pens, his hearing aids, the remote control. The occupational therapist has suggested giving him things we don’t need anymore to take apart or things for him to build. Does anyone have any suggestions for things like this? We can’t give him real tools because we don’t want him to get hurt, but also we think he will start taking everything apart around him. Just something interesting to keep his hands busy. Any suggestions would be appreciated!"
"My FIL has Alzheimer's and MIL is primary care giver on paper but has my wife do everything.   MIL decided she wants us to rearrange the living room.  It is the only room FIL spends time in.  

I think making a big change could confuse him more.  She also wants more chairs which will add trip hazards.

Any suggestions?
Thanks"
"This disease sucks. Just heard from my dad that my mom isn't recognizing some of her friends anymore, and can't properly put together the right clothes for an event or outing. And he's really struggling with full-time caregiving. 

Those of you who don't live near your LO, how do you help out? I'm trying to rearrange schedules to spend a week there every 4-6 weeks or so (thank goodness for flexible and remote work), but would really like to do more from where I am."
"It has been demonstrated that anesthesia increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's dementia.  (See e.g.   [Risk of dementia after anaesthsia and surgery](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3939441/).)  For patients with existing Alzheimer's disease, if surgery is required, what is the risk of acceleration of mental decline, and are some types of anesthesia worse than others?"
"Hey, my(f20) friend’s (f21) mother (f57)is very sick with Alzheimers. She is pretty alone going through all this😔What can I do to support? What is the wrong and right things to say and comfort with?"
"I have a family member who shows signs of dementia or Alzheimer's. Unfortunately this person aggressively refuses to get diagnosed - we've managed to get them to a doctor once and as soon as they realized why they were there they simply walked out of the clinic. 

Are there any strategies or ideas on how to deal with this? Most of the things I see online are centered around either getting them to a doctor or handling the aftermath of a diagnosis. Neither of these are the problem - they just walk out if the conversation turns to memory issues."
"I've suspected for a while but today we got the confirmation that my mom is solidly in stage 5. She was diagnosed with Alzheimer's last spring in 2020 (previously it was thought to be some form of dementia but unspecific at that point).

In any case, she's been really good at hiding how bad things have gotten. I see her twice a week. She didn't recognize my sister last weekend (specifically the 22nd). It was awesome that I had to be the one to tell her (/s). I thought it might have been some form of hallucination. I thought she just didn't recognize her because of this. It turns out, I was correct. She called my sister today and said there was a weird man named (dad's name) in our house and she couldn't find our father, (dad's name). In retrospect, I'm incredibly glad I warned my sister about not recognizing her because she was so thankful this call didn't take her completely off guard. Unprompted, my Dad told us that she wanted to pay him for watching the house and wanted to know where the man who lived there was. My dad says he could only describe it as a hallucination. I suppose I should have warned him this was coming, I thought I had more time. I have a psych degree (undergrad only) and specialized in memory disorders because my paternal grandmother had passed from complications with Alzheimer's.

I'm a bit rambly. Tonight has been hard and I hit the wine a little too much.

I'm not ready for this. I want my Mom back. I'm only 32. I have a 3 year old and a 1 year old and I wanted them to know their grandparents like I never knew mine. How is this fair? I miss her so much."
"Yesterday I asked DH where his walker was.  He said with assurance, ""It's downstairs.""  

Me:  ""We don't have a downstairs.  There is no basement, we just have a concrete slab and the apartment is all one level.""

DH:  ""We DO have a downstairs.""

Me:  ""Where is it?""""

We went back and forth a few more times and all the way to bedtime, and beyond, he went in search of the door to ""downstairs.""  He swore up and down we have a basement ""because I've been in it!""  He was a bit haggard by the end, having tried the door to the pantry, the garage, the laundry room, the utilities closet IN the laundry room, my walk-in closet, both bathrooms, and even looking carefully at the windows.  He insisted, ""there IS a downstairs and I know how to find it, there's a way to get into it without even going outside.""

I suggested it might be better to look for it in the morning and I finally got him into bed.  We laugh a lot at his Alzheimer's (as well as everything else) but I'm kind of afraid to remind him of this incident, not that he would get mad at me but he might spend the next day and a half searching for a basement that doesn't exist.

Just thought this might give someone a smile.  Have a great day, caregivers!"
"Sorry, confusing title, I know.

My mum has diagnosed alzheimers. My dad has had an assessment, but we haven't heard the outcome yet - but there's some kind of cognitive decline going on.  

My parents are still living independently, and they are getting on each other's nerves something shocking.  One (or possibly both) keep moving things around the house, and the other can't find said item.  This could be pills, wallets, books etc etc.  These items are often found in the most obscure places.

Anyway, my issue today is: both parents are insisting the other is verbally abusing them; deliberately hiding things; threatening the other with 'being taken away' etc.  I don't know who is actually telling the truth (or the truth as they believe it) and I just don't know what to say to either of them.  They can both sound coherent and make sense (sometimes!), and neither of them seems to remember that the other one is unwell and that they need to be more patient with the other.  Mum (for instance) says she knows she 'forgets a few things' but seems to have no understanding of just how much she forgets, and if we try to explain it to her, she gets upset and defensive.  

Dad is just off in his own little world, ignores mum most of the time and never wears his hearing aids (presumably so he doesn't have to listen to mum repeat the same story/question over and over again).  He will make a statement, apropos of absolutely nothing, and 5 mins later deny saying it.  When we try to explain this is what's happening, he refuses to believe it.

In short, they are both forgetting that they are forgetting stuff and blaming each other for anything and everything!

Does anyone have any tips or hints about how to deal with this?  We're at our wit's end trying to negotiate this stage of their lives, and it's incredibly stressful that after almost 60 years together, they don't even seem to like each other any more.

Any help or suggestions would be gratefully received.  FWIW, I'm in Australia."
"Hi friends. I hope to gain some help in ways to deal with my situation so any advice is much appreciated as I don’t have anyone to speak to about this. 

This year my grandma has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s which was a big and sudden blow to our family. She is the closest person to me in our family so you can imagine it was devastating to hear. 

My mother took her in to live with her to watch over her and make sure she’s okay. She watches over her, cooks for her, makes sure she takes her medicines and she is trying very very hard.

My mother is one of the kindest and selfless people I know, she does everything for us. However, she is a very explosive person who often screams and loses patience easily without even realizing how she is speaking. This was a hard adjustment (and still is) for her to accept that her mom is not the same full thinking adult that she used to be and to be aware of the diagnosis. She often gets into arguments with grandma over small things, even though these fights are absolutely pointless as grandma just gets the stress but will forget everything the next day. Not to mention they could be easily avoided. After these fights she feels bad but the damage is done already. I fear that grandmas condition worsens as a result of these stressful situations. Whenever I try to say anything to mom about this or how she speaks to grandma during these periods she gets defensive and screams at me, which also results in nothing being resolved and her not hearing me. 

I understand my mom and her frustration. All of her children live abroad, her partner is also living in another country and due to Covid they cannot even see each other, so she is alone in this and on top of that Alzheimer’s is very frustrating to deal with, especially considering fact that it’s happening to her mom and she obviously feels scared and sad about that. She is doing her best and I know that she is just tired, and grandmas comments such as “I am a burden to you all” just blow her fuse off at the end of the day when all she does is for her family and she barely ever does anything for herself.

I feel sad and hopeless and I worry for both of their states. I don’t know how to approach this.

I wonder does anyone else have a similar situation and how do I deal with it?"
"Hello everyone,

I'm a young person who has a grandmother than we believe is hit with dementia but her case is rather unique. She had a heart attack a few years ago and we discovered with recent medical checks that most of her brain cells have died ever since however she didn't lose most of her abilities right away, it was progressive and it was something we didn't notice at first.

The most signs we had noticed was when my grandfather passed away in 2018, that's when she came to live with us and we believe that his death was rather dramatic since her state has worsened ever since. At first the issues weren't that big, she could still hold conversations and remember things, she could observe people and give judgement about them, etc. She would sometimes become anxious when being alone and would have troubles sleeping at times but that's it.

2019 things became more difficult, her sleepings difficulties have increased, her memories have declined, we were expecting it so it didn't shock us much at the time, she could still stay by herself when my parents went to work and I would help her when I came from school by preparing us lunch.

2020 that's when the troubles became, she had become too unstable, she couldn't sleep at night and whenever we left her alone in a room because we had things to do or needed to discuss in private she'd wander around until finding us and staying by our side, she couldn't stay alone in a literal way and even if she would be with people she would start wandering from times to times. She could still use her bathroom alone and wash her hands.

2021 my father doesn't live with us anymore and has moved elsewhere because she was too unstable for the family and we couldn't sleep nor focus on our school activites or work, he's currently taking care of her and I visit her during vacations. I saw her this summer, she has become a lot worse, she barely can say more than a few words and 95% of what she says is nosense or unrelated to any events, she can barely count to 5 (she counts our fingers), she can't tell what time it is anymore nor does she remember how old is she. (She still remembers her name)

She forgot my mother's name (despite having lived with her for more than 20 years), she confuses my father's name with mine and calls most people by the same name, sometimes she pronounces random names of people we aren't really familiar with (perhaps from her youth ?)

Another major issue is that she wanders a lot and has become quite agressive whenever we try to call her inside or want to make her sit for a bit (because she hurts herself while wandering), even if it's dark outside she will open the door and leave (my father has to lock the door and remove the key from there and even then she tries to snatch the door away, gives up, wanders around then repeats) 

My father has been on low sleeping cycles for almost a year now, my grandmother sleeps only a few hours and then never ends wandering, she sometimes sits at the balcony but conversation with her is rather impossible and we even have to force her eat sometimes because she stops after every spoon she takes.

Can someone tell me what stage is this ? From what I read it does sound like stage 6 of dementia but I'm not quite sure. Since she had a heart attack her progression has been rather fast compared to how dementia evolves (according to the articles I've read) and it might be due to her cerebral damage. 

For how long can we expect for her to be by our side at this point ?"
"My mother is petrified when she goes to the dentist.  It seems like she now had issues with her teeth (cavities, crowns, etc) nearly every month.   

She is so scared when I say we are going to dentist and we have tried some pills like xanax to relax her.

Any tips or is this common for those with dementia ?"
"Mom is stage 6E on the FAST scale.  She is approaching Stage 7.

The doctors won't give me any ballpark ideas for life expectancy.  I am trying to make sure she doesn't outlive her money.  Internet research says 1-3 years at that stage.  She sleeps most of the time.

Anybody have any experience you can share?"
"My dad is still in the early stages. But getting worse fast. Easily confused whenever he's in an unfamiliar place. Which pretty much means whenever he leaves the house now. But also won't admit how bad he is, so he keeps insisting on going out. Sometimes takes the car keys and goes before any of us realize he's gone. 

Said he just went to the corner store for coffee. He was gone almost 3hrs. Can't even account for where he was, doesn't realize he was gone for so long. 

He won't wear a bracelet or necklace. Keeps loosing his phone or forgets to charge it, so a simple phone tracker app won't help. What else is there? Shame we can get him chipped like a pet lol."

Tl;dr

Dad has alz stage 5

Lives with caretakers

Falls in love with longtime friend during pandemic

Changes personality and becomes hostile to fam

Friend moves into house n removes safety measures

They now intend to marry despite his clear decline and impending end

Fam in disarray

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My 77 year old dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in October 2019 and is now in stage 5. He lives with caretakers in his home, a condo in a senior living complex. 

He has developed sleepwalking symptoms and was found outside with no pants at one point, requiring his other son who lives closer to put alarms on the door and for Dad to wear a gps watch. The HOA  people have warned him that the next time he is found outside like that they will revoke his lease! 

During the pandemic he rekindled an old relationship and before you know it he had a girlfriend. Good for him - the old boy has plenty of lead in his pencil as his doctor buddy is prescribing him cialis (it helps alzheimers symptoms?) which powers up his hypersexuality, leading him to spend astounding amounts of $$ on porn. 

After about a year of dating he asks her to move in and he agrees. And this is where the trouble starts.  I know he is free to pursue love and happiness right down to his last day on earth. However, this man has been diagnosed with a progressive and terminal neurological disease and he needs care.

His girlfriend, a 70year old widow we will call N. has so far removed family photos from the wall, saying they bothered her. She removed the alarms on the door placed there to keep Dad from wandering off.  She forces his caretakers to care for her and her dog, causing constant conflicts with these wonderful and competent people. 

She takes him to her place and he stays long enough to miss med doses which isnt good for him. She acts like he is is a normal healthy 77 year old dude and will not dispense meds to him or act lIke a caretaker AT ALL. When questioned by my brother, she says she has no intention of wiping his ass. 

She is insisting on remodeling his apartment and moving his bed upstairs even though we moved it downstairs for his safety. The caretakers are there 24 hours - he plans to cut it to 12 as N will be there. She was with him but asleep when he sleptwalked a few times last month and peed in a sink. 

Dad and N went to his lawyers to draw up an agreement so she can legally move in within the next few weeks.

During the meeting he said they had been together for a year and after another year they would get married. Under normal circumstances, mazel tov! 

But these aren't normal circumstances. First off, he lied to her right off the bat, saying he had only mild memory impairment (MCI) even after he was diagnosed and voluntarily gave up his drivers license which is a huge deal here. Second,  he went to all the trouble of setting up a trust for his kids and grandkid and getting everything legally squared away. But his personality changed within that year and now I guess he has different priorities now?

As for protecting him with legal measures - the state of California is totes cool with alz patients signing on the dotted line as long as they can show they are competent by responding to questions from the notary public or other official.  

My Dad is very charming and could convince any one he is competent to get married. That prevents us from getting conservatorship and getting a restraining order against her. They are in love and love trumps all. Even a fam trying to deal with the long slow death of our Dad. 

There is nothing I can do as N. has totally brainwashed him to the point where he will get angry if you question him. We were supposed to be looking for a nursing home for him when he hits stage 6 - we are all aware of what is coming next for him. The only person that does not seem to know or care is N. I just want my Dad back."
"The wife's memory has been failing over 2-3 years. MRI and Cat Scans showed up nothing.

After insisting, GP gave us a referral to a psychiatrist specialising in dementia.

Initial consultation led to strong belief on Alzheimer's. Sent us for further tests, both nuclear medicine tests, SPECT and PET.

These tests showed up the temporal lobes plus the rear and top of the brain having diminished activity. In addition to memory, gait and balance would be impacted as well.

Gait, I have noticed already. This failing had led to a fall and a fractured shoulder. After 3 surgeries, all is healing. But 3 lots of general anaesthetic has not helped either.

On Aricept at the moment. Just working out correct dosage now.

Moral of the story, MRI and CAT scans do not always show up the dementia.

BTW, as Australians, none of the diagnostic tests cost us anything. All paid for by the Government.

BTW, wife is 71, I'm a bonny 59."
"I'm fairly new to reddit posts so I do not know how to exactly format this, but I still wanted to make a post. About two or three years ago my mom was first diagnosed with frontal variant Alzheimer's disease (fvad). Even before this diagnosis I had noticed that my mother would have irrational and spontaneous moments where she would lash out in anger. Whether it be coming home from work, taking me to church, or even just eating dinner. It's an odd thing to deal with this kind of stuff especially since I am only 19, and was first dealing with the situation at a younger age. The main issue currently is that my mother seems to be progressing further at an alarming rate. Recently I had heard that this could be directly related to having covid. A few weeks ago she was tested positive and since then things have been spiraling out of control. Currently my mother is trying to file for a divorce from my father and it is putting an overwhelming amount of pressure on me in the process. She even tries to play a child-like game of winning me in her favor. From an outside perspective I find no reason for the divorce to be even in process since someone with alzheimers shouldn't even be living by themselves. My mother has severe short term memory loss and it concerns me that if she somehow won the legal battle, she would be living alone. For example of such memory loss, my mother will repeatedly ask me questions concerning some of the simplest stuff like classes or even if she fed the dog. While I am at college I constantly get text messages and phone calls from both my parents and it stresses me out.

&#x200B;

Another difficult thing about this situation is that it seems like me and my father are almost crazy because we are the only family members who can actually recognize the change my mother has went through. Some of the family members on my mothers side even act like total assholes to my father and get up in his face. The legal difficulty about this is that my dad cannot just force them out of the house because my mother also owns it, thus she can legally invite whoever she wants over. On top of this, my mothers family members also have her help watch over some of their kids, and have her almost doing a 'task' for the benefit of themselves. It seems like total hypocrisy. Both me and my father fear that they may try to use her so that they may gain access to some of her assets. Something of which I find no reason for. With the progressing rate of alzheimers, we also worry that my mother may one day get lost. This happened to my best friends mother, and she was unfortunately killed while walking along the highway. On top of this, my best friends family was sued and lost a lot of money to the drunk driver who killed his mother. It's sometimes stupid how the legal system works.... The main point of my post though is to gain some outside information on how I might be able to deal with this situation in a more effective manner. Has anyone else had some similar situations happen to themselves? 

&#x200B;

 If I could get any answers in relation to advice on the situation, it would be much appreciated. Much thanks to those of you who read my full post!"
So like the title says I woke up to a phone call from my parents and my.mom informing me she had been diagnosed with dementia. I don't even know how to process. She has been my biggest supporter in my.life and secretly the biggest deterrent when I was at my lowest to not take my own life. I have no idea what to do. I'm terrifies of losing the connection we have.
"We had to take the cars away from my MIL (patient) because she's been determined to be unfit for driving. My FIL wants his car back, but it can't be returned until he has a plan for keeping the key safe from MIL. We were thinking about getting a finger print controlled lock box for the car key. Do any you have experience with something like this and have any advice? Thank you!"
"My wife quit her job to help take care of her Mom who has been formally diagnosed with dementia. 

My wife and I are struggling, the stress is too much and it's made worse by the fact that her mother was HORRIBLE to her entire family for years with verbal abuse and hoarding. 

I'm trying to remain positive. I'm normally an over compassionate empath, but now I feel heartless."
"My mom, 56, got her official diagnosis, early onset (obvi) early to mid stage alzheimers, earlier this year. I first noticed symptoms 6 years ago, but it wasn't until last autumn when she got into her car and drove 2 states away, didn't know where she was or how to get home, that my dad finally agreed to have her evaluated. 
Since then it seems like she is progressing rapidly, the medication is helping with agitation, but thats it. 
They rent a beach house every year with an open invitation to us, which was last week. During the 1.5 days i was up there, I noticed she's started confusing my oldest brother for our other brother and my dad. She also wasn't sure of my name. I asked my dad if he was having someone come to house yet, he works full time outside of the home, to which he said no and brushed off. Then he's talking about next year hes going to rent a week at the same house for just the two of them then a bigger house for another week for us kids and our children to visit... im thinking like dad who knows if she's going to be able to make the trip next year."
"My grandpa is visiting this weekend with my uncle and cousins. He’s doing pretty well! I was afraid that the weekend was going to feel a little sad, but he seems almost like his old self. We had an addition put on our house about seven years ago, but he doesn’t remember being here since then. Other than that, we haven’t really noticed much. 

He’s spending the night at my house tonight instead of staying at my house tonight instead of staying at the hotel with my uncle. He’s telling us a lot of funny family stories, and things he remembers from when my mom was a kid."
"My mother is her mom's primary caretaker and recently my grandma has gotten really bad. We don't know for sure if it's actual Alzheimer's or dementia, but she has regular mood swings to the point where she will be speaking (nonsense) in a normal mood and then immediately switch into the most hurtful and mean things we've ever heard. She tries to start fights with members of the house, she hoards loose chips under her pillows, and frequently leaves the house unaccompanied. She was getting in the car at one point but my mom and dad now hide the keys. Now she can't do that, she goes into the woods behind their house or will cross the street to the neighbors houses. Yesterday they found her underneath someone's porch.

My mom isn't sure what to do or how to get help. They've tried talking to doctors, and my mom is her power of attorney, but apparently the Doctor doesn't think she's a danger to herself. Just trying to help my mom get some relief or assistance, they can't afford to pay to house her at a facility that's equipped to help people like this."
"My grandmother  was diagnosed with early stages of Alsheimers last year, but her condition is getting worse by the day. For instance today she decided that she was to be wed to a stranger who has called her on the phone. I tried explaining to her that that isn't true and there is no one, but she got very aggressive - she tried jumping off the balcony, bit me  etc. The emergency hotline said they couldn't do anything. I have never felt more unprepared in my life. I'm incapable of taking care of her, but also I don't want to send her to a nursing home. She is the one who raised me and it feels like I am abandoning her, but I can't give her the proper care she needs. Can someone give me advice? She won't tolerate an assistant and I doubt getting her to a nursing home will be any easier. Thank you in advance."
"My grandfather moved the both of them to our city because he couldn’t take care of her by himself anymore. My grandmother had a hard childhood with a slew of mental health problems that went untreated for most of her life. She lost both of her parents by the age of 10 and grew up in a time when mental health was highly stigmatized. So, she never got help and became someone who lived very unhappily (depression, OCD, bipolar disorder) but still loved her grandchildren despite her inability to live with a clear, happy mind. I knew her this way as a child and into my teenage years. She was a workaholic who went to workout classes almost every day after work. She stayed up late doing dishes every night and spoke ill of the people who hurt her in the past, sometimes saying things to us we didn’t need to hear as children. I understand now that she wasn’t well. 

Years later, she doesn’t remember my name but she cries when she sees me and comments on how beautiful I am. She always preferred the granddaughters of the family, but I will admit it feels odd to receive such a warm and genuine hug from her after all these years, before which her tormented mind didn’t really know how to be in the present moment and enjoy time with her family. She used to be so fiercely independent, refusing to let anyone do the dishes after dinner, and now I am afraid to let her touch a dish lest it should fall and hurt her. 

Alzheimer’s is a harrowing disease. But I look at my grandmother, and I know she loves me, despite the memory loss. I think of the kindness in her eyes, despite the hardship she’s faced. This is all so strange to process. She is not like yesterday. And from here on out she won’t be."
"Hello, 

My mother in law is in a memory care facility. My father in law is there 5-6 hours a day, 7 days a week, helping her. She also has serious gastro issues in addition to advanced Alzheimers. 

My FIL's neighbor just asked my husband if he could take over a day a week to give his dad a break. His mental health is low, low low. 

We visit every weekend and leave when she gets too tired. We can adjust to visiting for longer periods and helping more if needed.  This will include a lot of bathroom stuff, which my husband is dreading (but will do if needed, of course).  

With her gastro issues she's in constant pain and paired with her Alzheimers and OCD, is absolutely obsessed with bathroom stuff. For example, she is scared of going to the bathroom for nonsensical reasons. Last time I was there I was helping her in the bathroom and she was convinced a man down the hall would kill her if he found out she was going to the bathroom. 

Also, My FIL makes her eat and drink. She wouldn't otherwise. He calls doctors, makes appointments, advocated for her, etc.

I am just wondering if it's normal for a husband to have to do so much care in a memory care facility. I thought this is why she was there, to get more help for actually taking care of herself. Or is this a special scenario? Last time we beat FIL there and she just kept asking for him constantly. I think she was embarrassed. Why aren't the nurses at the facility helping her? Is it just too constant? 

We really had hoped that FIL would get to be a visitor. But he's Definitely still her primary caretaker. 

She is moving to a brand new, super nice facility in October. I am hoping it will help her, but we are worried she will be too far gone to even enjoy it. I just want to know what to expect in this nicer facility. Should I call them? This is so hard."

TW// s**cide - not mine though

I should start out by saying: my mom and I have a relationship like a broken piggy bank taped together. My childhood was not a happy one. I forgive her trespasses in exchange for having a mother. She’s been abusive but less so than my other parent. 

I feel like it’s just all so much right now. My first day as a senior in college is tomorrow, technically today, and I want to be asleep, but I am up tonight thinking about my mom’s eulogy.

I am 22 and my mom was recently diagnosed with mid-stage Alzheimer’s. She’s also in renal failure. She doesn’t actively treat either. She goes to doctors appointments to track her progression, takes vitamins, and takes medication for her blood pressure/blood sugar (she’s diabetic) but that’s it. 

It’s been an absolutely fucking emotionally wrecked summer. She had a suicide attempt earlier this summer when she found out she was in renal failure. She watched her brother die from diabetes and was a nurse for decades, so she was horrified of going through dialysis. She had been abusing pills for years anyhow. When she attempted suicide, myself and my siblings didn’t even know about her kidney problems. She was on death’s door. My dad found her catatonic in the bed. She was in the ICU for days. Then we find out about the kidneys. And a week ago, it’s dementia. 

Plus, while I’m taking care of her over this span it’s punch after punch. She’s not drinking water consistently because she doesn’t like the taste and gets a UTI- then a kidney infection. She vomits. I feel awful for her. 

I am trying to speak with a therapist at school. I am taking 18 hours and working technically two jobs. Plus I (at least part time) take care of her on weekends. There are other times where I am her primary caregiver. 

I wish I could be a kid. My siblings are both a decade older than me. I am so so deeply frustrated with my life right now. 

I know all I can do is accept- but this is such a shitty plate to eat. I know life isn’t fair. I get it. I get it. I get it. It doesn’t make it any better. 

I want to know that my mom will make it to my graduation. I want to know that my mom will know who I am when I graduate."
"I (23 f) am emotionally exhausted from being in the company of great granny (87 f) because she seems to lack the capacity to understand I can't gain the weight she expects.

For context, I'm from a mostly Puerto Rican family, we are blended with Dominicans as well. It's probably not even relevant what our race is, However there's this stereotypical standard of the latina body being curvy, thick, round, stacked or even just basically chunky and fat is expected and acceptable. This applies to my sisters, half sisters, my female cousin's, nieces, the daughters of my cousin's. Older and same age aunt's.  You get the point.

I am a string bean, petite and flat chested.  I just wasn't privy to having the same genetics. But it's fine. It's never been an issue for me or my family. Atleast until there was a change in my great grandma a little before I had turned 19. She confused me as one of my 12 year old nieces. The family would actively correct her though over time she would be bewildered seeing me in this ""condition"" when I visited. 

She accused family of not feeding me, worried if I wasn't eating enough. We thought it would remedy the situation if I visited my aunt and grandma more often to eat as they are her caretakers and grandma was a better cook anyway. I was happy to at first but it got tense why great gran wanted me to have a second plate of rice and beans or more potato or the extra fatty porkchop or another piece of plantain lasagna. I ate in abundance but I wasn't gaining weight because of course that's not how my metabolism works. This couldn't just continue, especially because my mom and half sister miss eating with me at our apartment complex. And sometimes the bus rides weren't worth the 15 minute commute.

I cut my dinner visits for a few days just to get phone calls from aunty explaining that great gran was actively looking for me to offer me food or desserts. I could hear her in the background calling for me, accusing grandma of not inviting me, sadly lamenting my absence when they put her on the phone with me. It breaks my heart.

We tried other options like switching things up and inviting other cousin's and adult grandkids so great grand could have plenty of company and liesurely get togethers with family. It worked for some time. But then it gets uncomfortable if she saw a ""flaca"" like myself among the visits and she'd go right back to demanding they are eating more or requesting to be on the phone with me because I have to make sure I come over right away so I can eat. I don't know what to do and I'm so worried if she's suffering with concern over something that can't even be helped."
"About two weeks ago, my grandma (74) was diagnosed with colon cancer. Now the entire family has their input on what my mom and I, her caregivers, should do. They never talked to us before as she struggles with Alzheimer's.

It may seem really morbid but last wishes and death has always been a talking point in our family since I was a kid. So much so it comes up atleast once a week. Thankfully, because we talk about it so much I know what my grandma's wishes are when it comes to treatment. She has told me many times she doesn't want a colostomy bag, chemo, or anything that will keep her on machines for the rest of her life. 

I have already accepted her eventual death. We didn't think she'd live past 2017. It's been 4 years since then and we've tried to make the best of them we could. It still hurts to know this is probably the end but I'm ready for it. My mom is still getting there but not far behind me in accepting what will come. My other family wants us to do everything we can to keep her alive. They're blaming us for not doing more to help her. They've been distant for many years and offering no help whatsoever with her Alzheimer's and other medical problems.

I'm not sure how to end this but my mom and grandma go to the surgeon today to discuss options. I'll update if there is any major changes."
My mom moved to assisted living 4 months ago because she woke up one day and no longer recognized her house as hers. (She was diagnosed in January 2021) She was convinced the people who lived there would come home and find her and call the police. At that time we decided to move her to assisted living. She still recognizes her family and most of her friends and can do self care for the most part so she’s not in memory care yet. Unfortunately for the last 2 days she has been very distressed because she does not recognize where she is again. I try to calm her and tell her to look around and see her furniture and pictures in the apartment. I tell her she is safe and loved. I have signs I made for her answering her most frequent questions posted in her apartment but that does not seem to be working anymore. Any suggestions to help her be calmer and feel safe?
I wouldn't usually post or reach out like this but I am not sure what to do in this case okay so about 2 years ago I started dating my girlfriend and moved into her mums house after a year and been here since so about 6 months ago her mum has been diagnosed with alzeimers at only 58 years old and me and my girlfriend are only 20 and we are having to pretty much take care of her and take her to appointments make her dinner and its affecting me being able to work fulltime because I come home to relax and the mother is just standing behind my qnd talking bon stop while I am trying to make my dinner and relax it is non stop issues and I feel like me and Mr girlfriend can't just get on with our life because we have been left to deal with this all on our own
"Age 80, a Navy vet whose service ended in 1964.  With this mess in Afghanistan, he came to me in a serious tone of voice telling me he wants to go help with the evacuation of Americans and friendly Afghans.  He said he would be able to help getting people out of the country, he just might need to update his security codes.  I told him I didn't think the government would take him, at 80 and with Alzheimers.  He said he would be willing to take drugs to treat the dementia.  I pointed out that he's already on drugs for Alzheimers (memantine and donepezil).

Poor fellow."
"My only living grandparent is my grandmother, she is 94-year-old, she experiences some dementia, and she was hospitalized last winter due to pneumonia.

The staff at the hospital left her unattended for too long at one point, and she ended up falling and experiencing a concussion. 

As a result, she experienced a blood clot in her brain, which was thankfully addressed via surgery.

However, due to the surgery and other variables, she has lost some of her ability to walk, and her legs are not as strong as before.

She now completely depends on some of my aunts and other family members, and they have been overwhelmed by the process of caring for her.

They may be in the process of hiring someone to help them from time to time, but I am not sure when that will come to fruition.

With that said, please recommend any forms of technology that my family can invest in, that will make the process of caring for my grandmother easier on my family.

Your help is greatly appreciated."
"My grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in January. Her doctor graded it as moderate to severe. She and my mother had a financial POA contract drawn up and signed it. I am the backup on the POA contract in case my mother doesn’t fulfill her role as POA.

Meanwhile, my uncle has been desperately trying to take advantage of my grandmother. He and his wife don’t work and live off of government assistance and handouts from local churches. They have had many issues with CPS over the years. As soon as my grandmother was diagnosed, he started getting her to give him money, buy him things, etc. He convinced her to give him some family heirlooms also, including some WW2 guns that belonged to my great grandfather. Then he got her to agree to let him have some of her land, worth about $40,000 and co-sign for him to buy a trailer for it. Luckily, my mom let him know that he can’t do that without her signing off on it. He and my grandmother are both angry that my mom is preventing this. 

My mom and I have noticed that my grandmother has been sort of distant from us the past couple of weeks. Then today she told us that my uncle took her to see a different attorney and she going to make my uncle her POA. My mom asked her if she told the attorney about her diagnosis. My grandmother argued that she doesn’t even have Alzheimer’s and that we are lying to her. 

I think my uncle has convinced her that nothing is even wrong with her. I think that he is telling her what she wishes was true so that she will be more helpful to him. 

Mom and I don’t want her money or land either, because we assume it will all be needed to pay for her care. She’s only 72, so young to suffer from Alzheimer’s. We probably have a long road ahead. But if she truly doesn’t want one of us to be her POA that’s okay, it’s her life, we just don’t think my irresponsible uncle should do it. 

Do you guys have any advice? Can she make my uncle her POA at this stage in her Alzheimer’s? Is there any option other than paying an attorney $300 an hour for finding a solution to this? If we can’t afford an attorney can the state appoint someone to be her POA? 

We are new at this and we don’t really know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated!"
"This is the worst she has ever been in front of me with me physically there. She refused to go to the pet store to get food for her cat because 'they' told her she can't go now, and then she proceeded to talk to 'them' through the wall. This was such a shock to me as I had never seen the paranoia/ delusions exhibited so openly. What am I supposed to do? I tried to calm her down and then left, and Im going to get her cat food and deliver it to her, but feeling very scared seeing this so openly."
"Has anyone given up on their career to be a caregiver for parent with dementia ?   

I am single and no kids.  I can financially afford it for a few years and feel like my mother might be in nursing home in 2-3 years and think it is hard to measure the time I can spend with her now while she still knows me versus what she may be at in 2-3 years."
"How do you take care of a parent with dementia who is sick all the time?   My mother has early stage dementia and heart issues, kidney issues, and other medical issues.

She needs someone to do her pills, make sure she take pills, go to doctors appts, talk to doctors on phone, go to have labs,  etc.    

I am physically and mentally beat up.  I do not think having a visiting nurse come will help much because my mothers meds chaneg all the time and she has 10 different doctors that call and so ultimately will not really save me time a I will have to go back to talk with doctors, etc anyways."
"Has anyone had any luck getting access? The rollout since FDA approval has been pretty spotty, and details very murky when I talk to our doctor."
"My parent has just been diagnosed with Alzheimers. I want to start recording his life story before it's too late.

Are there any apps which are best to do this on, or is it just fine to do it on your phone camera?"
"I'm curious to see if there are people out there who have had experience trying some of the research-based but not yet validated treatments out there, especially for slowing progression of early alzheimers. Some of the ones that seem interesting to me have been:

* 40hz light/sound therapy https://picower.mit.edu/news/new-trial-test-brain-wave-stimulation-alzheimers-preventative
* Plasma exchange https://health.ucdavis.edu/blog/lab-best-practice/plasma-exchange-with-albumin-replacement-for-alzheimers-disease/2021/05
* Rapamycin https://news.uthscsa.edu/ut-health-san-antonio-gains-2m-to-study-rapamycin-for-alzheimers/
* NAD+ supplementation https://www.pnas.org/content/115/8/E1876

Any experiences with these or other potential treatments in this sort of edge-of-research area would also be super appreciated."
"My dad is 57 and was just diagnosed yesterday. He was also told he has brain plaque. He's seeing a neurologist in a month to get more information. I know all cases are different but could anyone give me a rough idea of how long I might have with him . Right now he does have any severe signs of it , hell go out to his car and forget his phone or something and on occasion hell get tongue tied but I would say its very mild at this point. How fast does this progress and how long could I have to be able to do things he still enjoys before he is no longer capable. Thanks !"
"Hi - my mum was officially diagnosed with Alzheimers a couple of years ago, but her cognitive decline had been evident for some time. Overall, it seems to be a steady, but slow decline.   

We were all so concerned and attentive towards mum, that we just didn't notice the decline in dad, or put his occasional 'confusion' down to being tired, or a little worse for wear (ie he did love a drink).

Now, it's becoming apparent that he is also headed down the dementia path, and we are waiting for his official assessment.  The trouble is, I think he has a different type of dementia - perhaps Lewy Body or frontal lobe dementia.  He gets very frustrated and loses patience incredibly quickly nowadays (he used to be a very patient man), and he seems to have lost a lot of empathy towards mum; sometimes he just talks rubbish and I can't figure out what he's on about; he gets up in the middle of the night, convinced he needs to shower and dress for an appointment.

My biggest problem at the moment is that he and mum are driving each other crazy!  Part of mum's behaviour is obsessing about things, and she won't let dad out of her sight for very long, scared he will fall over and hurt himself.  There's a history of this, so it's not an unreasonable concern - but she follows him around constantly, and it drives him nuts!

Mum's also exhausted, because of dad getting up throughout the night - but she won't sleep in another room, as she's too scared he will get up and fall over, and she won't hear him.  So, with mum being extra tired and dad being extra impatient, they are constantly arguing and bickering - apparently a few nights ago they had a serious screaming match ... but neither of them can recall what exactly was said or by whom, just that they were both upset and that it was the other's fault.  So fat, my sister and I have heard several versions of what triggered the intense argument, but as the stories constantly change, we simply don't know who or what to believe..

My parents are, at this stage, refusing to go into any kind of care in any capacity - not even for respite.  According to them, there's nothing wrong with them, they just forget a few things (!) and get a bit impatient with each other.

My sister and I do have PoA and Guardianship; we've stopped dad drinking; we've taken both sets of car keys and we're trying our best to manage them - but jeez it's f***ing hard.  Both parents are in their early 80's.

Has anyone else had both parents develop dementia?  Do you have any suggestions/opinions on how we might move forward?  FWIW, we're in Australia.

Thank you for reading this far ... apart from anything else, I needed to do a bit of a verbal dump ... this shit is just so exhausting and overwhelming."
"For those that have moved their loved one from assisted living to memory care, was there a new behavior or something else that finally cemented the decision to do the move?  I'm putting off memory care as long as I can (almost double the cost) but obviously safety and well-being is the first priority."
"“He’s had another accident” my mum said when I waked in.
“I left his pile cream and toothpaste together in the bathroom.”
“Fuckin hell mum, which one did he use?”
“I dunno but he’s either got a minty arse or tight gums I’ve not found out yet”
My Dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2014. We think he’d had it longer. Hes 75 now, an ex semi professional footballer in his younger years, and as it has been well covered on the news recently, it is now very common to see this generation of ex players suffering from it after years of heading heavy mud soaked footballs in the 60’s and 70’s. 

Throughout my time growing up in wythenshawe, everyone knew Big Rick. Wherever we went when I was introduced to anyone he used to play with they would eulogise about how great a player he was. I used to find it annoying as a spotty faced centre forward trying to be my own man and living in his shadow in the Manchester amateur football scene, but looking back it was something I should have enjoyed. 

He was larger than life in my teenage years. Passionate about sport. Loved his horse racing, golf and snooker. Terrible gambler. Would bet on two flies on a wall. Some of my earliest memories is being on holiday where we were dragged into a smokey room upstairs in pontins in Prestatyn whilst he played brag. He would sit laughing and swearing at everyone with a massive cigar on the go. 

That’s what makes it so difficult now. It’s never easy for anyone altzimers. It’s a bastard of a disease. The long goodbye as it’s commonly known. It’s a gradual thing. Human beings only remember in the short term, and the longer it goes on, you remember the person they are now rather than then. With my dad the most painful thing was watching the confidence disappear. He was such an alpha male. To see him turn nervous and apologetic was heartbreaking. 

I was going through some old VHS tapes recently and found him doing a speech at a sportsman’s evening from the mid eighties. I felt a lump in my throat straight away. There he was, full of life and passion, delivering a wonderful speech to a room of hundreds of people. I called him in and he sat down. “Watch this” I said and as he walked on stage his old smile beamed across his face. “Look at that” he said. He watched the whole thing in silence and it was like we’d stepped into a time machine together. It was wonderful. At the end he turned to me and I looked at him holding back the tears and he said “who was that again?”. I just burst out laughing. 

Recently he has got worse and the stories have become more ridiculous. He was always telling you which football league grounds he had played at when you were watching the games, but he tried to tell me he’d played at the Allianz arena last week. “Have you fuck” I told him, then felt really snide. He also recanted a wonderful tale to me recently of how his dad had been kidnapped by Germans during World War Two but the tootengam hotspur team had rescued him and his dad had took him to spurs as guest of honour when he was young and they were paraded round the pitch. Another one in the car was when we were driving through Bramhall and he said “when I was a kid there were no cars round here.......just elephants with men riding them”. 

I had to spend a weekend looking after him recently when my mum was away and it is only when you spend an extended period of time with him that you see the disease in it’s entirety. It comes down like a cloud. Sometimes, it’s like he hasn’t even got it, then other times it’s like he is completely not there. On the Saturday night we watched match of the day together then I give him his tablets and put him in bed and just as I tucked him in he looked at me with an expression of complete clarity like he was 20 years younger and said “thanks for doing all this for me son”. I give him a kiss and went in the next room, lay down in the dark and cried like I hadn’t for years. 

I’m not complaining, he’s 75 and still here. Some of my mates lost their dad very early and I realise how lucky I’ve been. But in all honesty and as hard as this is to say out loud, when he does go it will be a relief. It’s hard enough now, seeing him in the middle stages. I just hope he goes before it gets worse. If I got the call in the middle of the night that he had gone in his sleep, I would grieve for my dad, but a part of me would rejoice. I would celebrate that I won’t have to watch any more of it. To see him deteriorate to the point where he doesn’t remember you any more, that’s got to be the worst. I hope he goes before then, on his own terms, riding the big elephant to the sky, detouring through bramhall first, of course."
"My grandpa has talked to me twice now on my grandma’s memory. She’s 75 years old. He first mentioned it to me last winter, but said it may just be her getting a bit older. I had noticed she seemed to be writing things down more, both on a notepad in her purse, and on a calendar she keeps by her armchair. She had also started asking me to remind her more often when I had appointments and such that she wanted to come up for.

This past weekend, he mentioned it again, but explained that things are getting worse. She’ll go pull out the sweeper, sweep, put the sweeper up, then a little bit later go pull out the sweeper again, and then just leave it  laying out. She’s forgetting conversations more often, to the point where my Great Uncle even mentioned it to my grandpa. My great uncle’s wife had Alzheimer’s, and he told my grandpa that my grandma reminds him of his wife before her diagnosis. Another odd behavior my grandpa mentioned was that she’s started to screw bottle caps on wrong. He showed me that this morning, she left a bottle of orange juice on the counter, and the cap was on it crooked. Though, full transparency I’m not for sure how/if that’s a sign of Alzheimer’s, I didn’t see it while I was searching around. 

All of this aside, another thing we talked about was how/if we should mention this to her. I love my grandma dearly, she’s been almost a mother to me, but I know she can be stubborn and doesn’t take perceived criticism well. 

What’s the best way to go about bringing the potential for this to her attention? I don’t want to hurt her emotionally, but I’m so scared that if this goes un-checked by the time she get’s help it’ll be too late"
"Hello, i've posted before a couple times and figured I would post again.  


The last two times, pre pandamic, I tried to visit my Grandma and did, however both times she did not recall who I was. We were always very close so this was extremely hard for me, but I put on a brave face and she did tell me I was ""Quite a nice young man"" at the end of the visit.  


Fast forward to 2021, last year she had a fall and broke her hip, she'd now in a wheelchair, and i've been internally conflicted if I should still go and see her next time I get a chance, or stop visiting. I always feel a bit awkward visiting her (I'm on the autism spectrum) but I've tried my best the last few times. I posted this because internally I am conflicted on seeing her how she is now, or just remembering how she was at least before the fall.   


Thanks in advance for any answers."
"Please can somebody help me? I have so many questions. 
He isn't too far gone yet, but I can see he isn't himself anymore when I'm visiting.
Like, can I help in anyway even though I can't live with my parents?
What should I think about when I talk with him? 
How fast does it take ahold?
Can I help my mom in anyway that live with him and have a hard time handling/dealing with this?
And much more

"Throwaway bc family and friends know my reddit acc.

My step-father is in his mid fifties, diagnosed with AD three years ago with clear symptoms at least five years ago. In his family, his father had it, his grandmother had it, and his great-grandmother had it as well as certain members of his extended family. It's a prevalent disease due to, I imagine, inbreeding. His family comes from a small village in my country and according to his mother, his father and her were relatively close cousins.

He has been more of a father to me than my actual father in so many ways, a really brilliant mathematician who used to love doing sudoku puzzles and now he can't even write the first letter of his name, let alone a word or a calculation.

Currently, he still remembers all of us, however his short-term memory is non-existant. He is irritable when my mother isn't around and always wants to go outside though thankfully he can't find the door. He constantly needs to be kept active, which is something that my mother did not marry him for - he used to live slowly, lounging on the couch and reading etc. The most recent antics of his are being unable to pee into the actual toilet. This, while disgusting, is even more problematic due to the fact that he was diagnosed with a Hep B chronic infection, which was caused by a blood transfusion from a surgery a few years ago. My mother is primarily worried about me developing an infection, even though I was the generation that was vaccinated against it.

How long does he have before death? That is the only thing that we can hope for. Hospice care is far, far too expensive - especially for patients who are able to walk. Nurses as well, we don't have that kind of money. Our country doesn't really have a good safety net for Alzheimers patients. I love him, I really do - but I don't want my image of him to deteriorate further."
"My grandma has been staying with us for over a week because my grandpa is in the hospital. She is nearing the end of the moderate stage. She is at the point where she doesn’t know who anybody is. She sometimes thinks her husband (my grandpa) is her dad,  thinks my mom is her sister. It’s endless. She just won’t stop asking questions, some of them don’t even make sense. I feel bad for getting annoyed but it’s so tiring listening to her ask my mom all these questions when my mom keeps giving her the same answers. She has a tablet that she likes to play solitaire on which helps distract her but even that sometimes won’t work. I know this is very vague but there is too much to put on here. What should we do that would maybe help with all the questions/distract her?"
I hadn’t seen my grandma since last mothers day. All she could talk about last visit was how pretty I am. I had pink hair that was a bit longer than it was now last time. Im afab trans masculine and last time she asked me a few times if I was a man or a woman. She doesn’t usually remember who I am but it doesn’t hurt my feelings. I have shorter hair now and this time I visited her she gendered me correctly half the time. She doesn’t know Im trans and my family misgenders me most of the time (though its not a big enough issue for me to pick a fight about). It was interesting to see how her perception of me changed depending on the conversation since she forgets things so easily. Im not sure it means much as far as how well I “pass” given her condition but instead of calling me beautiful this time she called me handsome more often than not. She actually flirted with me a bit which I found funny and flattering. I don’t think she’d retained that Im her grandkid. Maybe Im weird for not being weirded out by this and taking it in stride. She was being pretty innocent so it wasn’t a bid deal for me but I realize this could be a sensitive subject so Im sorry if it is for those who read this. I was genuinely curious if this was a common behavior for people with Alzheimer’s? Like is it common for people to hit on their family members in this way or is my Grandma just an oddball?
"Alzheimer's runs in my wife's family, particularly in the women. She's approaching the age where her grandmother, mother, and two older sisters were diagnosed. We want to make sure that there aren't complications that I or, if something were to happen to me, her daughters would have to navigate.  


I'm reaching out to an elder law attorney this coming week and would like to have some idea about what questions to ask. Thank you!"
"At 62, My mom is showing some clear onset signs of Alzheimers in poor money management and lack of self care. She wont save money, or set money aside for rent. She wont bathe often, nor will she visit a doctor, even though she is appearing malnourished. She's not terribly forgetful, but she will often gaslight me in very important situations saying she told me key information, but it was never said. It's a very dramatic behavior and I'm struggling to cope with this. I have no guidance on how to handle this situation, so I'm turning to reddit to help me find resources to help her. I heard often the only thing to do is wait until she becomes an endangerment to me, before committing her to help- but I know there HAS to be something I can do. She is intelligent enough where I believe with treatment, she can retain her faculties. But I am scared, I am terrified, that if this festers, I will lose her or my lose my freedom trying to help her (I am only 26 years old). Alzheimers runs through my family so I know I'm not imagining things. PLEASE HELP."
"Dad refuses to wear a coat when it rains. Conversely, he refuses to take his coat and scarf off when it's sunny. We had a heatwave in the UK recently - yes, 32⁰c is considered V E R Y warm here - and dad insisted on joining us for an evening walk with his jumper, coat and scarf. 

After some lengthy negotiations, he removed the coat and scarf which we promptly hid from view. Just as we're leaving we realise he had replaced his scarf with one he made himself. Out of toilet paper. 

Absolute fashion icon."
"My mother has Alzheimer's and frequently asks to speak with her parents, I don't have the heart to tell her that they are dead. What would be the best way to deflect this question without upsetting her?

"My mom told me about a week ago that my grandpa was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. It’s something that we’ve suspected for a couple years, but hearing his diagnosis is still incredibly painful. My grandpa and I are extremely close, and I’m having a very hard time with it. He’s coming to visit us in a few weeks with another family member, so it’ll be great to see him. My step-grandma says that he’s on a medication that’s helping him for now. He’s aware of his diagnosis, and knows what it means. I’m dreading when his condition worsens. I have a very hard time working through grief, and I know that this is going to be one long grieving process."
"I haven't been able to figure out how to keep my mother hydrated properly. She never drinks water on her own and when i give it to her i'm lucky if she even takes a sip. She barely drinks a bottle of water a day if even that. I think giving it to her in a cup helps and she also seems more willing to drink it when i bring it to her on the toilet (not sure why). If anyone knows of a good method please let me know. Thanks.

"Mom was recently moved to memory care.  They allow electronic monitoring of the rooms.  Has anyone done this?  Have a camera or system they recommend?

I am thinking of the Amazon show and maybe one other camera.

Thoughts?"
"Ok. So a back story is my mother is late stages Alzheimer’s but she has not quite made it over the hump. 

So last week I see that the assisted living home had added even more antidepressants and antipsychotics which was causing issues and I politely asked to remover her off the zyprexa due to the side effects she was displaying and how far she is out of it. 

This in turned upset my aunts and uncle to the point I’m getting messages stated elderly abuse and all kinds of crazy stuff about lawyers being involved. I’m the poa for moms medical. 

On a side note these new drugs was not prescribed by moms neurologist. So Friday I was in contact with moms neurologist to get them the list of new meds and the one I requested them to remover her off of. This was trying to get mom a better options for care. 

I was in contact with a lawyer Friday also to try and get an emergency conservatorship. I’m thinking that’s a lost cause. 

Thoughts on what to do in this situation."
"For people with family members suffering mild to moderate Alzheimer's, a company called Cassava Sciences just release data at AAIC that showed their drug improved ADAS-Cog scores by 3 points over a 9 month period. Which means improved cognition. They are starting their Phase 3 clinical trials in the Fall so if you live in the US or Canada, and want to know more about the trial, you can go to [https://www.cassavasciences.com/static-files/c45b6f43-ccc1-4391-bfed-e1c68fbae5fd](https://www.cassavasciences.com/static-files/c45b6f43-ccc1-4391-bfed-e1c68fbae5fd).

"So this week I thought my dad was dying. He was non responsive the facility called 911. He was admitted to the hospital for two days. Sleeping the entire time. They did blood tests, CT scan, UTI test. Found nothing. But he wouldn’t wake up.  The hospital mentioned he might be getting over medicated. The facility denied giving him more meds. My family and I were starting to think this was the end. My aunts were getting ready to come down and say their goodbyes. I took It a lot worse than I thought.  I had to hire a hospice service. They released him from the hospital and I went over expecting to see my father in his forever sleep. When I walked in he was bright eyed and said oh hi!  I feel like I haven’t seen you in so long!  He was the most clear I’ve seen him in a long time. He declined super quickly in the 6mos hes been in this place. I literally thought my dad was dying and then one of the caregivers proceeded to tell me all this stuff that is going on at the facility. Like there’s a nurse that over medicated to manage the residents. I don’t know what’s the truth but I am so upset. Has anyone experienced this?  This is suppose to be a very reputable facility and very expensive. I’ve started looking at other places but this has really made me lose faith in these places. On top of everything he fell and broke his nose today! My poor dad. I feel so guilty. I did so much research when finding this place. I thought It was going to be so good. I just don’t know where to go from here."
"
My grandmother comes from a family where Alzheimer's is incredibly common and hard to avoid. She was the youngest of 11 children, and every single one who lived long enough developed Alzheimer's - only her mother avoided that fate, who lived until 96 and in full possession of her mind the whole time (the Alzheimer's gene seems to have come from her father, who started exhibiting symptoms during the 1950s at a relatively young age and was almost completely disabled throughout the 1960s). From 1982 up through 2011, she lived hundreds of miles away from us so we only saw her once or twice per year. The June of 2011, she came to live with me and my parents after her husband died, where we cared for her for the next three years until her death.  


**2005 (Age 81)**

Normal, lucid adult full of boundless energy. No signs of dementia no matter how closely you searched for any.

&#x200B;

**2006 (Age 82)**

She had a few weird moments where she repeated herself in a very brief timespan. Otherwise normal. There was a large family reunion which took place in 2006, and Grandmother was nothing more or less than simply another family member, rather than someone who stood out due to being a dependent or a victim of dementia (as she would of course become some years down the road). 

&#x200B;

**2007 (Age 83)**

No real change noted here. This was the last year she remembered to send me a birthday card and the last year she regularly emailed my mom. She drove to our house 500 miles away for my nephew's baby shower with no problems, and displayed no symptoms of Alzheimer's during the few days she spent here (aside from a few instances of repeating herself within a very short time, as per the year prior). 

&#x200B;

She did, however, drive all the way back to the hospital in their hometown 500 miles away when Papa started having some issues with his heart during the visit, rather than going to a local hospital. She explained herself to my mom a few days later over the phone by saying ""I just panicked,"" though my mom found such an extreme lapse in judgment very odd. Since Grandmother overall seemed very normal, though, my mom put the idea of her developing dementia on the backburner, taking a more 'wait and see' attitude unless and until more obvious problems arose.

&#x200B;

**2008 (Age 84)**

Generally normal, though minor symptoms become more common here. Grandmother started replying to my mom's emails more and more inconsistently throughout the year, and stopped entirely by the year's end. She showed some problems with judgment and fell for a few ""prey on the elderly"" scams. My mom visited her that July, and Grandmother burned the turkey that she tried cooking for my mom by leaving it in the oven too long and forgetting about it altogether - something my mom found strange since Grandmother was always very meticulous about everything she did and had an excellent memory, though my mom was unsure if Grandmother was showing early signs of dementia or if it was a simple memory slip resulting from normal aging, since otherwise Grandmother seemed quite normal during the entire three day visit.

&#x200B;

2008 was the last year that Grandmother had full independence. She paid all the bills, she drove into town every week and bought all of the groceries, she managed all operations of the household since my grandfather was physically disabled from a stroke in 2006 (though he remained lucid and cognitively normal for about 2-3 years thereafter). Whatever problems she might have had - and it's possible that she might have had more trouble doing these things than anyone realized since nobody was keeping a close eye on her, assuming she was perfectly 'normal' and capable - she's plainly more or less a normal adult at the end of the day given that she was able to manage throughout the entire year completely unsupervised.

&#x200B;

**2009 (Age 85)**

Things begin to get serious here. As the year progresses she leaves behind ""early Alzheimer's"" territory where the disease is largely an invisible condition, and reaches the cusp of early/mid levels of the illness. This was the first year where she showed clear-cut problems in functioning. Her internet connection had been taken down by August 2009 because she forgot to pay for it, and she had her keys taken away in September after a drive to the grocery store ended with her getting so lost that she ended up on a beach dozens of miles away.  


Grandmother was at a stage where her Alzheimer's wasn't apparent, or at least wasn't *that* obvious, during simple regular conversation, but the cracks in her memory and thought processes were very clear when she had to do something mentally demanding. Grandmother drove my mom somewhere during our yearly visit which that year took place in August, and though the ride was generally fairly smooth with my grandmother seemingly capable of the basic mechanics of driving and remembering the route to the nursing home, there was one point where my mom had to take control of the wheel because Grandmother was driving the wrong way down a one-way road. And later that same day, Grandmother was unsure if we were going to go back to her own home, or to ours. (Since we live about 500 miles away, the answer should've been obvious)

We visited my grandfather at a nursing home that August, who was 91 and in much worse shape (he made a partial recovery and was in much better shape throughout 2010 than he was during either of the two bordering years, but it's a miracle he managed to survive 2009). At the time, I thought of Grandmother as having a foot in two worlds. My grandfather was on the obvious demented, sickly, broken side. Grandmother was MOSTLY on the healthy, lucid, aware side with the rest of us, and she self-identified as a 'normal' and 'healthy' person in stark contrast to her sickly husband's ""broken old man""... but she did have one foot in the world where my grandfather was.

Late 2009, in response to September's beach incident, was where she started to receive some light assistance. My aunt brought her parents groceries, paid all of the bills, and made sure Grandmother remembered to take her meds. Otherwise she was independent.

There's a test known as the Barthel Index. It assesses the independence level of someone based on their ability to do simple things learned in childhood - bathing yourself, dressing yourself, walking unassisted, feeding yourself, using the toilet. At this point there's no question whatsoever that Grandmother would score the maximum of 100 on the test.

&#x200B;

**2010 (Age 86)**

Definite mid-tier Alzheimer's. She recognized everyone and could still hold conversations, but she had little to no memory of recent events and she had no real detailed awareness of her surroundings. In 2009, she remembered that she couldn't remember her computer password; in 2010 she probably didn't know what a computer or an internet was. The 2009 Grandmother's short-term memory was noticeably impaired and spottier than the average person's, but it was far from completely gone or completely nonexistent. 2010 Grandmother's short-term memory, though... yeah, totally gone. If it happened longer than five minutes before, it never happened.

2010 Grandmother was perfectly capable of holding conversations, but only if those conversations were limited to things from maybe the 1990s and older. If you mentioned a friend that she'd made during the past 10 or 15 years, she wouldn't recognize them. Political figures and celebrities that made their debut later than the 1980s or so would just result in a shrug if you mentioned them. Technologies that were popularized during the 90s or 2000s were something she wouldn't recognize at all. She knew perfectly well what a television was and I think she'd recognize certain 80s technologies like CD players (just assuming there based on her overall level of functioning), but there was no way she had any idea what the internet was.  


By this point, the fact that Grandmother has dementia is very obvious even during casual conversation. Conversing with her isn't a frustrating endeavor or anything - if you say anything to her, 9 times out of 10 you will get a reasonable response that shows real comprehension of what you said - but it's still overwhelmingly obvious with even small amounts of contact that she has experienced some amount of transparent cognitive decline.

Still capable of all basic tasks of living. I think she would still get a perfect 100 on the Barthel Index. We visited the grandparents Thanksgiving 2010 - great visit, Papa was doing fairly well and Grandmother wasn't THAT bad yet - and I don't think we had to help her with anything listed on the Barthel Index.

&#x200B;

**2011 (Age 87)**

The more severe end of mid-stage Alzheimer's. She still recognized her kids, but it's unclear if she remembered the grandkids. Her memory of the past became more distorted, and she began telling stories about things that clearly never happened; in 2010 all of her recollections of the past were factual. She began falling asleep around 6 or 7 in the evening, whereas in 2010 she always fell asleep at her usual 10 or 11 PM. She alternated between using a cane and walking unassisted; in 2010 she always walked unassisted. 

She could still sign her name. There was one moment this year where she tried to add two double-digit numbers together, and did so correctly. She was talkative and would go on long monologues, and those monologues were very clear and coherent and easy to follow, but probably 70 percent of the time her responses to things other said had little relation to what was said.

Grandmother's adult sense of social etiquette eroded some here, with some much more childlike moments. During a visit to the grandparents the May of 2011, Grandmother had my brother and my mom move Papa because he was sleeping on 'her side' of the bed (Papa being very frail and skeletal and just a few weeks away from death). During the summer, she removed her medical alert bracelet and put Papa's on instead; when my mom informed her after discovering this that Papa's bracelet was useless for her, Grandmother replied with ""but his is prettier than mine."" And, of course, there was the time in December that she hid my sister's car keys, telling her ""If I can't drive, nobody drives."" 

The grandmother of 2009 and probably 2010 would have handled those situations differently. Despite her decline in memory and function, she still had the emotional maturity of an adult and so would have dealt with those three situations in the same way that she would have prior to developing dementia. The 2009 Grandmother would have identified Papa as a sickly old man and simply let him keep her side of the bed, understood the purpose of the medical alert bracelet and kept hers on, and she wouldn't have gone around hiding anyone's car keys.

This is the first year where there's a decline in Grandmother's Barthel Index score. Using an online calculator, it seems like 2011 Grandmother would get a score of around 70, putting her in the Minimally Dependent category.

&#x200B;

**2012 (Age 88)**

Early severe. She started the year off using a cane most of the time (she continued to walk unassisted sometimes during the early months of the year) and ended it always using a walker. She became a lot more quiet, though she still talked some. Her speech was still coherent. Her responses to others very rarely showed any comprehension of what was said. She still ate on her own. She clearly did not recognize the grandkids. Her recognition of her children was spotty and inconsistent. She slept more frequently than in 2011. In 2011, though she fell asleep in the evenings, she was alert and active prior to then; in 2012 she began dozing off every couple of hours, on and off through the day. 2012 Grandmother would get a Barthel Index score of around 40, putting her in the Partially Dependent category.

&#x200B;

**2013 (Age 89)**

Her speech was largely gibberish by this point with only occasional recognizable words. Early in the year she would open her mouth to let us feed her, but by the end of the year she subsided off tube feedings because she couldn't eat without choking. In early 2013, was capable of moving with a walker so long as multiple people helped her. By late 2013 she was wheelchair-only. 2013 Grandmother gets a Barthel Index Score of around 20, the Very Dependent category.

&#x200B;

**2014 (Age 90)**

Grandmother declined gravely almost the moment 2014 began, with there being an enormous difference between the Grandmother of Christmas 2013 (who, despite the issues talked about in the previous paragraph, seemed to be fairly happy and content - she enjoyed company and laughed a lot at the antics of the great-grandchildren) and the Grandmother of January 2014. She became bedridden and entered a semi-comatose state, sleeping around the clock. Would cry out and panic every time we tried to move her to clean her up. Don't remember her speaking a single coherent word throughout the year. Though Grandmother's Barthel Index scores from 2011 through 2013 are an estimation with a small margin of error, her score for 2014 is very clear - zero, Totally Dependent.   


This phase didn't last too long. She passed away the August of 2014, a few months shy of what would have been her 91st birthday."
"Hi Reddit,

I’m looking for some advice, my mother (72) is going downhill rapidly with Alzheimer’s, my father (70) is a very logical thinker.

Recently my father has purchased a Campervan and to take my mum on away within our country. They have always travelled around the world previously which is obviously now not possible. 

My older brother and sister are dead against this to the point they will not communicate with my dads group text messages to the point they are ignoring my dads messages on their first trip to a family property. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? 

I know my dad will look after my mum 💯 but I’m not sure if I’m missing something, my brother and sister are so against my Dad and I don’t understand why, as I know they love both of them so much. 

Appreciate any feedback from anyone who has been through this before.

(Please pardon my username, created long ago to be a lurker and totally unrelated to my post)"
"My dad recently started buying more stuff when he goes out. A few examples is home buying a cookie from the store every time he goes along with him buying me 4 Gatorade’s randomly because I workout. That and just an overall more willingness to spend/buy things for himself or others in the family. Does anyone else have any similar experiences, I think my dad is in the more earlier stages of Alzheimer’s"
"My late 60s moms has significant short term memory loss, episodes of confusion that lead to irritability and sun setting in the evening. She has a history of encephalitis that was rather significant and also seizures. The neurologist said that it dose not appear to be Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s yet but they want to put her on Aricept? Does anyone know why they would try such a strong drug without a formal diagnosis of Alzheimer’s? Since they can’t say for certain what is causing the memory issues, is this a way to test to confirm a diagnosis.  Has anyone been in a similar situation and could share the outcome or purpose?"
"My beloved Dad started with forgetfulness about 10 years ago- in October of 2016 I finally had him in agreement to get tested for Alzheimer and then he had a stroke 3 days before the test was to be conducted so of course we cancelled it and went forward with massive rehabilitation for the stroke. fast for to November 2020 another ""stroke"" hit and he was hospitalized for a week with no rehab- my mother kept saying the Doctor said no new medication and I kept arguing back antibiotics aren't a permanent medication he has a UTI- so he suffered for a week after being released from the hospital with crazy symptoms and pain I am sure. My dad today is probably late mid-stages. This past weekend all hell broke loose between my mom and daughter because my mom just doesn't provide the care my Dad needs, truthfully she can't even take care of herself she is covered in bruised from falling and constantly tearing her skin open and weighs about 80 pounds now. My daughter and I would like to take my Dad however she (my mom) will not allow it so she contacted a person connected with the VA and is placing him a VA nursing home 6 hours away from me roughly 4 from my mom and kids. Is there anything I can do to stop this? My mom is a hateful woman and just wants to stick him anywhere and just move on and live her life- which will be very lonely once she places my Dad because myself and my children won't be going around!! Does this disease make families fall apart? Luckily or may be a curse I am the only child and my Dad and his parents were always my saving grace!"
"We are finally moving dad to assisted living in a couple of days, and would love any thoughts and tips on how to make it as smooth as possible. He’s going from a small single family rental home with a great yard for his dog, to a studio unit. He always loved gardening and I know he’s going to miss his outdoor space, although the facility has nice grounds for walks. Fortunately he’s able to keep his dog for now.

My sister and I came in from out of town to help move, and will be here for about 5 days after move in day to be with him as much as possible. 

Lots swirling around in my head between getting him moved in, getting some old larger furniture out of the house, and all the smaller things sorted and packed. Would love to hear what’s worked for all of you, and also what to look out for as he hopefully acclimates over the coming weeks."
"My dad hasn’t been doing well these last few days. Yesterday he was very out of It. And then today he was just in bed sleeping and non responsive. I broke down today when I saw him.  I know it’s the disease progressing, and I thought I was mentally prepared, but It broke my heart today seeing him like that.  Has anyone experienced this with their loved ones at the end?  He’s not eating and I know we won’t be trying to prolong his life with feeding tubes or anything. He’s been out of It before and then was better the next day. But I hadn’t seen him like this before. Is this the end?  I just feel so heartbroken losing him to this disease. I really thought I’d be prepared for this, but I can’t seem to stop crying today."
"I am looking for opinions on what brand of adult diapers is the most absorbent and also looks the most like underwear.  My LO is quite young (61), still has a lot of cognitive abilities, but has recently been unable to control her bowels/bladder.  This started a few weeks ago.  I want to get something that will help but also manages to preserve some dignity.  Any thoughts/recommendations?"
"So my mother, her mother, and her father all had early onset Alzheimer's. My mother and her father also had Parkinson's. I recently took a genetic test and both markers showed up in my genes. We still don't know the possibility of me getting it but it's really put me into serious thinking mode. I took care of my mother starting at the age of 14, She was 53. So I've seen the beginning, middle and end of it all. I also saw the terrible time my own father had to deal with his wife declining so rapidly. Look at him now makes my heart hurt, they were together for almost 40 years and he watched his best friend go through all that.

Now speaking on myself again.... Should I even risk a relationship? For my own bodily autonomy I want to be Euthanized should I do develop the issues. It is legal in several countries.

So.. That's my question to you all. Do I just spend the rest of my life alone as to not even bother burdening someone with my own ""selfish"" choices or should I try?"
"Hi all, 

This is something that I have been struggling with. My father is 71. Before the lockdowns he was functioning normally. During the lockdowns, him and my mother due to the differences of my opinion concerning the lockdown were arguing a-lot. They really don't argue that much so it took a big strain on the relationship. During this time his became a little withdrawn and sulky. 2020 was a crazy year. Then his sister (my aunt) died out of nowhere and that when his mood started to change and so was his memory. In the past several months it seems that his personally changed and he did not want to do anything, he became kind of forgetful and did not seems there all the time. He also would not talk that much and it seems like he was not as sharp. The change was noticeable and it alarmed me and my mother and my aunt. His voiced seemed to of change too. He just seemed tired. My mother and I has scheduled him to get a physical. He can still drive and do other things, he can talk about current events and the like but the decline came out of nowhere and it became worst after his sister died. Like I said he is a bit better because is not as withdrawn as he was a couple of months ago. I just never seen him like this. What do yall think? Maybe a stroke?"
"Preface for why we need a watch with safety locks: My father will leave the house with just a shirt and underwear on. Small devices will not work well for tracking my father for that reason along with the fact that he will toss things out his pockets. It isn't unusal for my father to leave the house without shoes either, hence gps tracking soles aren't what we are looking for either. Regular wrist watches will be taken off when he wants to, hence devices like a apple watch aren't gonna work. 

We are looking for a wrist watch with a safety lock feature. We have stumbled upon the theora connect. Anyone have experience with it? Anyone have other options? Thank you for your time."
"Hello, as the title states, my Aunty has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. This has been a long time coming and is not surprising. I would estimate she has had issues with her memory for about a decade now and it has been painfully obvious to my mum (her sister) and I that something was wrong. Her kids are not very helpful and have been in denial about the whole thing up until she got diagnosed. 

I’m not exactly sure how far it has progressed, but what I do know is that she is no longer allowed to have a drivers licence and repeats herself a lot. Sometimes she will tell the same story 3 or 4 times in the span of a conversation. Just for clarification I never bring this to her attention because I feel it would be upsetting for her. She gets confused about her grandchildren’s names and sometimes doesn’t recognise them in photos. She has also stopped all of her hobbies over the years, for example she used to draw, sew, make candles, etc. Her handwriting has become quite shaky as well. She is really a shell of her former self and it is horrid to see. 

My Aunty is very dear to me and I wanted to be an Aunty when I grew up because of her. 

I guess the advice I need is how to talk to her about it when she brings it up. She will sometimes say she’s mad and belongs in an aged care home, and is quite aware she is forgetting things but she doesn’t know what she’s forgotten. The last time I saw her she told me she had gone too far in the wrong direction and she had tears in her eyes. I just don’t know what to say. I want to be able to comfort her but have no idea how."
"Is anyone else's family members getting confused by the naming ""2020 Tokyo Olympics"" in 2021. My grandmother is getting confused by it especially now it's on tv all the time.

&#x200B;

Not really asking for anything, just wondering if it is a shared experience."
"Doc prescibed alprazolam as needed. Seems like my Dad is getting angrier and since we started it,like he's getting worse. He was getting worse and that's why we started, but can ya'll share any experience with this drug? This feels chicken and egg-like and I'd love some feedback.Thanks so much!"
They gave her a week left to live. I just don't know if I can see her like this. She is not even there anymore and part of my asks what the point is of even visiting her. Am I a jerk?
"My mom will be 64 next month and was formally diagnosed earlier this month with early-onset Alzheimer's after a year of trying to get her into doctors appointments and testing. I'm 31F. She moved in with me in early February, when it had become very apparent that she could no longer manage living on her own. My living room is now her bedroom. She was put on Donepezil the day she moved in with me, and was on it for three weeks before it dehydrated her (constant and severe diarrhea) to the point of passing out, and she was in the hospital for three days. We're supposed to be starting the Rivastigmine patch soon to see if that does bypass her GI system well enough for any possible improvements.


I have loved my mom more than words can express, and she provided me with a really wonderful and enriching childhood, but we've always had a very volatile relationship. I don't even know why. Hoping to get that figured out, as I'll finally be starting therapy soon. She was a single parent, and we were really over dependent on each other. I have been stuck in the anger phase of my grief since she moved in, and I hate every single day of my life. I have completely emotionally detached from her in the sense that I no longer have a mom, but I still care about her enough that I am incredibly protective of her. I know she loves me so much, but I don't feel like I have that maternal protector anymore. Someone I can count on. My mommy. She's still ""here"" ​and mostly lucid, but her capacity to understand life in general has greatly and depressingly diminished so fast. I'm weary of not being with her, and the thought of eventually putting her in some sort of memory care housing terrifies me (even though we so desperately need it already) because I don't want her to be abused or taken advantage of. We are completely in a ""child has become the parent"" scenario, and I am having the worst time coping with the way she can no longer do things for herself like dress or speak properly, bathe, eat without making a huge mess, etc.


I have a really difficult time with controlling the way I react to her when she can't do something, even though I know it is completely not under her control. She's also so incredibly stubborn, and is having a really difficult time accepting that this is our reality and that I haven't been making all of this up. She is convinced that I'm not letting her do things like use a computer because I simply don't want to, when the complete fact of the matter is, she doesn't understand how to use a computer, her iPhone, her iPad, or even a tv remote anymore. And of course, this makes me look bad to anyone who is willing to listen to her make this all up, because she only sees it as me preventing her from doing these things. She really resents me for the fact that her driver's license was revoked, and that she never got to make the decision that she wouldn't be able to work anymore. I hate that I am making some of the last memories that she can retain be ones where she thinks I'm mad at her. I know it should be the absolute opposite. 


She has had a shit go at life, and for this to be what's going to end her life is shittier. I was the result of an abusive relationship with a drug addict, and I think she has a lot of unspoken traumas about that. She lost both of her parents young. She was in her 40's, when she was a caregiver to her mom while her mom was sick with and died of lung cancer. My mom's career suffered because she basically quit to take care of her mom, and then the recession happened, and really just screwed her over after that. She's got two younger brothers who really aren't going to be there for her because they're too self involved, and they've also had strained relationships over the years. She has no retirement money, only a small amount of savings that she was able to build up when she was working at her last job. I'm still in the process of getting her set up with SSDI. She does have a settlement coming soon due to an unpaid overtime and wage theft case from her former employers, but the attorney and the IRS will get the majority of it. Whatever is left when she finally gets paid will get put into a trust for her care. She was a caregiver for a man with dementia, and his daughter refused to pay my mom legally. She worked for nearly two years, because they had a truly incredible bond, but the daughter finally let my mom go after noticing her own symptoms present themselves. The fact that I now fully understand just how much work goes into being a caregiver, and how much caregivers truly should be paid will never be lost on me. Occasionally, when she's really upset, she'll ask to clarify that she didn't contagiously catch the Alzheimer's from the man she cared for. That's hard to hear each time, especially because this is not something we ever would have imagined. We don't have a family history of it. She was just supposed to be the caregiver of a person with Alzheimer's, not develop it too.


I just feel like I'm drowning. Like when a wave knocks you out and you don’t know which way is up because you’re just tumbling every which way under the wave. I am strong, but I am not okay. I fear that my stress and anger will be what kills me because of this. I truly would prefer that this disease takes her quickly so that we're both not suffering for years to come. I know what to expect from this disease and the thought of having to endure this for YEARS kills me. My only hope is that because of how rapidly she has progressed, it will, but I obviously have no control over that. It kills me even more to be having these feelings that I would rather my mom no longer be alive than have to participate in this journey with her. I never in a million years would have been able to imagine life without my mom as a child, and I am struggling to balance out those feelings with the feelings I have now. I am terrified that I will never get to have children or a family of my own with her in my life the way things are. I always imagined she'd be the kind of mom who would be helping me raise my kids like her mom was to me. And on the subject of children, how is it that I am otherwise an incredibly nurturing and compassionate person, have had a career of working with children, and desperately want my own, but I don't even want to take care of the woman who wanted me more than anything and brought me into this world? I feel like an indentured servant. We had no choice but for me to drop everything in my life to take her in. I don't make enough money to truly be supporting us. Maybe if I at least had her in her own bedroom and bathroom, but I will never be able to afford a 2 bedroom on what I make right now, nor will I be able to even consider memory care without financial aid (but it's not like the financial aid doesn't come with it's own logistics in terms of assets and finances). I'm so jealous of anyone, but especially friends who still have parents that are perfectly capable of caring for themselves. My mom won't ever get to be one of those older people who has ""golden years."" My best friend lost her mom at 56 to brain cancer two years ago, and was a complete rockstar caring for her mother, and her mother's mother. She lost them both that same year to cancer. I have incredible guilt for sharing my feelings about my mom with her, knowing how much she wishes her mom were still here. Sometimes, she'll get an attitude of her wanting to fight the disease as if it is something she can fight. And I don't want her to. I don't think she really understands what to expect from this. 


I hate sharing my bathroom with her. I hate that I constantly only want to be in my room now. I hate every single time she won't close the lid before she flushes the toilet. I hate how she has things she tries to tell me, and she just can't get the words out or describe things coherently. I hate how I have to tell her she needs to take a shower, and how she can't turn the water on and off for herself in the shower, but she has no problem randomly turning the cold water off when she's not done rinsing and then somehow turn the hot way up, and then gets stuck under scalding hot water until I can dash over to turn it off. I hate how her clothes are a constant battle now. I hate how she plays with her clothes because it's her ""busy work,"" but she's not actually folding them. She's just picking them up and down on her bed. When she's not putting her clothes on inside out or backwards, or sticking her arm straight through the head hole of a t-shirt to wear it like a one shouldered top, she's changing her clothes three times a day for no reason at all, and she doesn't even know why she does it. Or how she'll put her underwear on over her pants, or a disposable underwear on OVER her underwear, wasting them both when she has an accident. I hate that I have to explain or ask her to do something five times in a row. I hate that she has a huge bed, but only sleeps on one edge of it and doesn't understand how to center herself in it or not sleep sitting up. I hate that she thinks I'm gaslighting her half the time because she just can't comprehend the situation. I hate when she's crying, smacks her head with her hand, and talks about her ""dumb brain."" I hate when she cries in general, which is multiple times a day, I don't see my mom, who is a sad, 63 year old woman. I see the little girl version of her, a little girl who is just so lost. She cried yesterday about how ""this wasn't what she was supposed to grow up to be."" How fucking heartbreaking is that?  I hate the defeat when she just can't explain what should be a simple thought. I hate that I don't know how to comfort her. I hate that I don't have the compassion I know she deserves, especially coming from her only child. That I don't have the same resolve to care for her like she did with her mother. I very rarely give her hugs anymore, we were so attached when I was a kid, I slept in her bed with her until probably middle school. We cuddled in our big chair every night before bed. We used to call each other three times a day after I finally moved out on my own. She sent me to Europe and Australia in school programs, and I called her nearly every day with prepaid phone cards. That's when it all started. It all got tiring very quickly, but I did it because I knew she counted on it. How do these feelings just go away? How did I get so cold and how did I shut down like this? I don't know how to warm up to her again without it just feeling fake and forced. I hate that I know that she is going through a hellacious, traumatic, life destructing experience, and how I feel like I can't do anything for her. I hate myself for how I feel about our life.


I think about how I'm not going to have many pictures of her or us together as she ages for as long as she's here. I can't bring myself to want any to remember these days. Nor am I the type of person to just jump next to her for a selfie for the fun of it. I struggle with loving her the way I used to. Everything just feels like a chore, and I'm the only one who can do anything. I know that I do really love her and it's the disease I hate. I just don't know how to project that and fix this. I know that she'll be way better off if someone else is caring for her, but I don't know when we'll be able to get to that point. She is absolutely eligible for a home health aide through Medi-Cal, but I can't even have friends over anymore, my apartment is so cluttered with stuff we haven't been able to deal with since she moved in. I know we need the help, but I can't stand the thought of having a complete stranger in my house with junk everywhere. I know there's respite care, which I desperately need, and she also just needs more social interaction and activities to do, but again, I'm terrified about leaving her anywhere. I just don't know where to start with anything now. I feel like I've been running a marathon for the past year just to get her to a diagnosis, and I'm now crawling wearily and exhausted to the finish line, and we're really only just getting started.


I have really lost enjoyment to do anything, even basic things like decorate with the tons of seasonal decorations I have, or a reusable calendar that I had made with various themed magnets. I really took pride in things like that around my home. I miss my old life. I have really great friends, but they can only do so much. She has some friends, but not a large enough circle like she used to, to build a close support system for herself. She was otherwise a really well liked person when I was growing up and afterwards. She never found love. And now she's just stuck with me. I work because I have to, and this is the first stable job I've had in two years after nannying and contract work in the tech industry, and it has health benefits. But it's soul sucking. I'm just trying to stick it out enough to see how I can move into a leadership role. I hate the work, but I'm really good at it, so I know that I'm somewhat valuable in terms of efficiency and productivity. And respected. Thankfully, I get to work from home for now, but it's also hard when she's barging in on me while I'm on the phone with customers, because she's concerned about a scam call coming in on her phone. On top of grieving the mom I no longer have, I'm grieving the end of a three year, long distance relationship. He completely ghosted me. The pandemic really fucked everything up for us, and I know it could be said that I clearly dodged a bullet, but I really love him. I believed he was the person I had waited so long to meet, my lifetime in a reason, a season or a lifetime. I guess our season just changed, but I feel like I'm never going to get over him or be angry enough to want to get over him. I'm sad that there's no closure after a head over heels first couple of years and trips back and forth. The last thing he said to me as I was boarding a plane to come back home the last time I saw him in person was ""I'll see you before too long."" I can't get that out of my head. It just makes me so sad. I was really counting on ""before too long."" I hate that I feel like the idea of trying to start dating again or finding a partner feels impossible. And it's all I've ever wanted.


If you've gotten this far through my long, disorganized, rant (and if you have, thanks. These are all thoughts I've been needing to release for awhile now), how do you do this? I don't want to do this. I don't want to see the days where my mom doesn't remember who I am. I don't want to get further into delusions and things that are happening in her head that aren't happening in real life. I don't want to have to be one of those family members calling police and putting out a silver alert because she's wandered off. I don't want to deal with the fact that she'll put a nightgown on like it's a skirt and put a different shirt on with it, or how she'll wake up in the mornings, walk into the bathroom, and just pee all over the floor. How do I get rid of this anger? How do I come out of this alive? How do I deal with losing her and her truly losing her mind? How do I just come up for air?


TL;DR: Mom has early onset Alzheimer's and I don't have the emotional capacity to handle it, but I have no choice not to"
"Dad's a wanderer. At night, we can lock and bolt the doors, and he doesn't get too upset about that (yet). But in the daytime, if he can't open doors, he gets violently upset. When the doors are open, he has a habit of sneaking out and trying to go for walks, which would be great, except he can no longer find his way home. So we're looking for a 'tripwire' - a piece of security equipment that can detect a door opening and send an alert to mom's smartphone. We don't want anything loud, as Dad is noise sensitive, and we don't want to wake the neighbours.

Mom's considering Rogers Smart Home Monitoring, but I've heard questionable reviews about the installation, and I don't want to get a bunch of extras on top of what little we actually need.

We've already got one tracking device (samsung tracking device), and are ordering more (airtags), but we'd rather have multiple redundancies.

Does anyone have any suggestions?"
"My Grandmother recently moved in with us. I have an 8 year old and 5 year old. My Grandmother constantly picks on them, yells at them, and now sticks her feet in their face (no idea where that came from!) My girls are not saints, but they are really not doing anything wrong when these incidents occur. I can see this is effecting my kids (anger that she can act this way), and she is now hurt they don't want to sit next to her and simply avoid her. Anyone else have a similar experience? Ideas? She does fine with adults. It's just the kids she has this attitude towards."
"Just thinking. Rather than several individuals paying for a carer, could a few families pool so a few carers look after multiple people?"

"my Mom is still in early stages, however her condition is very evident at this point. i am a frequent cannabis user and yesterday my mother smoked with me. i’ve noticed that when she partakes, which is very occasional, she seems to be much better at recalling past memories she usually struggles with. additionally, she has a better grasp for time (i.e. recalling when in her life events have occurred) and in general can hold a conversation easier. on the flip side, she had a bit more difficulty than usual with her syntax, which was the only negative effect i observed. i am wondering if you have similar, or different experiences with weed and it’s affect on those affected? thank you!"

"I just became my Moms primary caretaker and I’m learning so much over the past couple months. I was wondering, some days are worse than others (mostly by the evening) and I’m wondering if anybody has any tips on how to keep her mind sharper and brighter. Prevent those nights where her mind seems to take a bigger dip. Have you done anything that you noticed made a big difference?

More games? Outdoors? Water consumption? Socialization?"
"I am new to this adventure, caring for a father fresh out of the hospital and a mother with Alzheimer's, so a lot of time is non-stop between tending to them and working (which I can do from their house).  And then you have the nice, calm, silent times like yesterday morning after they both had eaten their breakfasts.  Which was when my mother hit me with ""Did you pick me up by the head yesterday?""  I laughed way harder than I really should have.  Don't worry, I did not.   Hoping somebody else here gets a portion of the laughter I had."
"Someone I know just read this book, Making Rounds with Oscar, by Dr. David Dosa, a geriatric physician. She said that he recommends not treating other life threatening or severe illnesses, such as pneumonia, for Alzheimer’s patients. I’m probably misunderstanding her but she said that the doctor believes if you extend their life, you are only extending their misery. I feel like this shows no compassion. I have not read the book so I’m unsure if I’m misunderstanding what she is saying or if she is misunderstanding what the book is saying or if this information is accurate. Has any read this book? What was your take away?"
"Hi.

We've known my grandma has had dementia for about 2 years (probably longer) and recently she's gotten a lot worse. Leaving oil in the frying pan and not being able to smell it, falling and not using her alarm. She had carers come morning and night, but she got a leaflet through the post about a carehome and suggested it to my parents. 

She's been there 3 weeks and she's on a rolling 2 week stay at the moment to see how she likes it. Things seemed to be looking good, she's always kind of gloomy about things but when I last spoke to her a few days ago and I asked her how she was, she said 'oh, not so bad!' which is the best I've heard from her in a long, long time. She's stopped calling my parents in distress every day and she's been making friends and sitting outside. Stuff she never did at home. She would just sit there and sleep. 

But at the moment, there's a COVID case in her care home meaning no visitors and no AC during the UK's heatwave. She called my parents yesterday about not feeling fit enough to go to work and that she was worried about not going to work. She said she felt decrepit and useless. She has a recurring UTI that causes delirium, and the heat may be partly to blame for these thoughts, but she said it's too noisy and she can't cope much longer. My mum suggested that she get up and go to her own room if she wants a bit of peace, but she said she is so decrepit she can't even do that, so my mum changed the subject. At home she was depressed and lonely all the time and had started wandering outside sometimes, and wanted to go home when she lived there too. She's thinking about her old house. 

We can't force her to stay. But she can't live alone. Do you just keep telling them 'give it another week and see how you feel'? It feels so... Unethical. But allowing her to waste away in her house, living off icecream, potentially setting fire to the place is surely worse."
"I was just sitting here, watching tv with my dogs, perfectly content and it occurred to me I could be at Mom's hanging out with her and I got this stab of guilt. But you know what? I just can't continue to feel guilty for everything I'm not doing for/with my mom. I do a lot every day and she has help, she's in the early stages now.  However, she also will suck every scrap of attention that I or anyone will give her. She's always been that way, but it's worse now.  I've spent my whole life stiff-arming my mother to keep her at a distance, but now I have to take care of her and I'm losing my hard won boundaries. It's so hard to figure out when it's the disease making her extra emotional or if she just wants my attention.  I just feel like an asshole all the time. All this would be much easier if we had a better relationship to begin with."
"To make a long question short, does anybody know what causes incorrect memories?  I took my mother (who has Alzheimer's) to a doctor's appt.  The whole time we were out, she over and over again got real angry that my father made her this appointment and made me take her because he did not want to (none of it true).  I can wrap my head around the loss of memory and confusion, but these are just false memories.  I don't know what I am battling here.  Thanks."
I just found out that almost all of my girlfriends family on her mother's side had strokes and alzheimers. Everyone on her dads side has high blood pressure. She already deals with a few mental health issues like depression. If she starts to live a healthier lifestyle and get more sleep (she has super bad insomnia) can she save herself from it? She's in her earlier 20s...
"So it's time. Mom's paranoia and anger has gotten to the point where she can't stay home anymore - she's dangerous to herself and my father. Question - HOW did you get your LO to go into the AL/MC facility? She's aware enough to know exactly what is going to happen once we pull into the parking lot (my aunt was at the AL facility at the same location)? She's going to go in kicking and screaming - hopefully not literally - but any tips or suggestions are welcome.

&#x200B;

\*\*\* UPDATE\*\*\*

Kicking and screaming carried the day. We pulled in to just ""see a doctor here"" and she wasn't having it. She knew exactly where we were and had no intention of going inside. Started screaming, got out of the car, hit me when I started talking to her, and ended up inside with a couple of the nurses with Dad eventually to have coffee. We thought it was going better but she started yelling at everyone and got completely out of control. One of the nurses called it  psychotic episode-like behavior.The doctor there suggested a ride to the ER and placement in a geriatric psych ward so that's where we're at. It was one of the worst days of my life. My father was a champ, and as much as he loves my mother (to the moon and back), he stayed the course. She'll be there 7-10 days then go straight back to the MC facility.  I hate this disease SO MUCH. "
"Illinois. Near Western Chicago Suburbs. My dad will be having an MRI on his brain July 26 and we will discuss the results with a neurologist July 29. I guess a quick first question is, will they tell us anything July 26?

Anyway, my dad had a traumatic brain injury in 1984 in a head on collision. In 2003 he was deemed permanently disabled due to that injury at age 46 so he has a background of brain injury. He is 65 now.

Well his memory has gotten worse but most of all he has been ""acting out."" He hasn't bathed in over 2 months. He took advantage of some dribbling issues he had where he got diapers and now just pees in them 24/7 and has since stopped changing his diapers regularly. He just lays in his pee soaked through his diaper through his pants and it stinks up the whole house as it flows through the air conditioner.

I guess he's manageable now though it's not fun. But one would say that soon he would need a home care aide or an adult day care specializing in memory care. I've read horror stories on reddit about how some patients even entering/in final stage Alzheimer's and are still being denied entry into nursing homes through Medicaid. Is this common?

If he gets really bad I think a nursing home would be preferable. His lifestyle is bedridden at the house. He doesn't get up ever. He just lays in his pee watching TV. Plus, the house is an absolute mess borderline hoarder house. I would feel absolutely horrid if a home care aide had to come into that. His room is just littered in junk and urine. I would love it if he could go to a adult day care for the remainder of his life and get some activity. However, the nearest one with memory care is 14 miles away and no one can drive him. I read on another thread that there might be programs that would be a few bucks to pay for his transportation but I bet it was a lot shorter distance than 28 miles each day. Does anyone know of any? My mom can't take care of him.

That's all I can think of for now. I'm really trying to do what I can with what I've got to keep my family afloat. I'm glad I found this thread.

Edit: As of about an hour after this post he is now pooping in his diapers per my mom..."
"Just want every care taker to know that Yelp will keep images of dementia people who had their picture taken at business without their consent. 

Back story- I found a negative review of my moms biz and in the review there is a photo of my dad suffering from late stage dementia. I kid you not. He is standing tall and looking at the camera. He was not wandering. But he sure as hell did not and could not give consent. 

I reported this reviewer and review but Yelp will not take it down. 

It’s elder abuse and disgusting. He has since passed away and I am doing everything I can to remove this review."
"Hello Reddit. Towards the beginning of 2021 my elderly step father had a sudden violent mental episode which led to a diagnosis of Alzheimer's.  The hospital sent him to a psychiatric facility to recover and then to our local nursing home for rehab. He has Tri-Care insurance and medicare which covers 100 days in a nursing home after a medical problem. During this time my mother has worked with the nursing homes insurance bookkeeper to get him qualified for Medicaid. He financially qualifies, but even after an appeal they claim he doesn’t qualify medically. They say he doesn’t even qualify for at home nursing help. 

This is extremely upsetting as there is no way he can go back home and no way my parents can afford the $6000/month nursing home. He can not take care of himself at all and my mother has serious health problems and can not take care of him either. There is no one else able to care for him. He has military training and got so violent in the hospital it took five people to hold him down and put him in restraints. Knowing this there is no way I could allow him to live with my mother or her pets. At the moment his is staying in the hospital because of a sudden serious health problem, but if he does recover there are only 20 days left of nursing home care covered by his insurance. His Alzheimer's is very serious and  he can’t recognize his own children, thinks his wife is his mother, and has no idea where he is or what is going on. It’s even worse now, because the medication he was on to help with his memory caused extreme side effects that almost killed him. 

We honestly have no idea what to do and my step father never prepared for the future. If he passes my mother can’t even pay their mortgage and would have to sell the house. Should we look into hiring a lawyer? There is a long-term care facility for veterans near us, but I have no idea if they would accept him or how we could pay for that. This situation feels extremely hopeless and we are looking for any advice possible.

Infot:

He is in his mid 80’s

He is a veteran and served in the Vietnam and Korean war

He can do nothing on his own"
"Hi everyone. I wasn't sure where else to post this, but I'm looking for some advice for my grandfather. He has Alzheimer's and whenever he wakes up, either from a nap or sleeping overnight, he says the same thing. ""Where is my wife?"" and ""I want to go back to New Jersey"". He lived in New Jersey 30 years ago before we moved here. He lives with his wife (my grandmother, who is taking care of him) and he will tell her ""I want to see my wife"" and she always insists on telling him that she ***is*** his wife. This confuses him to the point where he threatens to call the police. After a while, he eventually calms down and realizes where he is. I'd just like to know what we could do to possibly calm him down so he doesn't freak out when he wakes up since that when the majority of the confusion happens. My grandmother isn't in the best health either and I want to make sure she doesn't escalate things (she can be pretty impatient with him) because she gets really frustrated when he doesn't know who she is. Any help is immensely appreciated. Thank you.

Edit: Wow. I am blown away with all the support and advice. I am grateful for everyone here. Thank you reddit!"
"Hello, my dad with Alzheimer’s gets confused very late at night and tries to leave the house, looking for his mom (who passed away). When my brother or I try to stop him, he starts being aggressive and yells."
"My dad (55ish) was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s a while back, maybe a half a year or more. I (16) have mostly been left out of the loop in regards to his treatments, what stage he is in, etc. What I’m wondering is if there’s anything in particular that I should look out for as the disease progresses. At the moment my father is kinda independent as he takes care of the animals, drives me places if their not too far, goes shopping by himself sometimes and just last week for example he helped me install an ac unit in my room. In regards to his Alzheimer’s, the only major thing I noticed is him telling me the same joke or story over and over or him forgetting to grab things as he leaves. That being said, I do know that things won’t be like this forever and I’m simply wondering if there are any key things or signs that you guys have noticed as the disease progresses from personal experience that I should look out. I mostly want to know since I can “gauge” how much he is affected and so I can know when to take more responsibility in the household per say if that makes sense. Thanks in advance for any tips"
"My husband is in denial when it comes to his mother's declining health. She is increasingly paranoid, blaming her home care attendants for everything from stealing from her (they aren't) to trying to kill her (if her food is even slightly spicy). Her health really took a turn over the last year due to severe isolation (due to COVID - she's in NYC where everything was shut down). My husband will procrastinate so I am trying to take a proactive role in getting her ready to be moved from NY to FL now, that way everything is lined up when we actually need to do it. 

My proposed questions for him to ask her case manager are below. Are there other questions I should be asking?

Thank you in advance. This is not a fund club to be in, but I appreciate your wisdom and insight.

"My grandpa has had Alzheimer’s for a few years now. He is in the late stages where he can barely speak, is bed ridden, and barely eats. After some very painful months of trying to get him in the right home, we currently have him in the hospital while we finalize our plans for him. It has gotten really bad and it’s just devastating in every way imaginable. I’m only 19 so I’ve never experienced anything like this before. It’s so painful and this whole situation makes me cry so much. I love my grandpa and I’ve been visiting him as much as I can. I don’t really know what the point of this post is, I just wanted to vent to people who I know have also dealt with what I’m feeling. Alzheimer’s is an evil, cruel, and awful disease."
"I'm 35 and my mom will be 71 in August. My dad died when I was in high school. Both myself and my sibling live several hours away. How can we care for her?

I'm not sure how I'm going to handle all of this. I'm terrified my mom could get awful care unless I supplement with my own income, but at such a young age I just don't have any money."
This is a shit post. Mom(71) with AZ and she calls me 3-7 times every day. Asking where my dad is. He died 5 months ago. So I’m basically living  in this Groundhog Day hell of letting my mom know every day her husband of 50 years died 5 months ago. I just need to vent. I love this sub because I’ve learned so much.
"hey everyone, i’m 21 and am living at home for the summer with my Mom who is 63 and has early onset. she also has a few other health issues and is currently in a boot for a broken foot. oftentimes she goes on tangents about how damaged of a person she is, how she has so many ailments in her life, and wants to put herself out of her misery. her punch line “pain is my best friend.” i have no idea how to respond to these comments, so i stay silent and let her ramble. it makes me so sad. i’m wondering how anyone here copes with hearing this rhetoric from those you know affected, if at all?"
"My MIL was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. It started slowly. She couldn't find her words.

Then, she drove alone. Passed a bunch of stop signs and caused an accident. She went from being a perfect driver to, not so much.

Now she can't form full sentences. No one understands what she's saying. She doesn't recognize anyone. 

My FIL is a bit in denial. He agreed to revoke her license and sell her car only last month. 

One thing my husband's family and myself don't understand is the aggressivity.

My brother in law has a small dog. And sometimes she will harass the dog until he gets angry and then slap the dog.

Or, the other day. My SIL was showing my MIL their new patio.

Don't remember exactly the words but she didn't believe it was built recently and then yelled F YOU and flipped everyone out of nowhere. 

Can someone explain the aggressivity they feel?"
"Something we all hope for, though just wondering if there are any known instances of anyone recovering from Alzheimer's?"
"I’m sure situations identical to mine have been posted 1000x so I apologize in advance but I can’t read through any more posts right now. 

I need to know what to do next. 

Mom is 71. Her memory has been declining for last last few years, which could of course be attributed to age. However, she has two sisters (so far) who’ve been diagnosed; one with early onset whose condition deteriorated drastically and the other who isn’t far behind. 

It’s at the point now where mom doesn’t remember things we talked about two days ago. She’ll call the dog the wrong name, forget the state I’m moving to, etc. I don’t live nearby so I can’t speak to the day to day ‘signs.’ 

I haven’t discussed this with her husband yet, which I know is probably step one. Im just concerned he’s going to say something to her which would be a disaster I’m not ready for yet. 

Among my many concerns I’m sure you all can identify with, there are logistical and financial concerns I’m thinking about. My stepdad is doing well, but fighting stage 4 cancer. As anyone dealing with cancer knows, “good news” lasts three months, until the next appointment. If something happens to him or his health declines, and she needs care within the next 1..3..5… years, I am completely unprepared. Should I be looking into a LTC policy? Is that even a possibility? Am I wrong to think I should be talking to my stepdad first? Should I look into counseling or a support group that might help with navigating the conversation with her? 

Many thanks."
"Has anyone else had issues with their family member thinking their reflection is a different person? My dad has apparently started talking to his reflection as if it is a guest in the house. My brother said he was asking if the reflection needed to be fed. He doesn't seem scared of it like an intruder, just something interesting. I'm assuming he probably thinks of himself as younger than what he sees."
"this is just going to be one big vent session, be warned if you're not in the mood


my mom is 54 and recently has been diagnosed with alzheimer's, she remains positive about the whole thing but i can't stop thinking about the rest of her life and where we go from here

i'm 18 years old, i'm going to college next semester but my dad is working a lot in order to pay for my college and for treatment and for college 

i recently was unable to return to a job i was previously employed at bc i was late to turning in the papers and someone else had done it, and the other job i'm working at is slowly putting me on the schedule less,b bc so i'm currently making no money from that job, i could look for another job but i'd only be able to work until august 17th (when i leave for school)

my mom is the kindest woman ever and doesnt have a single mean bone in her body, it's heartbreaking to see her fall subject to such a terrible disease

ive also been thinking a lot about my future, i've got a 50/50 chance of developing alzheimer's myself, and i'm terrified that i'm setting myself up for a lonely future. yku see i dont plan on marrying at the moment and i don't want kids either. i'm unsure who i'll lean on if i have the gene

i need to get a gene test to see if i have alzheimer's"
"Hi all,

Dad has moderate early onset Alzheimer’s. Haven’t seen much in this group about aducanumab. I know that it doesn’t have scientific backing. Still wondering, has anyone started looking into it with insurance? Is anyone thinking to try it? Thoughts or experiences? I just want to gauge where this community is at."
"My grandfather was diagnosed with a rare strain of Alzheimer's about 7-8 years ago, that was so rare he was legally required to inform his offspring of his condition so they could get genetic testing to see if they also carried the gene.

I did a genome test about a year ago and found out that not only did I inherit the gene maternally, but I also carry two other variants of the Alzheimer's gene  from my father's side. So, in total I have 4 active genome variants of Alzheimer's.

&#x200B;

Yesterday I found out that my Grandfather has been moved into hospice care, and I love him with my whole heart but the idea of seeing him (he lives across the country) terrifies me because it feels like I'm looking at my ""not too far off future""

&#x200B;

Has anyone else had to overcome this, how did you get through it?"
"My mom suffered through the pandemic solo taking care of my moderately affected dad and needed respite. So she dropped him off at my house under the guise of us “needing his help” with some projects and took off with friends. Here’s what I learned from it, and I hope it’s helpful:

1. We tried to keep busy. I knew he’d be out of his element and easily agitated with my mom gone. Every day we had either a small project to work on or a simple outing planned. 
2. We made sure to keep all car keys tucked away in case he got riled up. 
3. I allowed him to help me around the house and our farm. He was an engineer and loves to tinker. Even if it was something simple, like easy manual labor, he very much enjoyed feeling useful. Sometimes I had to go behind and fix things but that’s ok. 
4. He insisted on buying things for himself and has the money, but struggles with his card. I allowed him to make small purchases but helped him at self checkout. I also had to ask my mom for his pin as he couldn’t remember. It’s a point of pride for him and I didn’t want to deny him that. 
5. Alcohol is a problem. He wants to drink more than he ever has, and he doesn’t have an off switch. Instead of a nightly battle, I left a small amount of low alcohol beverages accessible to him. When we were out, I just explained I’d get more the next day. This really helped mitigate his symptoms. 
6. We gathered his wallet, phone, and reading glasses each night and put them on the night stand. Sometimes they were hard to find but I could ping his phone and things would usually be together. I had extra reading glasses tucked away if his got permanently lost. 
7. We stayed patient and calm with all our might. I reminded him to take a shower and asked if I could wash his clothes. I counted to ten when he asked the same things over and over. He needed more help in public spaces than I anticipated but usually accepted my assistance as long as I could get him on my side. 

I hope this helps someone. It was better than I expected and I’m sure I’ll have to adjust my strategy as he progresses. Good luck everyone."
"Unfortunately the time has come to move my mother into a Memory Care facility. We're moving slowly, getting some furniture, etc delivered.

"My dad died of mixed Alzheimer's/vascular dementia last August.  The following is something I wrote in honor of the first Father's Day after his passing.  I hope this is acceptable to share in this sub; it's part of my own personal processing of his passing.  Please take this in the spirit in which it's intended.
===
One day, when my daughter was two years old, our cat went missing.  We looked all over the house and didn't find her.  We walked out our front door, and didn't see her immediately.  But very soon we heard her meowing. I looked over towards the direction of the sound, and saw her - she had managed to get herself trapped on our neighbor's roof. I have no idea how she got up there, but you know how cats are. Cats have access to some form of unearthly magic that us mere mortals can only imagine.
But there she was; the magic she'd used to get herself on the roof was not enough to get her back down. My neighbors were not home, but I noticed they had a ladder set up against their garage door. So I borrowed it, set it up and started climbing to rescue the cat.

My daughter, however, was immediately scared on my behalf, in this dangerous situation she felt that I was in.  In her most terrified two-year-old voice, she shouted up to me, ""WATCH OUT, DADDY!""

It took just a moment; I was at the top of the ladder, the cat jumped down onto my shoulder and together we climbed our way back down to solid ground.  My daughter was immediately relieved, and spoke to herself in her most self-satisfied voice:  ""I Saved Daddy!""

Now my daughter is thirteen, and like any teenager the best thing I can do for her as her father is simply to exist in a different room from her. I'm told that's normal. I remember being thirteen and having the same attitude about my own parents.

But today is Father's Day, and in my case it's the first Father's Day since my father passed on. So that's a thing that I get to process today.

I actually never lived with my father growing up. My parents divorced when I was two years old and for most of my life my dad lived several hours, or sometimes several states, away from me. But I would visit a couple of times a year.  When I was younger he lived on an eight-acre property outside of a small Midwestern town.  Whenever I would visit we would alternate nights between shooting off the illegal fireworks he'd acquired from another state, or setting up his back yard telescope to look at whatever planets were in view that night. Through those evenings I saw the moons of Jupiter and the rings of Saturn.

When I was ten he gave me the Universe.  When I was 21 he gave me a job.  By this time through his job he had survived a spinoff and a buyout, and he'd moved states a couple of times, and I accepted a summer college internship at his high-rise company in a major Southern city's downtown area.  It was my first grown-up job and I was impressed and inspired by his big-box corporate office. How many other 21-year-olds have the opportunity to land a summer job on the 35th Floor of a high-rise?

But then the summer ended, I came back to my home state to finish college, then went off to do some other things in other countries for a while. By the time I was 27 I landed in what would become my own career-defining job.  I've also survived a merger, a reorg, a Covid furlough and two rounds of layoffs, but here I still am. I like to believe I have his example to thank for my own longevity at work.

From my dad I inherited his taste in music; his taste in television; his sense of humor (sorry about that), but most especially his work ethic. And for that I'm grateful.

Last August he climbed his final ladder, the one he can't climb down from anymore. I can't save him, but I've come to the conclusion that maybe, just this time, he's the one who saved me.

Happy Father's Day. May you be well."
"Mom is the main caregiver for Dad, and she has hit the “I’m tired” and frustrated phase. He has progressed to the upper tier of the moderate progression of this course over the last 18 months. 

She comes from a childhood of poverty, and therefore has a mindset that there is never enough money for X,Y, or Z. However, my sister and I are fully aware that they have a net worth of over a million. Mom is reluctant to spend more than a day’s worth of having him at a local facility so she can catch a break or catch up on needed responsibilities, which is $175. 

I am concerned that she might act out in frustration toward him or simply burn out in the process of caregiving. She is also highly persnickety about people coming into the home. 

Mom and Dad are retired RNs, so this also makes the overall dynamic more stressful. I want what is best for them, but also know she is being stubborn to a certain degree. 

What is the true cost for full-time assisted living per month? My sister and I have talked, and we would have him in a decent facility in the event Mom somehow passed first."
"I need some advice. My mother is in a care facility in Louisiana where my three brothers live. I live in North Carolina. Due to my husband’s job, we can’t move. Each flight down with car rental and flight is very expensive so I fly down once a year. My mother desperately needs interaction. I can’t move her to NC due to financial reasons. I need to stay connected to her. Phone calls are not productive because she just hangs up. Any ideas on staying connected long distance."
"Hi peeps. 
Tl:dr 
mother getting worse, brother angry and in denial, we're pretty much the only people who are in contact with her. 

Mostly read in this sub so far, it helps me feel less isolated and guilty. 
I don't think I use the proper terms for everything, excuse that and please correct me if anything is offensive to you. 

Mother has alcohol related dementia(Korsakoff), since about 3 years ago. 

My brother became her legal guardian during her getting the diagnosis. 

Mom isolates herself completely from everyone. Brother only sees her for doctors appointments and to sort out finances and practical things. Understandable, it's just that the rest, as in her seeing anybody at all, falls on me. 
My parents are divorced so dad involves himself as little as he can with mom.
My friends are supportive but aren't going through this.


I'd been worried about her drinking problem for about 15 years before that, 
talked to family and friends of family since I was concerned but was told they didn't want to hear about it, and to not be so dramatic. 

Distanced myself for a while from brother as we didn't have a great relationship. 

It's like I'm back there now. 
Her dementia has progressed rapidly since Covid, and when I've been with her and she's driving, it's been pretty scary! 
Speeding when she ""feels like it"" as she says, and generally not following laws/rules as one should, and she previously has. 

So when her yearly test came up, I was a little relieved as her continuing to drive seemed dangerous. 

Got the results this week and they said she shouldn't drive anymore. Brother got VERY angry. 
He called to yell at the doctor as he thought them being rude stressed her out and made her fail. 

He's going to appeal. 
When he's previously said she doesn't need any help and isn't getting worse, I've suggested help that doesn't cost money as her house is a mess and she's just so isolated. 
Plus I've figured she will have to get used to having help as it will soon be a necessity, and better to get used to it now so she won't be so angry or shocked and scared when it's inevitable. 

He just gets angry and tells me if I don't agree with him I can do whatever the f*** I want. 
He gets angry with mom too, when she forgets things¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Juuuust a lot of extra strain, aggressive behaviour 
, work that seems unnecessary and very counter productive to me. 

Sorry for wall of text. Don't think there's much of a ""solution"". My brother is handling this his way and I can't change that. 
Just can't help but feel like this could be so much easier for him me AND mom if he didn't act affronted any time someone acknowledges the reality."
"Sorry for the length, needed a place to clear my mind.

Short history: mum has alzheimers and broke her hip in december. She is relatively young (just turned 70) and still remebers quite a lot. She will ask the same question 10 times, but does remember that I am job hunting.
At home, she didn't eat, didnt clean and fell often.
In the rehabilitation place, she found it hard to find her room

So we decided the best place was memory care.

Now they are telling me, she's too well. She doesnt have a connection with the other residents, because they are a lot more forgetful than she. And she is very independent.

I'm at a loss to what I should do. They say a different kind of care facility might be better, but I know if they give her too much independence, she will stop eating again and go back to her old ways. Also I'm not convinced she'll find her way back if she gets the freedom to leave the building.

The place she's at now is great. They take good care of the residents. Do fun stuff with them. Mums been there since march, and I can tell she's becoming less happy there. Thinking she can go home soon. (I told her once she can't. She was sad for the remainder of the day, but 2 days later she didn't remember)

I really don't know what the next step should be."
"My (57F) mam has always suffered from “Brain Fog” as she calls it. Forgets things easily, has trouble following instructions or just generally listening to people.

Lately it’s gotten worse,the other day she called me asking me how to buy groceries online (we’re all close contacts and isolating). We had a chat and I asked her to do something and get back to me.

She rings me 20 minutes later asking me if she called me..and if she did what did I say to her. It took all my strength not to cry.

She said my brother was annoyed at her for not remembering and she started crying. I don’t blame him, I get incredibly frustrated with her as well sometimes, even though I know it’s not her fault, it’s just so hard to see her so unable to perform basic tasks.

Anyway the memory loss and general confusion is getting worse, and I’m afraid if we don’t do something about it soon and there is a  real problem, it will only get worse when we could try and catch it early.

Everyone in my family seems to be in denial, they know she has problems but there’s clear signs of an underlying problem but they keep ignoring it, no one will take action and she won’t do it herself.

I’m only 23, no job currently and I don’t drive. There’s only so much I can do to get the ball rolling

I just need some advice on the best way to encourage someone to get help, while keeping a sensitive attitude as I’m sure this is very upsetting for my mam, and just the best way to get her checked out.

Thank you so much in advance for any help/advice"
Today my grandma (74) tried to leave for her mother's house. Luckily we do not have a car for her to take but she has gotten used to walking everywhere. She tried to leave and I tried everything I could think of to get her off that track. I ended up standing in her way and she hit. I can't believe she hit me. I know it's the disease but I never thought she'd get violent. It's just all too much
"Just that for now.  I don’t post much here (mainly comment) but I do have to post later about my mom in care.  We just moved her to another place (long story) but it is great.  She is a bit melancholy again today, and it breaks my heart.  ❤️‍🩹

Edit"
"Please please please I am seeking for help!!!  
My grandma is 97 and she's been dealing with alzheimer's for a while now, bur her aggressiveness has been taking a toll on my mom's mental and physical health and mine too because we are the ones taking care of her. We are a bit short on money so getting a therapist or taking her to a nursing home are not viable options.  
I know, I know ""it's the disease talking"" but that isn't enough to help the issue.I'd be so so so grateful if you guys could give me some advice, please."
"My father just called me concerned about my mother. He mentioned that in the last 6 months, he's noticed some driving issues with her. The main one is not taking her foot off the gas when shes parked. He said it's like she doesn't even notice that she's doing it and he's had to physically pull her leg up off the petal because even when he tells her to take her foot off, she doesn't seem to clue in to what she's doing.  

She is in remission from cancer and recently had a head CT with no concerns in that department but he was still concerned. Especially because he doesn't always drive with her, so he can't say if it's something that happens more often than he sees. My grandfather had dementia but, I'll admit I don't know a whole lot about it. When my father called, it was sort of the first place my mind went. Could this be an early sign?"
"We are checking my dad into memory care the first week of September. Mom has asked me to figure out how best to mark his clothes, sheets, etc. for the laundry. She had friends tell her to order iron-on labels. But she said dad doesn't like itchy tags. After looking online, it seems some are saying to use a Sharpie; mom is worried it will seep through his clothes and show on the outside.

Can anyone offer some advice on marking dad's things in a way that isn't uncomfortable, stays legible, and doesn't look sloppy? Thanks so much!"
"My father-in-law was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's last year.  He turned 60 in April.  He has four children, but me and my husband are the only ones who are trying to help him as he has no savings, retirement, or way to work.  

We're trying to move him from AZ to CA (where we live) but not sure how to house him.  Assisted living is thousands of $$$ out of our reach.  He gets $1900 from disability and me and my husband are struggling to make ends meet ourselves.  

Any advice on housing credits or federal assistance?  We think he'll just have to live with us for the time being.  He's an awful human, which is why the other kids won't help, so not an ideal situation but probably the only fiscally sound one.  

Was just wondering if anyone could share advice/their experience/anything helpful.  

Thank you!  

Tl;Dr
Need advice on how to house early onset Alzheimer's man who makes $1900 a month in CA."
"Hi there, I'm the adult daughter of two 80+ parents, one with Alzheimer's, who have been paying into CalPERS LTCG (long term care) for over 20 years. There's a class action lawsuit going on against the entity (it's run by the state of California). We're starting to get to the point with my mother where I think we'll need to start ""using"" the insurance soon, and have some help come into the house.

I'm totally uncertain as to how that process works, and how to interact with them, given their current legal status and the few interactions I've had so far. They aren't accepting new enrollment (this is the message that pops up everywhere on their site: CalPERS has suspended open enrollment due to current uncertainty in the long-term care market and is no longer accepting applications), and their website managers are very evasive as to why we haven't been able to log in for weeks.

I'm thinking there must be a more specific subReddit somewhere for folks who have that form of insurance ... anyone have any guidance to offer?"
"Could really use any kind of help/advice here.  I'll try to condense the backstory as much as possible.  My (40m) mother (70f), had been diagnosed with dementia/short-term memory loss a few years ago.  Up until a few months ago it was nothing more than her repeating herself quite a bit.  

Starting in February of 2021 she went to the ER with pain in her lower abdomen.  It was diagnosed as a UTI.  Cut to 4 months later. It was not a UTI, and since then she has had almost every test imaginable. CT scans, colonoscopy, urinary scope, gynological exams and utrasounds, etc, etc.  All the tests come back negative and the variety of specialists we have seen really don't have any answers.  She has been put on a variety of different meds in hopes that one might do the trick (overactive bladder, IBS meds, antibiotics). 

Every 24 to 48 hours she is in severe pain and wants to go to the ER or urgent care.  She has been many, many times and although I think part of her knows there is nothing they can do, in her mind if you are in pain that is what you do.  

Obviously, this whole thing has been really hard on the whole family.  To make matters worse her primary doctor was pretty terrible, And they are switching to a new one this week.  I know with dementia it can be very difficult for people to explain exactly what is happening with their body.  She has a follow-up appointment with a neurology center in August.  

I probably left quite a bit out, but that is the general idea of what is going on."
"While i was living in Oregon, I surprised my dad with a trip to visit me. When I say I surprised him I mean, I repeatedly asked him to visit and he made so many excuses I ended up buying him a ticket and telling him to just show up at the airport.

Knowing what I know now about dementia, I think the problem was that he didn't know how to purchase a ticket on his own anymore. He didn't want to admit he needed help. 

When he got to Portland, he was excited to visit Cannon Beach, so we took the 1.5-mile drive down to the coast. When we arrived, my father stepped out of the car, looked at the beach, and got back in the car--he was ready to go. No explanation. And there was nothing I could say to convince him to stay longer. 

On the way back home, I stopped in front of giant logs on the side of the road and made my dad pose for a picture. He pretended to be a bear.

"Sorry, but I really need to get some things off of my chest and I feel as if this is the only place I can. Just yesterday my grandfather has officially been diagnosed with Alzheimers. My family has been seeing his decline over the past year or so, and it's been really hard to deal with. I've been close with him my whole life, and it really hurts just to think about. It's gotten to the point where he still expects me to get dropped off by the bus after school, even though that stopped happening about 8 months ago. Having to see a loved one go through this is in my opinion worse than death, and I really wouldn't wish this pain upon anyone. I try to call him as much as I can, but he just forgets I ever did every single time, and it makes me feel even worse. Again, im sorry but I just really needed to get this off of my chest."
"There are published papers in PubMed saying that CBD and THC might help Alzheimer's patients. My mom's pcp is fully supportive of CBD for her agitation, but I didn't ask about THC. Has anyone looked into this or tried for a loved one suffering from this awful disease?"
"Biogen and Lilly may be first to market, BUT, and this is a big BUT, it does not mean that doctors will prescribe their drugs versus Cassava's treatment when it is approved. I strongly feel that their side effects and costs will be a negative and that Cassava will be the medical choice for both patients, their families and doctors."
"My husband asked me this evening about his mom's strange behaviors. (He is staying with her while his sister is out of town this week) He said she will go to bed when he does and stay in bed until she hears him get up. She seems to be copying things he does in general -- not eating if he doesn't, going to the bathroom right after him, getting a drink when he does, etc. This is a new behavior just since we were there at Memorial Day. I told him it makes sense to me, and that between that and her not being able to read directions on a box of corn dogs & not knowing what she can make for dinner, it really sounds like she is at the point where she can't be living on her own. Am I making an accurate assessment? I only know of Alzheimer's/dementia though watching my aunt and uncle tend to my grandparents before they passed a few years ago, but in my husband's eyes that makes me an expert!"

"My mother who has early stage dementia is often in the hospital for 3-5 days with heart or kidney issues.

About 50% of the time she gets really really scared and nervous when I have to leave at night.  I am here caregiver at home and live with her.  The nurses usually understand but any suggestions on how to help her relax ?  

She has tried Ativan which sometimes works.  It seems like she has sun downing but some nights in hospital are fine others are really hard for her. 

Thanks!"
"Hello All,  

I am trying to determine the best way to try to negotiate prices with assisted living homes and their crazy prices.  

I talked to one and they did say price was negotiable.  I was thinking about throwing $1,000 lower prices on the ones I do not want to send my mom to get some practice.  

Any thoughts out there or tips??

Thanks 🙏!!!!"
"Just had to deal this recently. Dad decided to cut wood in the heat of the day wearing a heavy shirt. Before we knew it, he had come inside and near-about. Managed to hydrate him and get his electrolyte levels back up.

With summer upon us, remember to watch exertion levels and encourage or prioritize water and electrolyte, especially sodium."
"These are not my Words. My Wife Wrote This.

It's an uncomfortable and tender feeling being the daughter of a woman who has Alzheimer's. 

She is blissfully and sometimes unblissfully living in a different time and age. A time I didnt exist maybe, or maybe her young mother days. It could be four years back, I'll never know.

She herself is child like now, has developed a sweet tooth and the telltale bluntness that I've heard accompanies Alzheimer's, hurts you when you least expect it. I remind myself that's not Cathy, that Al. Fuck you, Al.

Today my mum asked me who I was very casually in the back isle of the discount store. She scoffed at my answer as if i was lying yet eagerly followed me. And i didn't know what to say to her. So I told her I was her friend. Which is true. But quietly, the Bargin-mania had become the backdrop to my sorrow.

I feel guilty and werid mourning my mums personality and her ways, while she is still here physically and giving that winning Cathy Barry smile. She truley is crucial to the whole damn operation. Responsible for so many planted seeds in my life.

I just fucking miss her. HER her. And I wish she understood that.

I don't share about this often,  but today, instead if going inwards and into the darkness, this short essay of my feelings seems correct."
"Write-up from the *NYTimes*:   https://archive.is/gfhTg

Academic article from the *Journal of the American Medical Association*:  https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2775218"
"Our family is me (37F, single, not married, no kid’s) my father 74, and my mom 74 with dementia. 

Father’s Day weekend I snapped on my mother’s dementia. I got pushed and pushed and I couldn’t take it anymore. 

Here is some background: 

I’ve live the beach house my parents own. It had been a rental for about 30 years, until 2016 when my parents stopped renting it because they could no longer handle the responsibility in their older age. I moved into the house in 2017.

I was never a big part of this house until I became unemployed in my career due to mental health reasons. I was able to stay in this house for free which was very generous of them and I am incredibly grateful. It became obvious my mother is a hoarder who had been storing trash and furniture for years in this house. 

The property is in a resort area with million dollar houses all around. When I moved in the property was neglected like something you would see on the show Hoarders. full of trash, debris, broken lights inside, dirty refrigerator, fallen tree limbs, vines everywhere, insect infested. 

As a way to pay for my stay, I’ve renovated the house. By myself. I learned to do electrical, plumbing, painting, house repairs, landscaping, etc by watching YouTube videos. 

There were …FIVE… 1-800-GotJunk trucks that I hired and hauled away literal TONS of trash. I used some of my own savings, money I collected, and my parents money they gave me for this purpose to renovate. 

Fast forward to this past weekend: my parents came to visit for the first time in many months. It was going to be the big reveal so I was really excited for them to see the changes I had made and enjoy their fresh newly updated property with me. 

I guess my problem is that I forget my mother with dementia is not the person I want her to be….kind loving enthusiastic fun and reliable. 

Instead, she has dementia .

Before she got sick, she only parented me until about 12. She was rude, disagreeable, argumentative, cold emotionally, and never got counseling or therapy.  She is now the original woman - not very nice or easy to love - who now has dementia. 

That’s reality. 

It’s been hard for my dad and I. I hold a lot of resentment towards her now. As an adult I came to see my reality as a child for what it actually was, and find it impossible to imagine myself ever treating my own children the way she treated me. 


Dementia in my mother… is severe paranoia, aggression, instability, unpredictability, forgetfulness, sun downing, repetitive negative thinking patterns, irritability, flight of ideas, falling, and non-regular sleeping patterns.  She does however still have a lot of capability. She can make her and my father dinner every night, write checks to pay her mortgage, call people, feed her cat, use FaceTime, mow the lawn, drive to the airport.   

So it had become really difficult for me to determine where my mothers personality ends and the dementia begins. It’s like a slow fade out process. Every six months she has a steep decline. Then will stable out for a while then decline rapidly again. The frustrating part is in between she can function to a degree due to day but she has become a disagreeable mean and aggressive paranoid person. 

I feel like a monster for my wavering ability to tolerate her and remind myself that she does not have control over the physiological process her brain is going through. 

On Sunday night we had a fight, then made up, then fought again, then made up all in the span of about two hours. I should have known better not to engage with her at night.  She has sun downing but also gets more aggressive and irritable and violent at night. I had been drinking some wine to cope with the stress of them being there.  

All of a sudden - mid conversation about some trash I found while excavating the beach house backyard - it was like a switch in her brain flipped.   

She started telling me that I lied to her and that she doesn’t trust anything I say and that I hate her and that I think she is an awful person …and on and on. She got in my face yelling, her expression twisted up with anger and aggression. 

And I snapped. 

I screamed at her that I hated her and she was ungrateful. I pushed her back away from me. She got scared and called for my dad. I Threw and smashed a wine glass on the floor in front of her, and chucked a pillow and water bottle. She was startled. 

I took a step back from her, realized what I did, tried to slow down my heart rate and decrease the adrenaline in my body. I burst into crying. I removed myself from her. Went into my bedroom, sat on the bed crying uncontrollably. Then called 911. 

I scared myself. I told them it wasn’t an emergency but I just couldn’t do this anymore and I wanted the police to come to the house. 

I guess it was to protect her from me snd me from myself. They asked if I had been drinking? I said yes. They asked if I was on drugs? I told them no. They asked if I had any weapons in the house? I said no I’ve never owned a gun and no weapons. They asked if I was around my mother? I told them no I separated myself from her.  

Within a few mins there were two cop cars outside my house with two female officers. I talked to one in my bedroom and explained what had happened. I told them I scared her. I pushed her away from me. I told her she has dementia and I snapped. I lost it and I couldn’t do it anymore and I wanted to be away from her. 

They ended up bringing me to a motel in town with my dog. I brought my pillow and a blanket, some pajamas, dog food, dog leash and some treats, my toothbrush and contacts case. The motel was right down the street, but just being away from my mother made me feel horrible and relieved…all at the same time. I eventually passed out in the motel room. Woke up, made sure my father and mother were on the road back to their home and I got an Uber back to the beach house. 

Now I’m writing this because I feel like a monster and I needed to get it out of me. It’s traumatic and every time my mother has visited me here in this beach house in the past couple years before this, something has always happened. She locked us out of the house once, got lost in a beach parking lot, started an argument with a random woman in a park I took her to.  The list goes on.   I feel like a monster saying this, but I really hate her. I hate her dementia.  But I also don’t like the woman she was before the dementia so it makes it even harder for me to tolerate her now.   I don’t know what I’m going to do.   
I do have a therapist appointment , a woman I used to see who happens to work with families of people with Alzheimer’s . She has some really good insight and made me feel less alone. 

Thank you for reading this if you got to the end. I hope I’m not a bad person. I don’t think I am. I am in the medical field and I love helping my patients and caring for people. It’s what brings my life meaning and purpose and I love my job (when I’m not unemployed in my career field). But when it comes to my own mother and her mean and aggressive behavior with dementia and our past mother daughter relationship…..I feel evil and bad for not being more understanding. I feel awful about myself and don’t want her to be in my life like this."

"Hi everyone-

I'm posting this here as well in hopes of getting as many opinions as possible.

My Papa (mom's stepdad) is quickly deteriorating into the grips of dementia. It's very sad to see. He has two labrador retrievers. They are both 11 years old, overweight, and arthritic. Papa does not want to pay for the medication that could help them live more comfortably (arthritis meds), nor does he want to pay for diagnostic visits when they get sick (this was a recent occurrence with one of the dogs), nor does he want to pay for euthanasia (I do not believe either of them need to be euthanized).

I suspect he is overfeeding them, forgetting to let them out (they are having accidents in the house), and giving them table scraps. The other day, he forgot he only had 2 dogs and thought he lost one when he let them outside (thought he had 3).

My husband and I have a farm with tons of space. We have offered to take the dogs in. My mom attempted to have this conversation with Papa, but from what I understand that didn't go very well and Papa got angry about it. However, the other day when one of the dogs was ""ill"", he asked Mom if we were still open to taking them. Apparently, in his dementia-riddle mind, we can have them if they are sick, but not if they are healthy (or as healthy as they're gonna get at this point).

I explain all of this to say: I feel he shouldn't be the caregiver of these animals anymore. But I also don't know how to go about getting them out of his care. Does anyone have any advice for how to do this? Or am I way off base?

Thank you in advance."
hey yall. around my early teens my grandma had begun showing signs of dementia around the time she was trying to become a us citizen. after a while my entire immediate family saw what was coming. at this particular moment she no longer consistently remembers me or my brother's name. in short i feel as if one of the people who raised me and gave me a lot has been subject to fate much worse than death. this has been difficult to process and take for obvious reasons as its like watching a death in slow motion and i wanted to just rant about it SOMEWHERE.
My 87 y/o Mom w/mixed Dementia has started sleeping about 19 hours a day. She does have a mild cold but the sleeping started just before the cold. Should I let her sleep? Should I try to keep her up? Is this end stage? Anyone experience this with their loved one?
"My mom has recently started getting up in the middle of night (3 or 4am is my best guess) to try and walk 'home'. My dad and I are starting to get worried because the same police officers keep finding her and walking her back, and at some point they might call in APS and they'll take her.

I've read a bit about disguising the door and installing extra locks, but I was wondering if anyone's had success with other methods?"
"So my dad is 75, diagnosed with general dementia about 3 years ago. He has recently regressed where his iPhone is too difficult for him. I've done my best to remove most of the apps and turn on various accessibility features.  However, he still manages to turn on airplane mode, turn off the volume, turn on do not disturb mode, etc. Today, he's officially ""lost"" his phone, aka he hid it somewhere in his paranoia and is now saying it never worked 🙄. I really wanted a phone that I could dumb down for him, and found this:

https://www.razmobility.com/solutions/memory-cellphone/?ref=9

Honestly, I'm so happy I found this! It gives me the power via a laptop to control his view and settings, while still allowing him to be independent. 

Has anyone used this phone before?"

"Hi everyone!

There is a new helpline for a pre-bereavement charity in the UK which I think could be really helpful for anyone in need of a little extra support surrounding terminal illness/end of life.

The Anne Robson trust give support to anyone facing the end of their own life (if you're terminally ill yourself), people dealing with the upcoming death of a loved one (terminally ill family members), and also people who work in environments with people who are dying/at the end of life (nurses and care staff for example).

They'll talk through anything and everything surrounding dying, and I think they're particularly useful for those moments where you're struggling to cope and you just need to talk through your feelings with someone who will listen (and help you find ways of coping with your specific situation, if that's what you need).

Taken from their website: **""The helpline number is 0808 801 0688. The service is confidential, free to call, and operates Monday to Friday between 12 – 6pm""**

Their website has more info: [www.annerobsontrust.org.uk](https://www.annerobsontrust.org.uk)

I hope that this might help someone who needs it!

Sending lots of love to anyone who's struggling,

"So I'm looking for advice, I am fairly unexperienced with dementia and alzheimers and I have just accepted a job as a chaplain in a hospital, 20% of my time will be spent in a seniors home that is attached to the hospital. Most of the seniors home residents have varying stages of dementia.

I only start the job in a few weeks so I am trying to gather resources while I have some free time. I am finding a lot of research on music and using familiar music to help seniors engage, I do play guitar a bit so I am planning on maybe learning a few old hymns and stuff like that (the seniors home is in a small bible belt town).

What are some things you've learned about this disease that would be helpful for a caregiver?"
"My mother is 91, with Alzheimer's. We've never had any easy or close relationship. Last week my dad, her husband of 70 years died. 

While I was crying (at the palliative care when he died) and holding her she said that my grief and feelings didn't matter, only hers mattered. A lot of other unkind things as well.

Last month she flat out said I was a mistake, not even an accident.

All of it rings true. She would have been happier without children and she stopped parenting me when I was 7. 

Is it the Alzheimer's speaking or has the Alzheimer's just removed her filters and releasing her true feelings?

It hurts so much."

Right now we're trying to get them to accept in home care. They live at a facility that allows residents to move from their condos into assisted living and their nursing home facility. They wish to stay in their condo as long as possible.

"Hello,

Im not a member of this comunity but I would like some advise from people who know the desease. My grandpa has Alzheimer and is coming to his final stages. My uncle who visits him regurlaly informed everybody yesterday that he wont have long anymore. Now my father has no bond with him due to my grandpa being a heavy alcoholic most of his life. Since my grandmother past away around 2000 the contact has gotten less and less. For me to because he was always drunk and not really gave us any love. 

When my son was born I visited him with my dad in the nursery home and that was okay. He was nice and not drunk for the first time in my life. My dad moved to Portugal soon after and I haven't visited him on my own. Before my dad left he gave me a present from my grandpa. It was a little wooden house that I used to play with at my grandparents house when my grandmother was still alive. I didnt even know he still had it or that he knew it was something I would like to have. It made me very emotional cuz it made me feel like maybe he did pay some attention when I was a kid. At first I wasn't able to visit do to COVID and then because of having no transport to the home. Maybe I also didnt feel like putting in much effort beacause I already have other things Im in therapy for.

Now I feel like I should visit him and pay my last respect to him. I dont want him to die knowing I didn't visit him. That leads to my question. Will he know? Will he know I did not come and say goodbye? My uncle says he does have some clear moments. Plus I also believe that when you die your soul gets released. (I dont what I believe what happens with it after that tho). So Im really torn. Im also afraid it will be a unplessand experience for myself since now I will only remember that one nice last visit and the gift he gave me. I dont know what to expect... 

Please share your wisdom and advise."
"My grandma is in mid-late stage Alzheimer’s, and is mostly bed bound. My mom and aunt take care of her. I’m a 20 year old college student, and I avoid being around her a lot because it’s heartbreaking to see her suffering. Part of me wishes she would pass now, because ‘herself’ is already gone, and I know she’s probably going to suffer like this for years. I feel like a monster for wanting to let her go, or for ‘accepting’ her death. ‘She’ is gone, only her body remains alive. I feel so callous for saying this. I don’t have the natural motherly instinct, I’m not a loving person, I’m very blunt. I don’t know how to care for her. I’m going to hell anyway, I just want to see if anyone else feels the way I do."
"My dad has Alzheimer's and I don't know how I feel.

I'm scared because I don't have kids and am worried when I do, he won't know who I am.  I'm worried that something will happen to him and my mom won't be there when it does.  I'm worried that I haven't said enough to him; I haven't told him I love him enough, I haven't.....But I also feel like I'm being selfish because I'm not the one living with him, my mom is, so why do I get to be upset?  Also what happens now?

I just don't know what to say.  But I'm scared, I know that.  I'm also angry."
"My maternal grandmother is in the late stages of Alzheimers; yesterday we were told she would be gone within several weeks, and today we were told it would be more like hours.

"Hi pals.

I just found this awesome group and read some messaged to know if the right place to ask the question that i want to shoot.

My mom has been ""affected"" with Alzheimer, she is 62, but this behavior have started about 6 years ago (she faced some big working issues at the same time her father passed away). Doctos was not sure about the name if this illness because she was very young, and on the beginning was not going fast, and he was just forgetting little things (she has one of the best memories that i have ever seen, she remember the Document of all their clients and the monetary status of each one of them - she was accountant).

  
These days, her manual mobility has been affected and she can not recall normally words used all days, she use to ask the same question over and over again when like 30 minutes have passed... The problem is that she always has been very curios and wanted to know everything.... We have tested with cannabis and with formal treatments, but we see no change.  
My father is dealing with her, by taking her to the doctor when she has an appointment and helping her with daily activities, and managing his business as well.  
I am full time worker  and finishing my Engineer degree to leve the country asap (living in Argentina) and trying to convince my father to come with me.

I have spoken lot of times with my father to hire someone to take care of my mom, or at least some  therapist contention for him, because he is maddest every day with all this crap.  


Do you happen to have some advice for me to push the person who is taking care of her to start with psychologist or something?

&#x200B;

Thanks, and sorry for the long post.

Alex"
"Any suggestions on how to get help with caregiving ?    I only have 1 brother who is battling cancer right now so I have to take care of my mother 100% of the time.   I have my own business that I can work from home for right now.  I just get worried that hiring someone my mother will not be comfortable and / or nervous they screw up something with her 15+ meds, etc.

My mother has several medical issues (heart, kidney, etc) and seems like she is ""sick"" with an issue nearly every week."
My grandma with Alzheimers wont stop banging on the door few times an hour all afternoon. Whenever we ask what she needs she’ll just say i didn’t bang on the door. Has anyone else been through this? We give her sleep gummys in the evening and thinking about giving her some after lunch as well. I just worry it’ll affect her sleep at night if she takes a nap in the afternoon. Thank you in advance.
"Hi everyone . With the approval this week, we are very hopeful for this drug. But does anyone know more about if it’s actually possible/going to be affordable to get? My dads is in a position where he would qualify as the perfect candidate for the medicine and like most people I’m willing to try anything if it means working against this memory loss. Thanks for any info !"
"Hi there- as the title states, my mom with Alzheimer’s is not compliant with treatment. I’m not sure if this stems from her time as an RN staffing a memory ward in her younger years or what. She gets almost combative when we try to get her to go to her neurologist, when we do get her to one, she finds some reason or another to dislike them and therefore not trust them or their treatment. My mom refuses to take her medication because it makes her “spacey” and is unable to care for herself. My dad, her caretaker, works out of town full time most days of the week and I have a job where I work 60+ hours a week. I don’t know how to help manage her care. How do you get your loved one to a doctor? I understand it is her choice to receive treatment but at this point it impedes on our life and ability to care for her. Anything helps."
"My grandpa is 81 and has been progressing through the stages for a while now, probably 5-7 years. (Sorry my timeline is a little screwed up) I’m not sure what stage he’s in but it’s getting very bad. My whole life I had NEVER seen my grandpa get mad, or frustrated at anything. 

Nowadays he’s always mad at people and his communication skills are basically non existent. I go to his house atleast 4 days a week to help with things around the house (and I spend 2 nights a week there for easier commuting) or whatever because i park the car I use to driver for uber at his house.

He does nothing all day except sit in his recliner, or stare out the window for hours. I bring my dog over to his house during the week so he has some company, it seems to have made him a lot happier as he LOVES animals.

Every time I see him it’s always the same basic questions over and over and over..
“Can I get you anything to drink?!”
“You’re going to work?”
“Where do you work?”
“What do you do?”
“Where do you live?”

He has asked me if I wanted a drink 5 times in 1 minute before. And him asking the same question 2-3 times in a minute isn’t uncommon EVERY TIME I GO TO THE KITCHEN TO GET SOME WATER OR WHATEVER.
I often find myself not eating or not drinking because I don’t want to go downstairs and have to explain what cup I’m getting, that I want ice in my water, I’m hungry so I need a piece of toast, just stupid shit.

He will freak out if he sees me outside (which I often am) because he will think I’m a burglar or something. He’s a EXTREMELY paranoid, he thinks people are watching him whenever the windows are open. And he thinks there are burglars EVERYWHERE. 

For example:
A car stops a little bit down the street for more than a minute. OHNO OHNO THEYRE GOING TO ROB US CLOSE THE WINDOWS!!

I guess the part I need help with the most is how to deal with the constant questions. He never understands my answers, I have to explain things more than you would with a 3 year old, and then if he miraculously understands me, he just forgets 2 seconds later.

Today absolutely broke my heart...he was telling me some simple story in the most complex way that my dog heard my car and knew I was outside. I said “oh haha yup” and walked in the other room because someone was calling my name.
He then storms in the other room yelling about how I’m so rude and I walked away from him before he could finish talking.
“Grandpa I heard you”
“Oh ya?! Then what the hell did I say?!”
(I then repeat what he said word for word)
He then says 
“No you didn’t hear me say that because I didn’t say it yet!!!”
*extreme anger 
“Grandpa then how did I know what you were going to say?”
*extreme confusion
“I dont know...”

Please any words of advice or encouragement would help a lot. I’m struggling so badly seeing the one vibrant, interesting, loving grandpa who was more of a father to me than my father ever was.

Going to work everyday knowing I’m going to have to see him like that breaks my heart. He’s hardly the person he used to be and watching him deteriorate right in front of my eyes is agonizing. But I know I can’t just put him in a home and forget about him.

Thank you."
"My 74 year old mother has alzheimer's and has been living with me for about a year and a half. I work full time and take care of her when I'm not at work. We have a little outside help - just enough to barely scrape by. Her needs for care are increasing and my availability isn't. I want to find a live-in caregiver to assist her full time 5 days a week. l am having a very hard time finding out how to get through all the red tape of minimum wage/overtime/sleep requirements. Agencies charge too much, I want to do a private hire. If you live in California and have a live-in caregiver, please message me! How did you figure out what to pay them? Are you following the rules or doing cash under the table? Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated."
"He’s been way more forgetful then normal lately and I think from my perspective I’m feeling more sure about being some form of Alzheimer’s or dementia. I think it would be inappropriate to not take action. 

But I have no idea how to have the conversation. Any articles, YouTube videos, books, or personal experience that you found helpful that you could share would be immensely appreciated."
"So my dad has symptoms of dementia since the last few years. No short term memory left, needs help with simple tasks, problems remembering words. He’s going for a memory test soon and I’m really worried how he will react. He’s always been super independent, in charge and in control. He will not be able to drive soon and going places with my mom is his only hobby. Are there any resources or suggestions to help deal with the impact of this diagnosis?"
My mother is dying of dementia. She fell and busted her head open and they don't believe she is waking up. She has maybe hours to a couple days left. She is 5 hours away from me. I have watched my mom fade away slowly over the last 8 years and when we put her in a home I hugged her saw her smile for the last time and I told her I loved her and told her goodbye. I feel like my mother's spirit has been gone a long time and I don't want to see her like this. My extended family is trying to tell me that I should but I don't know..is it wrong to feel this way? Should I go?
"My mother ended up in the hospital last weekend and was released Monday to my aunt's care. She has power of attorney and decided hospice care would help with costs. Met my mom's caretaker today and went through meds. Zyprexa, tramadol, and lorazepam are all she's on. Every 4 hours and they want to increase to every 2. Pretty sure they're trying to kill my mother. Anyone else have any experience with these meds or situation?"
Who would admit them to a nursing home? Who would manage their finances and pay for the nursing homes if they are no longer able to do it themselves? How would they be protected from being taken advantage of financially or otherwise?
Does anyone know what one can expect from Medicare when it comes to in-home hospice.  Right now we have a day-aide and a night-aide.  Up until now my parents were able to use walkers to get to the toilet.  While they needed assistance to use the toilet they could stand up and turn around and sit down as needed (even if it was with a bit of help and/or coaxing).  Now they are both completely unable to stand up.  To get them up there needs to be one person on each side holding their arms  to prevent them from falling down.  This have become practically speaking bed-bound.  I think they are now ready for hospice care.  It's impossible for one aide to care for them as they used to be cared for.  Does anyone know what kind of assistance Medicare Hospice can provide?
"My grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in June of last year. I had started taking care of her last February when she couldn't remember how to pay her bills or order her groceries online anymore (she had stopped driving 2 years earlier as she didn't feel confident operating her car any longer.) She was calling me at all hours of the day and night, so I was able to submit a claim to her long term care insurance and began in-home care for her 8 hours a day, every day to help her with food prep and remind her to take her medication as she had missed doses for about 3 months but wouldn't admit it. 

I found a care facility that offers memory care, and the place is lovely with really great staff. She moved in in December, staff says she's really flourishing. However, she frequently accuses me of ""imprisoning her against her will"" which is frankly untrue, she signed all the documentation to move it, visited with me multiple times before move in, she's even the one that asked me to find a facility in the first place. Now she's saying that she didn't sign anything, and that she doesn't belong there. I know telling dementia patients they have dementia isn't the way to explain things to them, but my dad snapped at her and told her she has dementia to which she replied that she wanted to see documentation of the diagnosis that we procured without her seeing a doctor. I explained to her that she did go to the doctor and I was there with her when she got the diagnosis. 

Mostly I'm looking for advice on how to counter or change the conversation when this happens. She really believes in her heart that I've locked her up and that she was doing just fine at home ""by herself"" and that her diagnosis was falsified by me, which wasn't at all the case. I don't know what it is about the situation but I always end up crying when she lashes out and says I ""should be ashamed"" of myself. I know I did what's right for her, but I still feel guilty and I want to be able to have a conversation and relationship with her."
"
My moms finds it funny to tell my grandma that her sister died. She just repeats it a bunch of times. My grandma talks abt moving back to her home town and my mom doesn’t want her too- so my mom will tell her that the senior living hone she wants to move to caught in fire which is kinda harsh. She will also tell my grandma that her friend from her hometown died.. my mom said she does this so my grandma stops talking abt moving back but my mom seems to find it entertaining / funny and I think she wants to see my grandmas reaction  . My grandmas friend and sister did not die but my moms says it as an excuse for y my gma can’t leave and than my mom laughs 

My mom is with her all day so I’m sure she’s stressed sometimes & I guess with dementia my grandma will forget anyways- but it’s just obnoxious of my mom

I guess my grandma can be a handful but my mom can just start getting snappy and being like “remember I told you 1000000” times today to my grandma"
"Never realized my dad was losing anything cognitive wise. He’s always been straight forward and on point until a couple months ago. He told us (mom and I) he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2011. He’s degraded physically pretty bad the past few months. 
All I’ve got to say is watch out for your parents/grandparents"
"So I'm 14 years old and my dad has alzheimers. I'm keeping an eye on him this morning because my mom is at work. A few minutes ago he started whispering ""I just wanna die"" over and over again. I guess he didn't realize that I was nearby and could hear him until I asked if he wanted to watch a different show. I'm freaking out and I dont know if I should tell my mom or not. I feel like it would break her heart and make her feel like she isn't doing a good job as his caretaker. She does so much these days and is always stressed out, I really dont want to make things worse for her."
"My grandmother and my great aunt died from Alzheimer's. 

My aunt has the genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's, so I wanted to know if I did. 

I do. 

I have borderline personality disorder and major depressive disorder. I am fully aware of how I will probably start to behave once I start going downhill. (If I start. I understand that a genetic predisposition does it mean you'll definitely get it.)

I can't put my daughter and my husband through that.

I want to set it up so that I can get physician assisted suicide if I am diagnosed with Alzheimer's. It is not legal in my state.

Does anyone have experience with setting this up or helping someone else set it up? I just have some questions about it."
"Hi all,

I was referred here by a mod from another sub. My mum was diagnosed with early stage Alzheimer's on Monday. We're all still trying to come to terms with it. She's only 52 and while I'm glad it isn't anything worse I'm devastated that this is the diagnosis. Being so young she's being referred to clinical trials and she's starting a supplement strongly recommend by her neurologist called Souvenaid. 

I guess I'm just looking for advice on how to cope with it and how to help my mum as best I can. My 1 y.o daughter and I live with her and my dad as well as my sister. 

I appreciate any advice that you guys may have for us.

Thank you 💕

Edit - I just want to say thank you to everyone who commented.

Mum and dad have an appointment to get POA sorted on Thursday. We wanted it sooner but mum just wanted to digest things first.
I'm already in therapy and I had a session two days before the diagnosis. I'll be having another session shortly.
I'll be asking our GP (he sees both my parents, my mum's mum, myself and my daughter) if he can offer therapy as an option to mum.
I'm going to try and get her access to the NDIS which is a government disability service in Australia. I'm already on it with my mental health.
My parents are lucky to be able to afford things as we need it. My dad has inherited money from a couple of relatives who passed and as morbid as it is I'm beyond grateful he did because they're going to need it. The Souvenaid is about $1300 a year alone. 

This is taking a toll on everyone. Lots of tears were shed as we'd all hoped it was from the trauma of losing our family dog in 2016 and her having a car accident in 2019. The more I thought about it the more I realised this diagnosis was a long time coming. I noticed the changes in 2016, but again just chalked it up to our family dog passing away because she was in her late 40's still.

And for everyone who has had a loved one or has a loved one with this I am so sorry you've been through or are going through this or both ❤️"
"So my dad has Alzheimer’s. He lives with my mom and they take care of each other, but his short term memory and decision-making abilities(which he never really had) are completely shot. Last week he asked me to fix his computer because it seemed to have viruses.  I got the computer, and sure enough it was full of malware because he’s been going to very shady porn websites, and just clicks on whatever he sees. He also was friends with a ton of bots/scammers on social media and has been chatting with them. Finally, he has been going to hook up sites to try to meet strangers. The rest of his time he spends reading fake news designed to make people angry (think Qanon.) 

Unfortunately talking to him about safety doesn’t work, he agrees to whatever we say, but then just does it anyways once he’s alone. We don’t want to take his computer away, because that’s all he does with this time, and that’s basically how he spent all day every day for decades. My mom doesn’t know much about computers and is overwhelmed, so she’s not really able to keep track of what he’s doing.

So far we’ve taken away his access to mom‘s financials, and I installed some antivirus and monitoring software so I could block the most dangerous looking websites. I also blocked the bots on his Facebook and changed his settings so only mutual friends can send a friend request. I made my mom the administrator on his computer so only she can approve program installations. Monitoring all of his Internet use is exhausting and distressing, but it doesn’t seem safe to let him roam freely at this point. 

Any tips about Internet safety for people with dementia? Also, I’d love to get him off browsing the web, but he says he’s bored and that’s all he likes to do. Any ideas of activities/hobbies for someone that loves intellectual stimulation but is losing his intellect?"
" FDA is supposed to rule on Biogen's treatment around June 7th. I don't believe Biogen's treatment, aducanumab, will receive FDA approval on the next round due to too many gaps in, and too small a test population in its current phase testing. I, however, strongly believe that Cassava Sciences' (SAVA) treatment will get approval because of its test population and continued track record of safety and efficacy. However it goes, these treatments will continue to put a spot light on Alzheimer's Disease and the FDA's need to work with these companies to get to a result in the near term. AD is the next pandemic and treatments must be viewed as critical solutions."

"Hi there,

I'm a 27 year old who (along with my sister) have been caring for our father who has suffered with early-onset dementia for several years now.   


I have been looking into the two week isolation period for residents that has just been scrapped by the Gov for 'low-risk' visits. This is obviously very welcome news, as I can't imagine my own father having to undergo two weeks of isolation when he is as ill as he is.  


However, the rule does still exist for those who have been in hospital. I was wondering if there was anybody in the community who had something to say on this, I'm looking to gather information on it to raise awareness. Thanks!"
"Hi all, seeking some help or just opinions/experiences y’all had with dealing with family member suffering from Alzheimer’s and aggression.

My dad has Alzheimer’s for almost 2 years (could be longer, but it was officially diagnosed about 1year and 9 months). Lately in the last 2/3 weeks, he’s been a lot more aggressive (Cursing, shouting, spitting out food, swinging and lashing out at family and the caretaker). This is especially a lot more often when trying to bathe him or wash his face. But otherwise, it seems like every other minute he’s hissing, snarling and yelling out his intent to “kill you all”(in his words)

While I’m not too concerned about his murderous intent, it’s more of him lashing out (think punching, scratching etc.) at the caretaker that I feel is unwarranted since she’s not a family member.

He keeps this up throughout the day till he eventually sleeps. And it tends to get worse at night, where he acts out and tries to escape. He’s in a geriatric bed with a safety vest with a harness to ensure he can’t get out but still allows for mobility. (He’s a fall risk since he has trouble with walking and has fallen before, when we didn’t have the bed then and lapses happened during the night when no one woke up to support him when he does his nightly walks, when he could still walk around alittle)

It’s getting to the point where it’s affecting the lives of everyone since even though he’s in the bed with the harness, at night he screams out every other minute..etc. And no one ever sleeps well and it affects me and my brother since we tend to miss meetings (even from home, thanks to covid) or things slip up at work due to exhaustion (I was recently given off from work to get some rest, which is ironic since I hardly ever am able to sleep at home even if I’m given off) since we spend hours just trying to pacify him. Mum is a non factor here, as she left our lives a long time ago.

Sorry for rambling, but the point I’m trying to state is to understand how peeps are coping with aggression and Alzheimer’s and also, if we send him to a home. How do they deal with it? Do they sedate them? (Is it even ethical to do so, laws might differ country to country) 

My brother is not too comfortable with that, although I did tell him it’s a case of “ignorance is bliss”( to a certain extent). If you don’t know, you will probably remember him in a better light rather than tainting your memories of him with his lashing out and violent outbursts.

Would greatly appreciate your input here, thank you all. Dad is currently taking memantine for Alzheimer’s and quetiapine for his outburst."
"My mother, who only turned 65 a month ago, is suffering from stage 6 Alzheimer’s and likely has < 12 months before our final farewell. 

I don’t know if it’s good or bad, but the Pixar movie “Coco” has been on my mind recently. Ive been listening to the soundtrack with my family (especially. 2 young kids) and Remember Me… man.. is there any song that is both depressing and hopeful at the moment?"
"my grandma has been changing recently. she is 73. she’s been getting a bit confused, mixing up words, having panic attacks/intense mood swings out of nowhere, rocks back and forth, shows behavior of paranoia, and said she hates the evenings. 

i’m not sure if this relates to alzheimers, but i’m trying to consider all options. i don’t really know what’s going on. this has all happened in about 1-2 months."

"Hello, I am 21 and currently live at home. my mother has been diagnosed with early onset ALZ. I am going to university about a hour away, and am moving in with my boyfriend but planning on coming home to work and stay with my family every weekend. My mom is 56 and it has been terrible for my family coming to terms with this and watching her change with nothing we an do. She can no longer wash her hair properly and can't drive, she also doesn't paint anymore, and that was her passion. It hurts me a lot being with her because I notice that she isn't the same mom I grew up with. I feel really bad being away from her too though. I am really worried about not being home as often and missing the good parts of her life, as we don't know how quickly this will progress. I am just so scared and don't know exactly what to do. it has been causing me immense depression and anxiety as well as mental breakdowns. Does anyone have any advice, or have been in my situation as a young person who has a young parent with ALZ? I feel like I can't talk to her or my family about it because they're all going through it as well and are equally as upset, if not more. I don't want to hurt them more. I am also fearing that I will get this horrible disease when I am older but I feel guilty for thinking about myself right now."
"My mom, 80+ just recently is starting to act a little strange. My older brother noticed this too, during Conversations with her on the phone. Last night she wasn't answering her Alexa and she always did in the past. So I called her phone. She said she heard two women talking and didn't understand them. So she said she wasn't going to answer the Alexa.

I determined it was a TV program she was watching. The Alexa device rings loudly and announces my name. Yet she apparently didn't understand what was going on.

This is the first time I've noticed something like this with my mom. She had always known how to work that thing and had never been confused about anything.

My dad had alzheimers so now I'm thinking maybe she is developing it. I had mentioned to her that maybe her memory is failing and that my brother noticed same thing. She thought it was funny and said she didn't know why she got things mixed up. But it sounded like she was a little sad that I mentioned something like that.

My brother never wants to be honest and tell people they may have issues. Did I do wrong to mention to my mom that she may be having some memory issues?"
"My mother is trying to make some changes to her and my fathers will.  My father is in a nursing home these days.  She is being told that without his signature she can't alter any part of the will that was signed originally by the two of them.  They are just saying ""you can't change that"".  I believe she has power of attorney since he's in a home (he obviously would just leave the home if he had the power).  So I don't understand how they think he should be able to sign legal documents.  

Has anyone else gone through something like this?  I realize this is more of a legal question and you can't really give actual binding legal advice, but maybe we are just missing something.  I wish I could talk to this lawyer myself but I don't want to cause any problems or incur any additional fees.  

Thanks!"
"Has anyone done the spaghetti and meatballs similar to the spaghetti and hotdog thing?

Wondering the best way to do it. My gma likes spaghetti and meatballs, but she does not want to use her spoon/fork/spork on certain days.

"My grandmother has early stages of Alzheimers disease. She is a lawyer, but I am concerned she can no longer handle cases. I tried talking to  her about quitting , but she is very adamant that she can still do it. I don't want to stop her forcefully, but at the same time she can't even organize her documents properly also mixes up reality and dreams. Can you please give me any advice on how to handle this situation? I don't want to hurt her feelings, but also there is a high chance that she screws things badly."
"Can I suggest to my grandmother's doctor that he check her for dementia and Alzheimers? She may not be far along, or perhaps she is just aging (she's in her 80's), but I'm terribly worried about her."
"Has anyone joined one, do you find it beneficial? I searched for support groups near me and there are a few listed on the alz.org website."
"My father is in the mid-stage of Alzheimer's. He's only 67 and has always been my mother's greatest protector but the disease has caused him to not recognize her and can become verbally abusive, despite her best care. I struggle wondering whether or not he should be reprimanded in any way (left alone for an hour or two, ect). He no longer has the capacity to feel remorse for his actions and instead always feels like he is being victimized. We have an extremely close family, all of whom are bending over backwards to help. When he lashes out, I don't know whether or not recounting his poor behavior is worthwhile or if we should just comfort him because he is ill. Any thoughts?"
"Hi, so she's 75 yo, in late stage Alzheimer. She doesn't speak or make face expressions anymore, just utter silence. However she only bite, like when I approach her she grab my arm and bite my elbow(she has dental meal so the bite is not hard) or she tries ro grab my neck and bite my cheeks. She then tries to remove food or saliva and start to rub my elbow gently. I'm curious about this behavior and can't find anything online. Hope someone can give an explanation."
"I live a far distance from my dad, he is 67 and has never really had the best memory.  He and my stepmom usually don’t let me know if things are wrong medically with them until it is absolutely unavoidable but my step mom dropped a bomb on me this weekend.  Apparently my dad has been getting progressively worse, this weekend he attended a baptism and didn’t know the names of the relatives there and insisted he saw his sister who died last year.  On the way home he instructed my stepmom on the way home but was giving her completely wrong directions even though he has lived in this area his entire life.  When he got home he was insisting that someone was trying to steal his house and sobbed.  My stepmom told me these episodes sometimes are worse at night, that he has emotional outbursts (he has never been prone to cry) and has also started pacing and wandering in the house.  She even told me that when they are out she has to take a portable jug for him to pee in occasionally.  This sounds serious to me and they are just now finally starting to get this looked at.  His mom (my grandma) had Alzheimer’s and I am concerned that is what this is.  Am I just over reacting?"
"Hello,

Found out my cousin's wife has advance Alzheimers in her 40s with 2-3 years life expectancy. He is struggling finding support to help take care of her and based on what he told me isn't maximizing his health insurance/benefits 100% because he doesn't know what he is entitled. 

He is under a lot stress and I wanted to help him find resources to get a care taker/nurse and teaches him his rights with California health insurance & disability.  This is just what I got from one hour catching up. I found some resources already for him to contact but wanted to post here to see if fellow redditors may have information/resources specific to Latinos.

Thank you"
"She was diagnosed with early onset about a year ago. Haven’t seen the docs much since the pandemic. 

I’m mostly just curious for more information. When I do research on the disease, the focus seems to be more on the memory and less on these other aspects. 

Does this suggest a certain type of Alzheimer’s or dementia? Or is just different for everyone?"
Any ideas for bra shopping for my wife? Clearly new to this so do stores have fitting service? Is there an online option? Thanks
"My mom has recently taken on taking care of my grandma 24/7. My mom's primary language is Vietnamese, with conversational English. My grandma only knows Vietnamese, maybe some Cantonese if she hasn't lost it yet. I'm not literate in Vietnamese at all. 

I'm looking for resources and support groups in Vietnamese to send to my mom. She doesn't know anyone else in her situation, and I think she would benefit from learning about how to deal with my grandma's hostility and confusion better. I know I can put things through Google Translate, but it would be nice if she could navigate the website on her own in Vietnamese instead of me sending her a bunch of links since she's not the best with tech. I think a support group would go a long way since she's pretty alone in the situation now, and has anxieties about developing dementia herself since my great-grandma was also affected. 

I already found the [alz.org](https://alz.org) Vietnamese site, and a weekly day group near my mom's, but any additional resources and support groups for caretakers would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"
"Hi. I work with a start-up nonprofit called [Lorenzo's House](https://www.lorenzoshouse.org/), that provides support for families of people with Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease. They have put together a FREE one-day youth camp for kids. This will be a virtual experience, so people can participate from anywhere without having to travel:

>WHAT IS [LORENZO'S YOUTH CAMP](https://www.lorenzoshouse.org/youth-camp)?  
**The purpose of Lorenzo’s Camp is to give youth with a parent diagnosed with younger-onset Alzheimer’s a chance to connect with each another and realize we are not alone going through this tough lifestyle. It’s a free-one day youth summit and in the pilot phase this summer of 2021.**  
At Lorenzo’s Camp there will be time to bond, share our story if we want, listen to the stories of other kids. There will be time to share our own caregiver ideas and learn from each other. There will be time for raffle prizes, to do cool art, laugh and maybe even heal some. Most important, it’s a time to build an alliance with one another because we are on our similar journey and can help each other.

There will be an info session on June 7 for anyone who might be interested in learning more."
"For like 2.5 weeks, I would have to look at my journal for exact dates, but my gma has been getting weak from 4-6 pm. My mother and I have moved her dinner early and I take her for walks(well, rolls, she's in a wheelchair when needed) to get her out the house and get some sunlight. . The past two days, she wants to ""do it herself"". She has a walker and she is ""grown"" lol.  I told my mom to help lift her, but let her think she did it herself. She's gotten some confidence back thinking she's doing it herself, which is good, but now, when she needs help and ask for it, she gets mad. My grandma is a trip. 6+ years now for me. 1.5 for my mom taking care physically. She's still learning. 

I do know my gma is happy that my mom and I are here. The other day, she pretty much ignored her other kids(on the phone, who lived down the street and did nothing, yet my mother and I had to move here to take care of her). I'm going to say allegedly, but allegedly, word on the street was they planned on putting her in a home and leaving her so they could wait for her to pass and get her money(they are disgusting people). Surprise when I got here, from a place I loved living and working in, they left. My mom and I are the only ones that have really taken care of her since she was diagnosed. My brother is the only grandchild that calls. Frustrated, but people suck as we learned over the last year. 

My gma has talked badly about my mother and I since as long as I can remember. As much as that upset me growing up, I'm glad I can be here for her now."
"Hello,

I need some advice. My dad has been banging on his bedroom walls late at night. He's also been tapping his dishes with his utensils lately during meals. He doesn't seem agitated when he's doing it and he says he doesn't know why he's doing it either. I think it might be because he's bored, but I'm not sure. Is this fidgeting? I was was thinking of getting a fidget blanket, but I'm not sure if it will help. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

"Apologies in advance for the long post. This is half catharsis for me and half cry-for-help. The most relevant parts of this post are the last couple of paragraphs; a lot of the rest is back-story.

My mother started suffering from Alzheimer's in 2015-2016, when she was 71. My father (they've been married over 50 years) has been her primary caretaker during her decline. I moved back in with them a couple of years ago to help out where I can, but he and I are both struggling and in need of some help and suggestions.

I was the first one to notice my mother's cognitive decline throughout 2015-2016. We had a memory test done that did not show any issues, so everyone relaxed about it for the better part of a year, but when it started getting worse, we started pursuing it again and got the crushing news. My grandfather on my father's side also had Alzheimer's in the '90s, so my father has some experience with this, but it's his first time actually living with it 24/7. By the point where we got our ""diagnosis"", my mom was already starting to show confusion about every-day things like the date. My dad did not want her told that she had Alzheimer's, so she has gone through her decline and care without any knowledge that she is suffering from this. He is also adamant that he does not want her put in a nursing home (though in light of the below recent developments, he has started talking to an in-home caretaker as well as a senior ""day care"" facility).

Over the past year and a half or so, my mom has gone through a very sharp decline, both in her mental capabilities and her treatment of her family. My dad is now having a lot of trouble getting her showered and is starting to have problems helping her in the bathroom as well. She has to go very frequently (sometimes several times in an hour), and can't go on her own (she often forgets to pull down her pants/underwear), but when he tries to help, she accuses him of molesting her and refuses to believe that she is safe with her family, or at home. She has become abusive, inasmuch as can be labeled as ""abuse"" with this disease, and has been verbally harassing/attacking my dad with increasing frequency throughout the day, alternating with showing him love and affection. She also sometimes does not seem to process or understand the things we say to her, and has been asking for ""help"" but then cannot articulate what she needs help with, and accuses us of not wanting to help her. She cannot control her urges to stand up and walk around and wander, and then tells us how badly her knees or back are hurting. We haven't been able to get through to her that she needs to rest and that her frequent walking around is contributing to her pain.

My dad, who is extremely sensitive and has had anxiety issues for a long time, is struggling under this burden and his interactions with her are sometimes not constructive. He often reminds her of something they've seen or done together and follows it up with comments such as, ""Don't you remember?"" or ""We've been through this X times today."" He has a lot of trouble not taking the cruel things she says personally, and his frustration often comes out when she does something ""wrong"" (his tone and mannerisms will be very clearly annoyed or frustrated or stressed out). I think these behaviors are causing my mom to emotionally associate him/his presence with feeling berated or attacked, and are degrading her relationship with him more than it would otherwise. Unfortunately, when I've tried to bring up this concern with him, he gets defensive and tells me I need to be more empathetic of what he's going through, or tells me I don't know what he's enduring because my mom tends to respond better to me and trust me more than she does him. I've tried to convince him to go to a therapist or support group to learn coping mechanisms and strategies, but he has been resistant to this. I believe he is already on antidepressants, along with both of them being on a whole pharmacy's worth of other prescriptions and supplements, but I'm very worried about his mental health.

I'm looking for suggestions on how to make my mom more comfortable and receptive to our help, and any advice that can be given on how to coach my dad to interact more constructively with her. I thank you all greatly in advance for your time reading this and helping out."
"My father is pretty far progressed in his Alzheimers. Lately, when he hasn't slept (a regular occurrence where he might not sleep for two days straight) he might try to get violent with his caretakers. He's succeeded quite a few times, and today was the first time he's seriously hurt his main caretaker who has been with the family for 8 years now. He punched her hard in the face while she was changing him. She says she cat chew on her left side, but attributes it to swelling. I told her we would cover any medical costs and I like take her to urgent care since I'm afraid he might have damaged her jaw, but she wants to wait it out for now.

Ironically that sudden violent act tuckered him out and he pretty much fell asleep right afterwards.

I've already talked to his doctor about upping his medications before this incident and am waiting for him to call back to see what else we can do, but while I wait for them to call back, I was hoping to get some advice from other people who have experienced the same thing.

My siblings and I are discussing our options right now, though obviously we're waiting to talk to the doctor, but any advice from someone who's experienced this before would greatly help. Obviously, we've never been in this situation before. His caretaker, while adamant that she's okay and she is fine taking care of dad, looked unsure for the first time since I've known her. Frankly, I wouldn't blame her if she finally had to tap out, no matter how much she cares for dad. We have another caretaker, a man, who has been getting the brunt of his violent outbursts, but he barely even bat's an eye when it happens. My brother lives at home and he's usually able to control my dad when he starts to act up, but he can only be there for so much of it. He's stuck in his job until November, but he's considering taking family leave at that point so he can be home to help handle dad.

That's where we're at now. Any advice is appreciated!"
"First time posting here.  My wife has early Alzheimer's or mild cognitive dysfunction.  We recently heard about gamma light and sound therapy to remove amyloid and prevent tau, with light (and sound) flickering at 40 per second.  Not sure if this is the right forum to discuss this since she is very early and lots of posts here seem to be about more severe/later cases.  There is a free app that works on phones with a refresh of 120/sce such as iPhones or iPads.  It's called AlzLive, can download from app store, free or $9.00 a month for enhanced version.  There are also lamps that do it apparently.  Does anyone have experience with this?"
"I'm glad we have a place we can ask questions. I want to thank y'all for being here for me and my family. I've been doing this for 6 years now, so if anyone wants info from me, feel free to ask."
I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder at age 16 and has been taking benzos on and off. During my college life I took adderall/concerta for my adhd symptoms. Recently I have noticed I have developed ataxia which I have trouble walking in a straight line or even balancing. I googled prolonged use of benzos can develop ataxia and alzheimer's disease. Now I am very scared and was wondering if ataxia can not be reversed or not. Please shed some light thx.
"Does anyone take care of someone that gets really scared when alone  ?    My mother who lives with me and has dementia often gets scared when I leave for a few hours.

Any tips how to help with this ?"
"I’m not sure if this is the right place to put this. This is a genuine question I don’t mean to cause harm if I do. 

My late grandpa (mom’s dad) lived with me and my family when I was really little, so the memories I have are very limited. I do remember him running out the house and my dad chasing after him. My dad would pick him up and practically drag him back into the house. My grandpa would be screaming and yelling like he was about to get murdered. 

My grandfather was also pretty aggressive. He would knock stuff over and yell at everyone. 
I was reminded of this memory a little while ago and I’ve been thinking about it ever since. When my dad tells his account of what happens, he makes himself to be the hero. ‘The son in law who cared about his wife’s dad so much that he even embarrassed himself just to make sure he was safe.’ My dad is a narcissist so I know that’s not true. 

Is it possible that my grandfather acted this way because of my dads aggression towards him? Is it even right to drag someone into the house against there will even with Alzheimer’s/dementia? Maybe my grandfather felt trapped and was trying to escape."
"Quick background. My gma is pretty much almost blind, but is still eating well, thank goodness. Looking for a variety of foods for her. If they are in her hand, she'll eat them. If they are not, she forgets and then doesn't eat. Oh and you can't be in the room while she eats. I give her a piece, walk out, and come back in every 2-5 minutes to give hand her more. She does not want to be fed. Any thoughts? We are doing, my chicken dishes, but on a bun, she likes it, but I want to give her some variety for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 

TIA"
"My grandma had suffered from the tragic development of Alzheimer's. This led to numerous difficulties and inflicted great frustration. However, it became evident that the only way through this obstacle was to recognize her humanity, and love her for what she still had to offer. Here's a short story capturing the effects of her diagnosis. Would be awesome if ya'll could check it out.

"My mom's partner got very, very stressed during lockdown and was dealing with a lot of anxiety and anger through most of 2020 - he'd been furloughed and was home 24/7, and didn't have opportunities to socialize or partake in any activities. He started experiencing memory issues last fall, was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, and put on Donepezil. 

He's been taking it for about six months now, but his condition still seems to be deteriorating. He constantly forgets basic things (like his wallet, phone, sometimes his paychecks), and tends to repeat stories constantly while misremembering details. He's also started having tantrums and showing uncharacteristic impulsivity - he'll do things like yell at my mom in front of the neighbors for not fixing him dinner, or randomly start crying and begging her not to leave him. His mood is very up and down, and he seems depressed and withdrawn overall. He also appears to have trouble sleeping, and is constantly awake when he should be sleeping. 

We've tried to get him to look after his health more, but he can never stick to it for more than a couple days. He rarely gets exercise, doesn't really socialize, won't engage in any mentally stimulating activity (the main things he does at home is watch TV or polish his car), and won't change his diet (he eats a lot of carbs and saturated fats). I'm worried that he'll develop Alzheimer's within the next year at this rate, especially because he doesn't manage his physical and mental health. It's clear he's declining, and it's hasn't even been a year since he started having memory issues. 

Is this how the early stages of Alzheimer's look? Or could it just be MCI combined with stress and poor lifestyle habits?"
"I caught her several times having 5-10 minute conversations with her reflection in the mirror, sometimes even standing in the pitch black bathroom talking to the mirror about the sink. I have asked her who she is speaking to and she says ‘my mom’. 

She has even begun speaking in third person about herself....  it’s very creepy"
"First time poster, but just curious if anyone has dealt with an issue like this.  

Was looking up a local company to get my chimney cleaned and noticed they have random, casual Alzheimer’s “joke” on their business website. Basically the gist is “If you can’t remember the last time you had your chimney cleaned, you’re either overdue or you have Alzheimer’s. Haha!”

As someone who has had their family deeply impacted by this, I was shocked and kind of gut punched. How has no one noticed this? Why is that attempt at humor still up there? Disheartening.

Who knew I’d get so steamed this morning looking at chimney cleaning services?

I called them out with a Google review, but basically I really just wanted to vent to this wonderful group and see if anyone ever had similar experiences. Thanks.

The page with the “joke” on it:
https://www.chimneymonkey.com/service/chimney-sweep/ 

My Google review is their most recent. Hopefully they respond soon to say they have removed it.

UPDATE - I called them out on a few channels, and they have since changed the language to remove the joke. I’ll take it!"
"I know that Alzheimer’s has 7 stages. I’ve googled a lot about the different stages and I think my grandmother is between 4 and 6.

She sleeps mostly during the day, and is awake wandering around the house throughout the night. She thinks it’s morning when it’s night. She’s extremely paranoid that we’re all going to leave her. Every time she wakes up, she asks several times if she has to go to her job but she’s been retired since the 1990s. She makes up a lot of wild, elaborate stories that aren’t true. Just recently, she started sundowning and tonight it was the worst. She couldn’t understand why it was so dark, but it was 11 at night. She absolutely could not be convinced it was night time. It’s also becoming increasingly difficult to have a conversation with her because it’s like she just doesn’t understand our words. 

She’s well beyond just the memory portion of Alzheimer’s. She can still move around fairly well, but she can’t bathe herself, cook, or drive. Do you think this is still the early-mid stages, or could she be near the end stages? It’s a tough thing to watch and part of me just wants it all to end because I know she’s frustrated and suffering."
"Sharing a funny story about a friend of mine and his dad.  His mom and dad declined at roughly the same time.  His dad kept asking where the car was after the dad had gotten in the last of numerous accidents and the car was retired from service.

My friend’s dad used to call him every day to ask where he put the car!  This went on and on for many months, and my friend had some amazing coping skills to deal with the calls.  

For fun, he made up more outrageous explanations over time for what had happened to the car and where it was... not to be mean but truly to look at the humor of those calls he knew he had to deal with everyday.

The stories went from the norm to the fantastical, the following are examples.

•	⁠Drug cartels in Florida took the car as part of a ring to steal only boring and unremarkable cars for drug mules.

•	⁠Cuba sent a Castro-armed force to take the car because his wife (Cuban) had spoken badly about Cuba. 

•	⁠A neighborhood kid moved the car down the block so the others previously mentioned could not find — so only for safe keeping.

You get the point.  At the end of my friend’s story told each morning, he would explain to his father that the CIA and FBI had already located the car and would return it the next day.  And so, like the movie “Groundhog Day,” rinse and repeat with another creative explanation. 😅"
"First time posting, sorry if it’s too long!! I just need to vent to people who understand, and who maybe can offer some advice or relate in some way. 
My dad is 74 and was diagnosed almost 3 years ago. I am 23 and it was right around the time that I first moved out, which makes me feel partly to blame for his mental decline. He raised me as a single parent since I was 5, my mom is an alcoholic who has been in and (mostly) out of my life. My dad and I had a good relationship, but he was more of a friend than a parent and had really bad anger issues, so there was lots of yelling and I felt as though I never had a real parent figure. He chose to have me with an alcoholic woman at 50 after spending his life partying and ending up with no savings for when I arrived. It’s safe to say I resent him for this, though I try not to because he did try his best.
Flash forward to now, I’ve been living with him since April 1, 2020. He has gotten so much worse this past year. He can’t make his own meals (doesn’t remember/know how to microwave the food I leave him), doesn’t bathe himself (I have him put a bathing suit on and give him a shower), he doesn’t flush the toilet and/or leaves shit on the seat, takes food out of the fridge and leaves it on the counter, is confused all the time and gets mad at me when I tell him the truth, ie. we sold his car a couple years ago, or our cat passed away (insists I’m wrong or that it’s my fault). He also just talks basically gibberish to me now, usually about what he’s seen on TV, and I feel so guilty because I know he’s lonely but I just can’t Stand to talk to him, it is so frustrating for me to see my only parent like this. He confuses me with his ex wife’s daughter, his sister, or my mom. Every time I’m in the kitchen he asks at least ten times what I’m doing or making “for him” and then when I give him food he has two bites and that’s it. I have to hide my food in the fridge because he will just leave it to rot on the counter. I feel like I’ve had a toddler for the last year and I don’t know how I’ve dealt with it for so long, but now that he is getting really bad I just feel so angry all the time and I have to go to my room and scream into a pillow to keep from yelling at him. This past year has made me so cynical and cold, I love my dad so much, and I feel awful for thinking this, but his death will be a huge relief for me. I feel like I’m going insane. Sorry again for the long post but none of my friends really understand what it’s like dealing with this. Anyways, thanks for letting me vent and any advice is greatly appreciated :)"
I still live with my. Mom and my abusive grandma has Alzheimer’s I’m having thoughts that my mom will be better off when she dies are these thoughts ok to have
"Hi Folks. I've been reading through the posts and I feel for all you, we are in this together! I would love some advice, but just having a place to vent is great as well.

My mother (70) started showing symptoms about a year ago, and it is progressed VERY rapidly. My dad has been great with her, even though they don't have the closest of relationships. I've been making a point to head over to visit and cook dinner once or twice a week, knowing that loneliness is a major factor.

My father has always been stoic and calm, but has started throwing these incredibly uncharacteristic tantrums. From what I've been reading, this could very well be the onset of dementia. I'm worried that living together may be exacerbating his mental decline, but my mom has always been very dependent on him.

I am their only child, and we aren't very close (physically or emotionally) to our small, extended family. I don't have the money for a care facility, nor do I have room in my home. They have a few, dear friends in the area that are essential to their happiness, so I can't buy a place for us outside the city where I can afford the space. This has all happened so suddenly.

On a selfish note, I'm 35 and my career is starting to take off, and I don't think my parents will have the capacity to be proud of my accomplishments. I never knew how much that meant to me..."
"Hi everyone - my mom is recently diagnosed early stage and is currently enrolled in a clinical drug trial. Taking things day by day, as we're all still processing and adjusting to the diagnosis and what it means. 

I've been reading various articles and studies about the possibility of diet playing a role in risk for AD and even seen the Alzheimer's Association post about it recently. My understanding of these theories is that there's a possibility the brain of those with Alz can't metabolize glucose and carbs, so eating those items muddles the brain and doesn't give it proper nutrition. The solution to this in theory is a diet very low in glucose and carbs are high in proteins and fats – allowing the brain to then be in ketosis and able to metabolize the energy it needs to properly function. 

When I read about these studies and theories, a lightbulb in my own brain went off, as my mom essentially only eats carbs and glucose and has done so her whole life. She eats very healthy, but what if her brain wasn't able to metabolize the food she was putting in her body even if it was considered ""healthy"" and it has contributed to the Alz? I thought we might as well try shifting her diet to keto as these trials are doing, while she's currently in the drug trial, however of course a keto diet is very difficult to follow properly and even harder when change is difficult for someone with dementia. 

Does anyone have insight into these studies or thoughts on this? Has anyone tried something similar with a loved one? I know a generally brain healthy diet can't hurt, but a strict keto diet could really affect her quality of life since it requires a big commitment and makes meal time more difficult, so I'm asking myself if it's worth it. Like I'm sure many of you are, I'm grasping on to any little sliver of hope and given her lifelong diet this seemed logical to me to give it a shot."
"Hey all, this is my first ever post on reddit - I searched up this group on a whim after a couple years of feeling intensely isolated with regards to my experience, and am really grateful to have read the stories posted here. This will be a somewhat lengthy post, but I am really hoping that someone will be able to give me some advice.

My dad is 74, and is in the mid-stage of ALZ. His working memory is non-functional - he forgets anything you tell him instantly, repeats himself over and over, has lost his attention span and interest in activities, and gets obsessive over things that are causing him anxiety. He is very withdrawn, doesn't contribute much to conversation as he struggles to follow it, but still has his sense of humour and is happy to see me and be involved in whatever is happening in the house.

2 months ago he took a memory test which he has been taking regularly to chart the progression of his disease (I can't recall the name of the test, sorry), and he scored 15/30. This score indicates that a person is no longer safe to operate a car, and his doctor had him sit a driving test to confirm this, which he failed. His license was suspended, and he has to sit another test with a written component if he wants his license back, which he will not be able to pass.

I live 3 hours away from my parents, and unfortunately can only get down to visit once a month - my last trip down was only a couple of days after this all went down, and he was understandably very upset and was stuck in a loop of: not knowing that his license had been taken -> not knowing -why- his license had been taken -> understanding why, including all the implications - which was deeply, deeply upsetting to watch. My Mum was able to placate him to an extent by buying him a bike so that he was still able to get up to the local shops, and although he was still upset, this seemed to help him accept his situation a little better.

I was ill for a couple weeks around the time I was scheduled to visit the following month, so I missed that visit. My most recent trip down was this past weekend, 2 months after the license revocation, and his disease was advanced noticeably during this time. He is now completely fixated on the loss of his license, but where before he was depressed and had some level of understanding about it, he is now angry, paranoid, and in denial that he is unable to drive. When he asks ""was there some kind of driving test I have to take?"", my Mum tries to explain to him that yes, she has booked him a test for 4 weeks from now and that he will have to take it if he wants to drive again. From that point the loop is: asking why the license was taken -> asking why he had to take a memory test -> not believing my Mum when she tells him that his memory has been failing for some time etc -> becoming angry and implying that he is being lied to -> storming around and slamming things. My Mum is doing her best to remain patient, but she is mentally and physically fatigued from living with these constant loops and repetitions, and is prone to lose her patience, which I know is the wrong thing to do but is completely understandable considering her situation. My Dad no longer seems to realise that he has ALZ, and  clearly feels that he is being abused and manipulated, which makes his baseline anxiety worse.

My question is this: what is the best course of action to try and soothe my Dad when he gets into this particular obsessive loop? I know that in many cases telling the truth is unhelpful, but I can't think of a lie that would both satisfy him and prevent him from trying to drive and getting caught up in the same loop again. This is mostly for my Mum, as she is the person who is dealing with the vast majority of it - any tips or suggestions that would help her to avoid being the focus of his anger would be gratefully accepted.

Happy to answer any questions or provide any clarification.

Thank you very much in advance."
"After about nine months of a part-time aide and discussing our options for several months, my father (early 70's) was moved into a memory care facility about a week ago. My mom has been caring for my dad for the last seven or so years as his disease has progressed, and he's at the point where being in a facility seems like the right choice (issues with escaping/wandering, getting dressed, hygiene, etc.). Caring for my dad for this long has taken a big mental toll on my mom, not surprisingly.

We were able to get him a room in a facility close to their home that seemed like the best fit of the ones we toured (some virtual, this one in-person by other family members). Now that my mom has visited him in the facility, she thinks he could get better care at home, but it would really require a full time aide at this point. It feels like she's somehow forgotten how difficult and frustrating it is to care for him after only a week of being apart. 

There must be a lot of emotions involved with putting your spouse in a facility, but I think she needs to stay the course (at least for a few months) and let herself decompress from the strain she's been under for so long. Does anyone here have advice I can pass along to help her re-frame the guilt she seems to be feeling? I will visit the facility soon, but I just can't imagine that my mom's life will be any better by immediately jumping back into the caregiver role that has consumed her life for almost a decade.

Any words of wisdom would be sincerely appreciated."

My grandpa has deteriorated a lot recently and it’s been pretty rough. He moved in with me and my family a month or so ago and there has recently been some issues. My mom thinks I might be his “trigger person.” The other week I came home and walked in and at first he thought someone broke in and messed up our living room but he was otherwise unbothered that I was there. I tried to explain to him that it was my younger brother who is a huge mess maker and had been playing with a close friend earlier that day but he didn’t believe it and didn’t remember my brother. Then he claimed it was me or one of my friends and had issues recognizing me so he walked over to the neighbors house and tried to get them to call my mom because he didn’t trust me. When we got back to our house after he had contacted my mom he locked me out because he didn’t trust me and was going to “let the police handle it.” I understand that it’s not his fault and it’s a disease but it has been really rough. He has been very emotional because his girlfriend of 30+ years passed away a few weeks ago. We are looking into a home but we’re not sure how it’ll go. He thinks that it’s his house and he also has had issues when he tries to feed my dog but we can’t just feed her whatever because she is older and has underlying health issues. It’s just been troubling me for awhile and I just wanted to put it out there I guess. Sorry for the ramble and i know it’s all over the place and hard to follow but I just wanted to know if anyone had similar experiences and how to deal with it? Thank you so much.

"He everyone. My dad is 59 and he doesn't have Alzheimers. I've just got a question about it. Your memory slowly getting worse is just something that happens when you get older and that's happening to my dad a little. My question is that when we discuss things like sports, movies, music, sometimes he'll forget the name of a song or an actor or a movie. Like he'll say ""my favourite song from that album is, ugh what's it called?"" Then he'll sing a bit of the lyrics or something. I know what he's talking about so I say the name of the song. There's been quite a few times where he's forgotten the name of something and he's trying to figure it out himself and if I gave him a few extra seconds, he would but I just tell him what he's trying to remember. Is it good to tell him or should I let him figure it out? I'm just wondering if what I'm doing can in anyway lead to problems or if I'm actually helping. Thanks."

"Hi, I really hope I’m in the right place, and that I don’t sound like a monster.

My grandmother has Alzheimer’s. I’d say it’s mid-stage, and she needs someone at home with her at all times. The symptoms are all textbook, and I won’t go on about how horrible it is.

I’ve lived with her, my mom, and my aunt since I was 6 and I’m 20 now. I’m in college several hours away, but I’m home during the summer. I have very high hopes for my career—I’m a cellist and I’m often very busy with school, but it feels like my home situation is sucking the life out of me, and that my young years are being wasted due to this.

It’s a devastating disease to watch, and I do not have the emotional capacity to deal with this. I love my grandma, and I always will, but she’s not really here anymore. I’ve been emotionally preparing myself for what’s to come for years now. I never know what I’ll come home to each semester. 

I want to move away from home permanently and get on my feet, because my career and my hopes and dreams are so important to me. My aunt is retired (and an alcoholic) and my mom is unemployed, and I have no other family. I want to save my mom and myself and live a peaceful life. It’s hard on my mom’s mental health; she can barely function. It sounds so awful and selfish, but I’m just so young and I want to enjoy my life. My childhood was extremely traumatic; my mom and I were both abused by my dad. My mom doesn’t deserve to live like this either. I wish someone could just save me from this."
"Hi everyone! I’m new to this group, and have recently joined seeking much needed advice and/or support from others that have more experience in dealing with Alzheimer’s disease. 

Both of my in laws have been recently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, and it is rapidly progressing. My husband is the one that deals with absolutely everything pertaining to their needs, wants, appointment, finances, etc. They now heavily rely on him for everything. The issue is that my father in law calls my husband on average about 10-20 times a day, and it is taking a huge toll on my husband both mentally and emotionally. Many, if not most of the phone calls are to repeat the same information that has already been given to him. My husband is burning out pretty badly and it is affecting his work, his moods, his relationships and most importantly, his well being. My father in law really struggles with anxiety and whenever he has any upcoming appointments (which is very often, if not everyday), he needs constant reassurance and repeating of the times, dates and details of all the appointments and subsequent information given. 

I’m at a total loss on how to deal with things and am struggling to cope. I don’t even deal with a quarter of what my husband does, and I have lately been feeling like I’m at a total loss on how to deal with this. 

My question to you all, as a community, how do you cope with loved ones suffering from this disease? What, if anything, can help them to worry less and thrive better with this disease? Is there any suggestions on things that can be done to help them rely a little less on us, to ease the burden? Any suggestions on utilizing anything to help them to worry less and help them to remember upcoming appointments? 

We bought them a whiteboard to do a daily schedule on, just to cover the upcoming day, to keep it simple. My husband will give him a call daily and get him to write down the events for the following day, although we are both worried that it will only be more confusing for him or he won’t remember to utilize it. 

We want them to thrive and do the best they can, with the circumstances. We do everything in our power to make sure they are looked after and keep them as happy and comfortable as possible. They both live together in a retirement home, but are not yet to the point that they need around the clock assisted care. Unfortunately because they are not yet at that point, they heavily rely on my husband for everything, but we want to try and delay their move to special care as long as possible because when they do, they will not only be potentially separated (sleeping in separate rooms), but it is a hospital-like setting and we worry their cognition and well-being would decline much more rapidly once they are there. We moved them to our city over Christmas and got them into the best retirement facility in the city, with the nicest, biggest and best suite possible and even with that, they aren’t happy, so I can only imagine how they would cope or feel in extended care. 

Any tips, tricks, suggestions, advice or support is VERY much appreciated and I’m grateful for anyone taking the time to read this. Thank you."
"Hey, all. I hope this is the right place for this post.

My sister and I are hiring an in-home care worker for my mom, whose Alzheimer's is rapidly advancing.

We're wondering how overnight workers are typically paid? Are they paid hourly like daytime workers? Or are they paid differently given that a big chunk of the night they're sleeping (though on call)."
"Hi everyone. As the title says, I need some advice about meeting someone with Alzheimer’s for the first time. It’s my boyfriends mother. We’ve been dating for about a month now, and I have yet to meet her (although I do want to!) I grew up with my grandparents so I know how to act/treat older people with respect and kindness, but I’d be lying if I said I am a bit worried about meeting her. I’m hesitant about how to act and what to say, and above all I want to make sure I don’t hurt my boyfriends feelings or make him feel awkward about it. I really care for him a lot, and I can see the pain in his eyes when I ask him how his mom is doing. Apparently she is quite advanced in her Alzheimer’s, so she most likely won’t remember me at all, but that’s no excuse. I’d be really grateful if anyone could give me some tips or share their own experiences!

Edit: Thanks to everyone who has responded so far! You have all given me great advice and I really feel much more prepared than I did before. :)"
"81 year old Mom was dx'ed with mid level Alz.   Dr. said she failed tests many 2nd graders would pass and has the cognition level of a 7 year old, but I'm having a hard time reconciling what the Dr says with what I see.  

I'm not in denial, but I feel like she should have more symptoms than forgetting people's names.  Mom is very aware that she's got memory loss but my impression was that with Alz the short term memory is the first to go.  I wouldn't expect her to recall a Dr's appointment with a dementia Dr that she had a week ago, for instance, but she does.  I wouldn't expect her to tell me her cousin called her to wish her a happy birthday, I wouldn't expect her to remember that her friend had spent a week at her son's house to take care of his pets while he traveled.   

The Dr. kept saying it's not what she CAN remember, but what she CAN'T remember and I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around this.  What am I missing?"
"Would this be a good idea? On the one side, I think it will help me understand what she's going trough and might help me understand her needs etc better. On the other hand, I'm kind of scared that it will completely horrify me and make me super depressed. Could I get your guys take on this? Thank you in advance."
"My grandma is in her late 70s and has been in assisted care for about seven years and has been in a memory care facility for the past two and a half years. The facility is close to my cousins and they visit her a few times a week (now that they’re all vaccinated) but I live a few hours away and due to school and work can’t see her more than a few times a year. I try to call her once a week but she never picks up. Her caretakers or my cousins will play her answering machine for her once in awhile, so I leave her a message, but it’s not the same as actually getting to talk to her. On the few occasions I do get to talk to her, it’s really difficult. She doesn’t have much short or long term memory and has lost a lot of weight and a few teeth. Overall she seems to be content, but doesn’t have much awareness of what’s going on around her. She is a really incredible, smart, funny woman and I’ll try and remind her of stories she told me when I was little or talk to her about how my college classes are going, but she just sort of smiles and says “That’s wonderful” or “How exciting” to everything. Does anyone have advice on how to engage with her more? I know that we won’t have huge deep conversations and she won’t be the same as she used to be, but I want to try and entertain her or have some sort of real conversation if possible. Her days are pretty monotonous (not that she remembers what happened the day before anyways) and that just makes me really sad, especially since I’m not able to spend much time with her in person. Is trying to remind someone with Alzheimer’s of stories/events that they no longer remember helpful? I’ll usually try and talk to her about stories she told me from her college days, but I don’t want to confuse her or stress her out. What are some things people have found helpful when talking to family members with Alzheimer’s? If anyone has advice on connecting with people when you can’t see them in person that would be incredibly helpful as well. My grandma’s physical health has been declining over the past year and although she’s survived through a lot, I know that her days are starting to come to a close and I just want to spend as much (virtual) time with her as I can. I’ve thought about sending her letters and photo books or maybe making her playlists but I’m not totally sure how I would get them to her or how much of an impact they would have. I’d love to know what other people have found helpful in situations like this!"
"Adults who have parents with Alzheimer’s- what things did your kids do (or you wish they had done) to help you through everything?

My grandma has Alzheimer’s, around Stage 6, and lives in a memory care facility a few states away from my dad (but in the same town as his brothers, so she has family close by to visit her). I’m in college so I don’t spend much time with my dad, but I know this whole thing is really hard on him and want to help him as much as I can. He’s a proud guy and a really good dad so he never really talks to my siblings and I about how this is affecting him and has told us not to worry about him, but obviously we still do. He and my mom are divorced, his dad died over a decade ago, and my siblings all moved out of our hometown for college, and I just don’t want him to go through this alone. He’s not the type of person to answer honestly if I just outright ask him how he’s doing and won’t respond well to being pushed to talk about his emotions, but I want him to know that he’s got support if he needs it. 

If anyone who’s been in mine or my dad’s spot has things that helped in this situation that would be awesome! Or if you have things you wished you had done or things your kids could have done that would’ve been a big help."
"My grandmother has lived with my mom (and sometimes me) since 2013. She’s gotten steadily worse over the years to the point where her short term memory now lasts about 20-30 seconds. She can’t remember when she’s eaten so she eats constantly if someone doesn’t stop her. She’ll say she goes on walks but her feet are so swollen since actually getting her to leave the house to go anywhere requires at least half an hour of persuasion and fighting. Her personality is all but gone, and all that’s left of the old her is her ego. Sometimes I look at her and think “Who is this old hag and what has she done with my grandmother?” And then I feel guilty because I know she can’t help it and can’t control it. She used to be a very independent person but now she’s constantly asking what she can do and we tell her that we’ve got it handled because she just gets in the way if she tries to help. Even simple tasks must be explained to her very simply and repeatedly, and even then she gets it wrong half the time. It’s especially hard on my mom. My grandmother wasn’t always the greatest mother to my mom and now she relies on my mom for everything. She can’t make food for herself and she does no self hygiene unless forced and assisted. She’d wear the same robe, nightgown, and pair of underwear all the time if we let her. She’s turned into a child and it’s heartbreaking to see my once strong, smart, interesting, enigmatic, and independent grandmother be reduced to this. She’s travelled all over the world, met all sorts of interesting people, and done all sorts of amazing things and now she doesn’t remember any of it. She used to have these amazing stories about her life, but then they got wilder and less accurate as she gradually forgot them one by one. Now the only story she really remembers is about how the Nazi’s invaded Denmark and how her family helped Jews escape to Sweden. She’ll make up stories, trying to relate to anything someone tells her. 99% of those stories is bullshit but I know she doesn’t know that. She’s always been the kind of person who took control of a conversation, but now she stills tries but has nothing to say. Her English is also slowly slipping. She’s forgetting names of things, even things she used to love. Her favourite flowers are daffodils and tulips, but she doesn’t remember the names of either of them most of the time. I miss who she used to be. I know if pre-Alzheimer’s her met her now, she’d have absolutely no time for current her. She’d also be horrified at what’s happened to her. I also know if she still had her wits about her, there’s no way in hell she’d still be living with us. She’d probably be off travelling or spending time with her mom or sister. I feel like I love her less than I used to and I hate it but she stresses me and my moms out so much I don’t know what to do. She’s on the wait list for a care home but they probably won’t have a spot for her for two years. My mother and I have started counting how many times she brings up the Nazis or Trump (she hates him) because that’s the only way we can cope with hearing it over and over and over and over and over and over again. We know it’s always the first time for her but it’s hard to not let the frustration show after she’s asked about something for what feels like the millionth time. I really applaud and highly respect everyone who does elder care for a living. Living with my grandmothers has taught me that I don’t have that kind of patience. Maybe it’s easier if you’re not related to them; if you didn’t know them before. She doesn’t know she had Alzheimer’s and there’s no point in telling her because it’ll just upset her and she’ll forget again in a couple minutes but be in a bad mood all day. She’s very healthy physically, which is almost worse in a way because it means she’ll most likely die from this disease. My family is typically long lived, so she’ll keep getting worse for years. We’re doing all we can to slow the progression of the disease as much as possible, but we know there’s only so much we can do. I do feel very lucky that she’s gotten sweeter as her memory has gotten worse. Her father killed himself and we suspect he was in the beginning stages of Alzheimer’s, along with other issues, and that’s one of the reasons he did what he did. We do our best to keep her comfy and happy, but it wears us out. I’ve seen my mother cry from the stress of it all and that breaks my heart too. My step-grandmother is also living with us for the time being (she doesn’t have Alzheimer’s) and luckily she gets along great with my grandmother. But her being here does mean that my grandmother is awake and in the living room more often which means she asks more questions, reads the headlines from the paper repeatedly, and asks the same questions repeatedly too. I do my best to be supportive and answer her million questions. There are good parts, like how I can tell her personal things and get them off my chest without worrying about her telling anyone and she is happy to listen to my rants. I don’t really have an end to this particular rant; I just had to get it off my chest. None of my friends have family with Alzheimer’s so I wanted to post this here, where I’m sure other people are going through something similar."
"My grandma died back in December and my grandpa has gone downhill fast. My grandma made us promise to live with him, which we would've done anyway. He keeps saying he doesn't want to move. We got approved for a loan and got his house appraised and he had no problem with that, but when we talk about finding houses he gets stubborn. Its worse on his bad days, but still. How do we convince him to move? He forgets we're looking at houses and when we tell him he is surprised and upset because he doesnt remember.


He's still there enough that he refused to give mom power of attorney, but she does have medical power of attorney over him. We want to talk to his doctor, but the problem is he doesnt remember he has Alzheimer's(oh the irony) so when I ask for his paperwork for his doctor he brings me the stuff for his k 
Nee replacement which is in a completely different network. 


On the upside, we've removed three tons of recycling from his house. My grandma was a 'clean' hoarder, but kept every magazine, paper, etc. Would print out emails and keep them. Her office looked like a maze. He went through the stuff we deemed recycling. At first I was annoyed, but it kept him busy and out of the way and he didnt end up pulling anything back out. We also got the basement gone through(looked like the warehouse scene in Indiana Jones) and have taken probably a Uhaul amount to goodwill."
"As I am laying in bed crying I just needed to find a group to talk about this. My mother has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and everytime I get back to my place after visiting my parents I'm just so depressed. I know it's hard for my mom and of course for my dad. But it's hard for me as well. I see my mother unable to perform very easy task or being unsure of how to eat an egg and I get so angry. Because for me, sometimes there are two people. The mom I used to have and this new one. And my mom used to be so skilled and she could remember so much and manage our family. And I know that I shouldn't get angry at her. It's not her fault. But it's like - i want my old mom back. And then I'm angry at me for hating this new mom who isn't what I need and want. Like - what kind of monster am I? 
Is there anyone else out here dealing with Alzheimer's in a relative and having a hard time handling it? What might help?"
"Jesus christ, mum decided to shit on the hallway carpet instead of the toilet. Then refused to accept it was her, suggesting it was one of the many people who pass through the house (there are not people passing through the house) . After accepting I was not going to be able to get her to clean up her mess I've been down with plastic bags, a sponge and some dettol. Figured a face mask might help with the smell. I'm not good with poo, there was heaving, and then a mask full of vomit. Genuinely wish I didn't exist.

We've had a few issues with pee which I can deal with, poo is a new low which is beyond me. Any suggestions for things to help please?"
"Hi everyone! My mother is a 53 year old with early onset Alzheimer’s. I’ve been going through a lot of our home videos recently and I noticed her voice has changed quite a bit since she started having memory problems. You know the voice you would do if you were imitating yourself as a child? That’s what her voice is all the time now. I guess I feel like it just used to be a lot brighter, and I was wondering if this is me in my own head or something others have noticed. Thanks so much for reading."
"After arguing with my MIL for a year that she can't take care of him by herself, she finally agreed to put my FIL in a memory care facility. He is only 66, but has very severe early-onset Alzheimer's that basically took him from 100% to a shell of a human in about 18 months. 

We checked him into the facility in January, and now 4 months later they just called and said they can't handle him there. He is aggressive towards other patients and staff, and recently just attacked a nurse and broke her wrist. They said we need to find him a private caregiver to stay in the room in the facility with him for 12+ hours a day. We absolutely cannot afford this (we saw rates close to $20,000/month). They said if we don't have a caregiver for him within the next month then they are kicking him out. 

We are looking into what kind of financial aid or medicare coverage we can find. 

What other options do we have? This sounds like a medication issue to me - can't they sedate him? The guy has no idea what planet he is on and can't identify even his closest family members. He is confused and scared all the time. What other options do we have if a memory care specialty facility can't even help him?"
"This is how it goes for him.

He wakes up early, at around 6:45 AM, gets his day clothes on (he sleeps in his shirt anyway). He says goodbye to the woman that lives in that house and cleans it, telling her he has to return to his own house. My mother sighs and wishes his a good day.

He gets into the elevator (the apartment is at the third floor of  a condominium), he gets down at the ground floor and without getting out of the building he calls my mother on the phone. He asks ""are you home yet?"", she patientily replies ""yes, I'm here, please come"".

He gets into the elevator again, goes up, opens the apartment's door with his own keys (this is paramount), undresses and prepares his breakfast. Then he goes to bed again for about an hour, or until he gets confused with some thought and has to ask a question to my mom.

This happens every single day. On the bad days he get extremely angry at the people occupying the house *he bought* before getting out of it. My mother and older brother can't do anything but indulge him and letting him go, hopying he won't get out of the building or too far anyway. This comedy sounds funny, but it's indeed exhausting for everyone."
"My mom is 60 year old female she had an MRI done on her brain this past Monday for on going cognitive issues for the last 5 years. I am not looking for an Alzheimers diagnosis but more of understanding of her MRI and I like this subreddit. I posted on here 2 years ago about her issues and will reference those posts at the end just so you all have a back story. Since I posted her Memory has def gotten worse but she hasn't forgot who anyone is or where she's at and still is able to drive like down the road to the store and sometimes 10 mins away if I got a doctor appt. I'm always with her when she does drive. Her short term memory is shot. She was long term user opioids for pain and even used a fentanyl patch for 11+ years. She is no longer on them after accidental overdose 5 years ago. We don't know if the opioids use is the cause of the issues or what. Last year when she had the MRI done it was normal. She's been getting them done each year and she does see a neurologist but she can't get into her doctor until June. In an MRI from a few years ago it showed ischemic changes but then like I said last year it said her MRI was normal. This was the MRI she had done on this past Monday and I was wondering if someone could help explain this because my sister and I are beside ourselves with worry. In the MRI it said that she has mild cerebral volume loss, multiple scattered FOCI of T2 prolongation seen of white matter that suggests chronic small vessel ischemic disease. The impression they got from the MRI is that there is cerebral volume loss with chronic small vessel ischemic disease. We just don't understand what any of this means. She will be seeing her neurologist again in June that she has been following up with. My sister and I are so worried though. She's the only living parent we have   
left. :/

"My mom (70) was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s about 2 years ago. She’s always had horrible anxiety from a life’s worth of trauma. But after her twin sister died she couldn’t recover and I guess that’s when her Alzheimer’s started. 

I realized right away that when my mom gets anxious and overwhelmed she can’t really keep up with conversations or even remember something from a minute ago. Her native language is Spanish so I can actually communicate with her perfectly when she speaks Spanish. It’s like the Alzheimer’s takes a break and she speaks normally, but her English is just fading so fast. 

The doctor put her on a low dose of Zoloft to help with the anxiety, but it hasn’t done much, 7months later. She also turns to alcohol for her anxiety. I explained to my dad to tell my mom’s doctor about how bad her anxiety is and how she gets very irritated and overwhelmed. Her misophonia is so bad (like noises such as a blender will cause her to go into a rage.) 

But her doctor refuses to put her on any medication for purely anxiety because “she can become addicted”... This enraged me because I have seen my poor mom suffer a lifetime of anxiety and at this age she deserves to breathe and be calm finally. 

Have any of you been given anxiety medicine for someone with Alzheimer’s? Is it not a good mix? 
Thank you! Any suggestions would be so appreciated."
"My MIL has dementia and over her life has acquired several family members belonging - like, most of the things that they owned. Now that she has dementia fairly bad we have moved in with her. She can still move and talk but it varies day to day and she isn’t capable of taking care of her self in pretty much anyway (she attempts to handle the personal hygiene but we don’t wanna cross that bridge until we have to). That being said she has grown accustomed to al of these things in her houses that we now also live in (my husband I and our 9 month old). 

It’s overwhelming. Almost 3000sqft and basically no room is clutter free. Some rooms are only clutter and things that are completely unused. Others have been hacked at but still busy with things from several past family members. It’s equally as hard for my husband to let things go because he loved those people too (grand parents, his father and great aunt.) Obviously I respect their memories and don’t want to push anyone. But with her dementia all the clutter makes it so much worse and dangerous not just for her but for our baby. 

My husband really wants to find a way to keep as much stuff and keep it all at home but some of the larger bulkier items like couches and chairs that aren’t used take up needed space. And donating these items only cause rage. Obviously I get it. I’m not trying to be insensitive but when the clutter causes more pain the pleasure where do you draw the line and how do you intervene? My husband is willing to let a lot of things go and that helps but at the same time when do we start just throwing stuff out or is there a better way? She honestly won’t part with any of it. 

I need advice. I love her and she is the sweetest and I hate that I only met her at this time in her life because I love the things she loves but her safety is in danger and her life would be so much better if she had a proper clean and hygienic clutter free home."
"Hi. I am desperately looking for anyone who may have some insight on Alzheimer’s in people already completely blind. 

My dad (65) has been blind for the past 15 or so years. About 4 years ago he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and it has since progressed rapidly so that he no longer knows who any of us are on most days. I think this is made worse by the fact that he can’t see us. 

Until about 2 years ago he could still get around well enough but since then his mental map has deteriorated and he often gets confused about WHERE he is. 

So many of the suggestions for coping and helping have to do with visually seeing things. 

I even contacted several of the Alzheimer’s organizations directly to see if they had any resources for people dealing with multiple disabilities. They had nothing, said they would look into it. But after a few months of fruitless email exchanges I haven’t heard anything else. 

We finally admitted him to a home last month because my mother was caring for him alone and he required 24 he care. 

However, they don’t want him walking around since he can’t see where he is going/is confused about where he is going and I am horrified to think that this man who has been active his whole life and is still in fine physical health is being confined to a chair most of the day. 

Also my mom is basically a hoarder so I guarantee their home was far less safe for him to wander than his sparsely furnished nursing home room. 

Anyway...just looking to connect with someone who might have had similar experiences and has some suggestions or just a familiar struggle to share.

Edit to add: 

due to his Alzheimer’s he struggled to keep track of the cane he originally was using until it was just in effective and also sometimes forgets he is blind or why he can’t see. This is a different problem then my worry about his care at the home. Just another part of his struggle that I’d like to connect with someone else and compare stories on."
"Hey everyone, I'm hoping maybe someone could give me some advice on how to tackle this issue. My Dad's symptoms have been worsening for the past 3-4 years and now his safety is at risk.

Long Story: About 2 years ago, our house (Dad's childhood home) had caved in forcing us to move to a rental house and eventually moving to our now home. My mom told me he has been exhibited symptoms for a while but kept them away from our knowledge until moving.

 Even since we settled into our now home, he exhibits more sun-downing quiet often, forgets his wife and who she is to him, doesn't know locally where he is at (stayed in the same city just on the outskirts), has left home multiple times for unusual reasons, typically going the wrong way. Other instances have happened where it's very overwhelming.

 As a result, this has made us get a security system installed so we can be alerted which direction he goes. Today he decided to jump our gates (6ft tall) and go running, because of this, there was no alarm set off. It's been over 4 times where we have had to drive to look for him (thank god for GPS on phones). He ran opposite of traffic, in rocks along a busy road, with no water and didn't answer his phone, today was the worst incident

I had confronted him last Summer when it became too much for me to witness only to be told 'I will do better, I'll work on it'.

 My mom has been taking it the worst because she's losing her husband every day but doesn't seem willing to put him in a memory care unit  We had convinced him to go to a doctor only for him to get upset the day before and refused to go. He hasn't gotten violent. Not sure how to help in this situation. While a diagnosis is not necessary, it would be nice to finally get a solid answer on all this and medical advice on how to handle it or prevent it from worsening as fast (If that's possible). 


Any advice would be helpful.

"My mother in law is in serious decline and my wife is just rolling with the punches. MIL has always been feisty but she has recently had the police called on her for trying to break in to the neighbor’s house, not out of confusion but to confront him about something that never happened. She cannot remember what was spoken about minutes ago and when she’s at our house she repeatedly tells me how much our kitchen reminds her of the one in the house she grew up in and that she can’t picture the one in the house she’s lived in for the last fifty years. I understand that Alzheimer’s is messing with her memory and the very long term memories are the ones she can recall BUT she has a weird twist where she can invent recent memories and hold them against someone. They are exclusively negative and she believes them with all her heart. The one I’m living is that I took her home Christmas morning and dumped her off at her house to spend the holiday alone. It never happened, she was with us the entire week and when she did end up going home, my wife took her. She is convinced my children who adore her and are incredibly patient with her have purposely made an effort to make her stays uncomfortable (always inventing stories about loud music or making her watch tv shows she doesn’t like) they are 10 and 12, they do exactly as they are told, especially by her. There have been many others and they seem to be coming up more and more often. 

My question is how can those “recent” memories hold so steadfastly and consistently but things that really happen are gone within minutes? Honestly, I need help understanding how this is happening and if it’s normal because I’m struggling to continue allowing into my house."
"So happy to share that my mom loves her new dog!  She is in advanced stages and this dog has cheered her up so much!  

I shared the link below for the dog.  I wish I had done this years ago.

"Hello everyone. I've been lurking in this subreddit for a while reading the stories and silently accepting the idea that I'm not as alone as I feel, but no I'm in need of some advice. 

I'm fairly new to the role of caretaker as I'm 26 caring for my 54 year old mother with early onset Alzheimers. I'm familiar with the disease after seeing it with my grandfather, but he had a stroke and wasn't able to communicate properly because of it. My mother on the other hand started out forgetting she had been diagnosed and forgetting anything was wrong. This was a problem when filing for SSDI and when trying to restrict her driving. Lately she has been consistently asking me if she still has Alzheimer's - I've never been one to lie to my mother, but every time I tell her the truth she gets very upset, tries hitting her head on things and even tries to run off like she did last night. 

Has anyone had a loved one like this and maybe have a recommendation for a better way to answer this question?"
"To be honest my dad is always been an asshole and an idiot. But now that he has early onset Alzheimer's it's only got worse. And my poor mother is getting the worst of it. He hasn't become physically violent yet. But damn you're close to it. Punched a hole in the wall a few months ago.

Starts fights over the most stupid things. Oftentimes you'll start a fight over nothing at all. As if he had an imaginary conversation in his head that he's confronting you about. Sometimes you'll have a big blow out and then a couple hours later forget it ever happened and wonder why everyone's nervous around him.

My mom's ready to just give up and leave him. But can't afford to get out on her own. Can't afford to put him into a care home. He's not far enough along to qualify for it anyway. And he's too abusive, any home would kick him out. Can't just divorce him and kick him out, he'll forget and keep showing up anyways.

Just generally feeling trapped. Sure, I can save up some money and get out of here. But I don't want to leave my mom behind to deal with this alone."
"So...my daughter spoke to my MIL’s doctor today, because it had seemed like no one else in the family besides my husband was willing to admit there’s a problem with my mother-in-law and do anything about it.  Turned out, he told my daughter that my husband’s sister took the same concerns to him A YEAR AGO. He suggested testing at MIL’s annual physical and she refused.  He said at this point, unless someone has her declared incompetent, there’s nothing he can do. I feel even worse for my husband now. He’s felt all alone in his concern for his mom, thinking no one else saw the problems or cared. His sister repeatedly tells him “it’s just old age.” Ugh. 

So now the question is what to do from this point. She’s really already at the point she shouldn’t be alone. But clearly no one wants to do anything more."
"New young caregivers support group

 I’m not sure if this is really allowed or helps anyone at all but my friend started this caregiver support group for anyone who is 35 and younger. It’s focused on dementia for grandparents but she will allow other young caregivers in the group. 

I do not have a Facebook but she sent me the name. 

Its called Taking Care of Grandma A Young Caregivers Support Group. She is med and finance POA for her grandma and does not have any family really who can help so shes in it alone making decision for her grandma with dementia.

If you are 35 and younger this group might be for you

"Hello, all.  

My wife and I are each either side of 50 years old.  We have always planned to ""get out"" and go see the country (which neither of us has really done).  My mother was placed in a memory care facility about 2 years ago.  I care for her dog now and see her about every two weeks with the dog (since COVID restrictions lightened up a bit).  She's VERY high functioning.  I'm her only child and her POA/ Trustee, but she has a dozen friends and family who visit her frequently.

I'm struggling with a choice we're intending to make.  We intend to sell our home and buy a truck and RV and travel the country, in a new place every couple of weeks - perhaps for the next 3 years (ish).  I would still fly back approximately every 3 months (or for any emergencies) to spend a few days with her, but I wouldn't likely be able to bring her dog to see her (the dog is getting older, but she LOVES the dog).  

Knowing that she'll need me around more in the future as she declines, and knowing that we're not getting any younger ourselves, we feel like we need this adventure in our lives now or perhaps never. Professionally and financially, we're finally in a place where we can do this.  But then I feel bad that I'm not going to be able to visit as often and that she won't be able to see the dog as often.

I devote a lot of time to her as her POA and Trustee, and I feel good about how I'm managing her affairs, but I need someone to tell me that this is a terrible plan and I'm a terrible person or tell me that it's ok to take care of myself and do what I want to do with my life while I still can.  This is an internal battle that I'm truly struggling with and any advice or tips would be welcome.

Thanks in advance!"
"My mother in law was diagnosed with Alzheimer's about a year and a half ago. She currently lives with my SIL who is her carer. Her illness is progressing slowly (at least in my opinion). She can still play golf,  use her iPad almost independently, make breakfast, do some household chores. However, she tends to forget what was said 20 minutes ago in a conversation etc, ask the same question again and again, gets confused in unfamiliar settings.

I'm pregnant, with our baby coming in a few months. When discussing who could help me with the baby when I need a break and some time off, my husband doesn't want to consider an occasional nanny because his mother can babysit. He claims she is good with babies, had three of her own and used to help with her other grandchildren. I don't doubt she was amazing with children, but I just don't feel comfortable leaving my baby in her care, one on one. I'm happy for her to spend time with the baby when my husband and I are watching, but I can't fathom leaving her to babysit. 

Am I being unreasonable? How can I explain to my husband that leaving a baby in the care of someone who needs care themselves is simply not safe, without hurting his feelings?"
"My mom was diagnosed with vascular dementia 2 years ago and she only has one symptom of that my dad is having an affair.  He is 84 and verified he is not (in case you were wondering as everyone asks).

Her delusions enrage her as she thinks he sneaks out in the middle of the night (cameras on the house does not help as she thinks they are hacked), that ""the woman"" follows them when they drive and that she watches them from the trees in the backyard.     


Her memory is still perfect. Intelligent. On good days (without delusions) she is almost perfectly normal and sweet.  No UTI (verified several times) and no thyroid issues (verified by endocrinologist).   


Is this normal to only have this psychotic delusion that kicks in 1 out of every 3 days or so? (Sundowning does occur)"
"My boyfriend's mother has Alzheimer's and her sleep schedule has been rough and it has taken a toll on his job trying to take care of her. Many nursing homes neglect the people they take care of, how would someone find a good nursing home that takes good care of their patients?"
"Hey friends - 

A lot of posts have been about how to keep track of our loved ones as they wander. Apple announced their airtags yesterday - and from what I’ve seen, it could be a helpful solution. Think it works a lot like any other iOS / apple device where you can enable ‘find my…’ on it. I’m not sure of the range - but it’s a hell of a lot cheaper (and likely easier) than convincing our person to wear an Apple Watch or carry their phone, etc. 

My dad wasn’t a wanderer (thank heavens) but I know how incredibly stressful taking care of someone with this dumb disease is. If it helps make your life a little easier, it’s worth it. 

Lots of different cases and whatnot, but the belt / collar case in this Gizmodo article seems ideal. My dad wore his belt every single day. With his suspenders. Silly goose.

"So My Dad and I both have some issues with memory. His was initially thought to be due to B12 vitamin deficiency. 

However, even after taking vitamins he continues to forget things like whether he has eaten something from the fridge, recalls about our lives in a disordered way as well, and forgets things like when major events happened in our lives. 

Did anyone else have similar experiences before diagnosis with family members? My sister thinks he is lying at times but it is pretty clear to me and my mother that he has worsening memory problems that won't be solved by vitamins."
"My step mum now has 24/7 care. My Dad still lives at home with her but he just can't cope with all of her care needs. She has PCA so ha almost her ability to read or really watch TV. The only thing she wants to do is wall, continuously. Today she told the carer to leave her alone and that she was going to call the police on them. She then tried to walk across a busy dual carriageway to get away from the carer. The carer has, understandably refused to walk with her anymore as she feels like it is dangerous.

My Dad wants to be able to come to visit us and his grandson once a week but now feels he can't leave. If they lock the front door and say she can't go for a walk she starts banging on it and screaming that she is being held hostage.

I don't really know why I'm posting. It's just so unfair. My poor Dad is at breaking point."
"I am working on a Phase 3 clinical trial for Alzheimer's disease and we are finding it difficult to reach out to those in the Alzheimer's community with so many in person events and support groups no longer taking place. 

I am wondering if anyone here has suggestions for good ways to share information about our study to people who might be recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease or are looking to potentially learn about trials for their loved ones. 

&#x200B;

Any help is appreciated. Thank you!"
"Today my mom let me know that my dad (early onset, mid stages) has been demanding to speak to or write a letter to the Pope about his situation. He has never been very religious (and never catholic) but is taking a very ‘I need to speak to the manager’ approach to this delusion. Thankfully it passes quickly and amuses my mom. Just wanted to share a funny-ish story in an otherwise very plateaued situation"
"Any tips for caregivers to manage stress and be able to have a life outside of taking care of a parent with dementia ?

I find myself trapped at the house and unable to get away to enjoy anything.  I am in my 40's and not married and no kids.  My mother is 75, has dementia and takes several important meds for heart transplant and other issues.  My brother has pancreatic cancer so has been super stressful the last year and not sure how to get away for a break.  

Just struggling for ways to ""escape"" my situation from time to time."
"My dad's (74) dementia has progressed -- the last time he took a MoCA test (last year), I think he scored about a six or a seven. He is still living at home with my mom (74). My siblings and I have been encouraging her for at least a year to get some in-home help, so she can run errands, go to activities, and get a break regularly. She has resisted, for a lot of reasons.

We just learned today that dad has stepped out of a moving vehicle (happened this week, while my uncle is visiting them). Dad walked almost a mile down the road, while they looped back around to get him. Mom admitted to my brother that it wasn't actually the first time he had done that. He will also sometimes leave the house if he gets frustrated or angry. I am looking at bracelets for him (that are not removable by the wearer). His main health concern is the dementia. I would assume it should say his name, that he has dementia, his address, and my mom's phone number? Anybody have good luck with bracelets? I have been looking on Medical ID Fashions online -- I want to get one that is comfortable, but sturdy.

Also, against our advice, mom is taking him away from home this summer to visit her family. They are being driven half-way across the US by friends, then flying home. She is now saying they may stay for six weeks (originally, it was two weeks). I offered to go stay with him, but mom declined. She wants him to see everybody one last time. (He no longer knows any of them -- my mom is usually his ""girlfriend"" or ""the lady."") I have spoken to his social worker, who spoke to his primary dementia physician, and they have said they do not want him to go -- my mom knows this. But we can't make them stay at home. We know that you can enable the child locks in the back seats. They will have to stay the night at least once on the way there (I think it's about a 19-hour drive). Does anyone have advice for road and vacation safety? They will be staying at a lake place, and I am so nervous about him getting lost in lake country. The lake place is yards from the water.

My siblings and I are going to move our messaging from ""you need an assistant"" to ""now is the time you need to pursue getting him into residential care."" We try to be gentle and non-judgmental. As is often the case, this is an elderly person taking care of another elderly person. Mom can be very stubborn, and stops speaking to us if she feels pressured, so it is a delicate procedure to guide her to better care for dad and for herself. Thanks for any advice."
"My grandma was diagnosed with Alzheimer's three or four years ago and so it's been getting more and more rough. She lives with me and my mom, stepfather, my brother and sister, and it's getting to the point where we can't handle it anymore. We're all doing our best obviously. This past week has been the worst. Every day, her episodes are starting with her saying she wants to go home, and she tries to leave the house, and after not being able to leave, she cries. She thinks she's being trapped somewhere, I guess, and that we're being evil by not taking her home. It's been happening at least once a day for the past week. Last Friday, she started banging her head on the window because she wanted to escape. I've heard her say ""Please God, take me. Take me right here and right now."" Yesterday before I went to work, she told me ""I'm sick. I can't take care of myself."" And then, she said she feels like she's in this evil place. 

It is absolutely traumatic and upsetting to see my grandma this way. Someone I've known and loved my whole life, who was a completely different person before (obviously). It's really affecting me. I can't get it out of my mind. I can't focus on anything else. It's just that we seem to have entered a new stage of this disease, and it's been awful to watch. My boyfriend told me yesterday that he's concerned about me b/c I'm really really fixating on it and it seems to be taking a toll on me. He's right. My friends and coworkers have all noticed too. My brother told me if it's affecting me that much, then I don't have to feel the need to be as involved as I've been. But, I'm still just really having a hard time dealing with it, internally. What can I do?! What can I do to calm myself down more? I still need to step in and help but I need to take care of myself."

"My mom has dementia with Lewy body. She’s 75. I’m 39 (single no kids and actively trying for both). My moms condition majorly worsened the last 6 months. But not horrible. It’s an insane depressing but grateful place to be. She knows everyone. But she can’t be alone. She won’t admit it. She’s depressed. She’s terrified. No short term memory. Cant
Really reason but also can. Anyway. I know this will only get worse. I have her on every med and with every doctor. I know how this ends up. Her dad and sister had it too. I know the deal. It’s my worst nightmare came to life. She was my best friend. Good morning texts. Good night texts. Knew where each other was at evert moment. How am I ever supposed to be happy again? Genuinely. I have a great boyfriend. Were tying for a baby after a recent miscarriage. But I don’t see ever being truly happy ever again. Not losing my mom like this."
"My 76yo grandmother has been in and out of doctors offices for the past 2 months, we don't have a diagnosis yet, though her doctor is on the same page as me as far as assuming it's Alzheimer's of some sort. She owns a business and recently got it into a bunch of trouble which took some time for them to get out of and she is stuck in the mindset that she needs to get up every day and go to work, because that's all shes known lately. Probbaly for the past 40 years. They've hired someone else to essentially do the bookwork and man the front desk so that she can stay home, but she doesn't like being left out of things shop-related, and when she goes there, she doesn't know what she's doing and when she tries, she just messes things up and is sending her business downhill. She should retire--- I know she's thought about it, and I've tried to talk her into staying home nicely... my main point, I suppose--- is that noone has power of attorney for her yet but she really needs to just stay home and I don't know how to get her to do that without being rude about it or taking her car keys. Shes always been very independent and she has no intention of stopping. She lets me take her to all her doctor appointments because if she tries to go anywhere but work she gets lost and she refuses to get a cellphone. She got violent with her employee today and she's never been the violent type but I know that he's been getting frustrated with her being at the shop and she's said that she's scared of him because he reminds her of her awful exhusband... I think he triggered her somehow, but thats straying away from my main concern.... I've tried to talk her into staying home and it won't matter if she agrees because she'll just get up the next day and get ready for work and go. Anything we tell her goes in one ear and out the other. I'm at a loss, and its time to get an attorney involved, I know that, but is there a nice way for me to do it? She practically raised me and these past two months have driven ME crazy trying to keep her happy, and it breaks my heart to see her so broken without realizing she is. She tells me the same stories over and over and then gets confused that she's already told me--- I can't accept her word for anything... she asked me to take her out for lunch at KFC today and I did and she tried to order a cheeseburger, and when I explained to her that we were at KFC and they didn't have cheeseburgers and she accepted that, but then I asked her again what she wanted, and she tried ordering herself a cheeseburger, again... Idk what to do. Help... please... I apologize that this is so long... I took the opportunity to vent a little bit... I appreciate any feedback."
"My dad is 57 and has been showing signs for the past 5 years. At first we thought it was bipolar disorder because it involved a lot of mood swings and arguments. He still isn’t diagnosed because it doesn’t run in our family but in the past 2 years he is unable to work, drive, has no short term memory, has no idea about our finances, does not know when to eat or how to work any household electronics/appliances, has to be reminded to shower or wash his hands. I am shocked at how quickly he regressed. 

Has anyone else experienced this? When he gets diagnosed officially- what stage will he be in? Does this all count towards it? When your parents or relatives get diagnosed before 60, how long do they live in this in between limbo? How much longer do they have? He’s still somewhat independent when my mom works if she leaves reminders but the doctors tell her he cannot be alone. And yet no official diagnosis. We’ve been dealing with disability for over a year, how long does it usually take? 

Sorry, I’m asking for shared experiences. When you’re in your 20s, you don’t know many others going through this."
"My mom (63) and I (24) don't know what to do. She reached out to his doctor, but he told us we had to bring him in for tests if we want him tested. I think if we told him we thought his mind was going... well, he is a very proud man and would not take it lightly or try to understand. It would just start a very large fight and get us nowhere, except less trust from dad. He forgets everything and argues about things that he taught me. His moods bounce all over the place, and he gets frustrated very easily. Everything is everyone else's fault basically as well. I always knew I would be the kid to take care of my folks, and moved across the country with them to start that ball rolling. Now, with this starting, I'm terrified. I'm 24, I just figured out how to start taking care of myself. We were planning on buying a house together or some land, but now I'm feeling a lot more claustrophobic in that situation, considering the person who was going to handle most of it is now unable to figure out how to do basic things on his phone. I don't know how to get him any help with this without telling him we think he has alzheimers. And I really can't stress enough..... he would never admit that, even if he thought it himself, and would take it as a personal attack rather than something out of love and respect. 

He just got so frustrated because the avocado he took out of the fridge is not ripe by any means and he can't use it for breakfast. He is the one who taught me that putting it in the fridge keeps them from ripening. He argued with me and now I'm crying. Most of my life was spent having a rocky relationship with my dad, and now that it is resolved and we can start to build a good one, he is losing himself. It hurts. I know it isn't about me but this is so hard to wrap my mind around. I am worried that I am not/won't be strong enough to handle this. 

Does anyone here have any advice? Suggestions? Things that will make this feel any less groundbreaking??? I am young and a lot of my friends aren't ""there yet,"" if you know what I mean. Even my sister, who is..... 32 I think? lives in another state and always has. So she isn't here to see it all the time. Sometimes I tell her about things that he does (like trying to change the address on his pizza hut account through his phone's settings app) and she just laughs it off. Which, sure, that might sound funny, but witnessing it in person is horrifying. It has made me feel extra pressured to get my shit together before my dad is completely gone. 

I am in therapy, and have talked to her about this, but I know it is going to get worse before..... well, before it just ends. I have no one really who has experienced this first hand. Are there resources I could be utilizing any better?  Thanks in advance for reading through this."
"Hi everyone. At my mom’s recent annual physical, the doctor suggested completing a DNR form. I felt rushed so I checked no life saving measures except feeding/hydration. On further contemplation, it seems like maybe I shouldn’t have checked those when I know my mom does not want *any* lifesaving measures. Anyone done the form and have advice? I know this is a complicated and sensitive topic, but I appreciate any compassionate insight."
"Hi sorry if this is not right way to ask or [place.](https://place.My)

[My](https://place.My) dad is almost 90 he has severe Alzheimer’s. He was in a care home but proved too much so was sent to hospital. From there he wasnt getting the care needed so was finally sent to a hospital for the elderly.   


my question is due to the fact his symptoms have deteriorated rapidly in last six months, is there a time line to figure out how long he has left? He cannot walk or feed himself. He crawls around and doesn’t speak. He is acting more like a baby again. my mum is very worried about him and I know nothing about this disease. 

Could he be like this for months or years? It’s really upsetting her. he doesn’t know anyone and I’m thinking it would be better for all if the unthinkable happened bc how can it get worse than this? She had spent her entire life looking after her family and has never had a break. 

My mum is in a bad way worrying about him, thanks for your advice. NB sorry if this seemed harsh but things have gotten as bad as I could have imagined with this disease."
"This is a long one, so apologies for the wall of text...

 This is something that my bf is going through- his father seems to be forgetting things more often, like how to use his phone and so forth. The forgetfulness has been a going on for some time and I really don't have many details because I haven't spent enough time around him (I have been dating my fb for a year, but covid and his dad being away in a foreign country has prevented me from getting to know him). 

His dad moved back recently to the states, and it seems that my bf's mother (a long time divorced, but still friends with him and she is also a nurse) came across some info while she was helping with his medication that stated that he was in the first stages of dementia. He is a big drinker (not sure if alcoholic?), and doesn't take very good care of himself (type 2 diabetes), and has had covid  recently (but hospitalized for several days). After he came back, he has been falling down a lot lately (big guy, maybe borderline obese? impossible to lift a 250lb six foot man). 

Anyway, my bf is his medical proxy and is worried because his dad is going to leave the country again next week to go back to the tropical country where he was staying before he came back. We have no idea why he came back, but it seemed like he was breaking up with his gf. Anyway, that seems to have resolved and there is talk about marriage... We are worried that he can't take care of himself and will be in that country with a gf who might not really love him, but is looking for other things (she is 40, he is 73)... And she is not a nurse by any means and in no way equipped to properly look after him.

So I guess my question is this- if his father really had been diagnosed with dementia, wouldn't the PCP be obligated in some way to inform the next of kin of this, or the medical proxy? That was never done. His dad doesn't have any plan for this sort of thing happening to him, even though his mother went through something similar. We are completely at a loss as to what should normally happen and have no idea where to turn for help. What if something happens to him and he can't call my bf because he can't work out his phone? What if we can't find him in this foreign country? He still seems of some sound mind to make certain decisions, so getting any kind of injunction over his decisions seems like not at all a possibility and might cause some serious family issues. Does anyone have any ideas as to what to do here? This is a serious conundrum

TL:DR bf dad in beginning stages of dementia (maybe), leaving the country soon to be with golddigger. What to do?"
"I’m saying goodbye to my Grammy today. 
I was her caregiver for a while before I moved out of state, and haven’t seen her since lockdown started a year ago. She was moved to a care facility 6 months ago, and probably had a stroke during surgery a couple weeks ago and has been placed in hospice care now. I was able to come visit for the weekend without my older two kids and brought my 6 month old who she hasn’t met, to see her for what is almost certainly the last time. 
Trying not to have any expectations as she sleeps most all of the day, only awake about 10 minutes at a time every few hours and still largely unresponsive. 
She took such good care of me as a kid, always picked me up from school, took me to dance classes, taught me to sew, made me so many cans of spaghettios, my favorite soup, Rice Krispie treats... Even if she doesn’t remember me or isn’t awake or anything, I still want to say thank you to her for everything. 
This disease sucks and I hate it, but I’m glad to know there are others here that will understand."
"My grandmother is 74 and shes been bedridden for the past 10 years due to a variety of illnesses (dysfunctional neurological system, severe osteoarthritis affecting her entire system). We tried a whole bunch of different treatment techniques (allopathy and ayurveda) over several years and it isnt improving infact it seems to be getting worse and doctors have given up hope. 

For the past four years, shes deteriorated considerably showing psychiatric symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations and forgetfulness. Most symptoms and an MRI scan indicate Alzheimers disease, including visits to two psychiatrists who prescribed her a range of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and dementia-related medication. 

Caregiving has become very, very difficult. But finding and ""financially-supporting"" caregiving through external means has become even more difficult. And so my mom looks after her mother (my grandmother) now, and shes showing severe sundowning including lack of time orientation and mood swings and worst of all, insomnia. Shes too scared to sleep at night and keeps my mother awake all the time. I cannot find anyone else to caregive for my grandmother. I dont know what to do, because Im running out of patience to deal with my grandmother (she relentlessly calls people around her for minor things and refuses to sleep at night) and I get angry at her for causing my mother such distress. 

Dementia related support in India (specifically Kerala) is very little. Im really tired and just want to end all this. Any help anyone can give me (people in India would be better) would be appreciated. Are there any homes in Kerala that take in bedridden dementia patients?"
"I have read about articles that Alzheimer’s disease is also often called type 3 diabetes because patients with Alzheimer’s disease are likely to have insulin resistant brains. Of course being metabolically diabetic (as in type 2 not type 1) increases the odds of Alzheimer’s as well. 

But has anyone tried to do anything of the sort like changing diet? Like trying to reduce insulin levels, make them go on Keto diets or fast for a whole day? 

Maybe even MCT oils will help if this is true since ketones is a secondary source of energy for the brain if sugar or glucose can’t be used. If your brain can’t get the energy it needs of course it’s only natural it would start dying off but if we can try to get ketones to work then it would at least postpone or stop the progression of the disease. 

There is also the article that some people with Alzheimer’s have 6x the aluminum content in their brains compare to normal people but I doubt there’s anything we can do here."
"Years before my Grandma got her diagnosis I noticed some signs. For example, she lost 500 dollars then blamed it on my Mom and said she stole it. She would occasionally forgot to turn the stove off and burned multiple dishes. These are all the warning signs I saw. What did you guys see?"
"I really do.  She just looked in my face, scream-bellowed twice, and emptied her dinner into the trash.  Then she demanded ""decent food"".  Because a cheeseburger is ""decent"" for a diabetic, and a bowl of homemade, organic, from-scratch Broccoli Beef is ""shit I don't deserve"".   

I hate Sundowner's syndrome."
"My mother (76) has Alzheimers. She still lives in her own home, and my husband, brother, and I are her caregivers. I don't know what ""stage"" she's in as it's so confusing to determine, but she seems to be managing keeping the house clean, bathing, dressing, and feeding herself -- essentially the basics. I have managed her finances and medical care for the last 5 years or so pretty much completely. My brother gets her groceries, my husband tends to the house, and I take care of other things. She's alone most of the time, but she's preferred that for many years now, long before Alz. I could obviously give more about her state right now, and maybe I should since everyone here is so knowledgeable and could give advice, but that's not my focus of this post.

Her current primary physician has been with her for a long time, but to put it simply, his care for her is inadequate. Long story shortened, he ignored all concerns, and it was a neurologist who diagnosed her after being referred for another problem. The neurologist has given her medication and sees us every 6 months or so); the primary doc has pretty much pretended that nothing's different than it ever was. Recently we had more issues with him, and I made an appointment with a new doctor. Mom's not happy with him either, so it was easier to get her to go to a new doc, and this guy is my own and is awesome (the perfect example of what a doctor should be!).

We are seeing the neurologist tomorrow, and the new primary doctor next week. The new doctor has access to all of her medical records already. The advice I'm asking for is this -- what is all of the information I should provide to him? It's so hard to talk about her in front of the doctors, so I want to be as concise as possible and may even detail it all out for him to just read. But I don't know what all I should give. I want him to know what's transpired and what's going on with her now. I want him to help us determine where she's at and how close she might be to needing to move elsewhere. I want him to help us find services that can help us care for her. And so on .... 

What details are going to be important for him to determine where she's at? Any advice and help you can give will be very much appreciated! This community has helped me so much already, so let me take this chance to say THANK YOU!"
"My dad used to be a voracious reader but his Alzheimers has taken away that ability. I am looking into audio books for him already, but he’s also got bad hearing and of course no focus. I was thinking, though, that if there was anything like an audio book that also had a simple visual component that might be something he would really enjoy. (I know- I’m describing a movie, but movies just move too fast for him to follow.) Has anyone ever seen such a thing?  Thanks in advance for any ideas."
"Hello, i have been going to my grandpas house since I was four and when I came to his house recently he has been acting like he hasn't done anything like he asked me to get a book is currently reading even though 2 hours ago i saw him put the book in the master bedroom, is this a sign of alzheimers?"

"I was reviewing my emails this morning, and my grandson kindly showed me a new comic that came out today. A funny looking distressed man was claiming there was a wildfire....in a sock drawer? this seems utterly ridiculous, for I have never heard of such a thing before. It took me by surprise, ha ha ha. I'll be sure to forward it onto Geraldine later, I always make time to send her new comics very day, she can get lonely after her husband passed away in Vietnam 10 years ago,"

There's nothing happening
"We open on an orange cat sitting on a purple table in a typical suburban house. Then, the cat says “There’s nothing happening,” which is humorous when you take into consideration the fact cats cannot speak. Then, a man runs in and says “I finally got the wildfire in my sock drawer under control!” which adds another layer of whimsy to the story because it is improbable that his sock drawer would be on fire. Finally, the cat says “Nothing out of the ordinary, I mean,” which is also funny because the cat is implying this is normal for him."
John alzheimer invented the cat??
"I am concerned that my uncle has Alzheimer's but he has no-one in his life to look out for him. 

I visited him the other day and I was shocked to find the fire in his sock drawer was not under control. I asked him what was going on with the fire in his sock drawer and he said it was under control. 

His orange cat (I forget its name) was no help. It considers this kind of behaviour as nothing out of the ordinary. The cat is lazy, fat and sarcastic, but it is the closest thing my uncle has to a friend. 

I have arranged for my uncle to get help from a nurse but he is convinced that she is his deceased wife, my Aunt Liz. I feel like her presence is only making his condition worse. 

I talk to my parents about my concerns but they are quick to shrug it off. They are busy working on the family farm and my father, Doc, just writes off my uncle's behaviour as the behaviour of a ""cappuccino-sipping city slicker"". I can't understand this attitude because it was my father who found a kitten in a sealed box outside my uncle's house, addressed to Abu Dhabi! Nobody even knows who the kitten belongs to. 

Does anyone have any advice?"
Great stuff

"Ever since my 87 year old Grandpa was diagnosed with altheimers, he had begun to lose common sense and knowledge. He would touch a hot stove on purpose or play with knives, not knowing the danger. One day, he asked me if anything was out of the ordinary. I said yes, so he set his sock drawer on fire while playing with matches. I tried to go in and save him, but he had already died of third degree burns all over his body. His funeral was today. Keep an eye on your loved ones with altzheimers."
"Out of everybody who I lost, I miss him the most. Of like, all the problems he had Alzheimers was the worst and it hurt to see him suffer from it. The last thing he said to me before he went was see you soon. Ordinary old me couldn’t spend as much time with him as I would have wanted and I regret it. I really miss him and I wish I could just spend one more day. Mean enough, I feel that nobody in my family felt the same about him as I did."

I saw a really funny comic somewhere. Cant remember where and what it was about!
"Do any of you have thoughts on the effects of ketosis on Alzheimer's treatment or prevention? From what I have researched and grown to understand, a ketogenic diet is best for treating any disease. A ketogenic carnivore diet is even better because it rids our plates of phytotoxic plant matter, but that is beside the point. Ketosis heals.

1. Ketone body Beta-hydroxybutyrate inhibits NLRP3 Inflammasome (Youm et al., [2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3804)), which “has been linked with several inflammatory disorders, which include cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, and atherosclerosis.” (Kelley et al., [2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6651423/))
2. Ketosis improves short and long-term cognition, A systematic review in 2020 analyzed ten different studies and published incredible results: ¨adherence to ketogenic therapy among adults with MCI (mild cognitive impairment) and/or AD (Alzheimer's Disease) improves both acute and long-term cognition.¨ (Grammaticopoulo et al., [2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32597927/)).
3. High fructose content is found in the brains of those with Alzheimer's (Milzer, [2020](https://news.cuanschutz.edu/news-stories/fructose-made-in-the-brain-could-be-a-mechanism-driving-alzheimers-disease)). The causal effect in this association could exist in the biochemical processes through which eating fructose disrupts neuronic function, alters gene expression, and more."
"My wife (69F) has Alzheimer’s disease.  Her short-term memory is almost totally shot.  She also does not remember that I am her husband.  Fortunately, she seems to mostly like/tolerate me.

Complicating things right now is that we are isolating because both of us have tested positive for COVID.  So, the companions we have hired for her (3 days/week) cannot come, the home health care aides we just arranged cannot start, and my daughter and daughter-in-law are staying away to keep themselves healthy.

My daughter previously has taken care of getting my wife to shower and to put on clean clothes.  We have given up on daily bathing, and would be satisfied with every other or every third day.  Yesterday, I persuaded my wife to go to the bathroom to shower, but she came out half an hour later with dry hair and wearing the same clothes.  I found the clean clothes I had set out folded on her bed.  This morning, she apparently showered, but had changed only her pants.  Since she had been wearing the same shirt for at least two days, including sleeping in it, I asked her to change into a different shirt so I could wash the one she had been wearing.  I leave her in her bedroom, and she emerges five minutes later wearing the same dirty shirt.  This happened, with minor variations, five more times.  Finally, she became exasperated with me asking her once again, and she took off the dirty shirt while I was still in the room and finally put the clean shirt on.

Even after we have the home health care aides, I will have the responsibility of making sure she is bathed and dressed three days a week.  I’m going to ask the aides to be hardasses, and to move heaven and earth of the days they are there to make sure my wife is bathed and dressed in clean clothes.  But I’m pretty sure there will be days when it falls to me.

Anyone have strategies that they have found to work on this issue?"

"My mother was just diagnosed with mild/moderate Alzheimer's recently. Her symptoms are forgetting dates, repeating stories, etc. She needs help with meal prep, but otherwise is okay on her own. My father passed away many years ago and my sister and I live close by but she has been living alone.

We realized she can't live alone any longer, and my sister tried keeping her at her house a few times for extended periods but she has outbursts and demands to be taken back to her house. She refuses to stay more than one night. So we decided to keep her in her home and brought a live-in caregiver thinking she would be happier. The caregiver is nice and trustworthy. She has been staying with my mom for almost a month now. 

The problem is my mother complains about her all the time, asking her to leave, and demands to live alone. The caregiver leaves on weekends, and my sister and I stay with her and she has episodes of crying and yelling at us for bringing this lady into her house.

We aren't sure what to do, we want her to be happy and live out her life without so much stress. Yet she won't live with my sister, and she doesn't want anyone at her house. She's also said to us previously that she would NEVER go to any kind of senior care.

We are running out of options and not sure what to do at this point. Anyone have any advice?"
"Hey all,

My mom has started keeping spoiled food and she yells at me and has a fit when I tell her I'm throwing it out. She has been drinking milk that went sour on 5/9 according to the label (and smell, obviously)...I told her it was expired and she said no it isn't, I just opened it today (5/16) so I showed her the label as said ""yes it is, you're drinking spoiled milk"" and then dumped it out. Clearly this wasn't the best tactic on my part and I feel guilty but I don't want her getting sick. She got mad and went back to the TV.

Would it cause her more distress if I threw things out without her knowledge? I want to keep her in the loop because she is semi-independent but I've been working nights and even though I pay a CNA to come a couple times a week to just spend time with her, I'm worried she may eat something moldy eventually if I'm not there. The CNA says in her experience elderly people tend to keep old food ""just in case"".

Another issue is that she will make a dish one day, forget she did, eat something else, then I'll find her cooking that and dish again the next day. I tell her ""you just made that yesterday, why are you making it again"" and she'll just say ""no I didn't"" so then I show her the container from the fridge and she gets frustrated and says ""I never made that"". Again, poor tactics on my end but I don't know how else to show her. Plus it's a massive waste of food.

I know it's my responsibility to monitor this stuff but I need the extra money as a financial stop gap measure until I get back into my professional career. The food waste is one thing, but her getting food poisoning is worse. I know as her primary caretaker I should be on top of this better, and I have been but with this job it's harder. 

Have any of you experienced this food issue?"
"My mom is mid-stage, living independently in a community but later today we have a meeting to start her on some assisted living services.  My mother used to be an ace with computers and phones and now has just enough knowledge to keep on breaking her email login.  (We told her the bank app doesn't work on her older phone and she calls me for balance information).  I fix it and tell her (over and over but you know how that goes, sadly) don't change the password!  I have my email and phone number as the recovery info and I have fixed email and other various logins many many many times.  

Just got her email fixed, again, and then Saturday--I got the message that the password had changed.  Now today, I've gotten several phone calls and emails with a google code.  I know my mom is extremely frustrated with her email, and is sitting there on her phone, (she can no longer navigate a computer) trying and trying to fix it...it's heartbreaking.  But I just can't fix it anymore only to have it locked up over and over when she changes the password, and then promptly forgets the new pasword.  She even forgets she's changing the password and will absolutely deny she changed it (I have the emails stating she did).  I do know for sure she isn't being hacked (over and over and over and over....)  

How do I handle this?  I can't tell her what she's doing, it will only hurt her feelings terribly and then she will forget the discussion, and will change the password again.  If I just ignore her requests to fix her email, she won't understand because I have always swooped in and fixed everything--and now I won't?  She doesn't remember that I have to keep fixing her logins, either, and so won't understand my crazy level of frustration with the situation.  Unfortunately, she hasn't forgotten that she wants email, even though she doesn't use email for anything anymore.  THis is SO HARD."
It took me 5 years of trying to convince my mom that she needs to see a doctor for her memory stuff. Long story short I was finally able to take her to a neurologist 2 weeks ago and in the appointment she  was so insulted by the written 5 minute memory test that by the end she was angrily stating how absurd it was that the doctor was testing her on things that she isn't using in her daily life and that it was ridiculous (she wasn't able to complete the test). She expressed to me today how upset that test made her and at the appointment the doctor referred her to get neuropsychology testing which I've heard is around 4 hours long (which it seems like my mom will definitely not sit though). I don't know what to do now. I don't know what the next steps to take are. I think I will be able to get her to do the MRI's MAYBE but a terrible geriatric provider earlier in the year told us she might only have a year left to live based off of no evidence or rigorous testing after the first visit. I really wanted a second opinion but it doesn't seem like i'm going to get it. If she refuses to take the tests then what should I focus on next besides ensuring that she is safe?
"I know this isn’t about me its about her, my grandma.

My grandma has lived at home with us my whole life. I’m not in a situation to move out right now and I don’t want the burden left on my mom anyways but I just can’t take it anymore. Shes been at a rehab for two months. She shouldn't come back home but maybe I am being selfish. She has dementia, we didn’t particularly knw until lately. She falls down and breaks her bones. That’s why she is there. I’m sick and tired of taking care of the parent figure that I love and watching my own mom become more sick because of her. My mom is not as well anymore and has health issues, I have health issues ad my grandma is a huge burden with her dementia and she is completely helpless and not independent. Our other relatives don't understand and think she should live at home but they don't know what its like or probably care.

There has been a huge strain in our household because of the stress and it rly falls on my mom and I its not healthy but my mom wants to take her home also because she wants to be home but she NEEDS a nursing home/memory care center. It shouldn’t be up to us to keep her alive and a few hours a day of care at home isn’t enough and not from trained individuals with specific dementia care.

I’m scared for her when she comes home. I’m scared and l feel so selfish of how much stress it causes me and how much of my life it takes away. I don’t think she should be home because I feel she needs 24 hour care at a memory center where they are TRAINED. But no my family thinks my grandma should once again get what she wants and live at home because that’s what she “wants” and home is home. At what cost though?  Its not fair and I don’t mean to sound selfish. I don't think its fair for her to live with us and have people come for how ever many hours they can that we can have with insurance or pay when she should be at a facility. I'm exahusted and i think i am a little upset. Its not a healthy environmet but maybe i am wrong.

I’m so scared I love my grandma more than life and I can’t believe I don’t want here here. It isn’t fair I’m tired of it she needs round the clock care and I don’t want our house to be a sick home we have done it before and it wasn’t right it was just stress. I want my mom to be okay too. she does't understand that dementia is progressive and shouldn't wait till the tail end of it but get optimal help now! I am so scared I want her to be in a facility but it isn’t what I want I can’t believe I don’t want the woman whos lived with me my whole life at home.

&#x200B;

need advice, thoughts, opinions, because while i said i kow this isn't about me i feel so alone."
"Hello to the group,

I'm struggling to decide if I should move mom, who has dementia. She's in a full time care facility across the country, doing well, but has very little visitors. I have the opportunity to move her to a facility 10 min from my home. 

I am very worried about what the move will do to her mentally. A 2 hour drive to the airport, a 3 hour flight, and then to a new home, all in one day. I would be traveling with her the entire time and there to help acclimate her to the new place.

Should I move mom to have the extra care from me (her daughter) or am I doing more harm by taking her away from what she knows and trusts, however isolating it can be with very little family close by. Any advice??

Thank you in advance!"
"Hey guys, my mom has had a declining memory for the past couple years, and she’s had difficulty with remembering names of close family. Last week she walked out of the house that she shares with my dad, and he had no idea where she went. To our relief she was at the hospital, either by way of Good Samaritan or ambulance, but safe nonetheless.

The past few months he has been trying to get a neurologist to read her cat scans that have been performed, but the closest appointment they can get is august.

The morning of the excursion she didn’t realize she was home, and was having trouble thinking of my dads name. Since then (when she’s woke up/isn’t tired) she doesn’t have issues with that. 

Anyways, what I am trying to gauge if anyone here has had similar experiences, and how long she has at this point. I know with this disease victory looks different than others, but she is 55. Any thoughts?"
"My grandma has dementia (vascular specifically I think), and while she’s not in the later stages yet, she’s getting there. Just a heads up, I’m sorry if I seem to be a bit blunt talking about this sort of stuff, it’s been a constant factor in my life one way or another so I never really got to learn how learning somebody you love has dementia and having to come to term with it. For me, that was just how some relative were.

Moving onto what I need some advice for, my grandma loves to sew (she learnt how at like 5 and it was her constant hobby), and would do it a bunch when I was younger (I’m currently in my late teens). When I say a bunch, I mean she’d make boxes upon boxes of finished American girl doll outfits, including multiple layers, working pockets, themes, and just generally some of the best sewing I’ve seen to this day. She’d go to craft shows, usually the kind organized by the local Facebook mom group, filled with old grandmas and their reluctant husbands. That sort of stuff. The earliest memories of it I can scrounge up had her as the most social and kind person, who genuinely loved to see and sell her creations.

The issue is, as she’s gotten worse, she hasn’t been able to do this anymore. We’ve found boxes of fabric, cut and ready to be sewn, that she forgets about. It’s a loop, she’ll want to make doll clothes, but once she’s cut out the fabrics, she puts them away and forgets, then repeats that. Plus, I’m not entirely sure if she can still sew at the level she used to be able to, so I don’t know if she just can’t make all those doll clothes anymore.

All of this is just a long lead up (and also a bit of a vent since my family doesn’t much like to talk about my grandmas dementia, like at ALL, which is a different issue entirely) to the actual question. Would it be good if I offered to help her start sewing and selling doll clothes again? It seems like a good idea on the surface, doing something she enjoyed in the past that she can’t do alone now, but I know it’s not that simple. Sometimes doing things like that can stress out people with dementia, and I’m not entirely sure if this would or wouldn’t. She seems to enjoy telling me about and showing me her doll clothes (she has some she never sold, because when I say she made a lot, I mean it), but also the stress of something like this could just upset her more. 
Sorry about the essay, I just want to put as much as I can so it’s more clear on if I should/shouldn’t

TL;DR
Need advice on if it’s a good idea to help my grandma with dementia start sewing again, or if it’ll just cause her more stress"
"My grandpa (80yo) has Alzheimer’s and recently got disability. The family dog of 11 years recently was euthanized (by recently I mean in March), he was really sick and had tumors all over his body. At first when my grandma told him the dog has passed away he cried a lot but at least accepted it. Now he frequently blames my grandma for kicking the dog out, wants the front doors to be unlocked because he believes that the dog will come back, everytime we’re out somewhere, he says that he needs to go home to feed the dog and take it on a walk. This has impacted my grandma greatly because she gets all the blame for literally anything, he would shout and curse at her, at some times threatening to beat her. We are not putting him in a home, he’s already seen a psychiatrist and is on meds. Is there anything else we can do? I know it’s hard on him, but it breaks my heart to see my grandma suffer from it as they live alone and we don’t have the space to take them in (a two bedroom apartment)."
My granda who is in her 70s (i dont know exactly) was just telling me to come and look at her fish tank because she saw people standing there and she told me that she didn't want to be seen by the people. She said that they had a garage and some construction going on. And she was asking me how far it is from here to home but we are at her house she is also taking some meds for her pain/heart problems/other daily meds. I am respectful when she talks about this stuff but its the first time ive experienced anything like this (im 17 years old turning 18 soon)
"My mother 56 year old, has started showing early signs of dementia. It might be becquse she is in a lot of stress due to poor living conditions and even worse family condition. My father is completely careless. The marriage was arranged. They never talk to each other unless some messag has to be conveyed. These latest headphone just made him even worse. My mom would tell something he wouldn't even acknowledge it, she would get frustrated and leave.

EPISODES
1. She usually calls people with wrong names, it wasn't a big concern at that time

2. She constantly struggles to cook especially the planning aspect of it. She would constantly complain to me that she has done nothing much, yet the time is running fast.

3. Recently I was on my room, she randomly came in and switched off the lights. When questioned, she said, she thought I had left, said that she was absent minded 

4. She sometimes walks close to me with dress hiked exposing knee, when she comes and talks to me.

I spoke to one of my family nurse to whom we tend to in case of emergency. (Her own mother has dementia) she told me that it may be due to lack of sodium. Then later diverted the topic saying she might just be under too much stress due the family conditions. 

Additionally my mother has knee problems which is being treated by physiotherapy. If not treatable she would have to undergo surgery which would involve full body anesthesia, I've heard that it only accelerates dementia. She also has varicose veins in knee (dont know if it helps), She is relatively very young, and I don't really know whether it really is dementia.

Any advice on how to prepare my mind for upcoming events would be appreciated. I am hoping it this might just not be related to dementia."
"I am getting very little info about my stepfather through my mom but he has all the signs of dementia and it’s getting a lot worse.  She said the doctors didn’t say what kind of dementia, even after several brain scans and appointments over the last 6-8 months. But they did say his brain is shrinking. Does that narrow down what kind of dementia he has?  She gets little info and then passes down even less to me. She’s allowed in his appointments now but wasn’t at first because he would tell the doctor he didn’t want her there.  Oye.  

I know that’s not probably a lot of info - but it’s all I know for now.  
Thank you for reading."
"I have read Dementia Reimagined by Tia Powell, only. 

What books would you suggest?"
"My dad was diagnosed with mild/moderate Alzheimers in December 2021 after memory clinic assessment and review of brain scans from Sept 2021. We informed the DVLA of this in December 2021 and have received a holding letter to apologise for the delay in their reaction to whether it’s okay for my father to continue driving. My mother and I do not feel he is safe to drive, he had an accident in August 2021 which was entirely his fault, his reactions are not what they were and the mobility in his legs is effected (he shuffles a lot and gets cramps in his leg muscles) and we of course we informed the memory clinic nurse of our worries discreetly. As I’m sure is the case with a lot of men in their mid/late seventies who have just received this diagnosis, he says he feels no different at all and gets very defensive when we try to discuss his diagnosis and we think he hasn’t got a full grasp on what his diagnosis means (due to the condition, no doubt). Today, he received a letter from the consultant at the same memory clinic to say that he will be having a telephone assessment (due to Covid) regarding his ability to continue driving. Has this been the case for other people, he is of course going to tell the consultant and the memory clinic that he feels that he is fine to drive?! Does anyone UK based know if this is normal? He was just starting to get used to my mother being the driver and we’re desperately worried that if the NHS/DVLA tell him that he’s okay to continue driving based upon a telephone assessment (HOW CAN THEY MAKE THIS ASSESSMENT ON THE PHONE?) it will become a huge source of conflict if we try to stop him. Any UK based experience similar to this with DVLA/NHS would be greatly appreciated."
"Update:  I couldn’t do it anymore. I called my step siblings and told them I had to leave. One of them is driving up tomorrow to stay with her for a few days and try to find full time live in care for both of them. We had another huge blowup and I can’t fight with her anymore so I am catching a flight home tonight. 



Long story here, It’s 1:00am, I haven’t slept more than three hours a night for the past week. My mother who refuses to admit she has dementia (as did her sister, my Grandmother, and her grandmother) has decided that this is a perfect time to do laundry. 

I live out of state and made an emergency trip because she was in the hospital with a DVT (blood clot) and my stepfather is also in the hospital getting his fourth stint put in his heart. I get her out of the hospital and she is supposed to be on bed rest but that’s not happening.  We also spent the day at the ER because her arm hurt. 

My stepfather knows she has a problem and refuses to do anything about it. I have three step siblings that aren’t here and won’t or can’t provide any help. My stepfather is going to get out of the hospital in the next few days so then I get to have two full time patients. 

I’m sorry if this sounds horrible but I can’t keep doing this. I spent three months here last year doing the same thing when he was sick before. When he’s not here she spirals, won’t sleep, and the confusion gets ten times worse"
"My 78yo father has Alzheimer’s and is now prone to purposely removing his clothes, especially in front of female neighbours. He even urinates in front of them. A few of them have started avoiding our family and we suspect he does this regularly and they don’t know how to let us know. He has also started randomly shouting extremely bad words (lewd) at us (mother, sister and me are primary caregivers). We have new neighbours across the road with a pretty wife and a young daughter and a little son.

How do we deal with the fact that he’s sexually harassing us and our neighbours? He used to be a very respectable lecturer and consultant in his time so this behavior change is shocking to us."
"My grandmaw struggles with dehydration and constantly asks who said she has to drink all these liquids. Today the home health nurse told my mom about some hydrating jelly candy. My question is, has anyone tried to make anything like this themselves? I’m thinking of trying it with sugar free jello and candy molds. Any insight would be very much appreciated!"
"My stepmom says I'm making my dad become worse quicker by getting his meds and if he fights me about some, just walking away instead of fighting. She will argue with him about everything and it's just UGH! I thought I was doing the right thing..."
"I’m in a bit of a situation and I really don’t know what to do. My mother (diagnosed with dementia last year, has probably had it 5 years or so) lives with her long-time (25 years) boyfriend. They are both in their late 60s, early 70s. Neither is in good physical health. I have a strained relationship with my mom due to years of emotional neglect due to her mental illness. I also live (on purpose) 8 hours away.

Ok so the issue is, something happened in their basement that caused massive flooding and them to lose hot water, heat and washing machine use. The bill to repair it is bad.. like $12k (it was a long-standing issue that they ignored for years). Ok so this happened about TWO MONTHS ago and her boyfriend has not had it fixed. 

As I said I am far away, have little ability to do much remotely. I’ve offered to help him pay (and his brother has offered to split it with me) but he keeps dragging his feet and now refuses to do anything.

Let me make it clear, I hate this man. 

What makes me the most angry is my mother has to take sponge baths and when it was colder, sleep in her coat. He is supposed to take care of her and he is not. 

If I could afford it I would pay for the whole repair myself just to have it done. I wish I could travel home to confront him but I am pregnant and quite sick at the moment. 

Any advice? I want her to live at home as long as she can but he is making this very difficult."
Will insurance/Medicare cover an aide for my mom who has dementia? She recently moved into my home and I’m paying out of pocket
"Is this common? 

How many of you have encountered a pet with dementia, also?"
"Last night my 9 year old daughter had a choir performance.  I didn’t want to leave my dad out but I had very little time in between school pick ups, sports practices, and getting to her performance. So, I called my dad and told him I would be there to pick him up and that he needed to take a shower, get dressed, and be ready to go. When we arrived to pick him up and he got in the car it was obvious he had not showered, he looked disheveled, and he smelled BAD! I didn’t have time to take him back inside to clean him up nor did I have the heart to tell him he couldn’t come with us so we took him the way he was. I felt bad that the kids were probably embarrassed to have him at their school that way.  

After the performance we went for a quick dinner at a deli which was also a struggle. Then, on the way home he cried about having to live at his assisted living facility and then got mad talking about some other issues. I felt bad for my 4 kids having to be in the car and witness that. I felt like he took away from my daughter‘s evening and kind of ruined the entire family time. I don’t want to leave him out but I also feel like my kids don’t deserve to have to deal with this all the time. I feel like I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place. 

I just needed to vent to some people that might understand. This is so hard!"
"My FIL has dementia. He has been going downhill for the last 5 years. Last Jan he couldn't live alone anymore so we moved him in with us and he stayed with us for 10 months. It wasn't working. I had to go back into the office full time around Oct and we didn't feel comfortable with him home alone all day. He was so bored, getting angry and having daily outbursts where he would see him stomping and cussing us out while we were gone. Having bathroom issues and destroying our bathroom and his bedroom. Having outbursts and grouchy to our 2 children that our kids don't like him anymore. We told our BIL (who has sole POA) that he couldn't live with us anymore and we needed to get him on Medicaid and in a home. He has zero assets and only SSD.  My BIL said he didn't want him to go into a home and that he would move him into his house. So that's what happened. We told him we would take him for weekends when needed, but he couldn't be at our house alone anymore. Now it is months later, and my BIL is always mad at us, saying we don't help enough with him. We have said we couldn't take him a few times because he wanted him to come on a Wed-Mon or something similar and we put our foot down and said we would only take him on weekends. FIL is home alone all day at BIL house, but we don't feel comfortable with that at our house, especially now that he as been gone for 6 months and not familiar with our house. He says they are struggling and I think they are over having him live with them, just like we were.

He still hasn't started the process for medicaid.  Complains that everyplace they call has a mile long list for medicaid patients and he can't afford any other places. Yes that is why we said over a year ago to start the application and get on waiting lists! We can't do it as you made yourself and your wife POA and we have no power (they did this without our knowledge, when the POA was drafted and signed by my husband it had BIL and my husband, still no explanation really why its different). A year ago when he moved in with us, we tried to start the process and they blocked us at every attempt. They would handle it they said. Got mad at us for trying to do stuff. Almost everything we tried ran into a problem not being the POA as well. So we gave up.

My MIL (FIL's ex) toured a place last week that is a foster care type home that he can afford (basically a dump). But she said they don't take dementia patients. She told them he's not real bad, but she isn't around him enough to know. She said all they asked is if he can feed and dress himself. We are like yes he can put food in his mouth, but he can't fix himself a plate, sometimes we have to remind him how to eat something. He can put clothes on, but he puts on inappropriate clothes for the weather, multiple layers, backwards, inside out and etc. Usually you have to lay clothes out for him if you want him to dress appropriately. We have to remind him to shower, use deodorant and very often have to clean up after he has a bathroom accident. I don't think a foster care is what will work for him. He needs memory care. They don't want to put him in one because his whole life is smoking his cigarettes/weed and they won't let him in a nursing home. 

Don't know what to do, and so tired everyone being mad at us for not ""helping."" We are done helping when everything we suggest is just ignored. FIL had a bike worth around $6K. It was sold by BIL and we suggested using the money to prepay a funeral as the state can't take that when applying for medicaid. No he didn't want to do that, he wrote the selling paper work up that it sold for $3K and is ""hiding"" the money. Who know what that means. But what ever funeral costs come up down the road we aren't helping with until the $6K is applied. I am just so done."
"I am wondering if anyone with dementia themselves, or a caretaker of someone with the illness, keeps meticulous records of the symptoms that they notice, as they occur.

If you don't do this, have you thought of trying this, as it may prove helpful to you, your loved ones, other sufferers, and researchers?"
"My grandmother does not take her depression pills. We are not sure about the cause, could be both attention seeking and simple forgetfulness, but the issue is serious as she once already had a temporary psychotic episode (thinking there are people in her house, that someone locked her inside even though she just lost her keys), due  to taking the pills and then abruptly stopping.   


Unfortunately, after that we had to get her to an old people's house as we live in a totally different city and the family that is there does not pay enough attention to her to keep her on her toes with her pills. However, she is a very assertive, and proud person so we think it is best that once she is comfortably back on her meds to let her live alone again, if she so desires.  


To that end I am looking for some intelligent contraptions, perhaps with a camera, that will track whether my grandmother actually does take her meds, and notify us wirelessly. Did any of you have experience with similar machines? Do you have any to recommend?"
"It started all of a sudden. My mom passed away on 07.07.2020. Her departure had a great impact on my dad as they were together for 42 years. From 2nd half of 2021 (June or July may be) we started observing some abnormalities like some illogical statements and questions(which were very occasional and unnoticable). But from then we noticed his excessive fascination towards sweet foods including ice creams, cakes, chocolates, candies etc. He has diabetes but he started eating candies and ice creams whenever he went out alone. I talked to the local grocery shop who informed me that Dad on average takes 5 to 10 ice creams daily. I was very annoyed on him because of this childish behavior because till then I didn't realized that he developed something like dementia or Alzheimer's. Things kept going like this till this year. Last week my dad left home in the midnight and when he got back I asked him why he left home and he couldn't answer me and he was very confused. That time I realized something is wrong with him which needs medical attention. Next day I rushed to a neurologist who told me that he has developed dementia and prescribed few medications including Donepezil Hydrochloride INN 5 mg tab once in the night, Quetiapine Fumerate 25 mg 2 tabs in the night and Ginkgo Biloba 60 MG tab twice a day. Since we started The meds he started hallucinating throughout the day. After a couple of days I contracted with the with the doc and he told me to discontinue Donepezil and continue the rest. But till today there is no progress and his deteriorating each day. I'm really confused whether this is because of the meds prescribed or his progressing so fast. Is it really possible to deteriorate within a week??
I have done extensive research for lost couple of days and discovered Alzheimer's is also termed as type 3 diabetes which leads to excessive fascination towards sweet foods because of some chemical imbalance in the brain. My doctor didn't tell me anything like this. Later I came across some researches which shows nasal insulin helps  Alzheimer's patients to some extent. I really want to try that out. Anyone ever tried Nasal insulin for Alzheimer's  or dementia?? I know it is not conclusive or approved yet, but I cannot see my dad suffering without any medical care."
"I don’t know if this is allowed here, but I had a non scientifical thought.

Is it possible dementia is a way for us to grieve our own deaths? Forgetting our lives, friends and family to ease our own passing?"
"I (20) lost my father (54) today after succumbing to dementia (unspecified). I first found out during my senior year of high school after my family started to notice strange behaviors (like forgetting how to operate technology and wandering the house at night). Unfortunately, my dad started to lose the ability to care for himself at the start of the pandemic and was forced to enter a nursing home. I graduated high school and had to temporarily move cities for college (4.5 hours away) which means I have only been able to see him a handful of times during this process. I am overwhelmed with my memories of him, good and bad, sick and healthy. This has obviously been the hardest and most traumatic three years of my life, and I feel so alone."
"My friend of 9 years has been in the hospital for a month due to an injury. Sunday night he fell and broke arm. His dementia has been getting worse the last year and now I'm having to come to terms with the fact they he will never be able to come home.  I'm starting the process of securing his home and getting it ready for  sale. Just 5 weeks ago we were making plans to take a trip, getting his house ready to sell and find a smaller more manageable house,  but now that's over.  I'll visit him in the hospital and discuss our plans to keep him happy, but now I know it won't happen. We'd go shopping,  run errands, go to dinner.  I'm so sad that he's stuck in the hospital, but want to come home.  I feel so lonely that I'm losing my friend and it so stressful dealing with his doctors and his medical issues."
"I can almost see the finish line! I’ve been trying to place my mom into a nursing home since December 2021, and it’s taken another ER visit for the process to pick up…. She’s been in the hospital for 2 days and we’re waiting for a response, but it seems like forever for someone to get back and say they’re able to accept her.

Has anyone experienced this process ? was it a lengthy one? short ?What was the thing that hindered the transfer? I keep getting told that they’re going to be able to move her soon but that day is never arriving…."
"My Dad's memory has been failing for several years, and he often repeats stories, fixates on specific things, and other usual early-stage dementia stuff.

His initial diagnosis was Alzheimers + Lewy Body. My sister is a Dementia Care Coach and has worked with seniors with dementia for decades (and lives with my parents!), so this was a hard diagnosis for us. We know well the Alzheimers journey, and the added complications of Lewy Body.

As things have settled down a bit after the initial diagnosis (and a stress-induced hallucinatory episode that was very scary), and my Dad is still the sweet, kind, generous man he has always been ... just with a lot of frustration over his diminished intellectual capacity and memory loss.

A week ago we did a follow up meeting with his brain doctors, and they have altered his diagnosis to Alzheimers with evidence of minor Vascular Dementia, but no Lewy Body.

While vascular dementia is no cakewalk, it is a MAJOR relief over the Lewy Body diagnosis!! This is a big win, a relief, and a diagnosis that is not as scary. The potential personality changes possible with Lewy were very concerning, since my Dad has always been a hugely loving, kind, and generous man.

There are not a lot of ""high points"" in the dementia journey, but today, this is a win for us."
"My mom is depressed, asks the same q's over and over and over (dementia).. so to entertain myself and make the visits bearable I have gotten to know some of her friends that she sits with at lunch. 

But, when I talk to them my mom rolls her eyes, flips her middle finger at her ""friends"", starts saying ""well I guess you forgot who I am.. YOUR MOTHER"" and ""well I guess you're not here to visit me so I'm going to leave now"".

She throws a major fit if I don't only give her attention. 

Well anyway, I tell her to leave and I stay with her ""friends"" and we chat and have a great time. I guess I've found surrogate parents at the senior home :) The more it happens, the less I want to see my mom.  My mom has no idea she sits with these people daily and says ""I don't give a f who these people are, but I know I'm your mother and I thought you were here to visit ME""

Has anyone experienced this extreme behavior?"
"So, I have been watching and reading a lot over here this week.
Im not sure what to say, this will be just a rant I guess ..
Little background story.

I spend half my childhood with my grandparents. Then contact ended. No one really knows why. They’re a bit traditional and we had very different views on the world.
That said.

Every Friday I work in the building, my grandparents live.
At first I was like; pfff. No.
Then they invited me in, after years of ignoring. I felt obligated to do so, and we had a drink.
Then the next week they invited me in again.
Fast forward to me being actually happy every Friday to chat and had a drink with my grandparents again.
Till last week.

My mom told me that grandma is not doing okay. And they are searching what the hell is wrong with her. 
Long story short; she’s starting developing tremors in her arm. And has memory fog. 
This was probably going on for a year or so, but they finally addressed to the doctor when they went for their annual check up.
She is beginning to have trouble walking, very tired very easily. 
At her birthday she cried all day. Because of frustration and not knowing what is going on. At one point, she pointed at pictures of us all, and she could easily call out the name of my wife. But she forgot mine … and I am there every week. She knew  my name later on but that’s the part when all the alarm bells went off.
She had her first memory test last week. Next one with all the scans and all are in september.
But things don’t look good and are going downhill very fast. 
A day after her birthday she thought is was Monday again. Few hours later she thought it was mothersday and asked if there would be any visitations.
She told my grandpa she would wacht the floor and then sweep it with a wet towel.
When my grandpa came back from grocery shopping, she was sweeping. But was CONVINCED she would vacuum after sweeping. Etc etc.

Sorry for the rant. For all who stayed reading; thank you. 
They think it’s Lewy body or Parkinson dementia. But the part where it might not be dementia is already out of the picture ..
I finally got them back and than this. 
Im scared as hell. 


Thank you for me, to do my story. 
Sorry for the rant."
"I’m going to keep this short.. My FIL has LB and requires 24/7 care—which my husband and I have been providing for the past three years.. 

Pops has two other sons, one of which is a POA, collects the SS, and contributes ABSOLUTELY NOTHING towards his health or food.. We have NO HELP..

My husband and I have an eight year old daughter that I have had to homeschool and is able to leave the house once a week, if lucky…

We are about to leave this situation to the other brothers to handle this and move two states away so our daughter can be by her cousins and have an actual family experience.. 

I feel so bad packing up-knowing that nobody can take care of Pops like we do but our mental capability has been compromised…  

Our daughter is at an impressionable age and I don’t want her to remember being intimidated by Pop Pop because she wasn’t silent during the Price is Right..

I cannot imagine how my husband will feel but he NEEDS  a break..

I am thinking of calling APS for wellchecks after we leave..

Just such a guilty feeling and dread…

Sorry for the rant..


Hugs to everyone who knows the pain.. 💕"
"Today was a good day! My 82-year old aunt with dementia walked, with her walker, to Starbucks and back — just under 1 mile. Yes, we stopped for some iced tea and egg bites so she could rest but she did it! A month ago, she had a really bad day and she had to rest 5 times on the way back to her house when we were only 2 blocks away from it. It was so bad, I ordered her a wheel chair that day so we could have it if she suddenly needed it. Took a photo of her happy little face, texted it to her sister and my cousins. It I’ll be a day I remember for awhile. 



Sorry, it’s just that I rarely have any good news to post on here."
"Hi friends,

I am caring for my 71yo father who has been diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia. He was taking Seroquel for about two weeks while waiting for insurance approval for Nuplazid. He hated the side effects — said it made him physically slow and exhausted. We switched to the Nuplazid a week ago and he says it makes him feel “crazy.” Can anyone share any person anecdotes about their loved one’s experience taking Nuplazid? 

More back information for those interested: he has been having “cognitive issues” for about two years, worsening significantly in times of stress (like when my mom was having surgery for example, but has otherwise been manageable). After my mom died suddenly in December things really took a turn for the worst and he has been declining rapidly. Finally convinced him to see a neurologist two
months ago who diagnosed him. He lives by himself in our family home which is across the country from where I live. I have no siblings, so I’ve been traveling back and forth frequently to get things in order for him but it’s becoming rapidly apparent that he is not capable of living alone nor is the isolation good for him. Vivid hallucinations started maybe three weeks ago and he went from understanding they were hallucinations to now being insistent that the people living in his house are real. (I have very much stepped inside his world with him, but other family members are still trying to correct him, which is upsetting for both of us.)

Edit: we have plans to move him to where I live."
"Friday I got a call from my cousin that my uncle (70) was admitted to the small local hospital this week and then was transported to our state university hospital in their brain and spine division. This was because my cousin noticed very unusual behavior from him during a phone call (saying he didnt reply to the text because he didnt know how to text.... which he has texted for years among other things) Pending results of several tests, we believe this is the start of dementia. It seems fairly rapid because he didn't show signs 3 months ago. 

I am very close with my uncle after his wife passed about 4 years ago. I drove down and visited him and spent several hours with him in the hospital.  I would say about 85% of the conversation was normal. The few unusual things I noticed:

1. He struggled with numbers. He confused my address, some quantity of things, was confused when I was talking money numbers, ect.
2. He told the nurse that he and I fished together all the time, but we never have (we have planned on doing it soon  but we didn't get to because of this)
3. He would tell stories or express violence in the story, which wasn't like him (example: ""I just wanted to choke him like this""

So far this has been difficult and I know the road ahead is even more so. Where do I begin really? I don't know what is appropriate for me to say. Do we let him know he might be having memory issues? do I never correct him if he gets things wrong? What do I do to help? What should I prepare myself for emotionally?Any good advice or resources? Thank you"
"I need to vent - please do your best to not judge me. I promise I'm trying...

I (30m) have been taking care of my mom (69 - nice) since March of 2021. I love my mom, but I've never really liked her as a person. She is very quick to anger, has no patience, has no understanding of most things in life. She's very loud, obnoxious, no understanding of privacy, rude to strangers, etc.. I moved out of her house at the ripe age of 15 because her and I just didn't get along. Constant fighting and screaming. I moved to a different city at 19 (she followed me) and got married at 21. During my marriage my now ex wife and her never really got along. Due to that my mother and I didn't spend much time together. 

Since my divorce(2020), I knew she (my mom) was lonely and could tell her health was declining, so I offered her to move in with me. I sold my house a little over a month ago because the housing market was so hot, and purchased some land out in the country and am building a house. I already bought her a tiny home that will also be going on my property because the goal is for me to still be readily available to her, but I need my own space, as does she.

We are currently staying in the tiny house together on the property of the people who sold it to us (very thankful for them or we would be in a much rougher situation). Its her, me, and 5 cats... in a 500 sq ft house. I have no one. I have 2 friends but they are long distance. I have 0 relatives. It's just me and her.  Over the passed few months her lack of memory has worsened substantially. I answer the same questions 30 to 50 times a day. I have to do literally everything and everything is my fault. Internet going slow? Let's scream and throw laptops and blame me for putting her in this situation.

I wanted to get moved before her condition got to a point to where I couldn't manage it alone, make it to where we didnt have a mortage and our over all expenses were almost non existent so I could focus on her. I thought I was doing the right thing. But everyday for the passed month it's just all my fault. I can't do anything right. I of course know this isn't true, but man is it affecting Me. 

I have untreated bi polar depression which makes it a little tougher but I manage it myself. I try my best to stay strong but sometimes I leave the house to go do laundry and just sit and cry. We are only in the beginning stages of this and it's already unbearable. Idk how I can continue like this. I know my circumstances will improve once my house is built and we each have our own space.

I understand what she is going through is terrible, and I know she's afraid, but dude... im just one guy and I'm doing my best to remain patient, positive, and helpful but my motivation is quickly fading. I'm building a resentment inside me that feels so unfair to her. I'm starting to snap back at her and frankly, my patience tank is on empty. 

She just was never really that good of a person or a loving mom, and this disease is making it so much worse, but shes still my mom. I'm a good person and a good son. I want to be. I aim to be. But this situation is making me feel like a POS and idk what I'm doing. I don't have kids. I would never want them because I'm not made for that... And this is like having a giant kid, but the future isn't them growing up and doing their own thing... the future is dark, scary, lonely, and hollow. 

The entire reason im doing any of this is because I want to spend time with her. I know our time together is limited and I want to make memories since we never really got to when I was younger. I want to take her fishing, I want to take her sight seeing and go for walks around the lake. I want to make her smile and laugh. But there isnt much of that happening... its just complaints, demands, and negativity.

I promise I'm trying...

If you made it to the end of this, thank you for taking the time to read it. Advice is welcome, but I mostly just needed to get that off my chest.

Edit: Thank you so much to everyone that has read this, provided feedback, given insight, and for sharing your stories with me. Today I feel refreshed & reinvigorated, and it's thanks to you all. Sometimes we forget the impact we can have on one another, and being in a world filled with so much shit, it's nice to find a clean toilet. Thanks again to all of you, and if anyone ever needs to talk or vent, don't hesitate to reach out."
"I’m 24 and take care of my grandma w dementia. I used to get so annoyed at her constant talking, but I wish she were able to look me in the eye and have be able to speak any words to me. I used to hate how she wanted me to walk with her 15 times an hour every single day, now I wish I could go on one more walk w her on her feet. Fuck dementia, man"
"I moved across the country and an ocean to help my mom take care of dad who is in the mid-stages. Only to discover that my mom is showing signs as well. The struggle to get her into a doctor is another story. But on Sunday, the stars aligned so that Mother's Day landed on my dad's birthday. 

It was a long day of trying to keep these two on track. At some point, we had a 15-minute convo on it *not* being Father's Day and *not* mom's birthday. We had to clarify why dad got a cake and mom got flowers. We sang happy birthday to both of them. My dad thanked my wife profusely for grilling steaks for Father's Day. My mom kept asking how old she was. Every time we got things sorted about what day it was, dad would wish my mom happy Mother's Day and my mom would wish him a happy birthday. I had an eye twitch by the end of the day, but it was still pretty funny."
"Mom, 75, dementia mid-late stage, otherwise physically very healthy, has tested positive for covid. I have it too and she lives w me part time. I’m waiting for a callback from her doctor about getting her Paxlovid. She’s had all vaccines and both boosters. Last booster was about a month ago. 
Any advice regarding Paxlovid? She’s also on lexapro, olanzapine and Escaltopram (sp?), vit B and C."
"My mother-in-law was recently diagnosed with dementia. It is on the mild side… But there definitely are areas where she has issues with language, reasoning, judgment, and rational thinking. We’ve noticed this for a while but it was just recently diagnosed. I recently had a baby and she comes over every week to spend time with the baby. I feel like it’s really important so I feel like I’ve encouraged it. I think the family is appreciative of it. I’m having surgery and I feel that it’s OK for her to be with me to try to take care of the baby since I’ll be watching her and guiding her the whole way. I have to have this surgery asap.

Sometimes I get a little frustrated though because I feel like it’s become opposite in the sense that I’m now the caretaker. I guess it feels a little weird because it’s not really my mom but I’m the one who ends up spending most the time with her. Is it bad that I’m really upset she’s gonna be here for many weeks? It’s really hard to hold a conversation and I feel like it takes a lot of effort for me to keep her engaged. I feel bad because I don’t want to seem like I’m being rude but I really am dreading the time she’ll spend with us. Unfortunately, I’m not working and with one of us just working it’s really difficult for us to pay for help. I guess it’ll be OK… Since I’ll be here, and the dementia is pretty mild.

Anyone else ever get a little frustrated? I feel so drained after I see her…almost like I’m babysitting her."
"I live in a sparse, forested subdivision of the Rocky Mountains.  Around 10:30 pm, I heard a guy yelling for help somewhere in the woods outside my house.  I yelled back and eventually found the guy at the vacant property next door. The guy had gotten lost when darkness fell sooner than he'd expected. He could tell me his address, but he couldn't figure out how to get to the road about ten feet away or how to use his cell phone. As I drove him a country mile home, he told me he had dimentia. I walked him to his door, and he pounded on it for about ten minutes until his wife answered. They are both pretty old, they don't have family in the area , and I am worried for the guy in particular. His wife may not be able to take care of him to the extent he needs it. They don't exactly live in the remote forest, but it is the Rockies and it is the woods. Night gets really cold, and the environment or its inhabitants can kill. I don't want the guy to get lost and die if this happens again. I called the sheriff's department, and they were not too helpful in providing assistance beyond a single welfare check..  Who can I speak with to make sure these folks are receiving the care and attention they need?"
"This post pertains to my grandfather, who is in his late 90s. He hasn't been thoroughly examined on this, but he appears to have some sort of dementia.

He has not had memory loss, hasn't forgotten anyone or any incident in his life, nor does he experience any issues with communication. He sometimes has lapses in working memory about whether he ate breakfast, etc, but other times he will remember these things correctly. He's sometimes confused about the day and year, but he's in the ball park (he doesn't keep a calendar or anything).

But over the past few years, he has developed a host of fantastical delusions which are getting progressively more detailed and consuming.

Some seems stem from his religion; he believes that people in a religious realm tell him facts about his family. For instance, he'll say we need to go get his mother or uncle from outside - it's not that he has forgotten they ever died, he just believes that they're here again after being sent back from that afterlife realm. Others are non-religious; he believes that foreign dignitaries greet him and converse with him, that family members have now become actors or sports stars.

He spends much of the day alone in conversation with beings/people he perceives to be present. But he realizes we can't see them and thinks he has special access to seeing them.

What conditions would be consistent with delusions without much memory loss? If dementia, which specific types match up with this?"

"Watching my mother-in-law decline and bearing the burden of her care has been extremely exhausting and eye-opening - and she has a lot more financial & family caregiving resources than my childless partner and I will at her age. We’re starting to think about creating living wills dictating DNR, comfort care only at a certain point and whatever else we can think of so neither of us have to do this again for each other a few decades from now. 

Have you made plans and documents like this? If so, what do they consist of?"
"Just wanted to come on here and thank you to all who have posted here, this forum has been a huge comfort to me tbe last few months as I looked after my dad in his final months which were a nightmare, I got good advice here, my dad passed two weeks ago, it was absolute hell for him, thinking and praying for you all xxx"
"After 3 weeks in the Hospital, my grandfather (who had been delusional/hallucinating and aggressive for the entire time there) improved. 

His heart stuff is back under control(Afib, tachycardia) . He was walking again a little (when he's confused his legs stop working completely).

 He didn't just improve, his mental faculties came back completely with Seroquel. He was himself again in a way that I hadn't dared to ever hope for. For 5 days. He was sent to rehab from the hospital on day 2 of having cognitive function and was fine... until today.

This morning he woke up thinking that he was home, but was supposed to be at the job he retired from like 19 years ago. He's not back to being aggressive or abusive yet, but I know it's coming, since he's been kind of a jerk for most of his life anyway (just not to family) and the dementia has made it so much worse.

I just... I needed to vent. We had him back and watching him start to lose himself all over again is almost enough to break me.

Everything has been on and off since February when his symptoms started with hallucinations/delusions that came and went, but those last 3 weeks in the hospital were pure hell. I know it was stupid to hope for a real recovery, but we'd thought that the Seroquel they put him on might buy us more time when he showed such a big improvement and now everything looks so bleak again.

They want to send him home next Tuesday, and he wants to go home, but home isn't safe. He's his own POA though and would never let anyone else have it willingly. We're working on a guardianship, but if he's functional on the day of the hearing it could go either way. 

So, I guess we'll probably be back at the hospital for a new round of torture by next Wed, because he still thinks he can walk, to the point where he will physically fight anyone trying to tell him he can't... and his legs still aren't going to hold him when his other symptoms are active."
"We live in rural vermont so dont have access to the best doctors as I assume, if youre really good at just about anything, why would you stay in vermont to do it. This is regarding my gfs father (52m)

Anyways hes gad all the scans, blood draws, imaging, lumbar punctures, etc. He was admitted to UVM hospital for 4 or 5 days for constant testing and monitoring with the hopes of gaining a diagnosis. Nothing

 Hes had a few older (>10 years) TBIs, they seemingly have ruled out most everything with testing but his cognition contunues to RAPIDLY decline. His cognitive abilities seem directly correlative to his stress levels. He remembers the most random shit, but also forgets how to use the smartphone hes had for years. He hasnt begun forgetting about people. His father also recently started rapdily declining and he constantly is asking if his father is even alive because he cant remember.

How common is it to be unable to receive any sort of diagnosis? Is this just due to not having "" good enough"" medical team and that if he were put in the #1 neurology hospital in the world that they would be able to find a diagnosis? Or is this common. He has stage 1 bladder cancer too, and were getting DRAINED trying to financially take care of him. SSI denied him as stage 1 cancer isnt a valud reason to receive disability i guess, at the time of the first SSI application his cognitive decline wasnt as severe as it is now and I dont think was noted in the application. My gf and i have only just now taken over his care from his gf. I'm lost as what to do while we wait for the current SSI appeal to come back. The hospital visit netter us multiple pieces of official paperwork saying he cant be left alone and cant work/hold a job. Weve never done anything like this before. This is driving me into a dark place, not being able to help, watching him decline, and being financially drained doing it all.

Tl;dr is it common to be unable to receive a diagnosis for rapid cognitive decline and how hard is it to use rapid cognitive decline without a diagnosis as a basis for long term medicaid/Medicare (whichever one pays for a in home caretakee) and SSI/Disability. Also if anyone has doctor suggestions anywhere in new england that would be appreciated."
"I'm in the UK. The local council let us know that my dad should actually be in a nursing home instead of a residential home. We visited the nursing home yesterday and seeing so many patients lying in their beds, mouths open and ready to die was something I was absolutely not prepared for. It's very different to a residential home and it hit me hard that my dad is actually dying and he has no hope of getting better. I think deep down I'd hoped it wasn't the right diagnosis because he remembers us and he is very aware of what is going on. He isn't as bad as they are and I worry that the environment will make him deteriorate rapidly.

We never got on but when he got diagnosed last year, he changed into the dad I wanted so I feel like I only really had him in my life properly for a year. It makes me want to have him back home and get a nurse to come in and change and bathe him. My mum doesn't want that and said I would find it very difficult having to do this. I want to spend time with him but not at the nursing home. I don't think I could ever go there again. It was traumatic. She wants him to go to the nursing home as they are better equipped than the current home and they feed them properly, let them go outside etc. She said if it was her, she would want to be in the best place for her.

I don't know what to do. I definitely need a therapist for this but I'm not sure if I could ever cope with visiting the nursing home.

How do you cope with accepting that this is it for your loved one? How do you cope seeing all of the patients completely out of it and ready to die?

Thanks."
"TL;DR: Items from my past makes my dad talk about those things as if they're from his past. 

I tried goggling to see if I could find anything about this but didn't have much luck. 

My father has early to mid stage dementia and is definitely acting more strange as the days go on. 

I have found that when telling stories he tends to say things from my past as if they were his own memories. 

For example he took me to karate when I was a kid and when moving home he was helping me with some boxes. Anything vaguely Karate related from those days caused him to stop in his tracks and talk about how he used to do it and that the training equipment was good stuff of his. 

Has anyone had any experience with a relative acting like that? 

It's not distressing so I don't correct him. It's just been happening more often with other things so I'm just curious if it's part of a bigger behaviour that could be forming. 

I think he remmebers taking me to the lessons but the lines are being blurred as to what his role in those memories are."
"A year and a half ago my wife fell. She hit her head so hard it bounced. Along with thus, she broke her shoulder and dislocated it. She has always been one to not do anything she didn't like. So the home therapy was pretty hit and miss and the use if her arm and hand has deteriorated. She started  ""misplacing "" wallet, purse, phone, charger, money, underwear, etc. Not a day goes by without  a search being conducted, as sometimes several. She will sob and cry and ask why I would do such a thing as to hide whatever the ite. Is at the moment. She hides these items and then forgets where she put them. Then she yells and screams and uses vulgar language and says terrible things. She never remembers any of her actions. I  called  her dr to setup an appointment for load tests and mentioned my concerns  about her behavior. Finally, after very much persuasion she went to the Dr's. She ended up with the PA who gave the blood test result and wished her a good day. At least that is what she said. I asked if she wanted me with her when she went in and she declined. I made appointments for eye care, follow up on her arm etc and she cancels them. I have to work and worry about what is going on when I am not there. Thanks for listening."
"I’m 27 and my mom is in early 60’s, she’s shown signs for years. On Saturday she almost smashed the windows and wouldn’t calm down, my dad called the cops. Today she didn’t recognize him and completely destroyed the basement bathroom. My dad dosent think he can take care of her and had her committed. She had been begging me to not let her go to a place like that all my life. Even weeks ago. I feel like a failure, I feel like I let her down. I feel like I’m losing him. I don’t know how to feel, today I lost part of me that I will never get back."
"21 years old and I feel like I'm caring for a child. Packing a bag when we leave the house, keeping bottles filled, preparing food, the list is endless. When this disease is out of my hands and we have no choice but to put him in assisted living, I will have my freedom back. 

I will never have kid and do not want them, but I feel like a mother every morning when I wake up to when I go to bed. Dishes, laundry, shopping. I can not wait to live my life (selfishly) and never return to this stage by never having kids."
"Hi there!

I'm a 30-year-old, and I'm wondering if/terrified that I'm starting to develop dementia:

- completely forgot someone's name for ten or so seconds.  Known them for years
- feel like I'm in a haze all the time
- spaced out more time than not
- trouble reading; feel like my brain shuts down half-way through any sentence

I've talked to my doc about this, and she's inclined to believe it's my anxiety and depression, but after several years of unexplained and unaddressed symptoms, I'm starting to reach out to others a bit. 

I have no history of dementia, though my grandma had trouble recalling the correct names for many years for no given reason. 

I've had a CT, blood work, and a urine test, none of them through neuro, and all seemed to come back clear. 

What'cha think?  Something serious or mental illness running amok?

Edit:

Forgot to mention, I also have no family history of any diseases that cause dementia."
Can I vent? My mom kept pressing the off button on the oven (even though she doesn't cook or use the oven) to the point that it broke the panel and it constantly beeped. I had to turn it off at the breaker. We no longer have an oven. I'm at my breaking point. I don't have anymore tears.
"I’m hoping someone can offer me help with this. My mother takes pills three times a day. It’s always a hassle, but the worst part is that she chews them instead of swallowing them, and then she wants to spit everything out because it taste horrible. 

Anyone have any ideas on how to get her to swallow them? I wish I could roll them up in a treat like I do for my dogs, but I don’t think that’ll work.

Thanks!"
"This is just a rant and I (24/F) need y’all to just tell me to stay strong because days like this just fuel my desire to finally move out and abandon my mother (63) with no resources. 

My mother and I have never had a close relationship. She has made no effort to learn about who I am as a person and that’s how our connection has been since birth. However, I am viewed as my mother way to success. My mother was diagnosed with FTD in December after a very long journey to getting an official diagnosis. I have spent countless hours at doctors appointments and filling out paperwork and righting her wrongs, I feel like a mother this year but I took my mother out for dinner today because she spends 95% of her time inside and she needs fresh air. 

She took full advantage of the opportunity and I regret it. She ordered two glasses of wine when I’ve made it my duty to keep the apartment alcohol free due to doctors orders. She ordered a entree, complained about it, practically inhaled it, then ordered the appetizer version of a pasta dish. She also trash talked my boyfriend during this dinner and spoke nonstop about an imaginary person who she has fixated on for about 3 years now. At only point to just put a pause to the monotony I initiated a revolving conversation and acted clueless to what she was saying but that got boring quickly. My mother then ordered dessert and complained but scarfed it down. 

I regret showing her the drinks menu. The car ride home was torture. I put the music on blast to drown her voice but she just yelled over the music and accused me of so much, insulted me and my boyfriend, and threatened to call her brother. I thought about swerving and crashing and killing us both. Once I got home I pretended that I was going into the house so she would leave the car but I got back in and drove to McDonald’s and ordered ice cream. I just needed space."
"My mom has early onset Alzheimer’s and it is no longer safe for her to be left home alone. She enjoys lots of things, but can no longer do those things without assistance. How did you go about finding in home care? (My dad, sister and I need to keep our jobs to provide for ourselves and our families, so we cannot be with her in the daytime Monday-Friday)"
The nurses are saying they won't cut her nails and my Mom ***says*** she is against me cutting them although the length is obviously bothering her. I believe my Mom's resistance isn't genuine. Is there a creative way to convince my Mom to allow me to cut them?
Please someone explain to me how to ever be happy again watching my mom disappear. It’s getting bad.
"Forgoing structure to try and make a concise point. 
I’ve been caring for my dad since august 2021. He was found laying on the side of the road, didn’t know who he was/thought people had picked up his house and moved it. Completely insane when I got the call. He has never/will not see a doctor of any sort. He is a lifelong abusive alcoholic with extreme paranoia. Some days he can barely speak, sometimes it’s only gibberish. He has said he’s faking it and that is the belief. I’m not allowed visitors or to leave the house. If I break the rules (trying to go to work, which he says is a cult trying to divide the family) there is constant harassment. He treats the house like a warden and goes through my things often, “looking for clues”. He might flip all the lights on at 4am, yelling at me that I’m hiding people in the house to harm him. He has mentioned “I’m going to walk that dog to the middle of the highway for how it treats me” because my sweet 13 year old border collie is frightened of him and his yelling. Constant harassment at home to the point where I had to leave my job. Sometimes he thinks I’m an intruder. He smashes windows with tire irons and has destroyed two doors. He can’t use any of the appliances (pretty sure this is fake as well). Does not use soap to wash dishes. Weekly falls resulting in ambulance calls, but he jumps right up when he finds out they are arriving. Hospice has been out multiple times and witnessed how verbally aggressive he becomes, but he refuses treatment and they say they can’t make him do anything until he hit/harms someone. He hasn’t showered in 9 months at least and has recently begun shitting himself. The entire house smells of feces. He smells horrendous. Everyday is a nightmare and I’m the only person involved. He has always been psychologically abusive and it’s becoming insane. He needs to be put away but when I call for help he turns it around and stops everything until the doctors leave, then the insanity doubles to punish me. I left my career, city, friends, everything because I was tricked into coming here, now I’m broke and stuck in a small town with no way out. The feces is the final straw for me, but I don’t know what to do."
"My Dad (75) is a hoarder.

I’m pregnant with my first baby but since last year I’ve been noticing a decline in my Dad’s memory.

He cannot remember why last year he removed bricks/ pavers and dug a trench around his back porch.

It’s Autumn here in Australia, the rain will start soon.

He’s spent a couple of days filling in the trench with bricks because he’s expecting a shed to be delivered (the people that removed his old asbestos shed removed all his hoarded boxes onto the verandah). Him having a new shed is probably not the solution to his issues when he has a good verandah to store things on.

Anyway, he has a lot of junk on the path he’s trying to extend. He’s using a rope etc to put the pavers back in a relatively straight line.

I said, why don’t you just move that stuff away. How long did it it take you to put those in? About five hours? He said yes about that… so he’s going to want to take them out because he doesn’t have good drainage at his house.

The water flows off the roof because a roof maintenance man installed a pipe to get the excess water off the roof (I pointed out in 2019 that he had mould on his ceiling). I can’t remember if I just found the roof maintenance person off Gumtree or he found them. He says he has his number somewhere and that’s why he hasn’t put a drain or anything in yet….. it’s like this with so many things that need to get done in the house. He has not got much chance of finding this man’s phone number.

He says it will be in his phone somewhere (he doesn’t know how to save numbers though I’ve showed him many times), he might have the card somewhere in his house but he is a hoarder and he won’t ever find this.

He won’t ever get a new tradesman, he always wants the one that came before but he can’t organise a way to keep their contact details.

Anyway, should I just leave him to it. I feel sorry for him spending the day doing pointless things. It makes me so frustrated because I see his house getting neglected, it’s like he’s always looking for an excuse to not deal with it.

He recently bought an Apple laptop (MacBook), he got locked out when he first tried to set it up. I helped him contact Apple and they sorted it out over the space of a week which involved him taking it in to the store twice.

He’s been paying a phone bill since 2015 for a number he wasn’t using.

He had an ancestry account that charged him $100 per year or something that had information he could have found on Google.

He is getting a shed to put his boxes in, but he doesn’t know what’s in the boxes.

He literally has two spare rooms in his house if he wanted to store things in them he could just throw out some of the rubbish.

He gets very rude and angry and I find it so draining to deal with.

He can’t remember conversations we had a few weeks ago. He’ll remember things he accuses me of doing that aren’t true though, like he says I broke his door when it wasn’t me.

It makes me sad having him in my life, but I know I’ll regret it and I can’t let him just be alone all the time.

My brother doesn’t help - he dropped off lots of junk when he moved states - some shelves - now my Dad ordered a shed to use the shelves. My brother also dropped off a boat he didn’t leave covered, this has happened before and the boat (my Dad’s) got damaged because they both don’t look after it. My Dad can’t use the boat because it hurts his back, so it’s just like my brother’s boat now.

My brother doesn’t help. He just doesn’t worry about it or talk to my Dad much."
"Since my recent FTD diagnosis, I have found a whole lot of information, most of it relating to caretakers of dementia, As it should be since caretakers are the ones that have to carry the brunt of this. But I’m hoping to find if other patients out there who want to talk about some things, such as planning for the future beyond just the usual DNR’s and living wills. 

I feel like there is a lot that I can be doing now to support my future. For instance, I see that dementia patients always seem to have a dislike and almost a fear of bathing, and a video on YouTube says to try to make the bathroom as inviting as possible. Pale colors, calming candles, (fake) fabrics, beautiful colors of towels, aroma therapy, etc. Things like that. I want to see if others have ideas like this and we could kind of help each other while we still can."
"Hey guys,

I live with my step grandmother, who has dementia (we will call her Meredith), and my partner. One thing that I've noticed is her selective memory, specifically around cigarettes. Meredith won't be able to remember the specifics of a conversation from 5 minutes ago, but she can remember exactly where you've hidden stash of cigarettes. However, she does always loses her cigarettes. 

Can anyone explain this? She smokes heavily, maybe it's to do with her dependency on smoking? 

*we hide her cartons in draws and such because otherwise she will lose a packet and then smoke the next one without trying to find the others. It becomes very expensive."
"That’s it, we really weren’t expecting her to decline so fast and from dementia. She has other illnesses that affect her quality of life. She’s not having a good time and asks to die but I don’t know how to help her, I pray every night that she’ll be reunited with my grandpa soon. I hope she dies at home, not alone in the hospital with pneumonia like my grandpa did. 

I’m tired and heartbroken."
"Tldr: last two paragraphs for current sitaution. Severe decline in past month. Unable to provide care because not a first world country. Wish I could type everything but the post will only get longer and discouraging to read

He is 92 and lost his wife to covid last year. He was physically able to move with some help but in the past one month his health has gone worse and has shown a very rapid decline in both mental and physical capabilities. 

We have an in house attendant during the day and he takes great care of him. We as a family are also present with him and try to keep him engaged and distracted. 

His mental decline has been too fast for us to handle. Two months ago he started having short term memory loss and would repeatedly ask same questions over and over. He was also confused. Taking him to poo was a hassle but we would manage it. Also started to eat way less than what I would imagine would be healthy for him.

However, last week or two, he pooped in his diapers and refused to get cleaned up. He never urinates or poos in diapers as he is not used to it and doesn't want to accept it but he wears one for emergencies. 3 days of trying to convince him lead to nothing. We also got him a wheelchair so he could move around but he got physically weaker to the point where we couldn't get him to sit on it from the bed. 

We hired an attendant for the day and he somehow didn't resist much to the idea of getting a bathe. Anyways we get him cleaned and back on the bed. But since then he is completely immobile and doesn't even move at all in the bed. 

Where we live it is very hard to take him to a doctor and he is afraid of going to hospitals. Doctors have refused in-home visit and give some covid protocol BS as an excuse. We have been trying to get one for a month. 

Anyways, back to 2-3 days back, he says he is in a lot of physical pain and would fight on any attempt to move him on the bed. He got a huge bed sore on his lower back as a result. We then had to just force ourselves to keep changing his position in bed while he screams and tries to hit us and the attendant because he is scared he will fall down (and the physical pain). He is on a huge double bed and we always try to reassure him and hold him. The attendant did warn us and insisted on us to help with changing his positions but we didn't know any better to deal with his unwillingness to be moved at all.

Anyways, yesterday, we were making some progress with everything. He got up and sat on the bed, had his hair combed, didn't forget much and kept talking. However, later in the day he kept hallucinating and was convinced he is not at home and kept telling me to pack our stuff and that we're going home. I tried distracting him with visuals and music but he didn't give up on this idea. We are also barely able to attend to him at night since it is very hard to sacrifice our sleep and function properly the next day. (The attendant was originally hired to help with tasks like cleaning and feeding which is for the day time.) I believe he has been unable to fall asleep at all in the past 2 days. 

So I wake up the next morning and he is screaming in his room and is talking loudly to the walls. I enter his room and he thinks the police have stolen something from him and also locked him up. He is mad at the hallucinations for not answering to him and letting him leave. I help him to pee and now I am too scared to go back because he is fuming. The attendant will be here soon but I don't know what to do at all."
"Hi all! As the title says, my sister and I bought my mother an animatronic dog for mothers day as a comforting sort of companion for her and she thinks it's real. The dog is especially designed for dementia patients and has pretty good reviews. Normally I wouldn't be too concerned if she were to think it's real, however my father is saying she has become focused on needing to feed it, protect it (she was worried it might fall off the furniture), and was worried it might suffocate when he placed it in the box it came in while they were at dinner. My dad isn't always the best at responding in these situations. He keeps trying to convince her the dog isn't real, that it's  just a toy. I'm thinking we go along with her belief that it's real provided that it doesn't start interfering with her functioning in some way. What do you guys think?"
"I live in Australia, and my grandmother in England. I used to be able to visit her multiple times a year and noticed a gradual decline. With the covid pandemic, I was unable to see her for almost 3 years.
In which time she's been moved into a care home, phone calls I've noticed a rapid decline in memory and general just knowing what going on.
So 2 weeks ago I was finally able to go over to England and visit.
My grandma and myself have always been super close, but when I saw her she didn't believe it was me. She abused me for interpreting ""her girl"" calling me a snake saying she's going to hit me. I couldn't believe it.
It's so upsetting. I never realised this illness could take the person you love and turn them into whatever this is.
I feel bad but it's time for her to go now, this is not an existence she ever wanted. It's heartbreaking to see her like this."
"I joined this sub only recently, though my mother has been declining with Alzheimer’s dementia for some time. It reached a critical point recently. This last Wednesday, the nurses at her facility discovered her unresponsive. There was no stroke or anything obvious from a CT, but it seems like the combination of diabetes and inactivity brought on by Alzheimer’s has led to pulmonary embolism and likely organ failure. I think it’s less a product of dementia than a byproduct of her overall condition. So today, I signed the papers to put my mom on hospice care. It was a tough but easy decision, if you know what I mean. She’s speaking very little, eating even less. I suspect she will be gone within two weeks. I’m sad but resolved."
Im 22 and my dad has dementia I have known for some time but got diagnosed properly couple of weeks ago. I think (even though was not said) its aggressive in the course of a week he has gone from doing okay to shouting in the garden at 2am in the morning. I don't live with my dad but I feel like I'm  struggling processing it all. Any help will be appreciated.
"Y’all, so my grandad has been dead for 22 years now and now my grandma has me looking all over the house for him…even in cabinets. I’ll play along not to stress my grandma out but the funny part is the cabinets. My grandad was 6’2”. And I even told her “grand, unless he’s a contortionist, he’s not in a cabinet”🤦🏽‍♀️🤣🤣🤣🤣. Her response: “we’ll he was good at finding hiding places.”🤷🏽‍♀️"
"I am a bit scared of these developing symptoms lately:

\- increasing difficulty with communication. I feel like there's a slight disconnection between what I think and what I say.

\- incoherent perception of space. For example, it takes me a while to make sense of space to get back to my seat after going out of the bathroom (a new one that I just discovered) in a coffee shop that I frequent.

\- incorrect time perception. Like a few days ago I mistaken one close national holiday for another that took place 3 months ago. Things that happen long before seem like yesterday, and things that happened yesterday seem so far away.

I didn't do an MRI yet, and the doctor told me that it's sleep, anxiety and depression. While it's true that I always have problems with sleep (the first and the third occurred right after I wake up), I am still worried about this being the onset of dementia.

Could you share some opinions on this?

I am a 28.5M by the way."
" I know these exist for stovetop, but is there a device that you can use to limit the time a microwave is used? My mom with MCI (mild cognitive impairment) just put her meatloaf that she's made a million times in the microwave instead of the oven, and only noticed when the smell of something burning horribly became apparent, because she set the microwave to a oven-appropriate amount of time. We're not quite at the ""freaking out"" stage yet, but want to look into devices that would allow her to maintain some independence in the kitchen with less risk."
"I'm 22 and my grandpa who raised me has had dementia since I was 13. he's physically healthy but mentally he's completely gone. my little brother and I have been trying to convince my grandma to put him into a nursing home for years, but she refused to do anything insisting he is staying in the house. he needs a nursing home now, and my grandma is finding out that it takes two months or longer to get everything ready to qualify for medicaid. my grandpa has been pissing and shitting all over the house for over a year, and it's destroyed our house. my brother and I don't have time to take care of him being in our early 20's, and my grandma definitely can't take care of him. I havent lived at home for years and my 20 year old brother finally gave up and told my grandma they're on their own 

they are essentially both dying in the house together and yelling and screaming at each other all day. it costs over 10,000 dollars a month where I live to put him in memory care. I can't believe that death with dignity isn't an option for him. today, he was eating his own shit out of a bowl he was eating out of, and pissing himself. I don't want to touch him, I don't even want to talk to my family anymore.

he is miserable, our family is broken, and the house has probably over 30,000 dollars worth of damage. why? so he can't sit in a chair and watch tv for ten more years?  I'm so angry"
"My grandpa has dementia and has been struggling for the past year. hes been in and out of hospitals becos of his heart as well.  a week ago he suffered a stroke. He is partially conscious now and semi awake. His mind is clearly alive but he is struggling to respond and talk. He falls in and out of sleep and has not been eating. Hes been surviving off the IV drip. Without food, its going to be hard for him to survive this time. Because of the stroke, he lost the sbility to swallow. The doctors tried to insert a nasal feeding tube, but hes resisting  because he indicates to us that its too painful when they insert it in. We dont know what option we have left. We cant go into surgery to open his stomach because his heart is too weak. Has anyone had experience with inserting feeding tubes or other alternative ways to get food into their bodies?"
"Although I have a billion. 😕

In the last year, both my mom (71) and my mom in law (77) have been diagnosed with rapid onset dementia (different types, so we see different behaviors). How our respective fathers handle things is different and I wondered what is best. 

When my mom repeatedly says things that aren’t true, my dad (as well as myself) correct her. When my husbands mom says things that aren’t true, her husband says he “plays along because it is easier for everyone”. I feel like that may be the case, but at the same time I question if that’s detrimental to the person with dementia. 

I am still learning all I can and have minimal support professionally and personally. I hope my questions are okay here. Thanks. 🙂"
"My mother is 77. She lives alone in a small town with no public transportation and everything she needs being at least a 15 to 20 minute drive away. She still has her license and drives daily. My sisters and I each live anywhere from a 2 to 12 hour drive from her house. She has a very supportive friend network at home. This is how we found out she was having problems. My sisters started getting phone calls from her friends a little over a year ago voicing some concerns. She was repeating herself in conversations. She would show up for a meeting on the wrong day. Stuff like that. After being alerted by her friends we started to pick up on some of the same issues in our phone conversations with her. My sisters and I all go to mom's for a week or so every summer as a kind of reunion. This last summer we voiced our concerns with the memory issues she was having and suggested that she permit us access to some things and that she schedule an appointment with her Dr. to see what might be the source of the problem. She acknowledged that she was ""a little forgetful"" and wasn't combative or argumentative, but it did seem like she lacked the insight into the potential severity of her situation. We scheduled an appointment with her Primary Care Physician that one of my sisters was able to attend with my mother.  

After a mini test and a referral to a neurologist for an MRI the results came back showing a pretty normal brain for someone her age and a diagnoses of mild dementia.

In the immediate aftermath we made sure we had access to her bank accounts so we can monitor activity. She has given her PCP permission to speak with us about her care and we can all look up her medical information on the online portal for her Drs. office. We also have the ability to track her by her iphone when she remembers to keep it with her.  I brought her to stay with me for a month over the winter with the plan of having her evaluate if she wanted to come and stay with me permanently. My sisters have done the same. Over the course of the past 6 to 8 months it is apparent to us that mom has some serious deficits. She still has trouble focusing on dates and times. She takes blood pressure and diabetes medication that we can't get her to stick with consistently. We have tried the pill containers with the days of the week and all of that stuff, she just doesn't remember that she needs to take them. She still drives and is familiar enough with everything at home that she knows where things are and how to get to her house, but in the last few days a friend of hers, who is a saint and spends a lot of time with her, informed us that she was out with mom for lunch and when they left the restaurant mom couldn't remember where she parked her car and had trouble remembering how to get to her friends house to drop her off.

She is flying out to stay with me this Sunday. The original plan was to have her here for a week or two, but I'm starting to question if I can let her go home, and just typing that has made me start crying. I'm already feeling overwhelmed and I feel like things aren't going to get any easier.

I have drafted a financial and medical power of attorney and plan to take her into my office on Monday, where we have several notaries, to get them executed. 

I'm scheduling an appointment with a local Geriatrician with the hopes of getting a more detailed assessment of her cognitive deficits. 

I have also reached out to my local County office of Adult and Aging Services to see what resources they might have. 

I plan to discuss with her, as I have previously, what her thoughts are. I have told her from the beginning that I want her to be as much a part of this process as possible as opposed to feeling like it's something that is happening to her, but her insight into the gravity of her illness is poor and I don't have any faith that she has a reliable memory of any of the detailed conversations we have had around the issue. When we do discuss it she is open and her responses remain fairly consistent. 

I am also thinking about seeing if I can set up tours of some local long term residential memory care facilities so she can get a look at them now while she's at a point where she can still give me feedback about what she does and does not like so down the road I'm not flying blind. There is a part of me that feels like all of this might be too much for her too, so I don't know. 

I'm going to wait to see what the Geriatrician has to say, but I think I'm looking at two options. One is letting her return home where she is familiar with things and has a solid support system of friends, and hiring someone to come in for a few hours in the mornings every day to make sure she knows what she has on the agenda for the day and that she's taking her meds. The other is having her stay here permanently. 

My sister was at my mother's earlier this week to pick mom up. She said the house is in good shape and well kept. Mom pays her bills, is active with her friend group, and is capable of all her normal Activities of Daily living and caring for herself for the most part, but she's just very forgetful and gets disoriented. 

I'm just afraid that I'm going to let her go back and something bad is going to happen. 

So now that I've written way too much I guess I'm wondering if I'm doing everything I should. Is there more I should do with her when she's here? Am I trying to do too much and will it confuse her? If she is going to stay here permanently, is it terrible of me to just make that decision and keep her here without any kind of lead up or preparation for her to leave where she has been for the past 50 years? Would allowing her to return home for a short period of time to get things organized at her house confuse her even more than just having her stay here and having me go back to get necessary things on my own without her? 

For everyone who has been doing this for a while what are the things I'm not doing at these early stages that I should be, and what sort of things can I do to help her function as independently as possible for as long as possible considering she's on the very front end of this thing?"
"Just want to thank everyone on this sub for all of your knowledge, support and friendship through these years."
"Just realized I’m the only one who knows which medications my aunt takes when and which medications she takes only occasionally. In addition, I’m the only one who knows the WiFi password, the Netflix email address and passwords for both, etc.

If I suddenly get COVID, have a heart attack or if Dorothy’s house suddenly drops down on me, I haven’t left information for my cousins so they can continue her care. Have you? Where’s the best place to store this info or should I mail it to 2 cousins? And, fwiw, the idea of writing all of this info down is overwhelming. There’s not a computer or a printer in this house, and I don’t want to buy one. Suggestions appreciated."
"My father had a stroke 2 years ago. He was 57 back then (turning 60 this year) and has type 2 diabetes, used to smoke (but stopped long time before the stroke) and drink (not too much), he also never was a sporty person, he couldn't walk long distances. I'm just wondering, I'm really afraid he could have it. Thank you!"
"Hi, it's finally time that I need more help with my mom, but looking for caregivers is feeling so daunting, sad, and stressful. It's hard to leave my mom in someone else's hands because it feels like there are a million ways it could go wrong. Does anyone have any advice on what to ask caregivers when I interview them?"
"Genuine question.. 

Before you became a FT dementia caretaker, were you happy?

I remember being happy.

Some days are ok and I get excited about that but apparently the sudden expression of the ok seems off to my husband because I am usually miserable..

I was just looking up depression/bipolar disorder symptoms and I REALLY don’t think that is the issue.. — We are completely on our own with him and obviously we love him but I leave the house every other Sunday and we have to bring him and his wheelchair so he can bitch the whole time..

Things weren’t perfect before this cluster-fuck but I was able to wake up in the morning without dreading everything in the house…

I am assuming if I saw a psych I would be told that it’s just stress but it’s scary because some days are good and ‘normal’.. Other days I only get out of the bedroom to attend to his needs and the resentment that I feel boils my blood.. (I know it’s not Pops’ fault, it’s the other relatives that abandoned us without help)

Idk, sorry for ranting.. 


Hugs to everyone on this subreddit! 💕"
"My dad was placed in a nursing home today. He was diagnosed with early stages of Alzheimer's with dementia. He keeps asking the same questions over and over and over. I feel devastated. There is no money for the quality of care I would like to give him: nurses at home, 24 hours. I am brokenhearted."
"I am my mom's sole caregiver, and she can no longer be left alone. I won't have anyone else to spell me until some time in July. (No family nearby. No friends I could ask.) Meanwhile, I just found out that my doctor has moved away, and I can't renew my prescriptions without being seen by a new doctor. Can anyone give me advice for finding someone to look after my mom for an hour or two while I'm at the doctor? Where do I look? How do I vette them? What qualifications should I look for? What can I reasonably expect from a short-term carer? What are the going rates?

If I can figure this out, I may look into having someone come in for a couple of hours a week going forward, and I'm wondering if they might be able to, for instance, take her on short day trips to the movies, or on walks, for example, so I can have some much-needed time to myself. Or can I get someone to come help her shower, do her nails, and other personal grooming duties?"

"My mums father died many many years ago from dementia and in the past two years or so my mum has become a bit more forgetful? She struggles to get her words out and it just makes me worry because of her dad. She was on anti depressants for a short while but we thought it was best for her to come off them because her forgetfulness was getting more noticeable, but now she’s been off them for a while she seems to be the same? 

(She also had covid last year and I’ve heard a side effects from that can be forgetfulness and memory issues) 

Is there anything I can do to help her and should I be worried?"

"Why can she seem so unaffected by this disease when distant relatives/ friends visit her, but will forget who my mom or I am, and we’re the only ones who’ve ever been there for her day in and day out?? Our extended family implies we are making up her diagnosis, or exaggerating because they see a different side of her. It’s very frustrating!"
"For the first time in 2 years we had taken an evening off. We were going into town to see a concert. Generally days pass with no issue but the one time we stray away where we aren't the closest people on call guess what happens?
I (not her child, I'm her daughter in law) get the call that 'there is no power and I don't know what to do'. FFS. Now what? Call the other children, can you check on your mother please? Call the care team, have you been in yet? Can you sort it out?
Long, long, long story short, a bulb blew. One light bulb. I'm so damn tired of this but at the same time I'm also gratified that she still trusts me enough to be her first port of call in a storm. It's just such hard damn work and I'm really tired."
"Several months ago, my mother suddenly began showing severe short-term memory issues. She had a brain MRI and it showed signs of chronic microvascular ischemia. Her father had Alzheimer's. We had her assessed by a neuropsychologist and the phone call that follows testing/report is coming up in a few days. Given the severity of her short-term memory loss, I am fully expecting a dementia diagnosis and the doctor will hopefully let us know how far along with that she is.

At present, she drives, food shops, can dress and bathe, etc. It's not clear whether she will be able to continue working, however, due to her memory issues. 

I am putting together a list of questions to ask the doctor during the call. I do not want to be overcome with emotion and unable to think on my feet so I want to be prepared. What questions should be on my list? Thank you so much, from the bottom of my heart, for your time and help."
"Appreciative of this sub. Was kinda here on an old account years ago and wrote some posts. 

Anyway, my grandmother passed in 2019. 3 years ago this month. She had vascular dementia (specific type wasn't ever diagnosed but her symptoms and likely cause of dementia were all aligned with vascular dementia). She never forgot who we were. She loved when we were all in the house. She would call us some days every 30 mins for no reason. Some days she was paranoid. I felt so closed in some days but I'd go back to those days in a snap if I could have her back. 

Anyway, I still feel so much guilt at yelling at her, being short with her, etc. I helped my mom care for her then my sister returned to help. She was super easy to care for compared to most but getting her to listen many times was so hard and I know it was the dementia but also she was a stubborn thing and I felt part of that came through too. I feel so bad for yelling though. I wasn't angry. Just frustrated. I feel bad for not giving her the attention she needed some days. Especially after my mom got cancer. My sister and I were so worried because of the cancer treatments. We fed and changed my grandma and our caretaker was super helpful during that time. I want to apologize to her. Let her know I love her (I think she knew). But I just feel so guilty and feel like some of the diverted attention caused her eventual downturn. 

I miss that woman fiercely and watching her siblings pass away is making my grief come back harder. I wouldn't wish this disease on anyone."
"I am in the early days of suspecting my mom might have dementia.  I think there's something not quite right with my mom. Every single day is different.  The thing that caught me off guard earlier this year was her mood.  Complete silence from her to me.  I am mindful of my attitude to my mom and I am not sarcastic or critical of her and I help around the home and pay bills. I did nothing to warrant silence from her.   Then there were times when she was in the silence mode and she would rush around the home and grab her jacket and run from the house to go out walking.   The silence was something that was happening for a few months.  

The silence was the number 1 thing that caught me off guard earlier this year and I began to wonder if this could be dementia. 

Then there was other behaviours over the past 2/3/4 years that I think I can now piece together alongside the silence.  

Currently a type of OCD cleaning has taken her over.  Every single day with her - cleaning.  Also she's not able to comprehend the energy crisis and the there was little effort to reduce energy consumption.   I am nearly at a stage where I am going to have a heart attack at the machine.   60 degree loads with prewash and extra rinse.  Washing only one or two items at a time. The whole works.  There's no effort or understanding to reduce the energy consumption.  She's washing as if she's leaving severe disease on everything. 

There was a type of silliness over the past few years like buying more shoes when she has shoes, shoes, shoes, shoes.  She just wants more.  

Recently I read something that said when dementia is found, quite often dementia change have been happening for up to 10 years before diagnosis. 

Is that true? 

Looking back there were other things over the past few years.  Her reasoning was warpped over some issues over the past few years. For example she was not able to follow instructions from the vet when our dog was old and sick.  

Now, I am thinking if it's dementia and of it was setting in for years? I hope I am wrong.  I don't have time to be a carer to my mom.  And especially this.  I am trying to suggest to my mom to turn the temperature down on the washing machine and leave off the extra functions and it's not going down well.  She's looking for a fight from me when I try to conserve energy like this."
"After four weeks at one facility, it’s become clear that this is not the best one for my wife. 

Not enough activities, despite a supposed calendar. Not enough residents to socialize with (she’s not too far “gone” and needs that). And the food is very mediocre - yesterday’s lunch was a slice of ham, some beans and some cabbage. Today was a piece of roast beef, mashed potatoes and overcooked string beans. Desserts have been some piece of a sweet cake with icing. I’ve yet to see a greasy vegetable or fruit. 

Went to see another one yesterday, a bit more expensive, but it was like night and day, with more people, more real activities, and a dining room and menu that actually looked and sounded appetizing. 

There’s a question whether she’ll “qualify” for the level just above the locked unity, but either way should be much, much better. 

Any advice on how to handle this with her? The Placement Consultant will take care of the details. I’ve arranged for lunch there with her next week, with a chat (not a full assessment yet) with the nurse to at least get a sense of which level and to give my wife some sense of control in all this. 

I’m especially wondering how to let her know that cooperation with the eventual assessment will be important for her time there. 

Thanks"
"Has anyone ever had trouble getting a nursing home to take their loved one? My Grandpa has been living with us for 8 months and Mom finally admitted she couldn’t handle it anymore a month ago. We found a place close to my aunts , but they told us we had to wean him off the Seroquel and put him on Trazodone . Which would take about 3 weeks . The 3 weeks is almost up and my uncle and his wife came up to give Mom some help . They decided to take him to ER yesterday because he had a pretty bad hemmorhoid . The hospital decided to keep him for the night to take him off his blood thinners and monitor his hemoglobin so they could remove it . They haven’t done the surgery yet , but in the meantime my uncle decided to see if we could get him transferred from there to the nursing home. Which would make more sense since he was supposed to move next week . Our Comission on Aging Caseworker called the nursing home to get the process movin and now the nursing home is claiming the bed (that they said they’d hold for him is not available now . So either they lied and never intended to take him or we mistakenly thought they would hold the  bed. My Mom and aunt are very frustrated and wondering what to do next . I’m pissed because I feel like the nursing home doesn’t want to help and doesn’t give a FUCK about our situation !!!!"
"My mother in law was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. She lives with her husband in New York, they are both elderly and need help at home. Things like checking that they’ve eaten, taking garbage out, making sure they aren’t eating expired food…just checking in in general. We live close by and my husband does a ton for them, but we are about to start IVF and need help. 

The problem is my MIL, with Alzheimer’s, has been scammed a bunch online, and now my husband is very wary of anyone being in their orbit, as he’s worried they will take advantage of her. I know there are services we could call but I thought I would take a shot and see if there are any referrals people may have here. 

While we are at it, looking forward, are there any homes people in the area have liked?

Thank you in advance!"
"Hi everyone newish here to the subreddit, back in 2018 my mother was diagnosed with PCA which now has turned into dementia. She’s also been diagnosed with Capgras syndrome due to her late stage PCA. Was hoping for any advice on how to cope or maybe make it less awful for her. Thank you for reading."
"My dad was diagnosed back in 2018 with mixed dementia and Alzheimer’s. He has progressively gotten worse through the years to the point where it is near impossible to care for him at home. He recently spent 58 days in the hospital with A-symptomatic pneumonia. Do to being in bed for this length of time his mobility has gone completely. We have a hospital bed and carers that attend 4 times a day to help carry the burden, however recently he has declined even more, becoming both verbally and physically abusive towards myself and my mother. He has to use a catheter which he yanks about pretty much on a daily basis causing himself great pain. Yesterday he attempted to climb out of bed, but with no strength in his legs he would’ve hurt himself. He has become a danger to himself and others. I just don’t know what to do or who to turn to.

I’ve come to the realisation that the man who lays in bed, attempting to occasionally escape, yell obscenity’s and is all round miserable is not my dad, not really, not anymore, and I want not only what’s best for him going forward but for my mum.

Any help would be greatly appreciated"
"I (27m) live with my grandma (78f) to take care of her house, chores, and animals. It’s been two years now and while there have been wonderful times that I will always cherish, not everyday is a good one. Sometimes we argue, usually about things that didn’t happen, and it can be very hard to de-escalate. Tonight was one of those nights and she kept following me to argue and call me names. I ended up yelling at her and saying something really mean. She said something to the effect of her killing herself to spite me and I said that I wished she would. It just slipped out. She just went to sit down on the couch and fell asleep within minutes after. I’ve been sitting here feeling terrible ever since. I don’t like that I let myself say something like that. 

How do you guys de-escalate situations like that? I’ve had knives pulled on me a few times before I decided to hide them. I just don’t want fight with her like this anymore."
She showed signs in 2014. By 2020 I forced her to a Dr. Early stages then. By end of 2021 she couldn’t live alone. Now she’s beginning to have a LITTLE difficulty running the shower etc.  But her short term is GONE. The EXACT same questions over and over and over. Every few min or less. I am losing it. This is on top of losing my stepmom after being her hospice nurse for 3 months. And now my dads SEVERE hypochondria asking me if he’s dying 100x a day. I’ve been caretaking everyone for 2 years. I’m losing it. But this post is specifically : HOW DO I DEAL WITH THE SAME QUESTION EVERY 5 SECONDS?!! Do you people have the patience of a saint? I’m pretty good. And she (was) my best friend. But this is. It’s all ruining my life. With covid. And I might as well quit.
"Are false memories a major sign of dementia or Alzheimer's? My stepmother told me a story about meeting Vladimir Putin in Columbus Ohio.  Without getting into the details of the scenario she has now told me (and others) several times, I know this never happened.  This past weekend I was visiting and found where she had written down ""My Putin Story"" on a notepad.  She told me that everyone that she tells is just in disbelief and amazed (probably more concerned in reality).  She is also showing other troubling signs such as forgetting to pay an annual bill (one that she has paid since 1996) that is now in collections and I am trying to deal with.

While I am typing this, I am kind of answering my own question, but any advice?  Do I try to tell her that Putin has never been to Ohio and specifically to the event that she thinks she met him at or will that make her more confused?"
"Last night, after a long, stressful weekend with my mother, she did something that made me smile. When I was a younger, she used to sing a little song to me as a goodnight. “See you in the morning!”, to the tune of singing in the bathtub. I always answered back”la de da de da”

She sang that little tune to me last night after I tucked her in bed. I answered back with my part and we both giggled. I love my mom ☺️"
"I lost my father after an incredibly long battle with Alzheimer's about 15 months ago.

Wanting to help others finding themselves in the same horrible situation, I wrote an essay about the experience, which was recently published.

I wrote it not only to tell my story, but to provide insight, guidance, resources, and to offer a glimpse into how Alzheimer’s can affect not only those afflicted with the disease, but — almost more importantly — their loved ones, because it is they who bear the deepest burden and suffering. 

Above all, I wrote it to help people navigate the devastating and overwhelming journey of caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's. 

Here is a quote from Greg O'Brien, author of On Pluto: Inside the Mind of Alzheimer's:

*""Excellent piece, Darren. Excellent! Hoping as many people as possible will read your words. You have great insight, a gift the world needs to hear.""*

I hope you will read the essay and hope that it helps you. And please feel free to share it in any capacity.

Thank you and all the best,

Thank you to every single person who posts on here. I don’t know what I’d do without reading your comments and experiences. Thank you!
"It's been a rough last 8 years. I'm my mom's primary caregiver since my dad passed away in 2014. Through it all, my mom, for the most part, remained a sweetie (she had her moments of course...always been independent since a her teens and hated being doted on by the professional caregivers we had coming to the house to help me out), even as the disease progressed. She contracted COVID-19, somehow, in February (I think at the dentist office) and was placed in home hospice. It looked as though she might improve to the point of graduating out of hospice, but things suddenly went downhill overnight. Yesterday evening, she was laughing at some old Three Stooges videos that I was playing for her. When I changed her at 4 AM she was responsive. But, this morning at around 11 AM, she wouldn't wake up. She seemed to know that I was there since she would move her thumb on my hand and squeeze it when I held hers, and her eyes opened slightly. The hospice nurse arrived, took her vitals, and stated that she's in the final phase, that her body is in the process of shutting down. They gave her some morphine since she seemed a bit agitated. This seemed to ease her. Anyway, she seems to be resting peacefully, and that's where I'm at. I don't know what to do.

Edit - I'm on the verge of crying but can't quite."
"I would first like to preface this by saying I'm not sure if it belongs here. My goal is to get some advice on how to deal with the situation that my fiancee and I have found ourselves in. This is most likely going to be long, so please buckle up. 

My fiancee's mother passed in February of 21. She had very advanced coronary artery disease, to the point that many of her organs had atrophied prior to her death from lack of blood flow. She knew she was dying for several months prior to her death; her personal preference was to keep this to herself. She was refusing medical care by the end, and insisted that no one could know. Which means that my father in law, her husband of 45+ years, couldn't tell anyone, either. 

My fiancee had an idea that something was going on, and left at 250k+ a year job to move closer in December of 2020. His mother passed in Feb of 21. He was pretty sure that his father wouldn't do well after his mother passed. And he was right, though it took a while to manifest, and even then, it would have been impossible to predict exactly how badly it was going to go. 

His dad, we will call him Jimmy, did okay for a while. My fiancee would go stay on weekends at his apartment for a while, and help him with various tasks related to bill paying ect. Jimmy was confident that he would fail the driving test required for him to keep his driver's license, so he agreed when we offered to let him move into our house. 

When Jimmy moved in with us, he was mostly in possession of his mental faculties. He would, however, occasionally tell stories about things that had never happened. It was clear that he really believed that these things had happened, but no one else had any memory of these things. For example, he told a story about how I had taken him to a goat farm, where one of the goats had headbutted him in the nuts. This never happened. I assumed something similar must have happened with a previous partner of my fiancee's. This turned out to not be the case, and just the first symptom. 

This year, Jimmy experienced the first anniversary of his wife's death. We were prepared for a bad time on that day. much to our relief, it seemed to pass like any other day. We began to look forward to Jimmy's 80th birthday two weeks later. We had no way of knowing that nothing would be the same again.

On Jimmy's 80th birthday, we had plans to go out for dinner to celebrate. Those plans never happened. Because the morning of his birthday, Jimmy woke up convinced that the police were coming to arrest him. He'd apparently witnessed a dog being hit by a car, and snapped the dog's neck to put it out of his misery. (he'd recently watched the first episode of house of cards, which is where I believe he got the idea) he was also convinced that a giant conspiracy existed between his late wife's doctors, and all of his friends, to pin the death of his late wife on him. We hoped that it was just the stress of the one year anniversary and his 80th birthday causing a little confusion. That turned out not to be the case. 

Jimmy has had very few lucid periods since then. We took him to the doctor who prescribed Seroquil, an anti-psychotic medication to help with his delusions. He took it for a few days, before he became convinced that the medication was a placebo, and decided to test it by taking the entire bottle. Luckily this was not enough to kill him. Following that incident, we declined to renew his prescription. 

Jimmy had a few doctors appointments after that, where various labs were drawn. All of his labs came back stellar, particularly for someone of his age. Eventually we convinced his primary to do a brain MRI - this also came back completely normal. 

Meanwhile, Jimmy has been living in a false reality where literally everyone is out to get him. He insists that all the shades in the house be drawn; he's pointed out to me on numerous occasions the police officers camped in our back yard. Every noise is the signal for them to invade our house. One morning at 5 am he came into our room to tell us that the cops had the 'hoot owl' in the yard, and that was the signal. Other times it is the train, or the medical helicopter going to the hospital that is a mile up the road. 

We were hoping, especially as we have never received a diagnosis, that this was a temporary psychotic break. However, we are almost three months in, and things seem to be getting worse instead of better. Recently, Jimmy told my fiancee that he raped me, and I gave him syphilis. (This is, of course, not true, the same as everything else he believes at this point.) He's also convinced that the neighbors have made him run a gauntlet around the neighborhood where he's had to stick his hand in a hot grill and fend off multiple snakes. 

He absolutely refuses to go to any kind of doctor at this point, because he's convinced they're in on the conspiracy. There is no reasoning with him whatsoever. He's also dropped an alarming amount of weight, because he refuses to eat for long stretches of time.

What do I do? I'm not qualified to take care of a person like this, and it's literally destroying my partner. He's a constant anxious wreck, and I don't blame him. I just need some help. What do we do?"
"This is the late-night/early morning ramblings of an Autistic, stressed-out, terrified mind. I (40f) live with my parents because I can't afford to move out. I have alerts set up on various property websites that let me know when a property matching my search criteria is listed, but the rent is always far too much especially with the deposit added on top (usually equal to or greater than the 1st month's rent.

My Dad is 73 this year and I'm not sure what stage of Altzheimer's he has. I think middle, cos he's always asking me if I'm working that day, even when I'm dressed in my work uniform. Sometimes he'll randomly ask me in the afternoon when I've been around all day.. 

I really can't keep going like this- constantly getting super anxious when dad gets up in the middle of the night. Always laying awake worrying about what he's doing. Where he's gonna pee. If he's gonna make a mess. 

I'm terrified of mum finding it & going apeshit, yelling at dad, slamming doors & drawers, dad saying stop shouting/slamming stuff cos it makes him confused. I just finished cleaning up after him again.

It's a good thing I was still awake tonight when Dad did what he did.

 This time he peed out the front door. I was retching as I came downstairs. I used the last of the kitchen paper, some TP, & some (Antibacterial spray cos it got all over the door frame. When I asked why he did it he claimed it was cos my mum doesn't allow him to pee anywhere else. 

I think I got it all but some may have gone under the bottom of the door frame. I worry abt the stink that may develop even with the spray. 

He'll probably get found out at that point and I'll get yelled at for covering it up. Last time this happened, he peed in the living room! And guess who cleaned that mess up as well... I asked him if he was gonna just leave the pee as is and he said no, but he had already gotten back into bed. Plus he can't really get down onto his hands and knees anymore. 

I can only pray none of our neighbours were awake and happened to look out their windows in our direction. I had to give up on numbering these cos I wasn't sure how much I needed to get off my chest. I'll definitely have to call the housing association & beg for a house/flat.

Yes, Dad has Altzheimer's, but is it wrong of me to want a calm, stress-free life? I'm sure that's what mum wants too. As an Autistic person, I hate stress, I hate the anxiety, I hate what this is doing to both my parents but esp to my mum. In my darkest thoughts (& I'm ashamed to admit this), I sometimes think it would be better had he died. Or that I had gotten out of this house years ago. 

 I also wish nursing homes were less expensive- £800 per week is in no way affordable! I'm tired. I'm tired of having to hide the messes dad makes.

I'm tired of the stress, the anxiety, the fear. I'm tired of having to mask. Of having to pretend things are perfectly fine. Of having my home invaded multiple times a day by the carers for dad. But at the same time I know they're necessary to cut down on messes, to get dad up, washed and dressed in the mornings, toileted 2x during the day then again at night & also changed for bed. 

I'm laying here in bed, still awake, with only a short nap yesterday (sunday) afternoon plus maybe an hr or so tonight. But I still can't sleep. I stg, I'm not gonna be happy if i hear dad get up again tonight. I'm so thankful i don't have to work today. But tomorrow is another story.

I had thought of renting a room from someone, but often the rent for a room is close to the price for a 1bed flat. But then again your bills might be included in that price. I definitely need a place of my own as soon as possible though. I really need to cry but I can't afford to.

Marking as NSFW just to be safe (I've never posted anything like this before)."
"Some background my grandmother in law had dementia, she passed January 2020. In December she had gone missing by that I mean no one in the family could contact her, she had been in my FILs custody. And he wasn’t answering his phone either. Later she was found at a hospital near his house. We sadly didn’t go to see her, a deer ran into the side of our car on the way there. But my spouses mother did and showed us pictures and she looked emaciated and had bruises bad all over but really bad on her wrists and ankle. I was wondering if this was normal or are our suspicions of elder abuse true?"
"I feel like such a pos and I love my mom but to see her age with this disease..it is killing me. My mom is combative, everything is a fight. It is a struggle to get her to shower. She plays in her poop. I am so fucking done, I feel evil for thinking it but I wish lethal euthanasia for people was legal because whoever is occupying her body, it is not the woman I used to know."
My 84 yr. Father was put on home health care after he became unable to walk. This progressed to palliative care and then hospice care in a period of about 3 months. The hospice nurse suggests I stop his diabetes meds but I am reluctant to comply. I am having to change depends many times a day as he became bedridden. He is still fairly heavy and has some appetite. He still has some good hours occasionally and I believe he could live for longer than hospice tells me. Just wanting to hear thoughts on stopping life prolonging meds
"My mom (62) can sometimes be forgetful, but she is normally on track of her appointments and work at her job. She is sometimes absent minded, asking me if I ate food after eating next to her, but then again she is consumed by Facebook and WhatsApp on your iPhone. She also plays a ton of word games and memory matching games. On top of that, my mom works in the school district so she always manages to stay on track of her work. She LOVES to talk so she will often repeat stories after telling us earlier in the day and sometimes she does not realize she has told us before. 

She is obese, but has been treating her high blood pressure and high cholesterol from years so everything is in normal range according to her blood tests. We are working on getting her to lose weight through diet changes and she has cut down a lot on her calories, but it is hard for her to exercise since her knees hurt a lot. I am starting to look at chair/sitting down exercises and it does look promising for losing weight. 

For all intents and purposes she is fine, but I just have this terrible fear that she will suffer from dementia in the future.

Any help on how to cope with this?"
"Title. She’s adamant that it is day-time, and is not going to sleep. Please help."
"Just got home after 3 years (stuck away from pandemic) and my step mom fully has dementia, she can't remember any new information and is usually very confused all day. The worst is she's paranoid and CONSTANTLY acuses me of taking her money/ car. Tonight she was convinced I hid her car from her. I can't reason with her and I also can't reason with my dad that she needs to see a doctor. It severe denial, and im scared something bad is going to happen, she already fell about a month ago, tripping over the dogs food bowl which has been there for literally YEARS. she's also still driving. I have literally no clue how I am supposed to deal with this, can she be forced to see a doctor????? Idk wat to do. My dad says he knows its dementia but that because her mom had it as well that we don't need a doctor because we already know what it is????

&#x200B;

is it true that you don't have to see a doctor with dementia?  my dad says there's no harm, and no meds or anything helps? "
"My mom is nearly 70. 

Earlier this year, my mom was doing something weird.  Basically more often than not she was in a silent mood to me.  I live at home and I am mindful of my own attitude and mood.  I am not critical or sarcastic.  I am always helping with jobs and paying bills.  I can't think of a reason for the silence.  It wasn't the first time.  The silence was on and off for months. One morning she might not be talk to me and than the next she could be trying to be my best friend.  The evenings as well.  Some evenings after work, she's sitting in her chair and I would be lucky if I got 'hello' out of her.   Any attempt at conversation from me was met with one word replies.  Then there would be days she would be in the silence mode and she would start prancing around the house and get her jacket and looked as if she was making progress to go out and then the next second I would hear the front door close.  Not even a 'goodbye' from her.  No speech to tell me where she's going.  If she's going for a walk or to the shops. 


This was the behaviour that caught me off guard.  I thought it was so weird.   

I was able to think back over the past 2 years and there were some other behaviours too and it's only now that I am piecing things together and thinking maybe dementia might be setting in. 

My understanding of dementia though is that there is a forgetfulness or confusion.  I will admit, there is some mixing up of things from her but it's ever so mild and I can be the same when I am busy and stressed.   

A relatively new behaviour from her is OCD cleaning.  The youngest is gone now from the nest and she had a lot of focus on him and helping him.  She's now cleaning every day and a lot of it I think is OCD cleaning.  

This is difficult for me because my suspicions of dementia is not showing up as forgetfulness.  It's just some odd stuff on mood and angers and ocd stuff. 

Every day is different with her.  Some days are ok and then other days she's just flat if that makes any sense. 

I don't know how to go forward with my suspicions.   I feel like I can't talk to her about this. She's not going to welcome any of this and it will likely result in an outburst from her. 
I don't feel comfortable ringing or writing or emailing to the GP practice. 
I would feel more comfortable talking to a GP face to face.  We attend to the same practice.  I wonder would it be ok for me to make an appointment for myself at some point and raise concerns about my mom so they can maybe not it on her chart and start the process of investigating. 

I think there's definitely something going on but it's not showing up as a typical forgetfulness. I know some replies to me before said sometimes UTIs can present in a similar way.  I don't know if it is a UTI because I can go back 2/3 years with pieces of my mom's behaviours.  If it was an undiagnosed UTI surely she would be in sepsis by now."
"I'm almost 24 now, she's 84. My great grandma is Saint of a woman who helped raise me and so many others in the family. I call her a few times a month to twice a week, mail her pictures, and occasionally get her stuff from Amazon to help her out (walking shoes, pajamas, etc), and visit every few years when I can afford to. 

I've noticed her condition getting significantly worse and I'm wondering what more I can do to help her? She has her sons and grandsons helping her out since she and my great grandpa aren't able to drive. It breaks my heart listening to her confusion - she thinks it's currently December, and told me that two of her daughters recently passed away (even though they passed 10 and ~15 years ago). I don't know what to do or how to deal with this, any advice is greatly appreciated."
"My mother in law is probably at stage 6- can’t be left alone for more than a few hours, doesn’t drive or cook, doesn’t remember to get dressed or bathe on her own and pees herself a lot. My partner is her primary caregiver and has been living with her and taking care of her ADLs for over a year. It is taking a huge toll on them mentally as they have no time for friends, hobbies, pets, a job or me. We recently hired weekend caregivers to check on her so partner can come home and spend time with me. 

Well, first weekend alone and the caregiver arrived to find her on the floor. She doesn’t remember when or how she fell. This happens every few months, always when she’s left alone. I think it’s possibly related to her anxiety about being left. She wants my partner to be by her side 24/7 and is not capable of understanding why that isn’t possible. She gets upset when they leave. 

MIL is still conversational and wants a lot of company all day and night. She can read but gets frustrated with most activities and mostly wants to watch tv. Her ability to take walks changes every day. She is still aware of who we are and where she is, but doesn’t know what day or season it is and does not retain information/conversations. Our plan was to build an addition on our house, move her here and have caregivers assist us with her ADLs and keep her company. I work from home full time so I could help a little but burnt out partner would still be primary caregiver. It’s going to take a good 4-6 months to get the addition built and she seems to be declining already. Moving her in without the addition would be even more stressful on all of us (too small, shared bathroom etc).

My partner feels a lot of pressure to make this happen for her because she wants so badly to be with us. But we are realizing she might be at a point where she needs 24/7 care. I will not allow my poor partner to further deteriorate by sleeping with her and accompanying her for every single bathroom trip. She does have money for a care facility and we’re in the middle of putting her assets in trust in case she lives longer than 5 years. 

I guess what I’m asking is, what would you do? I am protective of my partner and cannot bear to watch them fall into a black hole of depression over this and lose more of their precious life to her constant care. Is it time to put her in a home?

Editing to add: my partner is very upset, and has been on the verge of a nervous breakdown for months. We were really hoping these weekends off would be a decent compromise until MIL is moved in with us but it already doesn't seem to be working. I am very concerned."
"Edit: Thank you all so much for your incredibly kind words. I will go through each and every comment later! 💛 I'm overwhelmed, this community is amazing.

First of all, I'm glad this sub exists. The fact that we all basically share similar experiences makes me feel less alone. 

So, I'm only 21 (about to turn 22) and my dad (in his late 70s) has had dementia for a long time, I'd say it started around 2015. Last year he moved into a care facility, which is relieving on one hand, but on the other hand his dementia has progressed extremely fast in this past year. He doesn't recognize any of his family anymore, he needs to be fed and help on the toilet.
He recently was in the hospital cause of kidney failure and since then it got even worse. He barely wakes up anymore and if he does, he is not present. Just a body without a soul. 
Basically I'm starting to prepare myself for his passing. My coping strategy so far has been surpressing everything. It's just too painful to let it get to me. I love my dad over everything, he means the world to me.

So... how tf can I survive losing my dad this young? How do you even cope with that? How do you overcome losing the person you love the most?"
"My (25) mom (63) was diagnosed with dementia a few months back. It was hard to process. It feels like so much loss. Losing my mom, who she really is. Loss of what I expected. Loss might not be the right word, but different than what I hoped for. Especially for when I have kids. On top of that she was diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer this week. It’s not looking good. If she goes through chemo the chances of it making her dementia worse temporarily or permanently is pretty much inevitable. I guess I’m just looking for some words of encouragement/support."
Hi I’m 36 years old and my father has dementia he’s 87 years old he’s currently in a nursing home so he’s getting great care but it’s  super hard cause he’s changed and not who he used to be he’s currently battling his 3rd UTI this year he is dehydrated and can’t comprehend how important it is to drink liquids he doesn't understand things anymore I’m losing my dad piece by piece I feel somewhat alone in this because usually this happens when the children are much older not in their 30’s (me and my sister) and our friends parents are way younger than ours I feel so lost and scared thanks for listening
"My mother-in-law sometimes gets very anxious and obstinate when we try to give her the meds that will help reduce the episode.  Like a catch 22.

Sometimes she spits out the applesauce or pudding that has the crushed med in it.  I almost wish Seroquel came in an injectable for those times..not even sure if that is an option.  Anyway, do you guys have any solid tricks to get an angry loved one to take the med that will help?"
"Effect of aromatherapy in patients with Alzheimer's disease: a randomised controlled clinical trial 

Twenty-five patients with AD in the aroma group (two participants discontinued midway) and 26 in the control group (one participant discontinued midway) completed the study (Table 1). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding baseline participant characteristics. There were no statistical differences in the total PQSI \[Pittsburgh Quality of Sleep Index\], NPI-Q \[Neuropyschiatric Inventory-Questionaire\], and QOLAD \[Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease\] scores between the two groups before the intervention (P > 0.05); however, at week 8, the PQSI score of the aromatherapy group was significantly lower than that of the control group (P = 0.003), and the QOL-AD score was significantly improved compared to that of the control group (P = 0.009); the NPI-Q score of the aromatherapy group was slightly lower than that of the control group, but the distinction was insignificant (P = 0.077). At the end of the 12-week intervention, the PQSI and NPI-Q scores of the two groups were reduced compared with before the intervention. Furthermore, the QOL-AD score was improved compared to before the intervention, and the difference in the scores between the two groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05) (Table 2)..."
"Hi all, 

My grandfather 93 years old has dementia that has been progressing fairly quickly. I even notice a big difference in the past 2 weeks. 

My question is: how can I know what is his dementia progressing vs delirium? 

He had an episode of delirium in September, and again 3 weeks ago but the hospital didn’t catch it and they assumed he had Covid even if he has zero symptoms. PCR and rapid tests all came back negative and they sent him home. He is extremely intelligent and if you don’t know him you wont notice the extent of his confusion. He basically tells the same story over and over again about how he was a microbiologist and could have worked in a hospital but ended up vice-dean of medicine at our university etc etc 

This past week he has become completely obsessed with a watch that was “stolen” and he sleeps a lot during the day. 

He called me an hour ago and couldn’t tell me the name of the residence where he was (unusual), apparently had called the reception at the residence because he wanted a list of all the employees that were working Easter (when he thinks his watch was taken). The receptionist told him he couldn’t have that information and he got very agitated. He called me to tell me his frustrations and asking for a lawyer wanting to sue the residence."
"We are nearing the point of needing to put my mother in memory care. We have a place chosen and room reserved. Our problem is how do we break the news to her?

Our mother is highly educated and very resistant to help. She has always said she doesnt want to be in a home but it's a safety concern at this point. What are some ways we can ease the transition for her? How do others prepare their loved ones for the change? We expect her to be emotionally hostile and want to make things are easy for her as possible. Thank you."
"hi, my father (70) just retired and i have been spending more time calling and spending time with him because of that. he was always the type to want to work 24/7, so it really took a lot to have him actually retire. anyways, the last couple years i did notice him being more forgetful than usual, telling me the same story multiple times, etc. but i assumed it was just him being very busy with work and such. lately, it’s been more than just that though. for example, the other day, i asked my dad if he had my birth certificate since i needed to renew my passport. next time i came to visit, he gave me the documents in an envelope and said it was the documents for my background check at work. 
this worried me since i did ask him for similar papers for a background check at work, but that was a whole year ago. 

i’ve always been worried about him as he’s aged and i asked him to cut back on his drinking and have a healthier diet. while he has been cutting down on fatty foods and high sodium, he absolutely refuses to cut down alcohol. he has at least one beer with every meal. he says he rather be dead than give up his choice of meal accompaniment. i also mentioned that he should get a check up soon, but he says that is also not necessary as he’s already old. im wondering if anyone had any advice of how to go about this. did you have a family member who refused to be healthy or even see a doctor? is there anything i can do myself to help him if he refuses to do something himself?"
"My quite-a-lot older sister was diagnosed with MCI about 4 years ago. She is now 61. I haven’t observed much other than mild forgetfulness over those years, but just lately, like last 4 months or so, she is saying things that are way out of character. Insults, complaints, really mean jokes about me, totally out of the blue. She also seems to be unable to talk and do a task now, like if we are cleaning the kitchen after a meal, she seems not to hear. Does this mean anything?"
"Hi everyone, my mother late 60’s has received a dementia diagnosis. We are awaiting a second MRI. 
Her Dr. does not believe it is Alzheimer’s, she does show signs of Frontal dementia.
I have recently noticed a large increase in her fixation level. She has become very fixated on some current events she sees online and has begun to talk about it non-stop. I have tried changing the subject, asking other questions and redirecting her but it feels constant.
I don’t know if I should says something or if it would matter. It feels like the conversation is so one sided and I could almost not be there. She would just keep talking about this topic. 
Part of it is grief also, I don’t know if this is a dementia symptom but it feels unlike her and like something has shifted again. Like another loss. Like it’s not even her, just so sad. I have to not think about that part, feels like she is turning into a different person I don’t even know.
Just wondered if anyone else has experienced this ? 
Thanks for reading and a place to vent."
I’m mentioned my step-father’s dementia in a previous post. Again thank you for all of the feedback.  Is there anyone in the New York/Westchester County area that I could talk to about getting my step-father more help? Even a group to speak to others dealing with dementia or other illnesses in person? I need help coping.

"I (23 F) am about to graduate with my masters degree in nutrition and am basically guaranteed a position at a local veteran's hospital. I've lived with my family for the duration of college. At first I did it to avoid the expenses of dorming/renting, but it has basically led me into being my 71 year old dad's caregiver. 

My dad was in a car accident right before I graduated highschool about 6 years ago and had a bad concussion. His memory was a little fuzzy afterward, but totally understandable given the accident. Ever since then though, he had been declining and has gotten especially worse the past 2 years. My mom and I have had to take away the car keys and so someone has to drive him to appointments. We have to cook for him because he can't be trusted with a stove or oven, and even basic foods we have to do because he, for example, will not make a sandwich unless we get everything out of the fridge and set it in front of him. He can't be left alone because he will call people non stop on his cell phone and get very agitated. Even when he is home he still tries to do this, so then I take his phone, and instead he will constantly ask me for the phone back or where it is. We tried sending him to a senior center during the day while I was at an internship and my mom was at work, but he would call us non stop and tell us he was bored and wanted to come home. And then would also get agitated at the center. We have to lay clean clothes out for him and remind him to take a shower, brush his teeth, etc. 
    And his most recent development is that if someone is asleep while he is awake, he thinks they are sick and will repeatedly wake them up to ask if they are okay. Problem is, he gets up at 5 AM and I sleep late (like 10 AM). So from 5 AM until whenever I get out of bed, he is waking me up every 20 minutes to ask if I'm okay. When I am inevitably tired in the afternoon and want to lay down for a nap, he does the same thing. Oh and of course he can do basically no household chores unless he is supervised like a hawk, which at that point it's not really help anymore. I feel like I am taking care of a 6 year old. 

And well, I'm just sick of all this. It's not like I was never expecting to be a care giver for my parents, just not this early when I am just establishing myself. Like my parents really didn't start caring for theirs until they were in their 40s.  I feel like I have no life. If a friend invites me out somewhere, I have to either decline becsuse my dad will be home alone, or I have to arrange for him to go to the senior center and then subject my mom to his torrent of phone calls (and I know I can't just take his phone away then, because then he will harass one of the supervisors their to call my mom for him). And now my mom doesn't want me to move out because, well, she can't care for my dad on her own, and so I have no privacy at home to have a relationship with someone. If I did ever move out I feel like she will have no choice but to put him in a SNF, which I don't ever want as I spent part of my internship working at one and they are just sad and pathetic.

I have a younger brother, but he moved out years ago and is not going to come back to be a caregiver as he just got offered a full time position at a lab he works at. Nor should he have to be a caregiver at 22. 

I'm not sure what the point of this post is. I guess I am just ranting."
"So yes, we went on a picnic to the park.  I'd put some cat kibbles in an old bread-bag, to feed lurking cheeky magpies with - I'd TOLD HER, look we'll bring some of these cat-food nugget-things for the maggies who always turn up hoping for snacks.  ""Ok"" she says.

We'd had our sandwiches, there were various other snacks in the basket too.  Whilst I was reading magazine mum was grazing the snacks, I heard loud crunching and looked over to see her with the bread bag and a handful of kitty-kibbles.  CRUNCH CRUNCH eating it like popcorn.

NNOOOOOO  Mum!!   ""But, the bag says 'Fig & Sultana', not 'cat food'!!?""    Yes mum, it's an OLD bread bag, it's cat food we brought with us from home, for the magpies!!!!      ""Hmm, really?  Well, whatever they are, ok they're a bit odd but, tasty anyway.""     lmao.....   :)

Anyone else some funnies recently?  "
"Hello, I'm taking care of an old lady (87). Been doing so for awhile now. Started by visiting her every evening to chat and give her her meds. Her health has been declining rapidly over the last year (we suspect that an operation caused the outbreak of her dementia, it's gotten worde since an operation at the start of the year which caused her to be wheelchair bound). I am not her primary caregiver but I watch her and keep her company every once in a while so her live-in caregiver can take a break. 

I started putting lotion on her handy, filing her fingernails (as far as possible, due to her wheelchair her hands are more like claws and she can't really stretch her fingers without pain), brushing her hair, putting on music or the TV and chat. It's mostly me talking since she rarely interacts with me. I talk about watever is on my mind and ask her questions. We have a game here but I tried to play with her UNO twice last year and that did not work at all.

How can I make her feel better? She can't leave the house (no ramp), is not interested in games or looking at photos I show her."
"
Anybody else have a situation like this? My mom (66) is the one with dementia; Grandma (90) is healthy for her age. I suspect Grandma's phone number is the only one Mom remembers, since it's been the same for the last 40 years. She calls at least a couple of times a week, often when she's confused about where she is, and sometimes at inappropriate times because she forgets about the 3 hour time zone difference. Mom is not in danger; 99% of the time, she's at home in her own living room and just doesn't realize it. Grandma lives 3,000 miles away, so there's nothing she can do anyway - the phone calls are just causing her distress. It's got to be torture to know her oldest child is suffering like this. 

I don't want to prevent my mom from calling her mom, but maybe there's a way to keep the phone calls to decent hours?  Also, Grandma is healthy for a 90 year old, but isn't going to live forever. What do we do when she's not available to answer the phone anymore?

Background: Mom has been showing signs of cognitive decline for about 10 years and was diagnosed almost 2 years ago. No one else on her side of the family has had any kind of dementia that we know of. My dad (72) is managing most of my mom's care at home. However, he sleeps a lot more than she does, so he's not always aware of what she's doing. And he seems opposed to bringing in outside help. I live relatively closest of all my siblings, but I'm still about 90 minutes away and can't get over there very often."
"I'm a caregiver for my mom (79). 

I noticed last week that one of her front teeth had chipped. This week I looked again and more of the same tooth has broken off. She is indicating that the tooth is painful. 

She has been bedbound since September 2021. 

Has anyone else had this happen? If so, how did you handle it?"
"I'm a young female and Dementia has taken both my Great grandma and my grandmother, who I'm currently the caregiver for. How do I prevent it from effecting me? What can I do to live a long concious life?

I'm sorry if this is the wrong way to word this or wrong place to post"
"I (47F)  have been living with my mom (89 vascular dementia) for awhile now and normally she is really good with me. Until she is not, and today has been one of the WORST days so far. It's confusing, cause she slept well last night after a couple of nights where we were up every two hours. She woke up in a decent mood and was was fine, until we went to the bathroom. It was not a good scene and I know that how you react sets the tone for the interaction sometimes. So I sat down on the edge of the tub and very gently tried to get her pants and depends off of her. Not a pretty sight, but was done. Though, she refused to let me clean her, or remove her top which was also soiled. We sat there for a long time, me trying to clean her up, her refusing and trying to do it herself, which was making it worse. She was threatening to hit me and kick me if I didn't leave her alone. I gave up and let her go back to bed, when she started trying to put it on me, and accusing me of doing and putting it on her. She got up hafl naked and just went back to bed. I cleaned up the bathroom, while breaking down and just got ready for her caregiver to arrive. The caregiver is still working on convincing her to shower... 

My mom has always been stubborn, but she took such pride in her appearence that this is just so shocking to me. Her primary care physician doesn't want to overmedicate her, so won't prescribed any pills for anxiety. This is just such a fucking shitty way for someone to have to be. It's cruel that this is happening to her. It's just a bad day, I know. Tomorrow may be better or not..."
"This morning my grandfather passed away. I'm hoping that writing this it will help me get it out of my system. I had planned to go home this weekend since a hospice nurse told us that he has anywhere between 2 days and 2 weeks as of last night. I thought I would have one more chance to give him a hug and say goodbye, even if he didn't remember me. Now I'm just crying by myself in a shitty college dorm 

He has been struggling with vascular dementia for a while now but until he got covid in December he has been hiding how serious it is. He just sort of stopped talking as much. after covid it got much worse though, he stopped eating, began to forget us, his voice started going, and he rarely had the energy to even open his eyes let alone fight off the infections he got from his bedsores after spending all day in a wheelchair.

When I saw him in the care home it felt like he had already left. nothing can prepare you for the look of confusion they have when they don't remember you anymore. It takes them before they're gone. I visited him one last time the following weekend in the hospital as he was fighting off pnemonia, and he had been doing better. I was so hopeful that he would atleast make it till the end of the semester so I could visit him when I came home, I even had my dad facetime me every time he visited and I would always say bye with ""Hang in there popop, I love you"". I hope that inside he recognized me a little bit since even when he would give me the look of confusion he still called me ""buddy"". He made it till finals week, and im thankful that he held out as long as he did, even if I didnt get to say my final goodbyes.

My mom called me a few hours ago as I was studying to let me know, I knew what it was the second the phone rang.

Im going home to attend his wake and funeral in a couple of days.

This is one of the lowest lows ive ever felt."
"My uncle has Lewy Body Dementia and has started wandering off. Last week, he stormed off and it took a search party four hours to find him. I'm looking for a way to track him until we can get him into a secure facility.

Tried air tags but the range is too short. He keeps turning his phone off so that won't help."
"I’m so sorry if this isn’t the place to put this, but I need to hear something from a person who’s been a caregiver, who’s seen those with dementia at their worst. I feel so alone. 

I try so hard not to harbor any resentment for my grandparents. It’s not their fault. But I will never get closure and I will never get an apology because they don’t know what they did.

Both my grandparents moved in with my family when I was 13 because they both got diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. My grandmother already had depression and my grandfather already had some sort of paranoia or schizophrenia. It went undiagnosed, but he was always rambling incoherently about people trying to follow him or steal his things, taping doors shut, and making odd “inventions” decades before his Alzheimer’s diagnosis. 

When they moved in, I did not sleep. I was developing an eating disorder before this, but the stress of feeding them, washing them, making sure they didn’t run away, calling the cops when they did, and being their full time caregiver was not easy. I almost died, and went into the hospital for a month to recover my weight.

My grandfather would run away, shuffle around the house, jiggle locked doors. Repeatedly he would stick paper clips and forks into my door to get in. He got in once and molested me. I don’t remember it well. I don’t blame him for this, I’m sure he was just confused despite being in the early stages. 

We got them into assisted living communities. They were constantly kicked out because my grandfather was violent and would beat the staff. He dragged a CNA down the hall by the hair. Countless times I would be woken up to go over there because the police were called. Again. 

My grandmother would refuse to change and bathe. I was always called in. She would beat me. Punch me in the face, kick me, stomp on my feet, scratch my hands, bite me, spit in my face. And I’d have to deal with it. 

I had to clean their house. They were hoarders. For a year straight coming off my deathbed I was heaving pounds of garbage and soiled clothes into six industrial sized dumpsters. 

I’m now dissociated. I can’t think. I get confused in the same ways they do, I don’t recognize myself and I don’t recognize others. Everything smells like their house. When I try to imagine a future it’s just one where someone is breaking into my room or beating me or making me clean or running at me and screaming or standing still and just staring at me with a blank look. My future is in this industry. I’m a CNA because it’s all I know, and despite constantly being reminded of what I’ve seen and been through, I can’t leave. This is who I am now.

The thought of making coffee makes me ill. 

I was 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. And I will never get an apology. It’s not their fault, of course it’s not. But I’m just so angry and broken. I feel I will never heal."
"Hi all, this is just a rant of some feelings I finally figured out how to word and I'm wondering if anyone else feels this way about caretaking.

I'm used to working towards goals in my life and I feel like with dementia caretaking there doesn't seem to be one. Obviously the goal is to care for them to the best of our abilities, make them as comfortable and peaceful as possible, and ensure they don't harm themselves or others through accidents. But it feels like these goals are constantly contradicting themselves or that what ""caring"" for them entails changes drastically. Some examples that are bothering me right now are that when my grandpa's GI problem acts up we have to switch him to a bland diet but his quality of food/nutrients drastically decreases, and it feels like by addressing one problem we're neglecting other concerns. He has chronic back problems and when we do things to try and help he refuses, but will continue doing puzzles that strain his back. We all know he shouldn't do puzzles to the extent he does, but it's one of his only hobbies left. He loves doing yardwork and housework and it's when he's happiest, but he's never content to do the small things that are safe for him and instead he wants to mow or get up on ladders, so we're constantly having to tell him no and anger him. 

It feels like the things that would make him happy, he either can't do or takes too far, and I feel like taking away these hobbies and small moments of happiness isn't caring for him but just making him a shell of a person by secluding him away in the house. He can do smaller tasks and we try to get him to, but he won't do them because he's so pissed about the big things he can't do. It also feels like with all of his health problems we're constantly either neglecting one or aren't able to properly care for it due to other medical problems. Or his stubbornness is making medical problems worse. 

It feels like some days doing the caring for him makes him uncomfortable, anxious, or pissed off. It also feels like caring for him is taking away things that make him happy. And it all just feels like a big mess with no clear end goal."
"My mother (63) was diagnosed in December 2021. The process started to get my mother transitioned to the Medicaid long-term care plan and eventually have a home aide for 3.5 hours a day, she will also be able to go to daycare. The process is so draining and takes time, she would also have to change her PCP and dementia specializing neurologist. I (F/24) just found a letter stating she owes Social security $2k  because she made too much money the year she decided to retire. I talked to her about this at night and she said she never decided to retire and has no idea what I'm talking about. My mother and I bicker because I hate being asked the same question again and as a result, I answer with an attitude, she then tells me to not speak to her that way and I stand my ground, she eventually says she wants to move out and I repeat that I'm the breadwinner and the only way she'll be able to move is if I fund it, she then remains quiet. 

I am just so tired. I am an only child with no father in my life and no family around. I am truly alone. I feel like my 20's are being stolen from me. I have dreams about beating my mother up and being the reason why she won't exist anymore. I wake up questioning if the dreams are real and if I'll ever be capable of doing such things. I hate those thoughts so much. My mother and I were never close emotionally and never bonded but it still pains me to think that I could probably receive a call one day hearing about her passing and be overjoyed. I think about abandoning her so often it hurts but I can't yet because I have to financially support her."
Mom has stage 5 dementia and cataracts. Doctor says he doesn't think it's best to do the surgery because he thinks she will mess with her incision or not do well with a patch. He changed her glasses script and told me to bring her  back in a year. It was an ordeal to get her there. Has anyone's family member with dementia done well with cataract surgery? I don't want her vision to get worse; as it will affect the dementia and add to the confusion I'm sure.
"My mom is stage 5/6 alz. I’m her only daughter. She’s a covert narcissist and I have ADHD. She’s always relied on my struggles with ADHD to fit her narrative about how hard her life has been just being my mother. I’ve always rejected the manipulation with avoidance and dissociation. This has translated to my mom telling everyone that I dont like her and dont want to be around her and she cant rely on me to be there for her when she needs care, which she knows is bullshit because I have told her repeatedly that just because she cant live in my house doesnt mean I wont take care of her. She does this as a ploy for sympathy and a way to keep me isolated so that I can focus only on her. Im almost 100% that narcissism is directly linked to dementia so Im sure some of you can relate. Anyways - now her pity party stories and manipulation tactics have created real consequences and I’m at my wits end waiting for APS and my lawyer to move with a purpose. 

My moms husband of 20 years passed in early feb and left her with his sister. He had late stage COPD but he ultimately died of COVID after his sister gave it to him when they drove down to get my parents without telling anyone the day after Christmas. 

Before he died, I had never met or seen this woman. She decided they should move to her house last September and I found out bc I just happened upon a facebook post. A month later they decided to stay and again, I was notified with the rest of the world via facebook. I tried to talk to my stepdad multiple times about including me and keeping me informed in their decisions and what is going on and he apologized and said he would. 

Then two days after Xmas their hospice nurse called saying that she was at their house for their appt and their car was gone and their door was padlocked. No one could get ahold of them until we said we were going to call the police and then 2 minutes later the phone rings and they tell us they moved. 

I couldnt make a trip until early feb and by that time, my stepdad had passed and they had given all the legal everything to his sister. 

Since they moved to her house, she has been a nightmare. She wont give me phone numbers and addresses. She refuses to discuss any of my moms finances with me. They decided to put her in a home, found a place, paid for it, and had a move in date before they ever told me anything at all. She’s been making my mom travel every week and stay with different people and when it was my turn, she sent her away with me with no atm card and no ID. My mom has been having regular anxiety attacks when she forced to sleep in all these weird places and this lady just blows it off. 

I told her that I wanted to move my mom to a place closer to me and asked to discuss all my moms money and she said she wasnt comfortable discussing my moms finances with anyone. 

She wont show me any docs. She wont tell me whats going on with moms money. She has control of my mom and stepdads house. And now she wont give me my moms new phone number in her new facility - its a private number and the facility says they cant give it out. 

So I called Adult Protective Services and now they’re going to investigate. Im waiting for a lawyer to call me back. But these coupe of days where I’m not able to check on my mom and this woman could be doing or saying anything to smear me, I feel sick to my stomach. 

How can people do this to their kids?!?! These two dont even like each other and it feels like Im just the scapegoat for both of them. I love my mom and I never could have imagined that she would just write her life over to a virtual stranger that she doesnt trust or like just to spite me because I said she cant live in my house. I will NEVER do that to my kids. 

I feel horrible, conflicted, angry, disappointed, disrespected, sad. Im just deflated and confused because all I ever wanted was for my mom to love me- and she just cant."
"I have just been told this and it’s now so apparent. I hated my life and wanted to die so bad, but I couldn’t find a way I felt comfortable ending myself with. I would’ve done something like an opioid but I never had a place to get it, so I chose diphenhydramine. I poisoned myself everyday with usually around a gram of diphenhydramine for if my memory is correct about 7 months. I thought it would kill me quickly, like with cardiac arrest or something. It became apparent to everyone around me that I wasn’t going to die from a heart attack or seizure, but that I was declining mentally instead, and fast. I was so isolated during my use due to laying in bed all day I never noticed too much impairment aside from forgetting things a lot. Since almost everyday I have some sort of mental breakdown about how I’m not doing enough with my life, I tried to get out again and put in an effort to function like everyone else. That’s when it became apparent. My voice was so frail and timid, and I could never find the words I was looking for or would just completely forget what we were talking about, and completely freeze up like a classic Alzheimer’s patient. The most scary thing is I will be walking sometimes and before I know it I’m in a completely different place with no memory of getting there, it’s an absolutely terrifying realization. My mom has seen these effects and it’s become apparent to me that I have managed to kill myself, but this will be a slow and agonizing death for me and everyone who cares about me. I am so terrified. I don’t want to die anymore, and especially put my poor family through this. The doctors say I have given myself drug induced dementia from DPH addiction, and I am so scared that I may have just lost my life. I will be on acetylcholinasterase inhibitors very shortly."
"I thought perhaps this form might help some folk with communicating their LO condition to doctors / medical / care industry staff  -- from Fb page < Dementia : The Journey Ahead >

While we were searching for an accurate diagnosis in the late 90's, our family practitioner attempted to treat my husband’s agitation and behavioral issues with a drug called Ativan. Ativan, which goes by the generic name of Lorazepam, is an anti-anxiety drug used for the management of anxiety disorders associated with depression. Our physician was not aware that many dementia patients have an unfavorable response when given this medication. For this reason, avoid medications such as Valium, Xanax, and Ativan if you suspect Frontotemporal Degeneration (FTD), as they may create more problems than they solve.My warning does not apply to all dementia patients.Dishonesty (fiblets) and distraction has its rewards when caring for a dementia patient; namely, reducing patient agitation and caregiver stress.If you are experiencing agitation problems with your loved one please fill out the agitation inventory sheet below and give it to your loved ones physician. Please deal with this problem before it gets out of hand and someone gets hurt...it can and does happen... more than you realise.

"I ask because, months after my dad's death and almost a year after I put him in memory care, I'm still having a lot of issues.

For example: I have trouble sleeping at night. I snap awake at every sound, everything suddenly on high alert. I never used to, but then dad stopped sleeping at night and started getting up to shenanigans. (He tended to destroy things. Or try to bolt into the night because the FBI were after him. Or whatever.)

My temper is also frayed. I'm burned out. I have no patience. I also can't seem to stop reliving what went on. I walk into the house and I almost see him again. I have trouble going into the room that was his bedroom, because it brings back all kinds of unpleasant memories.

I do try to remember better times, but the total insanity of dementia overshadows it all. I am in therapy, but it doesn't seem to be helping a lot, because the thoughts/flashbacks/insomnia are all still there.

But I always thought of PTSD being a thing you suffer after being in war, or suffering attempted murder. Like, serious trauma. Not from caregiving, which is traumatic in little ways but nothing like listening to bombs fall on your neighbor.

So, has anyone had any experience of this? If so, what did you do? I've been drinking more than is good for me just to drown all of these thoughts out, and I really need a better solution."
"A bit of background, I went low contact with my mom in 2017 because she was becoming more and more toxic to be around. She was always complaining about my dad and was rude about both my and my brother's relationships. I saw her on holidays and birthdays and that was about it. At the time I had no idea it was the beginning of dementia. It never even crossed my mind.  


In 2019 I figured out that it was likely early onset dementia and told my dad to get her seen. I told my mom to go get seen. And they didn't do anything. In early December her mental state dropped off a cliff. She left the house and called my brother because there was a strange man in her house. It was my Dad.    


She's isolating herself more and more and when we go over, it's like there's a wall in front of her. Her personality is just flat. My husband and I had our first baby, her first grandchild, a few months ago. She acts like she barely cares. And it makes me so angry because if she had gotten seen 3 years ago, they could have possibly slowed the decline.   


My mom was so excited for grandkids. And honestly, the woman who has met my baby isn't her. She never recognizes my Dad anymore, even though she recognizes everyone else including the baby. The past few days she hasn't been eating and hasn't even turned on the TV which is extremely strange for her.   


I feel like we're in the late stage, and we don't even have a formal diagnosis yet. I don't know what the specialist is going to do, but I feel like now, it's too little, too late.  


*edited for clarity and readability*"
"I’m not quite sure if this is the right sub, but I figured I’d give it a try. 
My mother is 62 years old and has never been known for her great memory, but it’s been steadily getting worse and we’re worried about early onset dementia or something similar. I recently moved for work and don’t speak to my mom as frequently as I did, so the change has been extra apparent for me. I know stuff like this can be genetic, but both of her parents died over twenty years ago so we don’t have any elder relatives to compare to. 
My brother, my sister, my father, my cousin, and I have all had conversations with each other about how to help my mom but it’s been to no avail. Every time someone has tried to bring up the topic with my mother, she gets really defensive and sometimes mean. She seems aware that it’s getting worse, making comments like “What is wrong with me?” when she can’t remember something but whenever we suggest talking to a doctor she shuts down.
I guess my question is, are there any tips for trying to talk to my mom about this and trying to get her some help? Or tips for the family so we can better understand what may be happening? I know you can’t help people if they don’t want it, but it’s so hard watching this happen especially when everyone is so hyper aware of it but we still can’t do anything."

"This sounds strange but what can I do to keep my mother entertained? She used to play bridge and go to classes and read books. She had interest in plays and events. Now she has LBD with Parkinsonism and can’t get out much. She has forgotten how to use a computer so can’t do Zoom classes. She doesn’t seem to have the patience or attention to sit through a movie, even a sitcom. What can I do to keep her entertained? She calls me 15 times a day to complain and argue. Her latest is that I told the doctor to diagnose her with dementia. I am The Antagonist in the story of her life. If there was something else that could hold her interest, maybe even bring her some pleasure, maybe she wouldn’t be so angry at me all the time?"
"my mom's health has been slowly declining for the past few years. she has end stage emphysema, microvascular disease, and dementia. but, over the last few months, it's declined *rapidly.* 

today was interesting. she's been falling increasingly more the past few months, she's gotten two black eyes and a swollen knee. she fell off the toilet and didn't say anything for hours until she finally unlocked the door to let me in and I saw. my husband and I got her off the floor and back to her room.

after about 10, 15 minutes, I went back to check on her and it seemed like she had just slid off the edge of the bed and was sat on the floor. I got my husband and as we helped her back up, she kept giggling, calling me ""Sarah."" I said no, my name is OP, I'm your daughter. she would swat my head playfully and say ""shh! stop it, my mom will hear you and find out we're loaded!"" 

this was the first incident where she didn't know who I was, and confused me with a high school friend she used to smoke weed with in the late 60s/early 70s. so, that was a lot of emotions..

anyway. we're buying some bars to install on the wall in the bathroom, one of those toilet chairs, and some handles I can install on her bed. I'm taking her to her doctor in the AM for a check up and to make sure she hasn't broken anything.

she seems to have regained some cognizance back and knows who I am again. it comes and goes in waves.

anyway, hi. I know this is a lot for a first post but damn, I just needed to let it out. my mom is my best friend and watching her fade in front of me is a bitch to deal with."
"Hello.

To begin - whoever you are, if you are within this virtual community, I truly send you my love. This is a vile disease to navigate for all involved.

I come seeking advice. Here is some information that, while I apologize for ranting, hope helps give you the best idea possible of my family's situation...

My mother (72 years old) was diagnosed several months ago with a yet-to-be-finalized type of dementia, still in its earlier stages. My father died without warning this past June due to PE after major surgery so it's been a hectic and difficult year. I am the youngest (30) of my siblings and while they have been doing a lot, I have taken lead with her mental health and overall well-being.

Her main symptoms are mild memory issues, trouble focusing at times and she has difficulty with speech, especially when she is anxious or feels the need to ""perform"". She does not slur words nor does she ever simply stop talking - her issue is getting the words out (she expresses that it feels like the words are trapped in her mind). Once prompted or guided, she can complete her thought. This gives her a lot of anxiety.

She has no issues with balance or movement nor has she had any hallucinations or severe ""episodes"", yet. She is still pretty active (does laundry, cooks her own meals, for the most part, does work in the garden, washes her own dishes, etc) and stays relatively social. She has been taking Donepezil and began speech/cognition therapy about 12 weeks ago.

I am not sure if the speech therapy is doing a great deal but she enjoys going/likes her speech therapist. If nothing else, it's additional socialization and gives her a bit of independence that she likes (she does not drive anymore but rather a county-sponsored service picks her up and brings her home, door to door). Said van service can also take her to other appointments if need be or even grocery shopping. We have a RAZ cell phone for her that both tracks her and gives her security of calling pre-programmed numbers (me, my siblings, close friends, etc) if there was an issue while outside her house.

My brother lives with her (he has his own health issues so they benefit from having each other) but she can handle herself without issue if left on her own for days at a time if need be (we would NEVER allow that, but I state this to stress she is not a danger to herself or others at this stage).

update: We have her will and power of attorney completed. She and my father put the house in my brother's name before my dad died and my name is on her bank accounts. 

**With that info done...here is my question:**

While we have things under control now and could handle this for years and years I know it will, someday, get worse. I am simply seeing if anyone out there has any advice for me and my family at this stage.

Is there anything you wish you had done to better prepare your loved one / the family?

Are there any more progressive or unique types of therapy that you have seen help?

ANYTHING you wish to offer in terms of practical advice?"

""Jelly Drops are award-winning candy designed to boost hydration. They’re 95% water, sugar-free and vegan with added electrolytes.

Inventor Lewis Hornby was inspired to create water candy after his grandma Pat, who had dementia, was struggling to hydrate.

With a fantastic solid, but smooth, texture - these candies do not have a liquid centre - encouraging independent hydration for all, through a delicious snack.""

I started following them years ago, and they're finally available for sale. Sadly, all three of my remaining grandparents have passed since then, but I wanted to share. I know how hard it is for those older ones to stay hydrated, and how much my grandmas in particular loved candy :)"
"So, my mom has always really enjoyed Hawaiian pizza, BLT's, Mexican food - and now she doesn't seem to like any of them. She says ""It doesn't taste right"" 

She, of course, still wants sweets, which, according to the Alzheimer's website is normal, but I have to be really careful because she's pre-diabetic.  

Is this the precursor to her refusing to eat entirely?  She is in stage 6d according to the research I've done."
"Don't know if anyone has experienced this, my grandmother is in mid stage, moving into late. 

We can have an amazing dinner with her getting to see her great-grandkids, she will have a wonderful time, but the next day she forgets it happened.  Sometimes, if you remind her, she will partially remember it, other times she has no recollection.  

But the moment she is told someone in the family is sick, hurt, needs help, it's like her mind reverts back a decade.  

Six months ago when my mom had surgery, she called everyday to check on her.  She didn't need to be reminded or prompted.  

A few months ago when her great-grandchild had Covid, same thing.  

Yesterday, I was pretty sick.  I called up her and my grandfather to let the know that I was, and wouldn't be stopping by.  

Twenty minutes later, they were dropping off some fresh cut fruit for me and a bottle of juice.  

Talked to my grandfather on the phone and he said it wasn't his idea.  When I called, she was having a bad day.  Laying on the couch, not dressed at noon time, confused about where she was.  

The moment she found out I was sick though, my grandfather said she got up, she put on her clothes, went into the kitchen, got out some fruit from the fridge, cut it up, bagged it up, and told him her to my house to leave it on my porch.

Then this morning, I get an phone call from her, she's asking how I'm feeling, asking if I ate the fruit, telling me to make sure I drink a lot of liquids, and she just comes off as sounding very cognitive during the entire conversation.  


Like I said in the title, it feels both comforting and depressing at the same time.  

It's just so insane how the mind works.  Her mind has been breaking down for years now.  On my daily visits I'm asked the same set of questions every time.  When sundowning she gets angry, agitated, doesn't even recognize my grandfather most nights.  

But **she** is still there.  It's as if the moment she hears any one of us is sick, hurt, in trouble, her brain just uses everything it has left to kick into overdrive for a time period in order for her to focus on doing what she did for her entire life, take care of family."
"My dad—who has dementia—is currently in the hospital for various reasons too complicated to get into here. The point is, his health is now stable, and the wheels are in motion for him to be discharged to a long-term-care facility today or tomorrow. 

That’s wonderful news for my mom who has been his sole caretaker for the past decade or so. In addition to having dementia, he also has a below-the-knee amputation, diabetes, COPD, and numerous other chronic health problems. She’s been the one who risks injuring herself multiple times a day when he falls while trying to transfer from his recliner to his wheelchair. She’s been the one to bear the brunt of his mood swings. She’s been the one to clean up his feces. She’s been the one he wakes up every two or three hours at night, for one reason or another. I mean, you guys all know the drill. 

The thing is, Mom had a choice between placing him in a short-term facility with a high-degree of physical rehabilitation (for about a week before being transferred to long-term care or home) or a long-term facility with a low-degree of physical rehab (indefinitely). She close the long-term option, *and the hospital’s care manager and a rep from the short-term place are guilt-tripping her for it.* 

They honestly don’t seem to grasp that he’s never getting better, or that taking care of him 24/7 is killing my mom, or that any effort he puts into rehab in a facility will never be duplicated of his own volition if he’s at home. 

Similarly, many of the doctors, nurses, and therapists who have cycled through his room have radiated this naive positivity that makes me, frankly, furious. The man hasn’t used his prosthetic leg since he got it almost a decade ago, he keeps mistaking the trash can for a window, and he’s told my mom he wants to stab her. Stop acting like Mom should cheerfully take him home and nurse him back to health. When can she live *her* life again?"
"My step-father has been a struggle for me. Before dementia he was an alcoholic, bi polar, abusive monster.   Present day, it’s gotten even worse.  He still drinks a case of beer or whatever he can get his hands on. He is diabetic as well and thinks no doctor can tell him what to do.  He buys alcohol with money given to him by his other children and sometimes my mom because she just gives in to avoid conflict. He has destroyed parts of this house usually when he is manic. which could last for weeks. Today he is currently hoarding all the potted plants into his bed room and spray painting them.

I’m autistic so I live at home with my mother and step father. My mother is an attorney, so most of the day she is at work. I work from home and the last 3 years have been hell. I’ve all of a sudden am the care giver to this man that I hate.  He has 3 children from other marriages and none of them give a shit about his condition.  I feel like everyone is gaslighting me when I try and explain what is going on at home. NO ONE listens to me. My family knows that I hate this man but I’d never not care for a person who is in need. I just wish something could be done because I can’t handle this much longer."
"Not looking for advice, just want to vent about my mom's latest meltdown. I live in the lower part of a split-level house with my elderly parents above. 

I woke up at midnight last night because my mother opened my bedroom door and turned on the overhead light, crying to me and asking ""who's hurting you?"". I was so confused and asked her why she was awake and fully dressed. She cried and told me that she heard me screaming in pain, and she kept begging me to let her take me to safety. I kept telling her I was asleep, I'm ok, no one's screaming, PLEASE go back to bed. She finally retreated upstairs, and I asked my bf, who had been in the next room watching TV, what happened.

He said she had been yelling down the stairs to him for 20 minutes about me screaming, with both him and my father trying to convince her nothing was wrong. As we were talking, I could hear her upstairs wailing to my father about ""how could he let someone do that to his own daughter"". He stormed downstairs to placate her, and she followed still weeping and yelling that my father wasn't helping me, and he's a monster. We all tried to convince her that I was ok, I had been sleeping! I even told her that I was probably having a nightmare (not true) and that's what she heard, just to get her to calm down. I had to plead with her for over 15 minutes to let everyone get back to sleep before she finally agreed to go back upstairs. 

I talked to my dad about it this morning, and apparently before waking me up last night, she got dressed and drove to the neighbor's house to get them to help me. I don't know what was said, but the neighbor knows about mom's issues - he once came over and informed my bf when he saw her hitchhiking down the road while my father and I were out for a few hours. And even more shocking than disturbing the neighbors, she PUNCHED my dad in the mouth when he refused to barge downstairs. This is the first time she actually hit one of us; usually it's just screaming vitriol, throwing things, and beating on doors. And usually I'm the target, so this is a completely new behavior. 

Today, she keeps going back and forth between apologizing and insisting that she heard my voice screaming, meanwhile being pleasant as pie. 

I'm just so tired today and in general."
"How much longer does mum have / how much worse will it get?   

I’m just looking for advice, I guess, or more accurately a rough road map of how the next few weeks or months might go. 

My mum is 58. She was diagnosed with Early Onset Alzheimer’s 3 years ago but had been suffering symptoms for at least 6 years before that. 

For months now she’s been unable to speak properly. She’ll say some words but they’re mostly unintelligible. Every now and again she’ll smile and wave as if she recognises me. She needs help with pretty much everything—getting up and washed and dressed and eating and moving around and using the toilet. My StepDad does everything for her. He’s an absolute saint. They do have carers go in every day to help him. 

These last few weeks she’s taken a worse turn. She’s currently in hospital on a drip (because she hasn’t eaten properly for weeks) and under sedation—because she’s been becoming violent, lashing out at my StepDad and the carers and even the dog. I can’t overstate how unlike her this is. Especially the dog—she’s the most gentle and animal friendly person you can imagine. Or she was. 

A CT Scan has shown aggressive dying off of brain cells. I’m getting this all second hand from my StepDad. As her designated carer he’s allowed to be up there with her but no one else is. The only reason I mention this is because I have a feeling this is it, this is the end times, but that he doesn’t really want to say so. I don’t know how specific the doctors would have been about his? But rapid dying off of brain cells sounds like the end doesn’t it? 

When she’s stable they’re going to send her home. They’re helping my StepDad get a hospital bed set up for her downstairs. He’s determined to have her home, which is fine, I know she’ll be happier there and he cares for her well, I just can’t even imagine the toll this is having on him. 

The reason I’m writing this is mainly to vent it, I guess, but also to ask if anyone can give us a rough idea of what to expect? How long we can expect to have her home before she’s gone, how much worse this is likely to get? Anyone that answers please do be honest, don’t sugarcoat it—I’ve always had a good relationship with my mum, I love her very much but I’m sure she’s ready for this suffering to be over. 

Thank you."
"Really hoping someone can help! My dad is 70 years old and has always been exceptionally intelligent, though also a textbook narcissist and not always very nice. Last month he started acting very out of character, rambling for hours and being generally manic. He ended up going to the ER as he realized something was wrong; discovered he was having frontal lobe seizures and was prescribed an anti-convulsant. HOWEVER, due to the personality changes and diminished cognitive ability he displayed, was also prescribed an anti-psychotic, which he has adamantly refused to take. After a couple other ER visits/dr. appointments, it was clear this was more than just seizures. Some of his visit summaries/med charts specifically cite dementia, one in particular ""aggression due to dementia."" 

His condition continues to deteriorate, but he has decided he had a singular neurological incident and nothing else is wrong with him. Everyone is against him, the doctors committed malpractice and are colluding with his wife (my mom), he's going to sue, etc etc. He has effectively kicked my mom out of their house and told her they are getting a divorce. Unfortunately, this isn't a new thing and probably should have happened a long time ago. The main problem is that he refuses to go back to any doctor to get an actual assessment/diagnosis, won't take his prescribed medication, and is OVERTLY HOSTILE with anyone who brings up his medical care. 

He and my mom have done well over the years financially, but he has always taken care of all of their assets and business. They own several rental properties, have multiple bank accounts, stocks, IRAs, etc but she does not have access to any of them. I have found her a short term rental so she's not on the street, but we are completely unable to have a rational discussion with him about how she's going to support herself. I have no idea if he is paying his mortgages or other bills, filed his taxes, etc. It's not likely things are getting taken care of as every day he seems to slip further away. 

I know she needs a divorce attorney, but I'm just wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation-- are there divorce lawyers that deal with this type of situation? How should we approach him, if at all? He is currently alone in a big house by himself, just deconstructing mentally but won't allow anyone to help since he ""doesn't have a problem."" I have no idea what I can do to help someone with these symptoms, let alone who has always been a difficult person to deal with anyway. Just kind of desperately reaching out into the Internet ether and hoping someone can give some guidance."
"My mother has had nonstop delusions today. It’s been so frustrating! She talks to imaginary children and then wants to take them home and yells at everyone until we take her for a drive to see if that would help her stress. She’s giving me driving directions even though she doesn’t know where she is. She wants me to stop people taking walks and ask them where the children live! Then she’s raging at my dad cause she thinks he wants to kill her and that he has a tiny woman living under the bed in a shoebox. She heard my dog bark at someone and now she thinks the dog died because of it. She’s now morning the dog who is happily running back and forth through the house chasing a ball. Sorry. I just had to vent! Ugh! I’m glad I’m going to work tomorrow so I can take a break from this stress.

Edit:

Thank you all for your support and for the great suggestions. I’m going to have a talk with my dad when I get home and hopefully come up with an action plan. My poor dad is so tired 🙁"
"My father has had parkinsons for 15years. Currently 64. His first 10-12 years the progession has been 'okay' he loved alone and was fairly independent. Unfortunately he deteriorated during covid and was admitted to hospital in February this year due to distressing hallucinations.

He is currently still in an assessment ward 8 weeks later after initially expecting to be in for  2 to 3 days respite. 

While there hasn't been a formal conversation hid presentation suggests it's progressed to parkinsons dementia. He has some really good days and some really bad.  Some days he is lucid and understands others he thinks he works on the ward (used to be a physiatric ward mgr). 

He has been told he will not be able to go home to his current accommodation. He is being assessed for very sheltered (independent living) but have suggested he may require care home. 

He has always said he doesn't want to go in  to care. I love him so much and visit every day and do all I can but work full time and live in upstairs flat with no easy access to shower etc so he can't come live with me. 

How do I live with him going in to care? I hate the thought,  but I want him safe and in as little distress as possible.

He is widowed and his family stay 2 hours away and don't visit. How can I make him ""happy""."
"This is my second post here. And I appreciate all the support I got on my last post for not making me feel like I’m insane. 

4/22 my father fell and hit his head (on blood thinners so we immediately called ems) he has a laceration from it. He blamed my child who wasn’t even in the room w him. 

4/23 at 5 pm my time we caught him falling and he only hit his butt, because we caught him mid fall. At that time I took his cane away and enforced a walker only rule. 

At 930pm he fell and hit his head again. He tried to blame it on my 17 mo old who had been asleep for 2 hours. 

This time he is admitted, even though the attending wanted to discharge him I protested and won. 

This is his 6th hospital visit in 8 weeks. I’m asking the hospital to put us in touch w a social worker and care management worker so we can place him in a home or facility till we can get him somewhere permanent. (We have a meeting w a care placement coordinator Monday so we’re already on it.) 

I’m not gonna lie. Money is super tight. But he has BCN advantage HMO and from what I’ve read they should cover it especially since he has zero funds. 

At this point from my self it’s basically 24/7 care and watching. My mother in law and wife cover when I’m sleeping (I haven’t been able to work for over 2 years pre pandemic cause of it) 

What do I need to say or tell the dr’s to look for to have him put in a rehab facility or SNF? Im I’m Michigan btw. So idk what that affects care wise. 

But we’re just done. We can’t do it anymore. We spent 400k on a new build house built to his needs and he has been here less than a month and has deteriorated immensely and had all these falls. (It’s a one story ranch style house with tons of items out in place, grab bars, rails, etc.)

Im at my wits end."
"My mother is turning 60 this year and I’ve never been concerned about the state of her mental health other than her severe depression and crippling anxiety. A couple months ago my brother told me to keep an eye on her, said she was “airheady lately”. I hadn’t noticed anything of the sort not till now. My mom has never had much trouble finding things other than her car keys. But a few weeks ago, she came in my room asking where her purse was I asked did you check under your bed or your car she said she had looked everywhere. She started canceling cards and I was just as convinced as she was that it was missing. Until I went out to her car to get my charger I saw her purse sitting on the floor of the passenger side. I’m thinking in what world could she have missed that. So this is already unusual behavior. But last night and tonight is what really has me worried. Last night I was doing my hair in her bathroom and she asked if I had work the next day I told her yes I go in at 2. Within the hour she asks me again, “do you work tomorrow” I laughed a little and said yeah you just asked me that. She looked at me absolutely bewildered, she said no i didn’t I don’t recall kept saying she didn’t remember and I’m assuming joking accused me of gaslighting her. And tonight I asked for her vape she said she left it in her friends car, I asked if she was sure before I drive over and get it she said there’s no where else it could be she’s looked everywhere. So I go and I look, it’s not in her car. I come home and I ask her again is it in your purse she told me I could look, it was in her purse. Plain as day. Maybe I’m being dramatic but does this behavior show signs I should be concerned about?"
"This is the end? 
Like this? 

In disbelief,
but know it’s true.

I’m broken. 
I’m numb. 

And just wish, 
I did more for you.

This is the end? 
Here? In this place?

With chaos and noise,
with sad face after sad face. 

With caring staff,
but too few. 

This is the end? 
Like this?
For you? 

It can’t be, 
but it is. 

Take your time, Mom. 
I don’t need to know when. 

I’ll be here. 
Because this is the end."
"That's the sound I'm currently hearing after an exhausting weekend.  She finished it yelling at me for washing/grooming her dogs while she watched Forest Gump. I did it too late but I didn't want to be stuck here doing the laundry tomorrow on no sleep. It's harder to walk early in the day. After she finished the movie , she told me how terrible it was . That's been the theme and it's getting to me. I went to find something else when she told me she was going to sleep . That was 2 hours ago while I waited to wash the fur off me . She's eating candy  in the dark. 

Anyway, I finally got some weekend help. My uncle agreed to have someone come in on Saturday so I can go home and sleep a few hours . Between my own serious pain issues , the temperature, the dogs and her ups and downs it's impossible to sleep here . I don't mind but I couldn't do 3 days of no sleep anymore without a break . My brother came to visit. I showered and even put on a little makeup. I sat a few feet from her making jewelry with my niece while she proceeded to bash my weight , my lack of life , my appearance , just everything . I am disabled. I have adhesive Arachnoiditis and it's advancing  . After pain management poked and prodded me for 6 years , they decided to reduce my limited pain meds . I know I'm not the average 33 year old. It's been a horrible few months. I spend 3 days here and the rest of the time going to appointments, trying to recover . I know I have no life , but this side of things is hard . I have no business trying to groom her dogs either but I don't control the money. I'm tired of trying to do things with one hand behind my back.  I hope tomorrow is a good day. I just  needed to vent and in that way , I can understand her unhappiness. I just wish I mattered as much as a dog every once in a while."
"I am in the early days of dealing with the possibility of dementia with my mom.  I feel at times there is something off with her. Something not quite right.  It's different every single day.  Some days are good and then other days are not so good. 
The main behaviours have been mood changes and easily angered, some silliness, some ocd. 

Mood changes - some days she talkative and other days there's nothing but silence from her
Easily angered - there were incidents where she blows up at me easily and over nonsensical things. Like I was preparing a parcel for sending away before and she went into a range at me. Another time I was looking for a pan from the cupboard and that was another episode from her. Another time I reached for a clean kitchen towel. Small incidents that would anger her. Another time she blew up at me over the laptop when I was setting it up. She has no knowledge of computers or internet and I was setting up my laptop to sit down together with her and she blew up at me shouting - 'I will do it's. 
Silliness - getting me to do online shopping for her and getting me to buy her more shoes even though she has loads of shoes.  Last year during lockdown she wanted more 'going out' or 'fancy' shoes for wearing to am event.  She has a wardrobe of shoes for such events but she wanted more even though we had no events to go to.  We were in lockdown.  I think in her mind she thought the whole country was going to break out and go dancing at each crossroads the minute the pandemic ended and she was buying to party. I don't know. 
She was never OCD when I was small. She is still not very particular OCD but she is spending a lot of her time cleaning and needlessly cleaning more and more. There's a lot of time and effort spent of cleaning.  It's almost as if she wants to maintain control. 

I know a lot of the time forgetfulness and confusion presents with dementia so this is very difficult for me..  I think there is some forgetfulness but it's very, very mild and hardly noticable. This wasn't the first thing for me to raise alarm bells. 

It was earlier this year after yet another silent episode from her that I started piecing together bits and pieces over the past 2 to 4 years with when I started thinking on the lines of dementia. I think she is going senile. Every day is different from her. 

I am in a place where I don't know how to move forward with my suspicions. I am apprehensive about emailing or writing to our gp practice. We attend the same practice.  I would feel more comfortable speaking face to face with my GP to see if they could put a note on my mom's medical file to explore dementia for when my mom goes next. 

Today I found something new with my mom.  
She had a rack of clothes drying and there amongst some of her undies was a bra that looked familiar to me. I had a closer look and it was one of my bras for sure. We would be different sizes and we would shop in different places. I looked at the tage and it was my size.  I am plus size so My band size would be larger than hers.   My mom never does laundry for me so there's no way she picked up this up and put it into a load of her own laundry. There's no way this bra was lying around the home for her to pick up.  Another thing is that I have my clothes and undies divided up into good wear and every day wear.  This bra would be a bra for good wear.  It was a good bra.  I remember last year when going to an event, I thought I had more bras but I couldn't find them.  I even checked my laundry basket and definitely a lot of my good bras were gone. I didn't think anything more of this. I thought maybe it's in a bag somewhere. And here today I found my mom with one of my bras. I am completely shocked that she has a bra from me.  So she robbed my bra and possibly even more as if it was hers. There's no excuse in the world to rob my bra though.   

I know if I asked her she would give me an excuse of buying it in a second hand shop. I found her with other things before that looked familiar and she told me that she bought it before. 

It's just a new incident to add to the list of doubts that I have."
all in the subject line. any help appreciated.
"My dad has dementia. I am not able to take on the role of guardianship. I can no longer get power of attorney because he has already been diagnosed. Currently he is staying with my Aunt but she wants him to move out. Before he was alone and declining quickly. 

Nobody else want to take on the guardianship role either. Our only option to get him help is make him a ward of the state. Any help on how to do this would be appreciated."
"I haven't seen my grandma in years, and she's staying with family on the other side of the world. She's impossibly healthly for her age, she has a full head of thick hair better than today's teens (although grey) and all her teeth are shiny and look like they came out of a toothbrush commercial. She has zero, and I mean zero, health issues. She lives on a farm with the rest of my family, and never has unhealthy food. 

A couple years back when my dad visited her, she forgot small things, like she'd remind him to eat lunch repeatedly even though he just ate lunch in front of her half an hour ago. Nowadays, my dad talks to her frequently, but apparently she doesn't recognize him 20 minutes after he's just introduced himself again and he has been talking about life. When asked to identify people, she pointed at her grandson (my brother) as being the son of ""this lady beside you"" (my mom) rather than referring to him as her grandson, and as my mom as her daughter in law. I thought this was absolutely crazy; my grandmother was a pharmacist and has the most knowledge I know, so forgetting seems very out of the picture. 

I think that our extended huge family living with her helps her with tasks, but I'm not sure if she can manage by herself. My father has said that she has Alzheimer's, but he doesn't say it definitely, he just says it like ""she's old and she's forgetting things, like dementia, like alzheimer's"" saying the whole spectrum and he doesn't seem sure, but he might be about alzheimer's, I'm not sure if he's saying she has normal memory loss for her age or if she has the brain degeneration illness of Alzheimer's. 

I was really scared and sad because I heard Alzheimer's has no cure, and my grandma used to give people medication as a pharmacist, so to think that she cannot remember a thing while her brain degenerates is scary while she depends on others for medication. I don't know if she takes medication either. Does this sound like someone with normal age-related memory loss, or actual dementia/Alzheimer's? What have you noticed early on in your relatives with Alzheimer's?

I know I'll figure out whether she has normal memory loss or Alzheimer's by asking my family; but I don't want them to worry and they'd probably gloss over the severity for me so I wouldn't worry. I actually asked my mom and she said my dad was overreacting and it was just normal memory loss that she has seen plenty of times in older people. Now I'm pretty confused whether I should be worrying about my dad now or not, and about myself. I heard this was genetic, does that mean in the future my dad (grandma's son) and I (along with my siblings) will get Alzheimer's? None of my grandma's siblings (older and younger than her) have it. I now feel like someone who has been told their dad has 6 months left to live, or that I have 1 month left to live. I'm super terrified for my grandma, my dad and my siblings."
"So, yesterday my mom and I spent some time with my grandma and her mood was very erratic. Happy/okay then angry/aggressive and snappy. I noticed when she was angry her eyes would change. Like, they would go dark almost black in the irises. And when she was back in a normal mood, her eyes would be their normal brown. Has anyone else noticed this? Oh! And her face changes—like it goes slack. It’s the oddest thing. (We’ve already had her checked for a yeast infection if anyone asks) Idk this whole thing freaks me out, the last time she was like this was back in January."
"I work in activities and honestly I find myself completely alone in our room for hours sometimes. I try my best to run activities, have conversations, and keep everyone safe but damn is it hard sometimes. I find myself almost crying during resident breakdowns, after getting swung on, after being told how useless and stupid I am. The Nurses aids don’t seem to care as they sit on their phones talking to people and watching videos, the nurses seem annoyed by my very existence after I have to take someone out of the room for a change, behavioral issues, inability to stay seated in their wheelchairs while I try to keep 5 others in theirs and convince a certain resident to please stay in his chair as he is a fall risk… and all he wants to do is show me the box outside the window and the cowboys coming for us. I try diverting…. I try gentle hand holding and eye contact but sometimes I just can’t hold back and tears stream down my face and mask… so I go quickly to our little office and try to regain my composure. I now feel like a prison warden helping prepare people for their slow deaths. I love all of them so much but it’s like the world forgot about them and they are slowly disappearing.

All you need is love."
"Thanks for reading my post. 

My mother has been living in independent living now for about 4 months. She no longer drives, we took this away since she was getting lost. We took away her credit card,  frivolous spending. 

She is no longer cooking, we are afraid she will leave stove on.she can get meals at her facility . 

She has now turned to her neighbor to manipulate and coerce her into 'buying' her things. Toilet paper, shampoo, cheerios, frozen meals, soap.
Mom had plenty of this. No need to buy extra and hoard.

 We didn't know this was happening. This patterns are not new to us. We have known for many years she was manipulate. That is why she is living now where she is. 

Also to find out she was taking food off neighbors plate during meals. And putting it away for later, possible to eat or hoard. No idea. Mom will not be truthful on this fact. 

She has been diagnosed with dementia alzheimers.  We have literally taken pretty much everything away. We cannot let her go to the store anymore, and Walmart. Now we have to reimburse the neighbors for all the extras she bought her. 

This is more than dementia. How would you go about dealing with such acts. 
I'm at a loss."
"In the past I've noticed every now and then, that my father is a little forgetful here and there. Nothing that was ever worrying (though his mother had dementia that degraded very rapidly).

Today I was talking to my father about the bike that he and I had bought secondhand a month ago from a bike store. He remembered us together being there to buy the bike. He did not remember the bikes brakes being oiled that I had asked them to do. While it was being oiled my dad and I were there looking and he asked a handful of questions about it being done.

Today, roughly a month later, he could not remember it happening. It was after I pried for a while and gave more details about the moment that he slowly started to remember.

He is currently 65, his mother developed dementia at around 75 I believe. Any worries I should have?

I intended for this message to be shorter and more to the point, sorry."
"   Not sure if this is the right group, but I really want to seek some opinions or thoughts about the situation. My Grandma is 89, and has dementia. Her memory is really not perfect, she remembers the key details, but oftentimes she forgets what she did during the week. She is under constant care by me and my mum. 

   Moving to the main point, she is very obese. At first, we were really puzzled how she managed to gain such a big amount at this quick rate, since she does not cook, and only eat when we serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  What we found out, was when we are gone, she goes through all the cabinets, pantry, in search for food. I have busted her a few times, and she always says, that either she is hungry or acts like there is no food in her mouth, that she is obviously chewing. So, me and my mum started hiding food.  But it is really frustrating, and hiding a fridge can be a challenge. It is just crazy how she never feels that she had enough, and she can easily eat everything she finds non-stop. The cherry on top is, that when the guests come over, she always says that she hasn’t got anything to eat all day, even though she already had breakfast and lunch. I see how it is taking a toll on my mother, when she really sacrifices a majority of her time to take care of her, and grandma doesn’t even remember. Maybe someone had a similar experience or can share any ideas? Thanks a lot in advance."
"I have been having the absolutely WORST time trying to use my POA to manage my dad's affairs after he ended up in the hospital and then a memory care unit. I am starting to think it's ME doing something wrong but I'm wondering if anybody else has experienced this or maybe has tips?

I would say about half the places I contact with a POA document either lose, 'never receive,' delay processing until I contact them about 10 times, or outright reject my request to be added to an account due to some stupid small technical error that's usually on them. Every place has their own specific submission process, form, letter with specific information I need to send, etc., so I am careful to ask exactly what the process is before actually submitting.

I have spent an unbelievable amount of time over the phone and sending letters just following up on things (I'm talking like 10+ hours per week, which HAS to mostly be during work hours), only to be told by generic customer service reps that there's 'nothing they can do' and they 'can't transfer me to the legal department' or even transfer me to a supervisor. I also will receive generic form letters 2-3 weeks after submission of docs that basically say, ""in reference to you POA: nope, we didn't do anything. Please submit some *other* thing nobody told you about and wait another 3-4 weeks."" There is also the problem that it seems like in complex organizations, one branch will accept the POA but that's not the branch you needed to talk to, so you have to submit ANOTHER POA and then wait another two weeks, before you are then told that the second branch you *definitely submitted a copy to* never received anything.

I mean, this thing is a legal document. I have a valid authority to be added to these accounts in a timely manner and these companies are straight up interfering with my ability to manage his affairs. I have been trying for two months to get access to his primary asset account and it's now interfering with my ability to pay some of his bills. No matter who I talk to at that company, they can't help and they give me a new set of directions to 'try resubmitting.'

I try to remain patient and give each person I talk to the benefit of the doubt and the chance to help me, but I feel like I am getting straight stonewalled out of this with no options. It's such a weird form of helplessness! I also try to tug at heartstrings due to his situation and this can sometimes gain sympathy but never gains any competence from anybody.

How have you all managed this ridiculous set of hoops, on top of the whole your-parent-has-dementia thing?!"
"Sorry for the long story. There is a summary of my question and a TLDR at the bottom.

  I want to give some backstory. My mom got early onset Alzheimer's/dementia and over the course of 8years I watched her completely forget who she was, who I was. Near the end before we put her in a care home I was changing her diapers. She would talk to her reflection in the mirror like it was her friend. I'd come out in the middle of the night sometimes to find her just standing there staring into darkness or facing a corner. It was really unnerving. She started getting symptoms when I was about 16 or so and she died when I was 23, my younger brother only 18.  Her dad died of Alzheimer's but his didn't set in until he was around 80years old. Her symptoms started when she was about 40. She always said she wouldn't die of that disease and technically, she didn't. She progressed really rapidly in the care home and In her last few days she became violent, attacking other residents in their sleep. So she was sent to a psych and they prescribed her some medication. Well this medication made her really dizzy and a couple days later she fell and hit her head. She died of brain trauma/internal bleeding. So her statement did stand true in the end, she didn't let that horrible disease be the thing to take her out.. although i believe she died long before her physical body did anyways.. Now none of that is really the point of this post. Since she had early onset that means she carried a specific gene that caused it. This is hereditary so me and my younger brother have a 50/50 chance of carrying it. This gene can be found in a DNA/Gene test.  If I carry this specific early onset gene it is pretty much 100% that I will get early onset Alzheimer's. If i don't carry it there's still always the chance I can get it later in life but it's not a certain thing.

TLDR:  If I don't carry the early onset gene Id get some bit of peace of mind. But if I do carry it there are 2 cons and 2pros that come to mind.
 Con #1- it will most certainly effect  health or life insurance right?
 Con #2- I feel like I'd psych myself out and think about it all the time, worry if any small thing I forget is symptoms setting in etc.
 Pro #1) I could likely start trying tests studies treatments & prevention methods early on and 
Pro #2) I would try harder than I have been to live my life to the absolute fullest knowing that I could die in my 40s. I already live by this to an extent as i know every day isn't guaranteed but I'd definitely spend a lot more time doing the things I love in the next 10years or so.

 I know in the end it comes down to what I want to do but my question for you is, would you want to know?"
"My grandfather (I'll call him Pa) just got diagnosed. Stage 4. He's on home health care now. This man is everything in my life. He was like my father. He is doing OK I think. He likes to stare at the TV and then he will have ""hallucinations"" of 5 little girls standing next to him and he will talk to them like they are his grandkids. Then he'll imagine his best friend (who he hasn't seen in years and is also in poor health) and have conversations with him. He gets kind of upset when my Nana tells him he is just seeing things and his eyes and mind are overcompensating from going blind. 

She is just now finding out his diagnosis too and from my understanding let's him see them now. Should I go along with it? Like, don't let him know there is no one there?"
"Its been 3 years since my father's diagnose. He is 65 only. I am so sorry he never had the chance to live his 60's he went from 60 to 80 years old.

Its been downhill since then, he is on some medications to chill him a bit and get better sleep. 

I have been noticing he is beginning to have some kind of mild hallucinations. Last night he woke up in the middle of the night asking my mom why there was a person there and why they were in the kitchen while such person is just a frame above the bed of leaves and they have been sleeping in my room as they are staying this week in my place and I will return with them to their home for some weeks.

He is quiet most of the time, interactions have decreased significantly in the past months. I mean, he is not able to make a coherent phrase anymore. He stutters some words and its difficult to understand what he is saying, when he does sometimes comes from a weird observation, like trying to relate the TV controller with a little monkey there. Nonsense.

Its clear he is losing his consciousness day by day. At least here he is not wandering that much anymore, he sits or lays in the couch and stays there. His eyes...his eyes are lost in space. He doesn't hear or understand clearly when someone is addressing to him and he needs help to conduct him where he needs to go. He is totally dependent in everything, even baths he can't do it properly in his own. This wasn't happening when I last saw him in January. 

Sometimes I wonder if he is becoming blind because he cant see the most obvious things. My apartment is small, like 570 sq feet, two rooms and a bathroom between, he ALWAYS misses the bathroom. He goes all the way to the laundry area or one of the rooms to pee. Obviously the bathroom is damn small, and he is still not sure where to pee and even aimed with his hands to be sure pointing it to the side of the toilette. How is that possible...

Its depressing...very depressing. I feel some guilty for choosing to stay in the city while my parents and my brother (27, I am 28) lives 1 hour drive (I don't own vehicles so I cant visit them that often, I intend to do so soon  as long as I find some way or even save to buy a motorbike). I mean, WFH since the pandemic hit and living by myself for 5 years now, I have choose this life before his disease so I could gain some independence and find my own way and to be not a burden for them, I have a girlfriend I want to marry soon so I need to build my life and not worry my mom, I guess its the right thing? If she needed my help she might ask, and  I am glad my brother lives there to help them out. As I see them every 2 months, this means I only see frames of my fathers illness and its always getting  worse. My mom and brother are not that shocked as I am because they are there. My mom has been dealing better now, she has accepted that correcting him will not help, just comply and chill him when asking about going home or seeing his wife or dead relatives.

He is not able to recognize any of us. I wonder what goes through his head...I needed to offmychest this because as much as I try to accept this as life the way it is and this is just one way to die, when I stop to think about it I just want to cry and I do sometimes, a little, because we need to keep going. I feel bad because we werent really close all of our lives. I mean, he was always there and provided us all, he did a wonderful job as father, we just didnt click when we grew up so our relation were just ok enough, I wish we had way more father-son moments as I see others doing. Now its too late. However, I am glad I see a lot of in me from him, I am a fraction of the men he was and I am glad for that.

As if the disease is not enough to burden us all we need to mind and deal with the judicial matters and battle for the right to not pay IRS anymore. 

So sorry...We are no that religious but I know he had faith in God as I do, and I am glad I once asked him if he believed in God ans Jesus Christ as his savior and he does. So I know he is going to be saved and go to Heaven peacefully. I don't pray a lot...once in a while but when I do I always ask Him to relief my father's pain and give peace in his heart, the same for us and strength to deal with all that, I feel better afterwards and thats the way he have been living.

I wish you all the best dealing with this. You are not alone"
"I’m posting this to get some advice on what I should do.

Should I try and get my wife to the doctor or neurologist?

She is having very bad short term memory loss, loss of balance, and tremors.

She is also experiencing muscle/joint stiffness/pain/weakness

She gets these very bad intense headaches, which in her own words ""makes her feel out of it"" they last for a couple minutes then go away.

When she laughs the left and right side at the base of her skull starts hurting really bad, she says it burns almost or that someone is pushing super hard on her skull and squeezing.

She has lost weight without trying.

She barely eats because she feels full fast.

For a while we thought her memory loss was due to anxiety and depression, but she has been on medication, and it has been controlled and getting a lot better. Her memory did not improve.

She had high liver enzymes one time, so us and her doctor chalked up her memory loss and tremors to her liver. It’s not because of her liver, all her bloodwork came back and it’s all normal.

Tested her thyroid, normal.

Last bloodwork showed no vitamin deficiencies. 

She is a smoker, vape throughout the day and marijuana at night.

Normal sleep

History of concussions when she was a teenager

She has had memory problems, but now it’s getting much worse and more noticeable.

Her memory loss consists of:

Asking a question then a few minutes later she asks the same question with no recollection of asking it the first time.

She will be talking and then can’t think of the word she was trying to say and she gets frustrated. She cries sometimes because of it and sometimes she will hurt herself (she smacks her forehead a lot when she can’t remember)

She gets words mixed up and puts two different words together.

She came out once asking where the sceeezers were. Then she says scissors, then she lets out a loud Fu\*\* and yelled TWEEZERS

She has little cups where she holds her makeup everything has a place. Specifically, her mascara, it has its own cup. One day she was wandering around looking for her mascara and she just couldn’t find it. She put it in a drawer, not the cup. She had no recollection of putting it there. Another time she’s looking for her mascara again. It ended being in the toothbrush and toothpaste holder.

She forgets appointments and important dates.

She had an appointment the other day at 11:15. She put it in her phone, work calendar, it was on her paper for the doctor, on her paper calendar, and on her doctors portal. Everything said 11:15. Well she forgets, and she goes at 11:45. She said she read 11:15 as 11:45 and she even questioned the front desk lady and didn’t believe her that her appt was at 11:15.

She’s having a hard time following recipes, she’s just very slow at it now.

She will be talking, and she tries to say a word and it starts out as mumbo jumbo she can’t grasp on to saying it correctly and she ends up stuttering trying to get the word out. She lets out a big UGH and I have to say the word for her then she can say it.

Whenever she gets up to go get something, she stops, looks confused and forgets what she was doing and must ask me what she was doing/getting.

She walks all around the house just to grab one thing. She forgets what she’s getting.

She once forgot that she let our dogs outside, until she woke up to barking and scratching at 2am.

Mid-sentence she will just stop and pause. She forgets what she was talking about, and she must ask me what we were just talking about.

She barely remembers to take her medication, we are close to getting her a pill box because when she does remember to take her medication on her own, later in the day she’ll forget if she took it or not and then is at risk for double dosing.

The majority of the time she doesn’t know what day it is, she will say it’s Friday but really it’s like Wednesday.

She repeats her stories about her day at least like 3 times a day after getting home.

She doesn’t remember the day before; she has a hard time thinking about what we had for dinner the day before.

She barely remembers what she does the day before.

She is a math wizard, but lately she’s having trouble calculating simple numbers like single digit numbers.

She has expressed to me that she can’t remember her schedule. She has a time sheet to fill out and she can never remember what time she got to work and what time she left. She also forgets to write down what time she gets to work once she gets there.

She has had tremors for a year or so, but they are very noticeable now. Her hand shakes uncontrollably and it spreads to her whole arm sometimes. Her leg will also have a big tremor. These tremors happen at rest.

Her balance is not great.

She’ll be standing up straight and just randomly loses her balance.

She runs into the corners of walls because she just doesn’t move out of the way quick enough? Or she thinks she’s moved enough out of the way, but she ends up just ramming her shoulder into the wall.

We are talking about getting a bar for the shower, because she has said when she closes her eyes to wash her face, she gets very dizzy and loses her balance.

It’s not safe. She has had some close calls of almost falling out of the shower because she just randomly loses her balance.

What should I do? Should I be worried?"
"My mom lives with us. She’s only 67 but after losing her job 3 years ago she has rapidly declined. She seems much slower to speak with, it’s almost frustrating listening to her talk .. searching for the words.. sometimes decides she doesn’t even know what she’s saying and says never mind


Recently (1 month ago) she started chatting through Facebook with a scammer / catfish that had convinced her he was a well known professional athlete (I’m leaving his name out) just let it be known he is exceptionally famous and 28 years old . She began a romantic relationship with this person believing it was the athlete.. after coaxing her to deposit a couple of fake checks (she didn’t know of course) and sending portions of money back to the tune of over $10,000 she finally realized and listened to her family and admitted it was not the athlete and was a scammer. She felt embarrassed and very sad/ upset. Her bank wanted tons of money and she just scraped by on social security. Days later she starts another romantic relationship with a person pretending to be a semi famous musician. She talks about it at first then begins to hide it from everyone. Her finances are absolute chaos so I have the small few hundred dollars she has left to her name. She asks for $100 to open a new bank account because the old ones all closed on her. She then proceeded to go buy gift cards and send them to this new scammer. She talks to him as if they are in love and will be married soon.. after two weeks of chatting and of course he’s wanting money from her and asks several times and tells her to ask me for it. Clearly I anyone thinking rationally he is pressuring her for money and manipulating her blatantly.

She claims she knows this is wrong but she also will lash out and scream at anyone who tries to confront her about this issue. It’s strange to see someone that was considered highly intelligent and successful so far gone from reality she believes these scammers ridiculous stories for needing money and will harm her own financial well being, lie to her family and even lash out in anger when confronted.

I don’t know if this is psychological or cognitive or what! I need to get her some help. Any advice??"
"My elderly Dad couldn’t get his brand new Windows laptop to work so he’s bought a MacBook.

He’s also just bought a book on how to use the MacBook because he set it up incorrectly and can’t even get into it.

He’s 75 and bordering dementia.

He doesn’t remember conversations we’ve had.

What should I do? He doesn’t have that much money to be buying all this stuff.

He has no need for a laptop. I think he just wanted one because I was talking about how I couldn’t set mine up as workmen are to put in floor boards but I’ve been waiting 7 months for insurance to sort it out."
My grandmother has mid to late stage dementia and Alzheimer’s and we’re trying to place her in a facility that can provide the care she needs since we cannot. The only facility near us that can provide the level of care she needs is quoting us about $3000 more than we can afford. Does anyone have any resources that would help us financially? She doesn’t qualify for Medical. And board and care isn’t able to provide the level of care she needs. I’m desperate for any help because we’re running out of time
"Hello, I’m hoping to get some insight on how my girlfriend and her family can get financial assistance with getting her grandmother (patient) and her grandfather into a long term care facility. 

Her grandma is in her 80’s and has SEVERE dementia. At this point she remembers nothing, and is verbally and physically abusive. Last summer she fell and broke her hip, that lead to a horrible few months of recovery. In the last 2 months she’s fallen 3 times and hurts herself constantly. Since she’s in pain it only makes her attitude much much much worse. She is absolutely unable to care for herself of course, and my GF’s family cannot care for her by themselves. They’re not equipped to deal with her at all. Her grandpa is in his 90’s and constantly is the target of her anger and abuse and when GF and her mom try to intervene, they then get the brunt of it. His health is also starting to slip further and further as this goes on. 

GF’s mom is a single mother and a teacher and GF is an admin assistant at a school so their funds are very very limited. I offer to help in anyway I can, house work, yard work anything, but I can’t help much financially either. 

At this point they don’t know what to do and believe there are absolutely no options out there. Even the thought of splitting up the grandparents scares them for her grandpa’s sake. What options are there for helping pay for a memory care facility. Insurance, non-profits, is something like Go-FundMe or anything like that the best bet?
Any advice can make a big difference for them so I welcome anything y’all can think of. 

Thank you"
Does anyone have incontinence problems from their brain damage?  I do.
"My mom has an important appt w her neurologist next week that I’ve been waiting months for. The neurologist will review the neuropsych exam that was administered to my mom several months ago, where it was indicated that she has vascular dementia w the possibility of Lewy Body Dementia. The neurologist will further evaluate her and likely recommend some kind of imaging studies for diagnostic purposes. I have been temporarily living w my mom at her request to help care for her (she has other health issues) and her cognitive health worsens by the day. This is not an appt she can miss, but now she’s saying she will not go and I am beside myself. All of my energy goes into being a caretaker for her, her dog, her house. I left my life behind (several states away) to care for her and my mental health is suffering majorly as a result. (I have mental health support via weekly therapy & a psychiatrist). I have no job atm, no friends, no money, nada. Just a desire to see my mom get properly evaluated and diagnosed so that she can get the treatment she needs and I can move on w my life. I desperately need to make sure she goes to see her neurologist next week, despite her resistance and denial that anything is wrong w her cognitive health. I’m feeling so helpless, and hopeless, like I’ve been wasting my life caring for a thankless old lady. I guess I don’t even know what I’m even asking here, other than maybe for prayers/supportive thoughts. I’m trying so hard to keep it together, help my mom, apply for jobs, try to meet friends, be healthy…but I’m at a breaking point here."
"Hi there! 

New to this community, and in a bit of a hurry here- sorry if I miss any rules! 
I am looking for recommendation on Tracking systems for my grandfather. He’s started wondering, and it’s very worrisome. 
Does anyone have any that they recommend? 

Thank you in advanced!"
"So my grandma is 76, and due to a traumatic brain injury in the 80s she has dementia. 
She moved in with my parents four years ago due to she cannot drive or cook, and she chose to because she understood how difficult it was living on her own. Well this year due to my(25 f) high risk pregnancy I had to stop working so my husband and I had to move in w/ then as well as my 1 yr old. We rent out our house to help with mortgage and to help financially.

Well my grandma is getting worse and verbally abusive to me, that I never take her out, that I just sit around and don’t help and when I don’t put a jacket on my son (to go outside in 68 degree weather to the car) that I’m a horrible mother. But when I cry(as an 8 month pregnant woman does hearing that) she tells me I’m nothing but a cruel person and hate her. She says it is so bad that she is moving out (to a senior place.) 
She still Can’t cook, she is legally blind and she doesn’t recall if you tell her what day it is or gets extremely nasty.
She has a follow up in May to see if it’s even possible but if it’s not idk what to do. I don’t want my sons hearing me get degraded legitimately 8 hrs a day, but at end of day I don’t want her moving out either. I’m just at a lost because I can’t comprehend how my best friend now hates me and calls me horrendous names. I can’t talk/vent to my mom because it hurts her feelings. My husband just says “it’s not her” which I know but it still hurts. Idk what else to do. It feels like no one even wants me here. That I’ve ruined everything. But where can I go to talk about it?"
"My grandma is 89 years old she lives with us in the house so my dad can take care of her, yesterday for the first time she started seeing people in the house and a kid running around her that she want to catch to give him water because he feels thirsty, I’m not sure what should we do, I read in Google that it might be dementia, should we take her to a doctor and is there any treatment for it?"
"My grandfather's onset was very sudden and very severe. He never set up a POA, and now he's completely incapacitated and in the hospital.

I'm not financially capable of getting a lawyer to help me file for guardianship. I'm also low-support-needs autistic, and the process of actually being his guardian is too much for me to handle, honestly. 

His two daughters both work multiple jobs and don't have the time or ability to be responsible for him, as they're barely getting by themselves.

If none of us can do it the state will eventually become his guardian. We're scared that they will cut us out of his life entirely if that happens. We certainly won't have a say in getting him the best care or getting him out of bad care. 

Not being able to handle this feels like I'm abandoning him, but I really can't do it. I watched the videos and read all of the pamphlets. It's all beyond my capabilities. 

I hate this. We're all failing him. I'm failing him. He's always been there for us. He would have done anything for us and we can't even help him the one time he needs us. How does anyone cope with this?"
"Moving my mom from the hospital to a care facility today.  I know she is going to hate it but it’s the best thing for her. Any tips from anyone about how to make the transition smoother, or things to bring from home that will help her feel more comfortable? 

What do I say when she asks why she can’t just go home? 

Thank you for any advice"
"I just posted about her few days ago asking questions , and now she is gone. I have taken care of her the last 228 days . I read over and over that people had relief when there loved one passed away and that they are no longer suffering. Ugh I don't feel that. I just want her back. I want more time. I thought I had more time. Dementia is such a cruel thing.

Thank you to all of you and this forum. It has really helped me a lot learning and being better for her. 

I hope you all find peace in this part of your journeys."
"My mom has dementia - Alzheimer's according to the neurologist.  She had lived with my father, until about a year before he passed away, and he needed to go to a skilled nursing facility.  

Since then, she's gradually gotten worse;  somewhere in 2020 about the time Dad died, we realized she wasn't thinking straight, and have wanted to move her into a retirement community of some kind ever since.  But she was resistant, and wanted to live at home alone.  So we indulged her, until she started having a lot of trouble taking her medications and dealing with pretty much anything other than immediate daily living- no sort of hired help could do right for more than a few months- the yard guys always ran afoul of her, and so did housekeepers.    

Eventually she started complaining about being lonely and not having anything to do, as well as having increased issues with stuff because she couldn't maintain her medication schedule herself. 

So we talked her into moving into a retirement community where she can live, people will give her her meds on time, keep an eye on her, and generally remove all the hard-to-do stuff from her. 

She's been there since January.  Most of the time she's ok and things are good- she's made friends, she does stuff, etc...  But every now and again, she goes on the warpath and decides that she doesn't like it there, wants to move back home, everyone's stealing from her, all her neighbors at home were so close and wonderful (she rarely saw them at all), and so on.  

  
How do I talk to her when she's like this?  I know that I can't argue with her- it won't work, but she's dogged and determined, and I have a hard time changing the subject.  And of course, she doesn't remember any of the bad stuff at the old place, or good stuff at the new place.    So far, I just try to affirm her emotions, not argue with her as little as I can manage, and try to redirect her onto other subjects.  

&#x200B;

Any other advice/suggestions?"
My father has been homeless for about a year and recently was confirmed to have dementia. The homeless shelter is kicking him out on Friday.

What else can I do to get him emergency shelter?

"content warning: caregiver grief, unsettling statistics, broken hip

i (20M) work at facility on a memory care unit, and recently the stomach bug has been going around. i was walking a resident back to her room when she threw up. i am very sensitive to vomit so i turned away and called for the nurse. I turned away for three seconds. Long enough for “[nurse!] please come here!” and when i turned back she had started walking away. i watched her stumble. i watched her land on her side. and i knew. she was just far enough away i couldn’t assist in the fall, aside from making sure she didn’t knock her head. but i just got confirmation she broke her hip. i looked up the recovery rates for broken hips in people with dementia and it’s,,,, not good. i feel like i hurt her. i feel like i was careless and now she’s going to pay for it. i can’t sleep. i can’t eat. i just feel,,,, bad."
"I am female(24), living with a tough situation. In my household currently is my grandma who has several medical issues, my mother who works all the time, brother who has epilepsy and me. I do not work because I have to take care of several family members at once and although it can be stressfully times I make the best of what I have. My uncle 65 has been in the hospital for the last week, he was living with us but we can’t take care of him unfortunately. 

I need advice or tips or support or anything I can get nothing is too small. My uncle has been homeless for a period of time before he moved in with us (he moved in two years ago), when he arrived we could tell something was wrong. His primary doctor said he has dementia. My uncles health is declining rapidly in a short span, I’m talking within the last month or two he has really went down hill. Everything started off with a bathroom issue and lack of hygiene. He become delusional and would “speak to his step-daughter” in his head. That progressed to wandering through the house often and eventually lead to him falling several times and he is unable to get up and down on his own. 

Since he has been in the hospital this week my family has received some of the most devastating news. Not only does he have dementia but at some point he has had a stroke or several strokes and his right brain is not functioning as it should. He has been deemed medically (I don’t know the medical term), but basically he is incompetent to take care of hisself and I know that sounds mean as ever but he really can’t take care of hisself. My grandma which is his mother can’t take care of him due to age and her own health issues. I can’t take care of him because I can’t get him up and down. My mom is never home she has to work constantly to keep us financially stable. My brother can’t really take care of him but helps when he is able. 

My uncle has a case worker and she said there is resources and help but she keeps saying he is okay to come home and my mom and grandma both express he can’t come home we can’t take care of him we just can’t handle that. We are looking into putting him into a nursing home close or near as possible to us. We live in the Northeast part of GA. Every nursing home in our surrounding area is either full or there is some reason for why he is not accepted and I don’t understand why he isn’t accepted. This is all new for me and my family and this is a lot of stress on us, especially me since I am the stay at home “care giver”. Can anyone please help us or point us into the right direction because I honest to god don’t know what to do at this point. I want him to get the help he needs and deserves more than anything. I keep calling all around my area and I just can’t seem to find anywhere with an opening. It breaks my heart because I wish I could take care of him but reality is I can’t give him the help he truly needs and I don’t know what else to do. Maybe this is just a rant or to share my experience I don’t know but I just need some help desperately."
"My loved one has been showing signs of delusions for a few years now, but there's something I haven't found much help with. When he has these delusions, sometimes he is VERY persistent about them. You can try to distract him, but he'll bring it up after another minute or two. You can ask him questions, but trying to be logical with someone in mid-late stage dementia is futile. Me and some family will go through the usual. See if he's hungry, needs to go to the toilet, in pain, etc. When he's really bad, it's never those usual suspects. Sometimes this happens during the day, more often at night. It's sundowning to an extreme.

It can take well over an hour or two for him to forget about what delusional problem he's obsessing over in daylight. At night, even longer. Distractions don't work. Looking for causes doesn't work. What can you do besides wait it out and keep an eye on him so he doesn't hurt himself? (He's on a walker and needs help getting out of chairs)

I'm not sure if anybody has an answer because dementia affects everybody differently. But it would be comforting to know if anyone else has dealt with these impossible to deal with delusions."
"Oh gawd, what kind of hell is this.  Got the call today whilst driving over to visit mom that 'I NEEDED TO COME NOW, MOM WAS BEING FIESTY'. 

So 5 minutes later I'm there and she is dressed and ready to go.  Where?  Doesn't matter, I never take her out. I sit down and start chatting and it's the same word salad I've been getting the past few weeks.  Sentences start out OK then head off into la-la land half way thru.  I just pick up on what I can and move the conversation along. She's obviously agitated so I ask if she want's to go for a walk & we head out to the backyard. We take a walk around the yard, pick oleander flowers (so many I have to tell her the bush needs SOME flowers) then have a sit on the patio.  The word salad continues, 'OH, I didn't see the car by the bushes' (no car at all), etc. 

It goes on for another hour but I'll spare the insanity.  The most disconcerting thing was another resident (there for stroke, not dementia) relayed mom said she was going to kill her earlier. I asked what staff did and she said nothing. Ya know, I don't care how demented you are, I'd frog march you into your bedroom for saying that. 

They  added in Depakote sprinkles at lunch and dinner last Thursday to try and slow the night wandering. The word salad predates the depakote and I didn't see where excessive nastiness was a side effect.  What to do??? I'm going back tomorrow at noon, hopefully I can talk to day staff nurse or doctor.

OK, vent over. Gotta get chocolates in the morning for everyone for putting up with this disease."
"Hello everyone, I am new to this subreddit.

My wife was in a coma close to 25 years ago for close to 3 months due to sepsis.   She was on full life support through that time and was not expected to survive at times.  Since that time she has had a memory deficit of a kind in which she would have trouble remembering certain things, but it was sporadic. She found routines to deal with day to day tasks, but never felt comfortable going back to work, or in socializing with friends and such.

She is now in her early 70's and her memory is seeming to get worse as time moves on.  I have tried to talk to her and her doctors over the years about it, but she is not co-operative and does not wish to deal with it.  The doctors, to this point, have not found it worth dealing with, but as time goes on, I am hoping for more information to bring to a medical professional for some help.

I guess I am just looking for something to help with how to deal with it.  I have been very ill in the past, and now am fine, able to be at home and help out basically full time, so for the time being, care is not the issue.  I am just grasping at straws on how to go about getting the type of dementia diagnosed, so as to know what type it is, and what could be done, if anything.

Thanks for letting me vent, and hopefully I can find a few answers.

Edit:  Thank you to everyone that replied.  It helps to know that I am not alone in my experience.  "
A few years ago I was diagnosed with Memory Impairment and Amnesia.  I know it's early onset dementia.  I also have APS Lupus and Lupus Encephalitis.  My father got it when he was in his late 50's and I'm 61 now.  I had a brain injury from a seizure from taking a drug in 2012 and haven't been the same since.  I haven't been able to work since 2012 and have been on SSDI.  I've lost my appetite and also have incontinence problems now.  Anyone else have early onset dementia?
"Genuine question. When my parents were into their 60's, they both developed diabetes type 2, which is very much a life-style acquired condition. So I spent the past 20 years watching my diet and getting in exercise. Now my mother has had a dementia diagnosis and from what I have learned from my mother, my father is also showing clear signs. Is dementia related to diet/exercise? Is there a correlation with diabetes? Is this something inevitable that I need to plan for with both parents succumbing? What (if anything) can we do to give our children the best chances of not having to worry about our generation's dementia problems?"
"Came across a few research papers and graduation projects that talk about using AI Machine Learning by making it recognize subtle differences in MRI scans from Dementia affected patients and using that to Detect dementia as early as possible.

But then also came across sources saying u cannot detect dementia through MRI. and MRI is just used to rule out possibilities of other complications like a tumor.

SO which one is true, I've no medical background and am really confused on this."
"My parents currently live alone, and my siblings and I just found out that my Father has dementia. My Mother has been hiding the fact from us for unknown reasons, and my Father is pretty far along. By my estimate, he's somewhere in stage 6. The doctor has said that this is rapid onset. I just made a trip home and he can barely talk and frequently soils himself. My mother is taking care of him and I worry about the strain that it's putting on her, as she already has notes up around the house that say things like ""Feeling tired, check blood sugar."" (Both are diabetic)  


Long story short, they had an initial visit with a neurologist and now my Dad has made it known that he doesn't want to go back for the follow up visit where they would run tests to figure out what's going on. I believe that it's because he doesn't want to be put in a care facility. The thing I need to know though, is if the doctor will report him to the state. They currently reside in Louisiana and I've heard some conflicting reports that they will or won't. I want what's best for him no matter what, but I'm also concerned that my sister(closest sibling and emergency contact) or mother would get in some kind of trouble if he doesn't go back. 

Information specifically relating to Louisiana would be of the most help, but other information is welcome."
"I didn’t sleep well last night - actually got up at 3 am because it was pouring down rain and our 2 barrel, rain barrel system is manual - meaning I have to swap out the one for the other while it is raining. Anyway, I couldn’t go back to sleep so I started watching the news about the horribleness that is now Ukraine and now, almost 6 hours later, the last thing I want to do is take care of my aunt today. I just want to stay in bed and hide or maybe sleep or read. I’m usually up around 5 am. I just really don’t feel like taking care of someone else today but I guess I will."
"This is a definitely a very sensitive subject and I don't mean to bring up things that will upset anyone. 

I just had some questions about Alzheimer's and the stages and when did your loved one pass.

I have a very large family my grandmother has a lot of kids and a million grandkids. So there is definitely a lot of hands in the cookie jar. I am the who lives with my Grandma as her primary caretaker. 

According to the fast Alzheimer's scale my grandma is at 6c. She has been progressing fast since my grandfather has passed away. 

There is definitely a disagreement in my grandma time left and how it should be handled. Some people think she only has weeks to months. She has recently fallen and broke ribs and now has pneumonia. So she is definitely struggling now and I know with anyone she could pass at anytime. But I believe she will beat this and recover. 

Things I read and see saying people can live a long time in the 6 category and even awhile in 7 on scale. 

Sensitive part could you tell me on what part of stage did your loved one past and was it complications or other medical factors or dementia related. 

Thank you"
"Hi all,

&#x200B;

My mom and I both live with my grandpa (her dad) to help take care of him and he's diagnosed with vascular dementia. Essentially, he copies my mom's sleep routine during the week and it VERY obviously doesn't work for him. Additionally, on days when my mom doesn't have to work, if he wasn't told beforehand and still gets up early, he is angry and will stay that way all day about the fact no one told him, frequently resulting in fighting. We try to tell him beforehand when we know she doesn't have work, but we can't always do that. The ONLY reason my grandpa needs to get up during the week is for his pills, which he can get up for right before my mom leaves.

My mom gets up around 4:45-5 AM and showers around 5:30-6. My grandpa gets up around 4 AM and goes into the bathroom before her. He also goes to bed around when she does at 9 PM. Hypothetically 9PM-4AM isn't the worst sleep, but when he does this he can't fall asleep, tosses and turns, and gets up to go to the bathroom frequently, so he isn't getting much sleep. He also refuses to nap, purposefully getting up to walk around, sit in uncomfortable chairs, or doing something to wake himself up. As the week goes on he gets more anxious, angry, and out of it from the lack of sleep. On the weekends though he'll go to bed around 10 PM, wake up around 6-7 AM, only get up once for the bathroom, and nap frequently throughout the day. When my mom has breaks from work that's the same sleep schedule he does. So 9PM-4AM is obviously not working for him and is causing problems.

We've tried to tell him he doesn't need to get up with her, but he refuses to listen. He'll argue he isn't getting up with her and that's just when he gets up, that he needs to get up because he has things to do, or he'll just get angry and say that's how he's always slept, it's never been a problem before, and that he's fine on less sleep. The longer this is going on the more angry he gets if he isn't told about my mom staying home before the morning. Even on days when we do tell him, sometimes he forgets and accuses us of not telling him and is angry. Sometimes when he's upset about it he'll say things like ""oh so I could've slept in,"" which shows he doesn't like getting up this early. 

We have a few guesses as to why he gets up this early 1) he wants to use the bathroom before my mom is up so he doesn't worry about holding it or not being able to hold it, but if this was the problem than it wouldn't change on the weekend and he would still need to go to the bathroom, and he doesn't on the weekends/breaks 2) he's trying to have a schedule/routine for himself but he isn't like this with anything else and on the weekends/breaks this schedule doesn't happen 3) he thinks he needs to make sure my mom is up for work and it's his responsibility to do this.

Due to other sleeping problems he's currently taking 3 mg of melatonin, and it's helped the other issues but it hasn't helped this.

Is there something we could do to help this? Has anyone else ever experienced this?"
"i'm the main caretaker of my mom (my parents are separated, but my dad comes to visit everyday) who i suspect has dementia but due to financial constraints, we haven't been able to get a diagnosis yet. i'm 19 years old and graduated high school last year. i deferred my admission to university so that i could help figure out what to do with my mom.

i've experienced depression since i was 12 and have recently developed what i think is anxiety. this whole situation and all these responsibilities took a huge toll on my mental health. my mom has become slightly verbally abusive too. when i'm in a depressive episode, i think about just not existing anymore and i've started to self harm a few times. i know that this environment is very toxic to me and leaving would save my mentality. it sounds immature, but i want to be like my other friends who've started their college journeys and are learning and experiencing new things. i'm supposedly due to leave in september but i'm not sure if i'll make it there since it depends on a lot of different factors. my dad has agreed to take care of my mom if i have to leave, and we are currently working together to think of a good arrangement.

every time i think of going to uni, i get excited to finally leave and meet people (i haven't met any friends face to face since the pandemic began in 2020) and just have a life for my own. but at the same time, my heart breaks when i think of leaving my mom. 

during one of our arguments, she got the impression that i didn't like her anymore and i was going to leave her right away which sent her into a big meltdown of crying and sobbing and screaming. that scene repeats in my head over and over whenever i think of leaving, and the guilt and frustration is eating me from inside.

what should i do? any advice on coping? i don't even know what to tell her when i leave :(

tl;dr being the main caretaker for my mom is killing my spirit and i need to leave to save myself, but thinking of leaving her breaks my heart"
"i'm trying to cross reference this with life expectancy, to see if the high amount of elderly dementia patients in the local old folk's carehome is related or correlated to increase maximum age"
"My grandad (75) only got his diagnosis yesterday, but I'm afraid it may have come to late to help.

For the last week he's been at the hospital and his symptoms have gotten so much worse. The fluctuations seem to come out of nowhere and the brief moments of clarity are heartbreaking for him and us. 

 In the past couple of months (after covid and a stroke in January) there has been a cycle. He will lose his ability to walk at home and go into a delirium phase with hallucinations (usually of dead loved ones). He goes to the hospital for a few days and regains lucidity while there. He can also walk again. They send him home. He's fine for a couple of weeks and then the symptoms repeat. This is the fourth time... Only this time his mind and motor function aren't coming back.

For at least 5 days now, he won't eat more than a bite or two of food, and only that to humor us. He barely drinks anything at all and has had fluids from an IV the whole time. 

The hospital hasn't said anything about this being the end. Before he went into afib yesterday, they planned to discharge him to a rehab facility (it wouldn't have worked out, because he isn't lucid for more than a couple of hours at a time and is pretty combative  his Medicare is just pushing for release) ...but his decline in function has been so rapid over the last few months, and I keep thinking that this is it."
"For Easter my family cooks a big meal (me and my mom) and immediate family come over to spend some time with my grandma. This year is different, and it hurts more than I thought I would be affected. 

My Uncle who was staying with us has been diagnosed with dementia. The past week he had to go to the hospital because he over all was not doing well. We received some of the most awful news and that is bad enough. We were not able to go to the hospital to visit him today for Easter and that bothered me tremendously. I thought about his condition and how he’s in a hospital room by hisself. He didn’t get to have a grand big meal, didn’t get to sit outside on the porch, didn’t get to see everyone. I don’t know if he is or is not aware of what’s going on or if it was Easter, but that hurts my heart so badly he missed out on so many of our usual holiday activities. I hope he wasn’t scared or uncomfortable or depressed. Everyone in the family are so wrapped up in their own things which I can understand to a point. I can’t drive and mom had to work so I basically had no way to visit. He isn’t allowed to have his phone as per the hospital but he can use the hospital phone but he’s not able to hold much of a conversation. It’s easier to visit in person than over a phone. It has been so hard dealing with him to be honest but it kills me thinking what if he thinks we abandoned him. I hope he forgive me for not being able to visit today. I pray he doesn’t feel abandoned I am so sorry, but I will try my best to come ASAP. I just feel like a terrible person for not being able to visit for Easter. I feel like a monster."
Obviously staff told to monitor her - of course now wondering if moving in was a mistake
"Tw Cw for animal death +srry for mobile+srrt if confusing thisjuat happen and upset 

For years now it been clear my grandfather (mid 90s) has something going up there and he has at least dementia and after my fathers death and him getting covid bad it worsen. My grandma and siblings want to deny it but theres no more denial he forgot my kitten was on the floor and he stepped on her and she died and im just so upset and anger and he littertly did forget she was on the floor and he’s upset and crying because he adored her too but he just killed her because he thought everyone was taking too long so he was in a rush, he forgot she was there and then didn’t relized and she was so small and he is not a super big man but he didnt relized. 

I just feel so helpless watching this progress for years now especially with being so young and him and my grandmother were the one to raise me and the culture of machoism saying not to get aid from doctor or others and my silbings scared of loosing him too which lead to their denial and now we all saw what happened and my poor kitten suffered and they will still deny it despite me being the main one aiding in the day to day with my grandparents and just loosing my poor Chupala"
"Hi, new to this subreddit.  My grandmother was diagnosed with dementia about a year ago, but no actions were taken early and now it is overwhelming.  I am NOT the main caregiver for my grandmother, her husband is (he's 92).  No one has POA.  Recently she beat my grandpa up with a maglight (a heavy flashlight) because she thought he was someone else.  She throws away her clothes, because 'they aren't hers', she refuses to take any medication for the dementia because the first one she took made her VERY sick.  After the incident my cousin took her to his house where she stayed until they got her a place at a skilled nursing facility.  She was at the skilled nursing facility for maybe 4 days and then had to leave because she was trying to wander and leave the premises, she was being combative, and uncooperative.   So my family (her son, grandson, and husband) brought her to a behavioral health unit for 'medication management'.  Now she is highly medicated and can barely speak to us.  Our family Zoom called her today and I couldn't believe how bad she looked.  She was sitting up in a chair, could barely open her eyes or talk to us.  I was NOT prepared for something like that.

My questions for people who have been through something like this..  Is this a normal process?  What are your experiences with something like this?  What was the next step?  How long did this 'process' take before they were able to get the meds needed and get to a nursing home?

TDLR: I've got some questions for people who have a dementia family member who is uncooperative, combative and trying to seek a resolution outside of being a 24/7 caregiver at home."
"Just venting
I’m sad, 59yo husband with early dementia, decided to warm yesterday’s leftovers over the dinner I had cooking (all afternoon) in the slow cooker while I had a bath. 
I’m not sure if he thought I was not going to make dinner or just forgetful. I’m not even mad, 
It just makes me so so sad."
"Dad is 72. Was diagnosed 3 years ago but on set was probably a few years before that. 

My sister and I are his primary careers. He lives with her and I'm there every second day. We generally cope well. 

Recently he's started sleeping approx 2-4 hours a night. He'll go to bed exhausted and then instantly he's wide awake. He'll get out of bed every 5 mins- 1hr and yell until someone comes down to settle him. 

This has been going on now every night for 2 weeks. We can cope pretty well with everything else but this is unsustainable. How is not tied. We're both exhausted and he's fit and perky in the mornings. 


Any suggestions would be helpful.

"or some context, my grandmother has dementia and i live with her and have been her live-in caretaker for nearly two years now. my dad lives 8 hours away and visits a few times a year. 

6 months ago my grandmother approached me and told me she wanted to get her will changed, to leave the house 50% in my name and 50% in my dads name, so it couldnt be sold without both of our consents. i knew that this was going to be a problem, but she started expressing these concerns to me when my dad kept trying to convince us to renovate the house and move her to his state. i understood where she was coming from so i set the wheels in motion. well we met with the lawyer, got the stuff she wanted changed. 

my dads visiting for easter and he handed me the property taxes for the house, a bill that ive been paying for two years now, and its all of a sudden under his name after 50+ years of it being under my grandmothers. it lists him as the owner of the property. at first i didnt think anything of it, but i couldnt stop thinking about it, so after a few hours of fixating on it, i asked me dad how this could have happened. the tax collectors office wouldnt make a mistake like this. and my grandmother doesnt have the faculties to do this on her own. 

as soon as i brought it up to my dad he blew up. he gave me the middle finger 3+ times. started screaming and swearing and calling me names. (very incriminating, i know). i told him that logically it doesnt make sense for this to have happened wwithout him knowing about it and without my granmother signing something. she is very easily manipulated and would sign anything my dad put in front of hers. however, he told me he has no idea how this happened and is very offended that i accused him. 

well he told me he wrote me out of his will a few months ago. (i'm his only child and he is not married or has any siblings) because of what ""i"" did with grammies will. but thats besides the point 

am i crazy to think that there is something fishing going on here and does anyone have any idea how this could have happened?"
"I see tons of support groups for caregivers, but can't find any for patients. I think it would be good for my mom to talk to other people who also lose things, have to quit driving, get confused, have anxiety and don't know why, etc. I've seen one phone call group, but i don't think she can focus enough to get anything from a conference call. Has anyone seen a group (either video or in person) for patients? I'm in Texas."
"I don't know if anyone else is in a similar situation. I live in a different country than my family and haven't seen them in person for a while. About 4-5 years ago, my mother was diagnosed with dementia. My dad is taking care of her. As is pretty typical of his generation, he doesn't really talk about her condition or answer questions about how he is doing. My aunt recently wrote to me to say she is in decline and isn't recognizing people. The point of her letter was to get me to come visit, which is not going to happen for various reasons.

Anyways, my mother and I have always had a strained relationship. She has a lot of narcissistic tendencies and I was definitely her least favorite child. Our video calls always consist of her scowling and making rude comments - even before the dementia set in. Discussing our relationship was never possible. Due to her narcissistic behavior, she is not capable of admitting to being anything but a perfect mother.

Knowing that the disease is advancing has brought on some strong emotions for me. I guess I feel like I am mourning the fact that there is now no possibility of getting any sort of closure with her. I didn't have much hope she would apologize or listen to my side of things, but there was a sliver of hope. With her mental state deteriorating, there is no chance of that any more."
"Hey everyone. I just need a place to vent. So I’m a single childless woman in my 40s who moved in with my mother to care for her, which meant leaving behind my community of friends several states away. In addition to having dementia, my mom is also a narcissist. Since relocating to my mother’s, I’ve been busy managing her care while also trying to set up a life for myself: searching for jobs, trying to find social groups to join, trying to get enough exercise to support my mental & physical health. I hate being unemployed, I feel like such a loser, and it’s so draining to spend every day hunting for & applying for jobs. Anyhow. Friday was my birthday. I told myself I could have the day off from job searching and exercise and all the “to-do’s” I assign myself. I didn’t have any plans and I don’t have any friends here to celebrate with, but I at least wanted to be gentle and kind with myself. Of course my mother forgot my birthday. And I reminded her. And she went out to the drugstore and got me a Hallmark card and a bag of shitty chocolates. I know I shouldn’t have expected anything but it still made me so sad. I’ve sacrificed so much for her and I’m so lonely and have no idea what the hell I’m doing w my life other than caring for a thankless old lady and a dog. I ended up going for a hike on my birthday. It was fine. But when I pulled into the driveway of my mom’s house, I just sat in my car…contemplating what the point of it all is. Telling myself I did not want another birthday like this next year. Feeling just pretty hopeless and tired. Thought about not going on. I have a therapist who I see weekly, thank god for that. But otherwise I am completely alone, despite my efforts to meet people. There is no other family involved in my mom’s care. It’s just on me. I thought I’d reach out here because I’m sure at least some of you can relate. I’m sorry for such a long post. Thanks for reading."
"She is late stage dementia, speech is a word salad most of the time.  Already on Seroquel for past year and doing OK with that. Due to increased sundowning and wandering at night  added low dose Depakote sprinkles at lunch and dinner last Thursday. I visit everyday late afternoons and she seems to be responding good to the depakote, not wiped out like the first week with Seroquel.  

The crawling in bed with the caregiver only happens on weekends.  During the week it's a husband and wife team so no room in the bed I guess?  On the weekends it's two single ladies who each have their own rooms and mom always goes in with the one closer to her room.  The caregiver isn't upset and willing to work this out.  I'm hoping mom will start sleeping thru the night with the depakote, will give it a few weeks to see how things go.

I also understand her wanting to be close to someone. I'm there everyday 1-2 hours and I sit next to her, hip to hip, and touch her a lot. We go for little walks arm in arm, I do her nails or hair, and try to engage her as much as possible.  Yesterday we played outside with the bubble machine, picked some buds off the blooming oleanders and I drew a sidewalk Easter egg for her. She does have a baby doll that she carries all day but doesn't seem to mind abandoning at night! 

It's such a tough decision to medicate more, you don't want your loved one to be a zombie, but you don't want them spending their final days anxious, afraid and confused.  Locking her in her room is also not an option but I was wondering about a child gate?  When she lived in my backyard casita (up until last year) I had an interior screen door with a slid over the door handle that I'd shut & I put a sign on it that said 'Don't go outside at night'.  So it was never locked but she'd read the sign and stay inside.  (I did have a door sensor that notified me if she did open it.) 

Anybody have any ideas on reducing the night wandering or using child/safety gates?"
I'm at my wits end now I don't know what to do. My grandma (who lives with my uncle) has been wanting to do less and less and doing anything to her makes her scream her head off. I watch her whenever everyone else is either out busy doing something or working so I'm with her by myself. She won't talk without crying so no one can understand what she is saying and usually when she does talk normally she usually gets her words mixed up so it's still not understandable. She also has mobility issues so she only sits in her chair all day. I've tried to keep her busy with toys and stuff but she wants nothing to do with them. Simple chores like folding laundry to keep her mind busy sets her into a screaming frenzy. What's worse is taking her to the bathroom. Its impossible for me to make sure she gets her diaper changed every few hours because a lot of times when I try to get her up out of the couch she starts screaming and pushing herself back onto the couch. She's a little overweight (probably around 160) so picking her up isn't easy either. I know it's really bad for her but there's been times where I had to have her sit in a soaked diaper for 5 hours waiting for someone to show up and help me get her to the toilet because I couldn't do it by myself. I'm the only one who can really watch her because I'm the only person who can 1.I'm patient 2. Don't have any kids 3. Don't go to school 4. Don't have a job
"My bride of 50 years has been having memory problems for a number of years. We started her on memantine (Namenda) 7 or 8 years ago, and progression had been slow-ish until recently.  We were across the country visiting our son & family for the holidays when she experienced an event of some sort that left her unusually confused, but absent any stroke signs.  She seemed to bounce back quite a bit in the next few days, and we were able to fly home.  However since then her dementia has accelerated and she began to become delusional at times.  We have consulted with a neurologist who seems to think she has Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy, which is consistent with a diagnosis her sister received at a similar age.  We got an initial prescription from her PCP for mirtazapine, an antidepressant.  When that failed to provide much help we started her on small doses of quetiapine, an antipsychotic.  This seems to help quite a bit, although there’s still a fair amount of “going home” talk.

My guess is that she’s currently somewhere in the stage 5 or 6 area.  The neurologist recommended transition to a facility.  My sense (based on very little actual information) is that the professional class seems to favor early placement rather than later.

The reality is that our only son and his family live across the country.  Up until now we’ve been able to go visit them several times each year.  Naturally they would like us to move near them.  One problem is that there is no way I could manage a move while continuing as full time caregiver.  But if the long term plan is to move, is it realistic to think I could place her in a facility here and then move her across the country in, say, a year?"
"Anyone have any tips on how to get the smell out of the mattress? Grandmother peed bed and didnt know until I checked 30 minutes later. Saw wet spot went close and felt wetness kn the carpet. Anyone have tips on how to get pee smell from the mattress?

She is still in the bed and refuses to get out. My nearest help either isnt coming right now or is supposedly too busy (grandfather retired and in pasture)

Mother is on her way but 15 minutes away and need to get ready."
"It's heart breaking, the prognosis of the disease was so fast in the last year. She is 77 now, symptoms started in 2014,it's been 8 years but in the last year she lost the ability to walk, talk and eat alone. My aunt takes care of her. I visit her every 2 weeks, and I can notice that her condition is ditoraiting at a fast rate. In the past month alone, she couldn't sit straight, we must support her with pillows on both sides, and food should be delivered crushed or liquid. She also hurts her self, her hand was badly injured (we still can't figure how). She is definitely in the last stage dementia, however I found conflicting information on the average duration of this stage."
"Let me start off by saying that while I do not care for a family member with dementia, I do spend a lot of my week with it. I'm a caregiver with Home Instead Senior Care so I go into a lot of people's homes to give respite care to families and help dementia patients go about their day.

A few days ago I had the amazing opportunity to see Teepa Snow at a seminar as part of training for work. I have been at my job for almost 4 years and I came out of there knowing so much more than I learned in this years. She was truly brilliant and engaging and easy to follow.

I highly recommend anyone who is around dementia to look up her videos and resources.

And remember that you are doing an amazing job! It is not an easy path. When I'm done with a shift I get to walk away. Most of you don't have that luxury. You will have good days and bad days. You will have mini victories and days where you just shake your head and want to cry. You are not alone on this journey. We are here to help and support you!"
"So, my members of my family have been keeping things from us relating to my grandma with Dementia.So that when happens at our house we’re taken aback by it.  I really hate all this secrecy BS because it’s unhealthy to do so and now my mom is playing this BS game of keep away(she got mad for asking my cousin about the situation)This bothers me because my grandma actually attacked my mom a couple months back and we found out later that she had done the same thing to another relative. I’m just so sick of this AND this relative is dangerously in denial…I try to empathize but I can’t do it anymore"
"Before my mom's dementia, she was sober for 20-something years. Clean from alcohol or any substances. With this dementia diagnosis and even a bit before diagnosis but presenting symptoms, she began drinking again. 

It is so incredibly difficult to see her slip back into her alcoholism and she has a major weed addiction. I know plenty of people will say you cant be addicted to weed, but she absolutely is. She'll steal money from us family members to buy it, she'll sneak out and hide it around the house, cry, beg, etc. for it. Just now she's threatening all of us with hurting herself if we won't buy her weed and alcohol.

Her doctors say she cant have weed, she has a really bad heart and lungs, she shouldn't be having coffee either but she's stubborn as all hell and refuses to change.

I guess i just want to know if anyone is experiencing similar things? Has anyone else seen a parent with dementia fall back into their addictions?"
"I can't seem to find the right way to search to see if this is something that is well known and it's not something I've found in reading yet, but I wanted to share one sign that I've now come to see that I missed earlier on. (That whole hindsight thing y'all, it's really a hard hitter with dementia decline, isn't it?) Is this something any of y'all have seen? 

About a year ago, my mom started telling me that she was worried about my *stepdad*, that his mind was going, and she was scared for the future because of it. This was before I'd cued in that *she* was starting down the path at all, and it didn't really strike me as much to worry about, as my stepdad is 83 to my mom's 72, so it wasn't something that sounded all that left field to think that his memory might be going. 

But I wish now that I'd talked to my stepdad in some way about that; that was an early sign that her mind was slipping that I missed. 

The main reason I wish I'd said something to him then is for **HIM**. I've spent a lot of time with him in the last month now and he's as sharp as he ever was, save repeating himself a bit. (And to that: he's also handling a LOT since my mom fell and has been in rehab that he's not used to handling, and I've been doing the same thing honestly just trying to keep everything straight in helping him - my husband has said ""Yep, you told me that already"" at least a dozen times in the last week.)

But he's still very sharp. He just hadn't realized what was happening with her; he was too close to it. 

One of the conversations I've had with him since her fall (that escalated everything) is how he actually thought he *had* been doing things wrong and he just thought he was doing dumb things that made her mad so when she would get super agitated with him he just felt bad. It broke me when he said that and he teared up trying to tell me that; for at least a year now he's been struggling thinking he was screwing things up, when really, it's been her. I feel so rotten than he's had to endure that - they've been together for almost 40 years and he loves her so much and to think that he'd been facing that alone and not knowing it wasn't his fault just hurts my soul.   


I know there's not a lot of good wallowing in what I could have done or said, but that one's gonna stick with me I think. I guess I'm partially saying this as a ""here's something you might see"" sort of thing too. Apologies if it's well known -- I'm learning a LOT right now but I haven't mastered it all yet. 

Thanks so much y'all for hearing me out, and for being here. This sub is partially responsible for my ability to hold my shit together right now; I thank all of you strangers for being kind folks silently all the time."
"I really don't know where else to say anything about this.  I'm not looking for sympathy.  I've had a couple doctors say that I may (no actual testing yet) have the beginnings of early onset dementia.

I'm a 54 (and a half!) year old male.  I'm not married, but I've been with the same woman for 18 years.  

I have a degree in Accounting/Computer Information Systems, but haven't worked in those areas in many years.  In 2016 I went back to school and got a degree in Culinary Arts, graduating magna cum laude, while also studying Brewing and Software Development.  I also have not worked in food service in many years.  

I started to notice a problem when I was in a biology class and a Java programming class.  I couldn't remember any of what was taught, especially when it came to tests.  It's not a problem with testing, just a complete loss of information.  I ended up dropping out of both of those classes.  There was one programming class which I completed with a 4.0, but have literally no idea what was taught anymore.  Since most of the culinary classes were hands-on, I was able to muddle through, but still had problems remembering techniques and I became less enthusiastic about it.

I notice that I have less problems when I wake up, but as the day goes on, I have problems finding my words (sundowning).  When I went to bed last night, I couldn't even think of the word 'dementia.'  I could think of 'senility' and others which I can't remember now (surprise!), but 'dementia' took at least half an hour to come to mind.

I don't hold a typical job.  I work as my partner's caregiver, as she has many medical issues.  We get by with a stipend which I get quarterly and her disability and alimony.  This means that I am technically at work 24/7 with no vacations and the worst type of boss.

It seems like my memory problems revolve around what I've taken in over the last five years or so.  A week ago I was able to tell my partner off the top of my head a bunch of stuff about an old Simpsons episode, including the title and a bunch of other stuff.  No problem there.  But something like the word mirepoix from cooking 101 (2 parts onion, 1 part carrot, 1 part celery), I just had to look up the name, and it isn't the first time.

I've had problems with depression most of my life and I am currently seeing a psychiatrist and taking meds.  I've gone to psychologists and therapists and the like for many years.  Suicidal ideation has been an issue for quite a long time, and presented itself as a solution to this current problem, as I doubt that this situation is going to get better and I don't want to become a strain in the end.  I've had an MRI on my head for headaches, which showed nothing.  Well, there was a brain in there, but no physical damage.  The headaches are just a symptom of stress, it is assumed.

I don't have any children, but I have ""adopted"" my partner's adopted 30-year-old daughter as my own step-kid.  

I'm not sure if this is a side effect of everything, but over the last couple of months, all my body wants to do is sleep.  I've been working with my shrink to tweak my medications to see if that's the problem, but it hasn't seemed to change anything.  I've been up 3 hours and could fall right back asleep if I allowed myself.

That's all I can think of for now.  I have to take the doggo for a walk because he keeps bugging me.

Y'all have y'allselves a great day!"
"My wife just entered a memory care community a week ago (see “After 5 years…) and their policy is to have no visitors for about 14 days, which I totally understand , and based on two phone calls, agree with. 

Now I’m looking for suggestions and thoughts on that first visit. Of course, there’ll be the “I want to go home”, etc. How can I beat handle those? What’s been your experiences in this situation?

Thanks to all."
"My MiL is barely eating.  We've been letting her (read: giving up fighting her about it) eat toast during the day (because we are not with her then and it's all she would eat, even if we, or the carers, prepare her anything). But she has tea with us every evening. She usually eats a small portion of whatever I prepare for her (I do her a separate dish to us, old fashioned 'traditional' English food). But just lately she is only eating 1 or 2 mouthfuls before announcing she is full.

She is looking a lot more frail, which I assume is nutrition related. I have tried making tea earlier, making tea later, going for stuff where she cleared the plate previously! Nothing is working.

She does seem to be eating some biscuits and sweets during the day (not many, but that in it's self is unusual). She has never eaten much of anything. She admits she is never hungry, but won't talk about it. She says if she didn't have to she wouldn't eat because she doesn't enjoy eating, never has. She also always thinks we have just eaten (as in, she think we had lunch recently).

I don't think it's about my cooking. and I make the type of dishes my FiL used to cook her. I go for soft and easy to eat foods (She has dentures).

Any suggestions for what to try her with? (Currently I give her Shepherds pie, fish cakes, fish fillets, pasties, mac & cheese, jacket potato's).  


**Edit -** The responses have shocked me. You all feel its quite significant and bad news. I wasn't prepared for that. I think I need a bit of time to get used to this. Ty for the helpful suggestions.  


**Edit #2** \- No more 'end stage' comments please. She isn't end stage. She looks after herself all day, she has never had a fall, she uses full sentences, can discuss her interests, dresses herself, can use the phone, can operate a TV remote, etc. ""one swallow doesn't make a summer"" (Pun intended)  


I will try less bland food. "
Anyone done this? Did it help you or your lo? Did you keep it hidden/secret?
"My father, 79yo with pretty severe dementia got several bedsores at a hospital back on Jan, this year. The ones on his heels (!!) are slowly improving (one is almost closed/healed), the other not so good but getting smaller weekly. 

The one at his sacrum is stage 3 now (into the muscle?). He has a wound dr that sees him weekly and nurses at his rehab facility do bandage changes daily. Depending on who I ask, this wound is large and ""pretty bad"". Not infected, just a large area and deep apparently.

I've been too afraid to look as I think I won't be able to ""un-see"" it afterwards. This is really traumatic for me already and I'm trying to safeguard myself :( 

Can anyone tell me about theirs, or their LO's, experience with one in that area? It seems like ANY position would be painful. Have any of you experienced improvement or healing with wounds like this? Is their any advice, encouraging words, etc...?

He is not currently mobile or else standing/walking would be the obvious move to take pressure off. We have been waiting months for heels to heal enough to allow weight to be put on his feet! 

Thanks"
"I’ve been grieving mom’s dementia for several weeks now and recently I had a moment of grace where I thought the following.

Mom isn’t gone.  She’s still here.  But the parts that aren’t have ascended to a higher level.  Call it heaven, soul, nirvana, enlightenment etc.  she gets confused because she’s beyond the world I live in.  It’s not that she’s losing it.  I’m 44 and if you put me in a group of teenagers, chances are I wouldn’t understand much of their dialogues and dynamics, because I’m no longer a teen.  So it makes sense that if I partially moved beyond this world that things would be off for me.   Honestly I am excited to be exposed to her world more.  Today I overheard her talking about the color of the trees swirling.  That sounds beautiful.  I realized this evening that I fully believe this to be fact and with that i have acceptance and am no longer traumatized in grief."
My mom has been rapidly declining over the past few months and it’s getting to the point  where I get frustrated because I don’t know what she’s saying. I really try to understand what she means but it just doesn’t make any sense. I’m trying my best not to get discouraged since I know this is a clear indicator of her alzheimer’s getting worse. Does anyone have any advice on how to have a conversation and not get frustrated? Thanks in advance!
"My parents live on a large piece of land that slopes down. Lots of vegetation. It gets slippery. Dad enjoys moving rocks from one spot to another. He can do this for hours. 

It would probably be ok if the ground was flat. It would probably be ok if he was steady on his feet. But a month ago it looked like he wrestled with some thorny branches and the wounds on his legs got infected. I’m talking green puss infection surrounded by bright red skin. 

A visiting nurse was sent because we couldn’t get him to the doctor. He refused to get in the car. He also wouldn’t stay out of the back area of the house. There’s a gate halfway. My brother and I bought locks and chains. He was able to break the gate hinge  off the fence. 

We fixed it again made it more secure and hid anything that he could potentially use to break through.

This morning he began a tirade directed towards my brother. Then he grabbed my brother by the front of his shirt and began screaming in his face. 

He has threatened to slash the tires on the car. The other day I caught him just before he swung a metal pipe at the windshield of my rental car. 

He regularly tells me to go to hell. Said he doesn’t have a daughter anymore, says I’m the devil.

And here is the heartbreaking part…he has started to force himself on my Mom. She even bought him his own bed and set it up in the main living room area. I know he has dementia but this is abuse. 

I don’t know what to do. I leave next week and the guilt of leaving is tearing me up. I’ve been here 3 weeks. He needs more care than what he’s getting. 

In February he fell 3 times in the span of a week. I can’t keep flying here - this is my 3rd trip in a year. 

Just venting really."
"Looking to vent but also see if anyone has been in this situation. My dad (68) is adamant that he is healthy and doing just fine, but obviously that's not true. He is barely functioning from day to day and is just scraping by in life while living alone. I often hear all about how my siblings and I keep on visiting and abandoning him (not true, we live across the country but have local family members we rely on), people are always ""in and out"" of his house, and he has been talking about those who have passed like they are here. He thinks I live down the street, and has reverted to talking about ""his wife"" who he divorced over 20 years ago and previously hated. All this is to say that he is often confused, talking about things that never happened.

Dad is simply DONE with doctors. This was an attitude he had before we noticed the signs of dementia. I contacted his doctor a year ago to explain what we were seeing. He found out and thought I was incredibly out of line and lying. This was the nail in the coffin for him getting medical help. It is listed in his records that he does not want to pursue any help with his cognition (I have access to his account). The MRI is showing large dead spots, including a big chunk of his cerebrum. He is suffering from vascular dementia, but smokes a pack a day, doesn't eat, and is no longer taking his meds. But he is FINE and everything is GOOD and he is just so BUSY all the time living his life! He doesn't want help, doesn't need it, and will get incredibly nasty if you overstep and make it impossible to help. We have been noticing a decline for almost 5 years.

We are now at the point where it is completely unsafe for him to be driving and living alone. The other night he thought his phone was broken and went out looking for a pay phone, which he didn't find obviously. We're very lucky he ""found"" a convenience store he frequents, and the owner helped him contact us. He is going to start a fire with his cigarettes. He is unsteady on his feet and is falling; refuses to even entertain the idea of a cane. I have no idea if he is still on blood thinners, but he is still bleeding everywhere with the smallest cut. We are in a precarious situation where SOMETHING is going to happen, and god forbid it affects anyone else. 

Any ideas on how we can navigate this? If we send a caregiver over, he WILL turn them away. He will not sign any POA papers. He will not give up his license, and I'm not sure he would even respond to a notice to come in and get tested at the DMV. He will not move to an assisted home. He is answering his phone less and less. And if any of us kids take him in or move in, he will not listen to rules like ""you cannot chain smoke in the house"" because he believes he is justified to do what he wants, when he wants. He will not allow family members to check on him. Couldn't even get him to go to the doctor with a trusted friend. Many family members have talked to him nicely, I've cried to him, brothers have yelled at him. Can't kill him with kindness, but also can't force him to do what's necessary."
"My 68yo dad was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease around 8 years ago. He had to retire from his main job but I think he is still quite active. I live quite far away from him. He has issues with short-term memory and comprehending complex things. He lives alone but has a girlfriend who lives in a neighboring town. Their relationship is awful and they seem to fight whenever they have contact. She's a pretty horrible person and I don't know why they have stayed ""together"". He has always been quite narcissistic and psychologically abusive to his girlfriend and also previously towards my mother (physically and psychologically). We have never had a close relationship and he was not really involved in my upbringing, except when I used to visit him as a child for school holidays.

During the past couple of years he has been through some periods of really dementia-ish behavior but probably more delerium, like night-time anxiety and calling at crazy hours like after midnight, freaking out because he is having normal (?worsening) Parkinson's symptoms. He hadn't been taking his melatonin and wasn't sleeping well. That seems to have settled down. He frequently fails to take his Parkinson's medications on-time. It's probably partly forgetfulness and partly denial / not thinking he needs to. He will often wait until his symptoms get bad which is then too late. He says he sees a different doctor each time he visits the medical practice but I still think he would have been advised about the importance of taking the meds regularly and on time regardless of current symptom severity. He has dyskinesia now (involuntary movements). He won't allow anyone to accompany him to the doctor.

He has generally refused home help even though he does not cook - his kitchen doesn't even have an oven and his girlfriend says he won't even microwave himself something. He just eats out for every meal, basically, or goes to his girlfriend's house. He does not use the pill boxes we bought for him to carry his meds so that he has some pills handy in all the places he goes such as the car, his home, his girlfriend's home, and previously his work briefcase. Back in around 2018 I had to write to his doctor about his driving as people from his church noticed him driving home late at night, weaving all over the road ""as if he was drunk"". He passed his driving test anyway. For years his teeth have looked terrible and he clearly wasn't brushing. When I visited him I saw a very old, mangled-looking toothbrush in the bathroom when I had recently ordered groceries for him which included a new toothbrush. When I asked him where it was he said he had already used it up and thrown it away (clearly not true as the one he had there looked ancient). Years ago I ordered him some assistive aids for Parkinson's such as buttoning loops/hooks to help with doing up buttons, key and tap turners, a Liftware spoon which compensates for tremor movements, etc. He has stashed all these things under the bed and they have never been opened.

My sibling and I have really tried to help in many ways over the years, like trying to help him fix issues with his home that for some reason he hasn't been able to organise himself, and arrange an assessment for in-home services but it didn't really go well and his doctors don't seem interested in assessing his cognitive function. If you call or write to them they regard you as a controlling family member and nobody has any power to make him get assessed, so nothing happens. Everyone gives lip service to ""early diagnosis"" being important but nobody ever actually seems to want to assess for or diagnose dementia. I have also found this in my work life (I work in health). We have kind of given up. When we have tried to make suggestions and help him in the past he's become combative and mean and we have never really had a close relationship anyway. I feel a bit guilty for not picking up every time he calls but I cannot for my own sanity.

He has been calling me quite often, not every night but sometimes consecutive nights in a row depending on what's going on at the time. For the past year-and-a-half, I would guess that his calls to me are averaging once every 2 days but he will often call me multiple times in one day. I have a child to look after and I don't like talking to him. He always expects me to stroke his ego and repeats the same things, wants to talk about his time in the Army and asks me about my life which I don't really want to share because he then blabs things to my other abusive family members. In the past we have never really had frequent phone calls and it just feels inappropriate and weird now. It's just awkward and unpleasant for me and a chore, and he will go on and on and not understand that my child needs me. Talking to him is draining and he still treats me like I am a child (I'm 38). He always wants to bitch about other family members, evaluate everyone's life-choices and talk about himself. I still feel like I have to do what he wants because of how authoritarian he was when I was a kid (and still is). I understand that in his situation he's isolated and trying to hold on to his dignity and self-respect and wants to feel heard and relevant like his opinions matter, and I do do that for him sometimes. Often he will call under the pretense of ""seeing how I am going"" and put on this excessive fake concern about me when he has never really asked or cared in the past because he has had better things to do and I find it really uncomfortable.

I don't really know what I want with this post, maybe just support? I just needed to vent about how frustrating the situation is and how sometimes you can't really do anything. He has lots of acquaintances, goes to church, has always been very extroverted, even forcefully so with people. He kind of pressures people to be his friend and talk to him. He is a skilled manipulator and good at appearing to be a ""great guy"" who everyone likes but deep-down he is very self-centred and does not feel remorse when he is abusive towards others. He will never apologise for his actions and is now more prone to emotional outbursts if you try to hold him accountable for things he says or does.

Just wondering if anyone else has a similar situation and anything that's been helpful? Basically I understand he's lost many outlets including his work and a significant amount of function (eg., he doesn't drive much now), and expects me to fill in the blanks for him. He is involved with the local returned serviceman's club and has reconnected with his old Army mates. I think that at times he just gets ""the fear"" and wants/needs to be talked down, but I can't do that for him every time he wants it. It does seem like a bit of a transition into him being more childlike."
"Title says it all. We’ve known for over 2 years something was wrong. Thanks to my mom and her stubbornness, now we have a diagnosis. Prognosis is bad. I’m devastated and heartbroken. Me (33F), my sister (42F) and my mom (65F) are his support system, but both my sister and I have been living away from home for +10 years. 

Advice and/or kind words would be appreciated."
"My mom (67) has been showing signs of dementia for the past 5 years and ever since her mom died July 2021 the deterioration has been rapid. I don't feel like I can take care of her. For my mental health I am planning on moving out sometime with all the right measures in place so she is safe but boy do I feel like a shitty daughter. She's been in denial of these issues for the entirety of showing symptoms and has never been checked out properly. Before the dementia she was also extremely emotionally abusive and neglectful (narcissist). I lose my cool so easily over small things because it all just feels so unfair. Why should I now have to fill in this caregiver role when she was never a caregiver to me as a young child? Why is it that I say something she doesn't like I start receiving endless hurtful ultimatums, name calling, etc. I could go on of course but there really isn't any point. On top of that I'm not working so I don't feel like I have much going for me, fear resenting her for having to take a large pause on my life, and face her deteriorated decision making skills, long-term & short-term memory, inability to do simple tasks, etc. It's all just so fucking sad. I love her and hate to see her like this. She can't help it and I know it's only going to get worse. I know that this will be the hardest thing I have to face and it's also hard not knowing anyone my age who has gone through something similar. I feel so envious of my peers lives. I wish I could just focus on myself and not worry so much or have so much responsibility. The day to day interactions with her are the hardest. My patience has run so so thin and I snap so much and she doesn't deserve that! None of this is fair for anyone, and I am so tired. Grieving sucks and I wonder if it will get any easier."
"I'm not even sure how to ask about this. 

Short-ish version:

I want to know if it's OK to have my mom over to *her own house* for holidays. 

My only experience with this sort of thing is with my spouse's family situation. With their family, they do not let the grandma go to her old house any more. She gets upset and doesn't want to leave. I was told by my wife not to bring my mom back to her old home, as it would cause trouble or upset her like how her grandma got upset. Both my wife's grandma and my mom have to go back to their nursing homes each day, so they can't stay at their old homes. They both have Alzheimer's, but it hasn't progressed so far for them not to remember their old houses. 

Long version: 

My mother is in skilled nursing / memory care. I sometimes take her out to places for lunch, ice cream, or go shopping. I have to make sure to get her back to the nursing home every time, because it's important for her to always take her scheduled medicine (and have nurses available around the clock). 

She still owns her house, and I've been taking care of it for years.

Since she hasn't been there in a long time, most of her possessions are gone, things have been fixed up, some rooms have been repainted, there are new appliances, and the yard looks different. I basically tried fixing it up, just in case we had to sell it to pay for my mom's care. 

Well, Medicaid took care of things, and they said that we can keep the house. 

So then we had this nice house, all fixed up. We have been wanting to do more things there. We did Halloween there, and we want to do Easter over there. My wife and I have been looking into selling our house for a while (since before my mom went into memory care), so it actually works out well for us to stay at my mom's house. I talked to my mom about this already,
and she thought it would be a good idea for me to stay there to make sure it was taken care of. 

I was thinking about getting my mom for Easter and having her join us, but I don't know if that is a good idea. I don't want to make her upset. I would also feel real guilty about doing stuff with family but not have my mom there at her own house. 

But I'm afraid that she might see her old house and not want to leave. Or maybe she will see her old house, realize how much of it has changed and get really upset. It's also possible that she won't remember the house at all. 

Has anyone else been in a situation like this?"
"As incredibly difficult as a journey that this has been, I know I’ve given it my all, and I have no regrets. 

My heart is heavy right now but I also feel happiness and joy that her fight and struggles will soon be over. 

You have all been so amazing and I am forever grateful for this group. I will continue to be here for others that may just be starting their journey even when ours is over. 

Thank you all!

Update: Mom got her wings yesterday and thank the Lord she’s free from that horrid disease! Thank you again for all the wonderful support! She’s at peace now and yes I’m sad- but I’m mostly relieved for her."
"So many emotions. Sometimes the most beautiful moments in the world then suddenly your hit by like a semi with some of the most brutal things you can see, experience, and have told to you directly. I love my residents but my heart broke today after being told I’m a worthless pile of shit and should thrown my self off the nearest bridge. I absolutely know that is not who they are, and under normal circumstances they would most likely never speak like that. I misdirect, put on everyone’s favorite Elvis, and help calm them down from what ever it is they are going through… but it still hurts man.

All you need is love

Edit: thank you for all the love, I don’t normally have any issues with what I’m told but I need to develop better Teflon emotions and let what they say slide off me and give them all the love in the world."
"Hi there!
I hope you all are doing well!  Recently, I was approached by a few people asking how to navigate medical care and hospital stay without frustration.  I am thinking of starting a project to teach everything I know about this, given my insider perspective as a physician who takes care of a lot of patients with dementia. Would you or someone you know be interested in learning this?

If so, please kindly reply YES so I know whether it’s worth spending time on.

Thank you much!

Leslie"
"My grandmother has both dementia and diabetes. She is late stage dementia. Hard for her to understand what we are saying as we say it. None of her sentences make any since. She is very childlike at this point. She likes candy and dying eggs so we are going to dye eggs. 

What could I put for a gift basket thing for easter? Ofc it would have candy (not sugar free since it upsets her stomach) what other stuff could I put in a basket for her?"
"I stumbled on this 1-hour documentary this weekend and wanted to  share with you all. It's a former CNN reporter who is now in her 80s and  has the APOE-e4 gene and wanted to know how likely she is to get  the disease. It's informative, busts some myths that I certainly held  about the genetics and avoidance of the disease, and funny at times as  she uses her love of 50s b-movie horror flicks to help tell the story!

Anyway, if you get a chance check it out on YouTube.

"She was able to get out via an alarmed door, which apparently didn’t sound, get past reception, out the front door and walked up a super busy street to a grocery store 1/2 mile away!  The street is almost a highway with. 3 lanes of traffic on each side.

I don’t know all of the details yet but clearly this is not acceptable.  My relative always wants to leave and has been a flight risk for a while, so it’s nothing new.  

My relative doesn’t even know the area surrounding their facility.  

I’m so angry that this could happen.  My family is paying a ton of money to keep them safe and this happens.  They could have been hurt or killed.

What would you do if it was your loved one?"
"There seems to be a serious lack of accessible technologies for seniors, especially ones with tremors and vision problems, etc. Are there specific accessible technologies you guys use to video call with them?"
"So I live with a couple people one of them were pretty sure has dementia but not properly diagnosed the other one he is just a complete fucking idiot   


Both of them try to 'help' by doing the dishes which doesnt help at all and mostly causes more issues   


One of them literally cannot see what he is doing with the dishes nor has the physical strength to scrub the shit off the dishes so basically anything he 'washes' goes straight back in the sink   


The other one decides that running the hot water and filling the sink for very literally two bowls and a couple cups is a worthwhile use of time water and heating which is wasteful at the best of times but especially you know current global situation price of heating and all that especially when half the time he fills the sink with hot water and just walks off to let the water go cold   


Both of them tend to drop things and just generally clumsy which yea dont really want broken glass all over the kitchen especially considering they dont say anything when they drop something   


Ive tried saying do not do the dishes I will do them but neither listen ive tried being nice ive tried being firm but nothing changes   


So is there some kind of lock I can use to prevent the hot water from being turned on   


Unfortunately we have a combination tap so its not like i could just disconnect one like I could do in the bathroom   


Preferably any solution would just affect the hot water side not the cold water because I dont exactly want to be getting woken up at 4am because they want a glass of water   


So is there any product designed to slip over the knob and lock it because the only things i could find are for outside hosepipe outlets not sink taps or is there some way i could just jerryrig it"
"My dad likes to mess with any electronic device he can get his hands on (TV remote, landline, etc). We can usually mitigate the problem by unplugging/removing the batteries. E.g. we have a spare remote with no batteries and he is content with that. Now he keeps changing the settings on the central heating. I ask him if he's feeling cold but he says no. 

 The control unit is mounted on the wall, which he can easily reach. This morning I found it set to 32C (90F). There's no easy way to stop him getting at the controls.  Any ideas on what to do?"
"My grandmother is starting to experience some early signs, but nothing preventing her from living independently. Her car is broken and in the shop. I work from home and my car is the same model as hers, just a few years older, so she asked to borrow mine to do some errands. No problem, she’s never had any issues with driving before.

While she was at the drug store, she put my keys down on the counter. Someone else must have put theirs next to mine, and when she went to pick up my keys, she thought both sets were mine and the keyring had somehow come undone. She took both sets, left, put them together so they were all together, and gave them back to me once I got off of work. When I realized what had happened, it was already closed for the day. So I am going to call first thing in the morning to ask if anyone reported a missing pair of keys. I also recruited my mother to post on Facebook about them. 

Have anyone else’s relatives done this while early on? I’m hoping whoever got their keys swiped is understanding."
"i guess i don't really have a point with this post but i just had like a semi-normal conversation with my dad. he wasn't having any hallucinations, and he tried his best to listen to what i said, and we laughed at a stupid joke i made. then he went to the bathroom and came back out and that part of him was gone again. we didn't spend a lot of time together when i was younger, he was always at work trying to provide for me and my mom so i rarely saw him. i don't know where i'm going with this, i just wish we had more time together back then. hugs to all of you, dementia really sucks :("
"MY 75 year old father has dementia. Not sure what type, but the whole family is having a reunion next month and I've been designated the ""responsible adult"" to take care of him. It's a 6 hour car ride to the ""vacation"" spot and I will be expected to look after him the entire time. Keeping track of keys/wallet/other stuff.  

I'm not ready for my dad to have this. Like January he was perfectly fine, and now....WTF do I do? He thinks my sister is me, thinks that his sister is due soon to pick him u0p for the reunion.  If he calls me by my sister or stepmom's names, do I correct him or what?  I'm so...unprepared."
"I am so frustrated. 

My dad (62M) has vascular dementia and is cared for solely by my mom (61F) in their home. They can’t afford in-home help (which their insurance barely pays for) or assisted living (which it won’t cover at all). Although he is incontinent, can’t take his meds on his own, falls regularly, and can’t independently shower or use the bathroom, he is deemed too independent for nursing-home-care coverage by their insurance or Medicaid. 

He is currently in the hospital for sepsis, acute kidney injury, pancreatitis, and an infected pressure sore. My mom has taken diligent care for him for almost a decade, but his condition has deteriorated, and it’s just too much for her now. We were both hoping this hospital stay would lead to rehab and eventual admission to a nursing home. 

But my dad is showtiming and seems to have the ever-rotating cast of providers fooled. They even judged his ability to transfer from his wheelchair (he’s an amputee) to the toilet an 11 out of 13. But when he’s at home, he almost always falls doing that maneuver alone. 

In the hospital, he’s claiming to have no nausea, no pain. But he’s done nothing but complain about nausea and abdominal pain for a week. And his test results support that. 

They’re going to end up sending him home with her, aren’t they? She’s going to kill herself caring for him. I mean, he outweighs her by 50 pounds. This is madness. 

This has happened before. In the hospital and rehab? “I want to walk again! I want to wear my prosthesis!” Real life: I have literally never seen the man wear his prosthesis. Ever."
"The title says it all. My mom, 81, and I am her son and primary care giver. We do have a part time caregiver that helps and showers her on the days she comes by (twice weekly) but on the days she cannot her has other commitments, I have one hell of a time getting her to shower. Any ideas?"
"She turned 82, and she had no idea it was her birthday or how old she is. She kept forgetting, and every time we gave her a card or she received a phone call with birthday wishes, we had to remind her that it was her special day. 

I hate that I dreaded it.  I'm so tired, depressed, and, anxious that I put in minimum effort.  A card, a small cake, a couple of sets of PJ's.  I hate that I was cranky with her when she insisted on spending every single minute with me - it's getting to the point where I have to hide in the bathroom AND SHE WILL STILL KNOCK ON THE DOOR while I'm in there.  I need so much space from her and it felt shitty wanting it on her birthday.

The thing is, I'm pretty sure that this will either be her last birthday ever or, the last one that she will be even able to talk and understand anything said to her.  Her decline is happening so quickly now I'm absolutely certain next year she'll be in skilled nursing because I can't do this much longer and I won't have the skillset needed to care for her.

Sorry for the word vomit, I know I'm all over the place, I just need to get it OUT.  I hate my life right now, and I feel terrible complaining because it's so much worse for her, and all I can think about is how I wish I could have my life and sanity back.  

Thanks for listening.  I needed to vent.  I'm glad I have therapy today."
"My dad is having a rough go of it lately. Just having these bouts of aggression and attacking people. Apparently he is looking for his mom who died many years ago. He’s hitting staff and patients. We keep adjusting his 
 meds but nothing changes. Last night he was admitted to the hospital and he smacked me and my bf a couple times, although not hard. The doctor there suggested that his dementia has progressed to the point that he needs skilled nursing. But the Alf is trying to argue that he just needs more med adjustment and he will fine even though he is upsetting all their residents. 

I’m just lost and the only one making this decision. It also doesn’t help that I’m in a massive fibromyalgia flare and it’s hard to function, much less be a person right now."
"I found an online group program with a therapist that takes Medicare and PPOs that's just for caregivers. It;s starting in 2 weeks all online. I called them to enroll (I have Cigna), and I'm excited to start soon. I think they may take other states now I forgot to ask but I wanted to share it with you all to help you find some extra support if you need it.

The lady I spoke to was really nice.

Maybe I'll see you in the Zoom???

"Hello, it’s my first time here and this will be quite a read. But I ask you kindly to help. We are at a loss. 

I will start with all the basic information. 
We have a family member who suffers from dementia, she’s 88 years old, lives on her own, and in poor health. Mentally, atleast. We live in a big house, in a flat above hers but we do not get along at all. She was always rude and obnoxious even when not demented, but now it has only gotten worse. We are her only family left, she is the grandma of my mom. So in this house there is my mom, dad, me, my little brother and our great grandma (the demented lady). 
She refuses any kind of medication, we’re constantly at the doctors begging to do something because we can’t control her (it’s illegal). She goes out on her own, is in constant dispute with neighbours, calling the police 5x a day, getting into fights, getting lost, she is rude to us, screams at us, threatening us to leave her house. She’s very, very ill. And yet there is nothing we can do. 

I am a nurse, I started noticing the symptoms a long time ago, and notifyed her doctor. But there is nothing we or they could do. They gave her medications, had the talk with her, so did I and my mom. We tried to get her to a psychologist, but she refuses to go anywhere, getting worse each day. She talks with herself most nights, we can’t sleep. 

So now I am turning to you, reddit, I don’t know how to give her medication so she won’t notice because if she won’t take them, she will most likely go insane. She doesn’t want to talk to us and won’t listen. I don’t know what to do anymore. We also don’t share a kitchen so we can’t put it in her food. What else is there left to do? Where do I go and who do I turn to? Our medical system doesn’t allow us to forcefully take her anywhere, so there is nothing much we can do. 

Thank you for your time."
"Dear community,

I am posting with a lot of hope here having exhausted all other sources. I am working on my thesis on dementia (Alzheimer’s, FTD, DLB, any type) in India. It’s been a tough journey finding and speaking with family-based caregivers (like spouses, children, or daughter-in-law/son-in-law) who look after relatives with dementia. There are over 5 million people suffering from dementia in India, yet the “log kya kahenge” syndrome that riddles our society only compounds the silent suffering of the caregiver. Today sucked even more because my faculty has written off my work stating that with my current sample size, they feel I am unable to back the conclusions I have derived. There are people going into depression owing to caregiving - the least we can do is build a safe space for them to share their problems. My study wishes to identify the roadmap for caregiver empathy. 

If you or someone in your network in India is going through dementia then please feel free to dm me or leave a comment below. You can also help by spreading the word around.

I’d be super grateful for your support!

Kind regards

P.S. Mod, I hope you'll permit this post."
"My mom is in AL for a few weeks now. She has moderate dementia, with moments if lucidity but she’s not really self sufficient. The facility is good but sometimes when I come trash has built up, things aren’t in their place (she has a tendency to pull things from her closet and put them around her room), non trash things are in the trash, the tv remote is lost, etc… and I have to spend some time “resetting” everything to a good state. She hasn’t taken advantage of AL facility activities, just hangs in her room watching tv. She seems relatively content but the longer I stay away the more disoriented she seems to get and the more calls I get from her about things she can’t figure out that she forgets she can ask staff about (like tv, temperature).

I’ve been visiting daily but it doesn’t feel sustainable. That said, I’m not seeing how I could be away for too many days. Was hoping to learn more about how others approach these situations."
"My MiL was widowed 10 months ago, is undiagnosed (due to ""hating doctors"") but very clearly has some form of dementia (She repeats questions, asks where FiL is, etc etc). She's had it for at least 5 years. She lives alone (because that's what she wants and is safe to do so, with some adaptions), but we pick her up every day on the way home from work and she has tea with us.

Every day without fail she says ""it's going to rain"" or similar and will comment on it repeatedly, because she thinks its so dingy / overcast. even now, with brighter, longer days at 5pm, when its sunny. So it absolutely isn't overcast. it's like she's looking through sunglasses or something.

Conversely she thinks car headlights are stupidly bright, and that they must hurt us as much as they hurt her. So she is at both ends of the extreme. Lights are too bright, but every day is overcast (when it isn't).

Despite always being happy to be with us and to be picked up for tea, she then quickly gets anxious when not at home, and uses the ""bad weather"" as a reason to request to go home (""I don't want you driving in the oncoming storm"").

Is this something to do with the dementia? is her perception of light and dark effected?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Background / context

I know I am going to have to be 'bad cop' at some point soon and push / trick her in to getting medical attention i think. Just so we know whats going on. My FiL & husband never stood up to her about her refusal to seek any type of medical assistance. She used to be a very grumpy woman, so it was a lot easier to give up pushing than fight her on this stuff. The grumpiness has mellowed with onset as long as you don't upset her. My husband once tried to talk to her about her issues but she refuted everything and seemed genuinely distressed as to why he would make up such things.

She was primary carer for her mum who had diagnosed dementia, it sounds like her father had it too but he was gone before I became part of the family (25 years ago). Her twin sister has diagnosed dementia, and like i say, she clearly has it.  My father in law was hiding from us just how bad it was (Not sure why as we where/are very active in their lives) and until FiL death she put on more of a front for us (didn't always manage it, but managed enough to hide just how bad it was)."
"For five years, I and our children had been trying to get my wife to a doctor for her increasingly obvious cognitive problems. 

We’ll, as previously posted, the inevitable crisis happened and five days ago she (VERY unwillingly) entered a memory care facility. They do not want me to visit for about two weeks, and after two stressful phone calls, even those are out for the moment. 

Sadness and relief…these years could have been somewhat better (especially since it’s vascular dementia), but that’s not who she is/was and that’s now history. 

Hoping things will settle down and I can visit and even take her out for lunch, but clearly not yet. 

So thankful that we bought Long Term Care insurance around 15 years ago. I don’t know how the next years would be without it."
"Last week my dad fell out of bed at his nursing home and badly broke his hip. He had surgery placing a rod, screws and a plate, was in the icu for a week and sent back to his nursing home. I saw him this weekend two days after he was discharged and he seemed really out of it. I assumed he was on lots of pain meds.  He told me he was in a lot of pain. He was just super sleepy and couldn’t stay awake, talked in a whisper. 

Today his palliative care nurse called and said he was doing so well and hasn’t asked for pain meds since he was discharged from the hospital last week. I told him about my visit and learned he had no pain meds that day at all. The nurse said they give them when the patient asks. 

I’m not sure my dad understands to ask for pain meds. For context he comes across very lucid at times. You almost question his dementia diagnosis until you realize he thinks he is working at the nursing home not a resident. Then he talks about how they are holding his hostage and refusing to pay him and he can’t find his car. And he thinks he’s owed a paycheck from a place he hasn’t worked for in 40 years. It’s strange. He has also forgotten he has a brother and sister. I’m not convinced he understands to ask for and can make a connection between pain meds and pain. Also worth noting the palliative care team got involved because he was very combative both physically and verbally prior to his hip fracture and refusing to take meds. They determined oral meds stress him so part of his care plan is to reduce unnecessary pills. Like cutting out his fish oil supplement and other vitamins. So the excuse was they don’t want to upset him by overwhelming him with pills unless he asks. 

Does this seem right?  Do I just not understand how this works?  I’ve never had a parent or any family member go through this so I may not understand."
"Does anyone know of any support groups in the NYC area for children of people with dementia? My dad has early-onset dementia of some kind. It's still in its relatively early stages and he does not have a specific diagnosis yet, but it has been tragic to see. Looking online, I see some groups in the area for caregivers of people with Alzheimer's. I'm not sure a group like this would be right for me though because I don't live with my dad and he is still fully independent, although impaired in noticeable ways. Any tips or advice would be really appreciated..."
"I'm working with an organization that's helping us finding a home best suited for my mum. Apparently one of the deciding factors in regards to price is the added security to the question of ""wandering""

I have a meeting with them tomorrow and of course in this context does wandering just mean leaving the home and wandering off ? Or is there more to it - like going into other peoples rooms etc.  If it's the latter, I don't have an honest answer for this due to the fact she hasn't been in a home yet and don't know if she is going to be walking into other peoples rooms. 

At home she is curious if I'm on the same floor as her she will come over to see what I'm doing on my pc in the dining room as she passes through the kitchen back to the living room etc.  But if I'm upstairs working she doesn't come upstairs during the day to see what I'm doing and will stay downstairs. 

She has no real desire to go outside besides to sit on the balcony and have a cigarette. 

Is that enough information to answer ""is she a wanderer"" ? I understand eventually as this progresses she may very well become a wanderer and may need to be move to something more secure."
"I have recognized some changes in my mom who is nearly 70.  These changes are mainly in mood and aggression over slight things.  There is some senselessness too.   Memory loss and confusion is not a big issue. It's very mild and hardly noticable. The biggest issues that I see is mood and easily angered, and senselessness. 

It's only recently when I am piecing a lot of these issues together and I think she is going senile.   I have suspicions of maybe dementia but my biggest issue here is that it's not presenting with a major loss of memory and confusion that you would associate with dementia and Alzheimers. Every day is different with her. 

I am actually seriously thinking that maybe dementia might be coming in. It's early days yet. 

I'm at a point where I don't know how to proceed. I know she won't be open to me having a chat with her.  She won't welcome that and I think it will be met with hostility from her.  We do attend the same GP practice so I am thinking about chatting to a GP at my next appointment and give her my suspicions of the possibility of dementia and tell her what I am saying her.  Memory loss is limited and not an issue or a huge concern of mine.  It's other things presenting - mood, personality, aggression, some senselessness there's even a type of ocd setting in. She never had ocd when I was younger. 

My question here is -
Is there treatment for dementia? Can the progression of dementia be slowed down? 

If this is the case, It would be worth my while raising my concerns now with a doctor instead of waiting some years and seeing more serious symptoms of memory loss, confusion and losing the ability to perhaps care for herself. If the progression of the condition can be slowed down, I think that would help her and me too."
"My family is 99.9% sure that my great grandmother is suffering from dementia. She hasn’t been medically diagnosed - because we can’t get her to agree to go to the doctor. She absolutely refuses. Her father and her sister have both passed away with dementia. She has good days, and then she has bad days. She is 87 and my great grandfather is 87 as well and he is so tired. We need home healthcare but we cannot get her to go to the doctor for referral. She doesn’t think she needs to go, but she is getting worse. She’s taking Prevagen (when she can remember to take it). Please, any advice on what we could do is appreciated."
"My family has been watching my father progress with dementia for years now. He's got good days, and bad days. More often good minutes and bad minutes these days. He doesn't drive anywhere or do much, but sometimes he's sneaky and will get up and start walking away while someone is either in the bathroom or kitchen. He doesn't have a phone anymore because the ringer just made him scared or upset.

He's recently been asking for a watch and my family is trying to find something that not only tells time but they can also live track location on GPS in the off chance he ever walks off or figures out the locks. Does anyone have any recommendations for a good GPS watch for an elderly parent with dementia? 

My mom would like something that could call too, but I don't think he'd understand the calling piece of a watch. The GPS piece feels like the most important. 

Thank you in advance."
"I am caregiver to a family member. She is forgetful and often can’t repeat what she just said. Sometimes yes is really no and no can be yes, you just to have to figure it out. She doesn’t want to bathe or wash her hair. It is difficult to get her to drink enough water which leads to constipation. She recognizes her grandchildren but has trouble recalling their names. On the dementia F.A.S.T. scale she seems to land into level 6, but not all of the way in. I understand she will need to be in level 7 before hospice will help. I think when the test results come back she will be diagnosed with vascular dementia. I know no two people will deteriorate at the same rate or in exactly the same pattern, but could you give me some idea of what to expect and how long the stages will last before the next level. Thank you for reading my frazzled description."
"If the grim reaper showed up for my dad today, I’d gladly invite him in and offer him coffee and a plate of cookies. The dementia is eroding my soul. I’m so tired of being a caretaker."
"My mother is suffering from LBD. She usually gets a lot of aimless energy in the middle of the day. She walks back and forth, moving things, talking to hallucinations, opening doors, “cleaning”, etc. Most of the time I’m at work when she gets this way, but during the weekend, I’m home and usually keep an eye on her so she doesn’t get into anything too dangerous. This helps give my dad a break. I used to indulge in wonderful, cozy weekend naps on the couch that I looked forward to all week. I can’t do it anymore. Her dementia has slowly become worse and she requires more attention from caregivers now. If I take a nap on the couch, i have one eye open. I am still paying attention to my mom and have to listen to her marching back and forth for hours, so I can’t take my naps anymore. I’m not trying to sound selfish. It’s just interesting and sad how dementia subtly and drastically alters every day life for everyone involved."
"my grandfather has dementia and due to a recent stroke, his whole left side cant move thus making him not mobile he also cants control his bladder and often wets the bed. We put him on diapers but he would always pull it off with his working hand causing it to spill on the bed.Right now we all are trying to help around the house and care for my grandfather but whenever he has to move or anything my dad is the one to carry him and he's been doing this the whole day not to mention he's also working full time so he has his hands full. We want to help carry him and all but my grandfather is quite heavy to the point where even three people (me, mom, and grandma) cant carry him thus only relying on him. i feel bad for him he's so tired and can barely catch a break he nearly fainted several times. I don't think we can keep doing this forever and when he is at work I don't know how we will carry him. Were thinking of getting a maid but not a nurse or anything due to the cost but I don't know to what extent the maid can help. Are there any ways to not make him pee on the bed as often and to ease moving him around? we all cant think of ideas anymore."
"Firstly thank you for any advice you can give. Apologies if this is too long, I'm not sure how much is relevant. 

My Dad was diagnosed with early onset alzheimers in Dec 2021. He copes fairly well day to day doing routine things currently but his ability to communicate has dropped off a cliff. Most conversations will include I Don't Know or I can't remember. Hes doing his best and can still drive and shop although only for items he regularly gets. He can't problem solve or follow simple instructions well and has lost the ability to communicate pain effectively. He does, mercifully, seem to have sort of lost the ability to be stressed outside of when he is fixated on something and cannot do it. 

He lives with my mother who is physically disabled 

He originally comes from another English speaking country and it is a relatively short trip over there. I have asked him and he says he wants to go visit. He has lots of relatives there who would appreciate a chance to see him before he deteriorates. I am willing to take him and be his carer for the duration which would likely be a couple of days at most. I know that I will be doing the brunt of social interactions and it would likely be staying with his brother, maybe a family dinner and some minor driving around (me driving). 

What I am concerned about is throwing him out of his routines and undermining him in his normal day to day at home. My mother would not be coming because she has no interest in going (separate issues). 

So can anyone give me some external thoughts on whether to go through with this? I'd love to be able to facilitate this but I don't want to prioritise his families desire to see him over his needs."
I was extremely close to her. The disease stole her. Covid made it hard to see her. She didn't really understand the phone so I couldnt even really call her. Now she's dead because a nurse gave her Covid and the Parkinson's complicated things. My partner isn't being supportive. I feel so alone. I can't even say goodbye
"I am In a very complicated situation my landlord's mother has some type of mental Illness I think that it is dementia but I am not sure because I am not a psychologist or a doctor. I know that she has some type of mental illness because when her daughter aka my landlord dropped her off at my house I noticed that she had some strange behavior she would leave food on the stove walk away forget that it's there until it is burned, she mopped our floors with shampoo and conditioner, and she bought plants from home Depot put them in the sink with our dirty dishes and said that she was recycling the water. 

 I don't know if my landlord is in denial or if she does not want to deal with her mother. But my landlord has dropped her mother off at my house and forced me and my roommate to watch her mother two times. Every time I try to talk to her about her mother In a calm professional manner she either ignores me or gives me an excuse. I don't know what to do about this situation I tried talking to a lawyer about this and they said that because I am renting a room in a house I cannot stop her mother from coming onto the property. 

I don't know what to do about this situation I am thinking about calling adult protective services on my landlord. Because I think that my landlord is abusing her mother by dropping her off at our place and forcing us to watch her when she knows that me and my roommate have no mental health training or experience, we have no idea how to take care of her mother and we do not have the time to watch her mother. But she still chose to drop her mom off here. I think that is very irresponsible and shows that she has poor judgement. 

I know for a fact that her mother is going to accidentally hurt herself or someone else if she does not get the help that she needs. I know for a fact that the law says that if you are a danger to yourself and other people you have to go to a mental health facility. I am worried that if her mother does not get the help that she needs she is going to hurt someone or herself and if that happens she is going to have a cop and a social worker knock on her mother's door and force her to go a mental health hospital. If that happens my landlord is not going to have a single say over where she goes. If the court finds out that my landlord knew about her mother mental illness and did nothing about it then the judge is not going to allow her to be in charge of her mother's care. I don't know about you but I would not want a stranger from the state to have complete control over the type of care my mother receives."
"I'm just wondering if there is anyone else out there my age. My doctor is referring me to a neurologist to be sure, but she's confident that I have dementia. I won't bore you with all the details and symptoms (I can't remember half of them anyways), but I'm honestly floored. 

Things that I thought just made me ""quirky"" or ""eccentric"" are apparently incredibly concerning signs, and things are getting dangerous when I have my less lucid moments. 

I was just getting my sh*t together. I have a decent enough job, I was going to move across the country with my fiance, get married... I even started puttig things in motion for retirement plans by 50 for passive/part time income. And now this. From everything I'm reading, I might have another 8 lucid years. 

I watched my grandma go through this. She didn't recognize her own children and thought I was her daughter at the end. To say I'm terrified is an understatement. Today I had to tell both my fiance and my best friend that in a few years, I might not recognize them.

Is there anyone else my age going through this? What do you think causes this? Is it just bad genetics? Did I overwork my brain? Is it something we did to ourselves somehow?"
"This happened last night and I'm still laughing about it.

My wife, in 4th stage dementia, is still pretty lucid most of the time. 

She went to bed at her usual 10:30 ish.
Around 11 she walked into the living room and asked me if I would take her to Target tomorrow to get a new bed sheet. Well, yeah. Good night.

I went to bed at my usual 12:30 ish.

At about 2 am she wakes me up and says the phone just talked and said ""Turn left in a quarter mile.""

I did not hear this and we both agreed it was probably a dream.

About 2 hours later I hear. ""Make a U-turn in 1000 feet."" 

I looked at her phone and she had mapped directions to Target but didn't shut it down.

I'm not sure how to finish this up, but hoping y'all get a laugh out of it too."
"My mum, in her mid 70’s, has been bed bound since a bad fall. She is receiving home care. She will never walk again and is slowly fading away. However she is showing signs of dementia. She did recognise me when I saw her last month for the first time in 3 years, but she thought the balloon on her bed was the TV and she tells me she gets up regularly to walk around.. she hasnt walked for months. So, do I humour her and pretend that the balloon is the TV and that she can walk, or do I try and be honest with her? Thank you!"
"almost 30 years ago, he was electrocuted, and his brain was aged 10 years overnight, total personality change, and doctors found classic multiple sclerosis lesions, saying that in another 10 years he would probably be unrecognizable 

since then, he has had his ups and downs, but he hasn't changed a whole lot since the mid-90s, for the most part, except perhaps gained a little bit of maturity 

my mom and I were talking on the phone earlier and she made some casual remarks that sounded eerily familiar, being that they sound like a lot of things my friend has observed in dementia patients she treats as a caregiver 

the things that set me off initially:

1. my dad has always been a socialite, hyper-extraverted, socialization is what he lives for, but my mom said on the way to church (a 40 minute drive) over the past 6 months or so, he mostly seems dazed and stares off into space, usually not speaking a single word until directly asked a question 
2. at his church, that he pastors, he has special reserved parking but keeps forgetting where it is and parking elsewhere in the parking lot 

that's the main two that set off alarm bells but there are others 

he has also shown signs of not comprehending certain things, or not remembering them, such as when he was introduced to my ex/close friend in November and, despite being told no politics/religion by my mom and I, he immediately went into politics and then religion 

that was pretty incredible because he has always been the kind of person who could hold down a normal conversation with a wide variety of people, he's met plenty of my friends before and had never done anything like that before, it was actually shocking 

so I don't know, I'm no expert, but something seems off and now it seems like more is off than I realized 

does any of this sound familiar? is there anything else I should be looking for?"
"My mother is a resident in a really nice memory care facility. Last week she had another resident (a male who is a wanderer) come into her room in the middle of the night and crawl into bed with her. She was understandably terrified and had a meltdown. Lots of ""I need to get out of here"" and ""I am going to stop eating"". We got her calmed down and got her out for lunch so they could clean her bedding and make everything ""clean"".  It seems like it isn't the first time this poor man has done this but it's usually not at night. 

Mom is usually really focused on keeping her door locked to keep anyone from getting in her ""apartment"" (there are a few residents who wander in if the door is open during the day so she keeps it closed and locked whether she's in there or  not), but she must have not locked it. We talked to the staff (they're great) and they said that they'd check her door every half hour at night and also if they happened to be walking by. So all seemed to be under control. 

Until it happened again two nights ago. There's definitely no malicious intent by this poor man - he's definitely unaware of just about everything around him. However - my mother needs to feel secure in her room. 

Has anyone experienced this before as either the LO of a wanderer into other people's rooms or as a person who's LO has a wanderer show up in their room?  I am looking for ideas or thoughts on how to handle this so mom feels safe - without making a big deal and getting this man in hot water, if possible. TIA."
"My mother lives alone and about 5-6 yrs ago I started realizing something was very wrong . She would cry for days over an imagined social scenario, imagine that people around her would “ tremble” when they see her , imagine people on her roof , imagine that someone was damaging her car etc . Whenever I suggested that she needed help she would go ballistic and scream that she wasn’t crazy and would not be given poison pills so that she could feel nothing . At the time I offered as much support as I could by offering to go with her etc. I even called her PCP once and although she couldn’t disclose her medical information she listened to my observations about my mom and did tell my that yes she was aware . Due to Hippa she could not disclose but suggested I accompany my mom to her next appt. I had asked the Dr to please not disclose that I had called her . Well, fast forward a week and my mom called me and screamed at me for contacting her PCP and of course would not allow me to the appt . I did find a scan once of her brain while visiting her and tried to quickly read it before she caught me but it was all medical jargon. I remember it did note shrunken vascular activity in the frontal lobe . Anyway , my mother has only become way more paranoid , resists any type of help and is extremely verbally combative . She has no assets so I’m not worried about her finances . She has always been on govt assistance.  What are my options if any to get her help ? And no , her moving in with me and my family is not an option as I would not be able to handle her."
"After 4 years of complete isolation and heavy drug abuse I think it’s time to stop. I’m completely dis functional at this point. My thoughts are sporadic and incoherent, it’s hard just to make this post. Over the past half decade I’ve watched myself go from highly functional to being a shell of a human. I could make friends easy, had a gf, had a job, was super productive and was steadily progressing in life, Now I can barely think. I don’t think I’ll ever recover from this and I’m done trying. Through the past 6-12 months I’ve put in real effort in improving and have made zero progress. My life is nothing but constant anxiety and dysphoria. I feel like I have dementia. I’m constantly tired but can never sleep. I have headaches and random pains throughout my body, I wouldn’t be surprised if I’m riddled with cancer. I desperately want to end my life but I have a massive family and suicide unfortunately only affects other people. The discomfort is becoming overwhelming. I’m paranoid and stuck in my head. I’ve had nothing but my own repetitive thoughts to think about. I’ve been living alone in a single room for years now. People in prison are punished with a life style like my own. I’m completely exhausted with life."
"Hello I am new here. Last summer my grandmother had a major stroke that caused brain damage resulting in dementia. Last month she suffered a cold and went severely down hill. Crazy what a cold can do to an old person I guess.  Anyway, she can barely walk or talk now and moves very slowly. I was afraid to take her home in the beginning because she was causing shenanigans and was generally very angry. I am hoping to get a 6 month prognosis and get her on hospice.  I am a stay at home mom with a 6 month old. I will not have any help from family. And if anything, very little help professionally.  I feel like my grandmother will die soon, because of her recent and fast decline. Shes on lots of meds that make her sleepy, I think about taking her off them to see if she gets better but I am afraid to. Any tips and encouragement? I have a meeting on the 12th with the nursing home."
"My grandma has Lewy-body dementia and recently moved to memory care. She’s always been somewhat moderate to conservative. Voted republican more often than not in the last 20 or 30 years, but is still a registered Democrat because she never got around to updating it.

But more than just what her voting habits were, she has always had a strong conviction that politics are *personal*. She gets offended when canvassers come to her door to ask who she’s voting for — not because of the annoyance of the door knock, but because how dare they ask such an invasive question. To her, politics are a private thing you only talk about with trusted people.

We’ve always been close, and Ive always been interested in politics and vocal about my own politics, and when she was mentally well we would discuss things occasionally. And still, all these years later, the above info is just about all I could tell you about her politics. Most people in her life have no idea if or how she votes at all. Any comments she’d ever make about politicians were decidedly not political — she felt sympathy watching Biden speak about his son, she respected John McCain for his service. That kind of thing. Surface level, polite, personal, not inflammatory, nothing to do with policy or party. 

All of that background to explain: she suddenly has a LOT to say and it’s kind of weirding me out. She hates Kamala Harris, apparently. That came out of nowhere. But ever since a few weeks ago, every time Harris is on screen she has a snarky comment, and today while Justice Brown Jackson was making her speech, grandma was yelling at the TV that she better watch out because Kamala was gonna get her for taking up the spotlight. 

She has newfound very strong opinions about our mayor, too, who is so incredibly moderate and milquetoast that I didn’t realize anyone could have strong opinions on him. She has decided she dislikes a handful of anchors and pundits too, and dramatically rolls her eyes and makes little comments anytime they’re on the screen. Like a teenager!  

I wish she didn’t like watching the news so much otherwise I’d turn it off, but she insists on having it on all the time. It’s often on mute and I’m not sure she notices that, it doesn’t stop her from making her comments. She’s not hurting anyone, and I don’t argue with her, so she can hate whoever she wants I guess. But it’s just so *weird* because she was never like this before. I’m wondering if anyone else has seen anything similar?"
"Hi. Trying to figure if MCT oil will make a difference. And get info to help guide family decision making since we all have different opinions. 
If someone with Alzheimer’s uses MCT oil but doesn’t reduce carb intake - and therefore is not on a ketogenic diet - will the MCT oil be worthwhile?
I’ve googled extensively and can’t find any research to this particular question. 
Thanks in advance."
"My mom has early onset (F59) and I'm very young (M22). It's finally come to a head and she got laid off. No one my age can relate and they're all very uncomfortable talking about it, especially when I joke. I've been expecting it a long time so I've come to terms with it pretty well and I've been a caretaker before so I know what to expect. But it's still lonely. I don't have older adult friends who have seen parents decline, had their mom forget their name. I need people who get it and don't try to relate my mom to their dead grandpa. I need advice. Who do I talk to? My therapist is nice but she also doesn't get it. My spouse is supportive and going through it with me, but they haven't done this before either.

Are there support groups? Workbooks? Book clubs? Do I just tread water? I'm out of my depth."
"Opa has now started advanced choking. He eats very very slowly. I know that dementia affects the part of the brain that controls swallowing. But I don’t know what to do, my parents are leaving me alone with him more and more (we all work but now it’s getting pretty drastic to leave him alone). If he chokes and it gets stuck in his air ways the only thing I could do is call 911 and I honestly don’t know if they would come fast enough. It’s really morbid but it is reality. 

His eating has been on and off. Sometimes the refusal of food and sometimes he wants breakfast, lunch and dinner. Which I assume is the dementia, but he won’t want soup all the time. And he is very picky. Do I just make him shakes and smoothies when he’s home with me? I worry about his health if he eats candy and ice cream for all meals   (He would probably love that lol) any suggestions or tips would be very helpful."
"For the past 5 years, we have been taking care of my FIL. COVID royally screwed everything and he went downhill FAST. Needless to say, we are just done. We have a two year old and we just want our space, ability to focus on him, and selfishly, our freedom.

Fast forward to Wednesday, he woke up and chose violence, and quite frankly, that's the last straw because we don't want that around our toddler and we don't know if this will become a habit. Yesterday, I spent most of the day calling everywhere and everyone to see who could take him within our budget. I found it. I found out there are assistant living homes that are actual homes and they take 5-7 people for 1-2 caregivers 24/7. Finally! Only problem is, there's a $350 gap between his social and how much it costs. 

&#x200B;

Is anyone aware of a way to find grants that could close that gap? Or anything like that? I mean, on paper, that's not much, but over time, especially when wanting to buy a house nowadays, it is a lot and it's money that could be used for our son.

&#x200B;

TLDR; found assistant living, but need help to find extra money to pay for it"
"I have been forced into this position and I cannot figure out how to handle it anymore..

My daughter is in homeschool and I leave the house for about two hours a week on sundays, with the FIL.. 

The last time I was away from the man was 104 days ago (Christmas Day) 

I don’t hate him but every time I look at him I want to scream. He is an asshole who defends the son who collects his SS checks but NEVER comes to help out.

I am at a breaking point but I am trying to stay strong for my daughter and husband.. 

I know it sounds selfish but I just want to be alone for a while. I don’t want to hear shuffling footsteps from pops, clean out his bedside commode, go catch his dog that he lets out, EVERYTHING!

Ugh, there is so much more to bitch about but I don’t have the time or energy.. lol

Sorry for the rant.

Hugs to everyone going through it."
"You're driving along a country highway, going 50mph, no problems, it's a nice day, and then --

You come around a curve and there's a farmer's tractor going 10mph.  You brake, you downshift, whatever, no danger of a crash, you're just forced to slow all the way down to his speed.  You don't hate him, you don't grudge him, you're just stuck behind him while he putters along.

Every time he gets to a four-way stop, he looks to the left and he looks to the right, and it takes him a minute to decide he can keep puttering along forward. At 10mph.

You're starting to get a little annoyed, and frustrated.  After all, nothing against the farmer, but you've got places to be, things to do.  You didn't set out to crawl along at 10mph.  This isn't your speed.

But it'll take as long as it takes.  No way to speed things up.  A test of patience.

Several times a day.

(I suppose if I had achieved full enlightenment, I'd then take this analogy to a regular highway, where I'm going 65 but jamming up some youngster trying to go 85...)"
"My Nana is deteriorating pretty quickly, I'm her primary caregiver and she doesn't trust most people anymore. Before she started showing signs of dementia, she set up medical/legal protocols to prevent her from going to a care facility and she didn't want medical intervention other than regular doctor visits for her other health conditions.  How realistic is it for 1 or 2 people to provide the level of care someone with dementia needs? Is there anything I can do to try to make sure she's comfortable and safe?

Info on caring: my mom and I make all her meals, help her walk, take her to social events, do all the household chores and maintenance.  

Info on my Nana: incontinent but can change herself, sometimes needs help with clothing, sometimes knows she is forgetting and getting confused beyond what's normal (she used to be a nurse), can usually walk with a cane, is sometimes very suspicious of and doesn't seem to recognize my mom (her only daughter), frequently has confused or illogical thinking.

Other: I work part-time, am in school full-time.  My mom owns a business so she has flexible hours."
"Hi everyone, i visited recently a neurologist because I had a constant headache with terrible contraction and low ability remembering ... I had these symptoms as long as I can remember ... But they were milder when i was a kid ... And they constantly got worse year after year ... But when i was 18 ... Things got way too much to handle ... I've seen many doctors but they failed to diagnose me properly ... Until now in my 27 ... My neurologist did an EEG ... And showed up that my frontal lobe signals are weaker than they should ... he ordered an MRI to have more information about my condition ... I'm gonna have it as soon as possible ... But until now i don't know what causes this frontal lobe abnormality ...  Juste from the information above ... Do you guys think that there is a chance that this is frontotemporal dementia ? Or probably something else ?"

"My grandma has been deteriorating for a while. But she just got really bad recently.

I mean, she was kind of a reckless driver and told the same stories/repeated the same things a lot, but i didnt think it was a big deal.
Now i know it was.

I don't think i appreciated my time with her enough. I'm only 14 and my mom is killing herself as her caretaker. She's been bedridden for a few days and her mental capacity has been dramatically fluctuating. I've only seen her once since she got worse and i feel like i don't want to see her ever again.

I held her hand as she told me not to remember her like this. She isn't fully there in the head but when she becomes more lucid she seems aware that she is a burden and weak in bed. At least she still remembers me.

My mom runs multiple businesses and is always busy, and now that my grandma requires constant supervision everything is going wrong.

Caretakers are so expensive. My mom seems miserable, and i feel like this is driving her insane. Literally. I don't want to lose her, too. I hear her talk to me about making sure that things are gonna be ok when she dies. Making sure i split everything evenly with my brother. Making sure I'll have access to her bank accounts. All because her mother didn't sort all that out for her.

My mom is sane, for now, but we're all so upset. Does it make me a bad person to wish my grandma would pass already, before everything gets worse and she's gone completely? What if this goes on for years and years and years????????? We can't afford that.. we can't make time for that. Everyone is miserable. I am miserable.

I don't want to suffer like this any more."
"(Based in the United States if that helps) This is going to be long and I'm so sorry for that but I wanted to share as much useful info as possible.

I strongly suspect that a family friend (70s; M) may be struggling with dementia. He hits all of the marks I've been researching with the exception of hallucinations. This is quite taxing on his wife as she's his primary source of everything (he's very antisocial- always has been- and spends his entire day on the computer). She's been expressing a lot of concern about his short and long term memory, his temper which has always been short but now seems to be on a hair-trigger, and general actions that don't make sense to her; most recently he's purchased a new vehicle which is the biggest concern because if he drives alone, he frequently gets lost and will cruise around for a while until something triggers his memory and he's oriented enough to make his way back.

A few other things that bolster our general concern:

\-In addition to the vehicle, he's recently purchased an air compressor/pressure washer which he does not know how to use nor does he have the strength to operate it safely. He's also been making tons of Amazon purchases (they have more batteries than a literal battery store) that are unnecessary, are incorrect parts for whatever project he's taken to try and fix, or things that he ""needs"" in the moment but by the time it arrives has no idea why he ordered it.

\-Randomly yells profanities at their Alexa system even when she's not offering her opinions, but who hasn't had that urge lol

\-He's making *horrific* comments whenever he sees a POC or LGBTQ+ person on TV (I used to think getting him out of the house more would be a good idea but with these commentaries, I'm rather relieved that he's a homebody). This as far as I'm aware is new, up until the last year he'd have negative opinions of people for specific things like their behavior, if he felt they were dishonest, things like that, but bringing race and orientation to the table is a definite change.

\-He's on a ton of medications for anxiety, depression, PTSD, and physical conditions as well, insulin, testosterone, and something to regulate his blood pressure. He is very protective of these and keeps them locked up so his wife is unsure of what his dosages are or if he's taking them properly. She suspects that based on his extreme mood swings, he's often taking more or less of certain ones though this can't currently be confirmed.

\-He's displaying extra caution? Paranoia? Not sure what to call it but the most recent examples are that he turned their Roomba off because his wife wasn't supervising it vacuuming and didn't want a fire to start. Same thing with their coffee maker; I started a pot, went to the bathroom, and when I came back to the kitchen, it was unplugged because no one was watching it and he didn't want a fire to start.

\-He goes to the VA a few times a year for blood pressure/oxygen checkups and a physical. When he's there, they also give him two other tests. One is a clock where the person administering will adjust the time and ask him to tell them what time it is; the other is a series of words they tell him and then ask him to repeat them back. He completes both the clock and the words perfectly every time.

\-When he leaves these appointments, he says that he doesn't remember what the doctors told him and has thus far refused to allow his wife to accompany him into the exam room for her to track their questions/answers and any info the doctors may share. She'd like to request that he have a more thorough mind exam (I'm sorry, that may be incorrect terminology) but the one time she asked that of them, they said they couldn't unless he requested it. She scheduled an appointment for him at a non-VA facility which he refused to go to since it wasn't through the VA.

So that's where we stand right now. Our concern is growing daily and we feel backed into a corner because we aren't sure how to move forward in getting the help he may need. Happy to answer any questions or expand on anything that's unclear in the comments."
"Hey Everyone,

Does anyone have experience using content protection software for dementia patients. I want to let my dad use a computer for his puzzle games, YouTube, etc… but I need to stop him from trying to make purchases… and from browsing other content (I don’t even want to deny him that… but I’m tired of having to clean the malware of his computer because he visits shady sites)? I’ve been in IT for over 20 years, so I’m looking for specific, dementia-related experiences.

"My Grandma (vascular dementia stage 6/7) would fold laundry. It was pretty much the last unsupervised independent task we could give her to feel helpful. In the last 2 weeks she has seemed to have last the ability to do it. I'm kind of at a loss as to what else I can try to give her to fill her time. 3 days a week she goes to an adult day center so she has time to socialize and get out of the house. 

I'm just so drained trying to keep the house running while trying to give her things to do without also having to spend my time with her. 
We are going to look into someone coming to the house 2 days a week for 3 hours or so."

"Hi all, thanks for taking the time to read. My dad has been getting more forgetful recently, he's in his 70's and, due to a bad knee has taken some falls resulting in impacts to his head. Such accidents aren't helpful and he refuses to get it addressed privately (knee replacement), despite having the funds to do so.

Just the other day, he forgot some vocabulary along the lines of ""keyboard"" and ""laptop"", substituting them with ""button pad"" and ""box"". He's been using computers for a good deal of his professional life and, even in retirement, he has constant exposure. Other signs are to do with forgetting plans made between us and an inability to understand some simpler concepts like the UK being in NATO (he worked as a journalist for many years so he knows this stuff and we've spoken at length about it, in addition to doing embassy work as an advisor etc...).

I've told him, repeatedly, that he needs to spend some money on himself for his own wellbeing and I'd feel better if a neurologist could examine him. He seems resistant to the idea though (again, not wanting to spend money). Here in the UK, it would be a miracle if the NHS came through for us (waiting times for his knee op alone are at the five year mark and it's only now we're seeing movement on that front). 

He seems happy to discuss power of attorney matters with me but my concern is that unless he exhibits some agency over things, it's going to seem like I'm making decisions for him.

Am I overreacting, how would you go about addressing this?"
"TLDR: I’m concerned how my mom will fare when we don’t visit since since a bit anti-social, yet complains she doesn’t just want to watch tv all day. How have others here dealt with this?

My mom (moderate to severe dementia) just finished her first week at her AL facility. For all accounts she’s adjusted well to the living conditions (likes her new “apartment”, staff and her are getting a decent routine in place for her basic needs). 

Up to now I’ve been pretty involved - going every day at least a few hours - which I think has been valuable in terms of communicating to staff all her unique patterns of behaviors and best ways to interact with her. I think it would have taken weeks otherwise and my mom would have had a much worse time in the process.

Now I’d like to work towards cutting the cord a bit. I still want to visit her often, but I can’t spend hours every day. The few days I’ve been around less she’s complained about being bored. Before the move she wasn’t doing anything but watching tv, so this new arrangement isn’t much different. She didn’t really have friends, and her social interactions were just the at home caregivers. At the AL she doesn’t get lots of 1:1 time with the staff, they mostly come on demand or in regular intervals to meet her needs. The AL facility has full days of activities, some which I think she’d like. But she’s never been a joiner, and now in her condition she’s really anxious too.

Any advice on how others here have helped similar family members integrate better into the more general activity structure of the AL facility? In the short term I’m going to accompany her to some events which hopefully she’ll enjoy and then want to do again (although she may not remember!). I was also considering hiring a companion, but that can get real expensive real fast."
Does anyone know the best way to tell a mom she has to leave her home? She is lucid at the moment about 60percent of the time.

"My parents are very strict and devout Catholics. I've had a beard for over a decade and my mother had always hated it.

I was considering getting a tattoo but decided against it. My friend asked why and I said because my mom would yell at me. He thought I was joking but I pointed out that because of her dementia it will be a fresh outrage every time. I don't live with her so each time she sees it will be like the first time, and I don't want to contribute to her mental stress.

My friend thinks I'm being stupid. She's at the point where if I leave the room for 30 minutes she'll ask if I just got there when I come back."
"Because my mom ran and controlled every occasion, this was a relatively messy, informal event.  Until this disease took her, I never knew how much of our lives werd under her mansgement.  COVID kept many people at home in a church only attended by old people these days.  It will probably die soon, falling to the younger louder evangelicals.  

Today I sit and grieve, and try to make sense of life from here on."
"My grandfather was recently diagnosed, and my grandmother has been doing her best, but is at a loss at the sudden heavy information and work ahead of her. My family is already in action to help, but as a grandchild who lives too far to drive over and help, I feel helpless in how I can minimize these burdens.

He is early in development, he struggles remembering how suspenders work and gets up to dress at 3 am, but he remembers who we are and what year it is still. He is very depressed and anxious though, an understandable feeling for sure. My grandmother is struggling to adapt to all his new needs on top of caring for herself, and my mom is the only one of 3 siblings doing any work to support them. 

Is there items I can buy and send them? Is there advice I can offer? Is it okay to talk about the hard things coming to prepare, or am I overburdening an already exhausted family with more than they are ready for? My heart wants to do so much, but I worry misguided attempts to help will only make it harder. I want to help the right way. Do you have any advice on what I can do?"
"Hello,

Maybe this isn't the right place for this question, but in the past people here have been helpful so I figured I'd give it a try:

My dad has moderate/advanced dementia and it's starting to get the point where he needs to be in a hospital bed. Specifically one that is electric and can be raised and lowered so my mom could take care of him.

I see them online from about $2000 to $3000. I've read that Medicare may cover 80% of the cost? Additionally, we also have Blue shield Blue Cross PPO.

Anyone have experience with this. As far as doctors go, they agree he needs a bed and have written us a prescription. Just trying to figure out the cost aspect. 

Thank You"
"They live with a daughter who was away for therapy. My grandmother had a fight with my pop, it escaled, my uncle (88) called my mom for help. She was at work, so i went to their house. I got inside to find my uncle on the ground, begging me to help him because granny pushed him, and my granny that was scratching up my pop's face. I called an ambulance and they deemed that everyone was fine, but that they shouldnt be left alone. My mom, me and my aunt cant take care of them all the time and they refuse any help."
if you look in my post history you can see a bit of backstory. she had early onset and by the time i was somewhere around 5 my dad became her caretaker. she forgot who we all were at least 4 years ago. i know what to feel now: joy! i am so happy shes finally finished suffering. i mourned her so long ago.
I know! I know! My mom is alive and sitting in her house right now. I am sitting right beside her. Yet she has asked me twice why her sister hasn't called (passed away 3 years ago) and if my dad just up and left her (he passed away 15 years ago). I miss the person that she was and oh I how I wish I had the times back that I took for granted. The time before her memory left her. Sometimes she tells me that she misses her mother and I tell her that I miss mine too.
"My poor Mom.  She hasn't yet been able to let certain things slide off her back when it comes to my Dad and his dementia.  

Over the course of the last few months.  1.5 years into my Dad's dementia diagnosis, his new thing now is obsessing over things.  Constantly worrying over things like his health or wanting to know test results RIGHT AWAY.   

If my Mom has to schedule a doctor's/specialist appt for him - he will literally wake her up at 7-8am to tell her that she needs to call the doctors office *right then and there* to either follow up on test results, or make follow up appointments.  

Before his illness he was NEVER like this.    Now he needs and wants my mom with him everywhere they go.  

He was getting his teeth cleaned last week and wouldn't let the hygienist clean his teeth unless my mom was in there beside him ""in case he fainted"".  He became obsessed with fainting.  We had him checked out and had his meds reassessed and he's had extensive tests done.  None are coming back to explain his dizziness.  

Is all this part of the disease? The constant obsessing over things? The paranoia?  

He's in the mild to moderate stage."
"I have been taking photos of him lately... and I don't recognise him.  I really don't.   He has similar facial features and his body shape is roughly the same.  

It's not just photos.  It's the same in real life of course... but I guess it's more... forceful or something... when I see a photo.  When he's 'not-him' his face structure is changed.  I don't recognise him.  His mouth sits differently when he's happy or sad or scared or whatever.   Even his sleeping face is different... how can that be?

Yet, when it's 'him', his face is back to the one I know so well and dearly love.  

Particularly because I'm taking the photo as a memory while he's still here... the photo only reinforces the fact that he's not here at all.

Anyone else feel/see/experience this?  It's all new to me, and this aspect doesn't seem to be talked about?"
"I know everyone is different but anyone who has reached the sleeping all day phase with a loved one able to give me a ball park time frame I have left? My grandma sleeps pretty constantly, she only utters a few words with visitors. I just so badly want peace for us all but I feel the need to prepare myself for the eminent end"
"Mid-later stage dementia. 75. Living with sister. Sister has two kids and can’t pay much attention to mom. I had mom for over a year but between having 3 jobs, being single and childless, and taking care of my dying stepmom and my dad, I haven’t had time for her. She’s social and she’s bored miserable and depressed. But my sister and I can’t give any more. Are there services for dementia patients? Like someone to come get them and take them on adventures, art classes, etc?"
"I had to place my 86 year old mother Feb 15 of this year.  The nursing home called today to give me her update after her PCP saw her today. She is prescribing lexapro because mom is exhibiting signs of depression. Mom has a dx of Parkinson’s and dementia. Does this often happen?  Is it the disease or is she just not adjusting well?  I have so much guilt over having to move her out of our home.   I feel so bad for her.   She’s so rarely with it, I  don’t know what to make of this new development."
"Since Ive become a caregiver for my dad, his health has only improved.  But ive gained 20 lbs, ive had to raise my blood pressure medication, and im prediabetic.

The issue for me isnt actually the amount of work.  Its his personality.  I cant stand it.  Hes so sexist, doesnt go a day without insulting me, and complains about my sisters all the time even though all of us bend over backward for him.  If i could only tell myself its the dementia talking.  But no, this is truly him, just more often cause he forgot he already said those things and repeats them.

How can i keep my blood pressure down and keep his words from draining me of my energy to do things like exercise."
"Uggggh. So we're getting Durable POA for my dad today. His wife died last week and I'm just now realizing I probably have to file taxes for him/them. She had no income whatsoever so maybe that'll be easy. But my dad has Social Security and VA benefits and held a job briefly last year for like 2 weeks. I really want to do it on TurboTax but I get the feeling I'll need a tax preparer or something like that. IF anyone has any experience with this, even just pointing me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated. 

What a mess."
"Hi everyone, 

This Thursday, I will sit down to do an interview with Dr. Cameron Camp, who is an expert in non-medical approaches to dementia care. Instead of creating questions of my own, I am hoping to collect some questions from you all to ask Dr. Camp, and I would tremendously appreciate your input. 

What are some of the biggest challenges you are facing that you would like insight on? What do you not understand about dementia? What questions do you have about long-term care? Anything else you'd like to ask? 

I'll select questions among the most upvoted and upload the video here after it is complete. 

Thanks!! 

&#x200B;

Here is Dr. Camp's bio: 

""With over three decades of dedication to the applied and translational research of gerontology, dementia intervention, and cognitive intervention, Dr. Camp has earned international renown for his work to improve the quality of life for persons with dementia and memory disorders.

The co-holder of two patents developed through Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR), Dr. Camp has also been appointed Principal Investigator on numerous NIH-funded projects and served as President of the Adult Development and Aging division of the American Psychological Association.

"Hi everyone! We just sent my aunt who is 86 years old to a senior living care facility because her sundowning was getting severe and it was beginning to be too much for my mother to handle.

After she settled in at the facility my brother and I came down from out of town to visit her. They let her sleep over my parents house so we could all spend time. Everything was perfectly fine. She was super happy to hang out with us and spend time with my daughter, but after we dropped her off she became very disoriented in the following days and her sundowning became a lot worse.

I know she misses us and we miss her as well, but the owner of the facility told my mom that it probably wasn’t a good idea that we took her out for that weekend because she just got lonelier afterwards. They advised us not to call or pick up her calls and to limit her visits once a month. 

I am all for doing anything to make my aunt as comfortable as she can be, but It really doesn’t sit well with me that she is at a facility by herself and we can’t even talk to her. I don’t want her to think we left her and neglected her. She practically raised me, my brother and my cousins and it doesn’t feel right in my heart to do what the facility tells us.

My question to anyone who has experienced this: Is what they’re saying the right thing to do? Will it make it worse for my aunt if we contacted and visited her more because it will just make her lonelier? If it does then I have no problem backing off like they’re asking. Sorry if this post was too long!

TLDR; My aunt’s sundowning got worse after we visited. Facility told us to stop contacting her and only visit once a month. Wondering if that’s the right thing to do.

Edit: Thank you all so much for your responses. It definitely gave me the affirmation I needed. I called my aunt this morning and she was so happy to talk! I’ll encourage the rest of the family to do the same. I appreciate you all!"
"So I have a good friend who is older, just turned 70 actually. I work actually work a lot with people with dementia so it's pretty normalized to me and 70 doesn't seem that old to me either. Anyway, I've been noticing my friend bring up the same things a lot. We talk a lot about spirituality (buddhist) and we both read a lot, so we end up sharing a lot on the stuff we read and such. But over the last several months he has mentioned and sent me emails (at least 2) about an natural art thing he once saw in Spain. I don't think he realized at all how many times he has told me about it, shown me pictures, sent me stuff on the web. etc. The same is true for a couple other things--one is a Ted talk about a book he likes. He must have sent me the Ted talk three times now and mentioned the book every time we talk. I saw him recently and he once again sent me a link to the Ted talk. 

Should I tell him he's sent these things before? He has some health issues which may be effecting his memory slowly and there's not much he can do about it. I feel like if I tell him he will just worry about something he can't change. It's also not that dramatic--like this is pretty small stuff to be forgetting too."
"I just got here. I've been dealing with my mum's advancing dementia for years now--with a major increase since the start of the pandemic--but I found this sub only today. My mother is 82 years old, and, to judge by the guides and charts and things that I see online, she's in either late sixth or early seventh stage dementia. This time a year ago, she was hostile and angry a lot of the time; blamed me for most of everything, mostly about where she was. That's pretty well passed, I'm happy to say, and now she's a lot quieter. She's tired most of the time and won't last more than an hour or so at a visit. I'm luckier than some here in that I'm not a full-time caregiver. My wife and I are the only ones local to my mum, so we make all the visits--at least half of which are generally spent changing her and getting her cleaned up. Unfortunately, my mum isn't in a top-flight facility because she didn't save a whole lot of retirement money, and the U.S. is a pretty terrible place to be old and not have your wits fully about you. We do what we can, and the staff is nice and caring, but they're just too few. I've got one sibling who is out of state and pretty much stopped visiting when my mum started going downhill. It's been almost four years since she visited. I think she just can't handle it.

Anyway, I originally came here to ask about how you all speak or interact with a parent who is almost unable to speak or interact in any meaningful way, anymore. I've found one thing to do is to read to my mum. She was always an avid reader, throughout her whole life, but she's pretty well stopped now, and her attention span and comprehension are poor now. The other day, I pulled an old book off my shelf that I knew she loved as a child--""The House at Pooh Corner"" by A.A. Milne. I've been reading it to her, and she seems to like it. (I do the voices.) I was wondering if anyone had suggestions for other ways to interact/things to read because we're nearing the end of the book. I'll confess I feel a little lost as to how to deal with it all. 

Anyway, thanks to everyone for writing your posts here and sharing your experiences, your frustrations, your fears, your anxiety, and everything else. It honestly helps to know that there are others on the same journey."
Here lately my uncle has been declining fairly quick it seems and refusing me at every moment I try to help. Every day he changes for the worst which I know is to be expected and my heart breaks to watch him struggle even to talk to him is impossible since he makes no sense all the time. No one should have to suffer like this its freaking awful. Anyway on to the good. Today he finally allowed me to help him change his clothes and clean him with a warm damp cloth which he has been aggressively adamant against this whole week and for once he was able to say thank you for all that you do for me. I was flabbergasted that he had a moment of clarity to thank me! I almost cried at being so happy to help him and him realize this for a wonderful moment in time. I know tomorrow will be different but I just wanted to share this win with those of you who know what its like to go to battle with dementia every single day. So here's to all you exhausted and burned out caregivers I wish all of you the best while enduring this Hell with our loved ones. Thank you❤
"My (24f)  mother (57f) has ftd, fairly advanced, but she can still speak - forming mostly decent sentences with real words, although it often doesn't make much sense as she has lost most nouns, and has no object recognition, and her understanding is pretty limited. She also doesn't know she has anything wrong with her, and is very stubborn, and doesn't like being told what to do unless by someone she views as an authority (e.g. doctors). She is also very mobile, and she is very reluctant to deviate from her routines, and has a preference for her own agenda. She has recently had two bouts of fecal incontinence due to not understanding the urgency of getting to the toilet. 

I'm sure people in this thread will understand more than most, but it can be tricky to take her places. Of course, we manage fine on short trips like day trips etc., but we are flying to Australia (from the uk) very soon, as our family lives there, and we want to take her over there for what we assume will be the last time. It's a 7 hour flight, and then a 14 hour flight, and then obviously a very different routine when we get there. She doesn't really like going out much and socialising, as she gets very anxious when she doesn't know what's going to happen, when we are going home etc. 

I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice for the flights, and for how we help her cope while we are there. We have accepted it's not likely to be the easiest trip in the world, but we would like to be able to have a nice time as a family, and for mum to enjoy herself. Thanks in advance!"
"Hi all,

My grandmother was just diagnosed with Alzheimer’s (after displaying symptoms for a few months). Obviously we are doing whatever the doctors recommend, but I’ve heard a few people talk about mushroom supplements for dementia. 

I don’t know specifically what mushroom supplements to look for and I wanted advice. I know it’s not a cure- but I was wondering if anyone knew what to look for or had any other suggestions for helpful supplements?"
"What an honestly awful night/morning for everyone in my house! We have a ranch house so falling never happens. It was 5am he was calling my name for I don’t know how long, I was dead asleep. I asked him what was wrong. His glasses of course, one of his lenses fell out. As it was still dark out and he had no reason to use them for sleeping I said can you wait till morning. He walked back to the living room where his lift chair is. Not long after I heard what sounded like a door slam. I listened for awhile but nothing out of the usual. Until 6:30am groaning sounds started, I told my mom and there he was laying on the bathroom floor. (He weighs just as much as I do and he’s taller, so I can’t lift him up) finally came my dad and he helped him up. Grandpa had stood in the bathroom for only who knows how long and collapsed. He obviously doesn’t remember what he was doing or why he was in there for so long. 

I feel like he’s been declining quickly the past few months. But he never got officially diagnosed. The doctor just said “He’s got some dementia”. So all in all we don’t even know where he’s at on the stages. Sigh. Unfortunately I think the next step is a home."
"My mom's dementia isn't bad and she can manage many things on her own. She has problems with paying bills and my sister and I can do this. However, getting control of anything is like pulling teeth. A year ago she would insist that one of use come to her place and she would get out her checkbook, etc. It took forever. Now we are (mostly) online. 

I expect the dementia to get much worse and I want that my sister and I have more control over her money and finances. We have done a lot like frozen her credit and we both have power of attorney (although she can certainly make her own decisions at this point). How do other people do this or manage this? My sister ends up taking care of so many other things at my mom's place. (Tv doesn't work right, etc) and I would prefer she focus on things like this. (I am in another state and make phone calls and such.) 

My mom told my sister it is her ""job"" to take care of her and I so I want my mom to understand that we need to be able to help her. Just now I asked the HOA to remove my dad's name from the bills and I need my mom to call and she won't do it. There are so many minor annoying things and I really expect this to get much worse."
" 

My father (M, 70) has been confined to a wheelchair for about 15 years, and is reliant on help for even getting out of bed and going out and about. My mother (F, 61) is there to assist him, and we are lucky to be able to afford carers who tend to him. Recently, over the last few years, he has become noticably forgetful - from both small things, such as what day it is, what he had for lunch, or what time someone is supposed to come over, to other more things such as my brother's birthday, his cousin's name, whether people are dead or alive, etc. Sometimes he will ask the same question 2 or 3 times during lunch or dinner, not realising that we have spoken about it already barely 5-10 minutes earlier. It has reached the stage where it is noticable even to people who don't live with him, but are meeting him socially.

The problem is - he is refusing to acknowledge these things happening. He either tries to laugh it off, claiming he was fooling us (he wasn't), or gets verbally combative, saying we're trying to trick him into thinking he's going mad. In one instance, even when on text message he mentioned something unfathomable, and we tried to show it to him as 'proof', asking him what he was trying to say, he just shuts up and shuts everyone else out. In his opinion, everything is as it should be.

But it is clearly not. Looking at early symptoms of Alzheimer's, he is displaying a number of them: forgeting about recent conversations or events; forgeting the names of places and objects; asking questions repetitively; becoming less flexible and more hesitant to try new things.

But he refuses to see a doctor. We have tried speaking kindly, politely, begging, cajoling, pleading, being harsh, being reasonable - to no avail. He is convinced that we ""want to make him think he is mad"".

I really am not sure how I even proceed with this - I do not live in the same city as my parents, and I know that my mother is quite anxious about what the future holds. In her opinion, even if we just know what is happening, either way, at least it makes it easier to deal with - if a diagnosis can be confirmed, wouldn't it be better to start treating with medicines as early as possible? And if he is being this stubborn now, and he does indeed have Alzheimer's or some other form of dementia, what is it going to be like as it progressively gets worse? In the last month itself I have felt it get worse.

Any advice is appreciated, both on how to approach my father and try to make him see a doctor, as well as how I can help my mother cope better with this. Thanks in advance!"
"My husband has FTD. He’s in the early middle stages. This morning he yelled at me “ I want a life! This is not a life. I feel like I’m losing my mind.”

I wanted to say “ yeah..that’s two of us” but what would that accomplish. I asked him what he wanted…what would make things better or make him happy. What *would* be a life? He couldn’t answer me. He then said he needs to see a doctor so they can fix him. I suspect he’s aware of how much more he’s been struggling and he’s feeling panicky about it. 

I still have to work full time so even with Covid restrictions easing up it’s not like we could travel much( that was always our retirement goal). I have tried suggesting hobbies, activities, etc but he always shoots me down. Even if we could travel I doubt he would enjoy it. New places get him flustered these days and even when we go for drives, something he used to enjoy, he just sits there and doesn’t want to talk or joke and doesn’t seem to be interested in anything around us. 

I have an appointment scheduled with his psychologist because I suspect this might be depression related. He’s on Prozac but I wonder if it’s not helping much. 

Has anyone else had experience with this? How do you handle it? I can’t say “ yeah this sucks but this IS our life right now and we have to find what happiness we can” when the person doesn’t know or can’t articulate what would make him happy?"
"I(28m)was raised by my grandparents and lived with them( here in Alabama) until I was 25(brief stints living away before then) as a child I would have nightmares of my grandfather(55 at time of passing, he married my grandma when my mom was 9 making him my step grandfather) passing and only ever began to cry when I thought about the death of one of them. Just before the start of covid my grandfather offered to use his VA loan to buy a house big enough to accommodate my girlfriend and I and her two kids as well as them and the dog they've had since I was 17 however due to the tumultuous nature of the housing market post covid we couldn't find anything to accommodate my grandmother's(family with dementia 71) physical needs as well as my S/Os needs(mainly based around her(36f) kids(12f & 9m) needs like staying in that school system. Fast forward to December of last year, my grandfather passed away in a horrible way that could have been preventable had I been more aware of the signs(went septic due to gallbladder disease) and died alone in the Selma hospital(which kills me even now to type). I had roughly 6 minutes to greave before the reality set in on how bad my grandmother's dementia was. My mom initially agreed to travel back(in the evening) and forth(mornings) from her own home to my grandparents so she could remain in a familiar environment. This lasted for 1 month to the day until my grandmother had a sundown event to which my mom responded by having her hauled to the hospital and attempted to have her admitted the next morning which she didn't meet their criteria for. The next weekend right after my 1st negative covid test she asked me to watch her for 4 hours only to tell me after the fact that she refuses to take care of her anymore. My grandmother has now been with me for  about 2 full months and it's all gone to shit. My significant other can't handle the stress(ers) dementia has brought in. My grandmother had to go from living in a 2900 square foot home with just my old man and their dog to a 3 bedroom apartment with 2 kids and an adult that are strangers to her almost even without the dementia. I'm trying to get their old home sold to give myself some financial wiggle room as they were still paying on it. In just the last 2 months on a 40k annual I've shelled out between 6 and 9k in expenses including slight renovations to help the value of the house. I sit now at my storage facility almost 2 hours away from their home and about 5 minutes from my apartment where she is sleeping with the kids and my s/o home while this moving crew(we have no extended family really and my mom hasn't been much help as our relationship was poor even before my grandfather passed) I want badly to get back I to therapy which I'd started before he passed so unexpectedly but I hate dealing with someone who simply sympathizes and ""understands"" I need the kind of answers that will help me grow and get past childhood issues and now his trauma. Meanwhile I'm praying I can honor his memory to ""take care of his wife and helps dog"" since there was no living will. All I have now is her, the dog, and POA but due to the dogs abused living before my grandparents rescued him he's always been possessive over them. He recently bit my s/o again and she wants him removed from the home. Which is the best short term solution but I know it'll cause further decline. I was overwhelmed before I caught covid and now I feel like I'm either about to just barely hold it together or lose everything and end up on a 72 hour hold. No help, no non busy friends, no family able to help regularly. F*** man why did he have to die alone, the man upstairs can be so cruel."
"I'm looking for suggestions for medication to ask for,  for my grandmother. Her PCP, a nurse practicioner, has been very uncaring and uninterested. We are looking into a new PCP. 

Grandmother is 90 and lives alone (currently her son is staying almost 24/7 given the circumstance). Sudden and extreme change in mental status. It started shortly after she had a very horrific fall in the middle of the night early March and broke her nose and wrist. She says her life alert button didn't work, she thought she was going to die but reached my family by phone finally, and they took her to ER. She's on Coumadin and bled a lot. Very traumatic. She also suffered for a week before they ordered a 2nd xray and discovered her broken wrist, it didn't show on first xray.

2 CT scans 3 weeks apart (one the night she fell and one a few days ago) show no brain bleeds.
She had a UTI shortly after the fall and has been off antibiotics almost 2 weeks and is showing no improvement in mental status, in fact is declining rapidly, despite all urine and blood tests being normal at each doctor or ER visit.

Changes include: doesn't think she's in her own home of 70 years, thinks people are in her home or outside of it and she is in fear, and has eloped once so far, cries and becomes upset easily, recently said she hears music all night (she extremely hard of hearing and lives in a secluded area where there is no music going). 
She put on a coat over her pjs, put on shoes, and grabbed a flashlight and her cane and took off in 40 degree temps in the dark on foot, leaving her front door standing open, and ended up at a neighbors house (the only neighbor) quite a ways away asking for help. It started that this behavior was late evening or night time only, within a week she's now disoriented during the day too. Today she packed a bag with what little medicine was at her home and said she was leaving and going home and taking her cats with her. She began screamin at the top of her lungs at her son when he tried to gently, verbally redirect her. 

Her son has cooked meals for her and visits 3-4 times a day for the last six years or so since she becamed widowed. He lives a mile away and is now administering her medication each day so that she can't get it mixed up. 

We have no idea what's causing this and the ER doctor says it's ""trauma"" but give us no ideas of how to help her. Her son is the only close caregiver, his siblings live 2 hrs away. He is 70 and in poor physical health.  We don't want her sedated to the point that she's unaware of things or falls but something she could take daily to help with mood or stabili her would be nice. Her PCP orders 15 ativan at a time and right now it's calming her a little but we'd like to ask for something that could help prevent the episodes rather than giving her an ativan during the episodes. 

We prefer to not place her anywhere at this time since this is so new and sudden. We're hoping she will fade back to normal but it's not looking like it. 

Thank you for reading all this."
"My grandmother is in the final days of her life and it’s absolutely devastating. I (21) have helped my parents caretake for the last year as things have progressed (in year 5 of her diagnosis), so I’ve seen the change and decline. And while I’ve been grappling with the emotions that come with imminent death, I find myself confronted by my own fear of this sort of finality and that she won’t see me graduate from university, go into my career, or be there to see my art in a gallery. 


I feel caught between shaming myself for selfishly wanting more time and trying to soothe my anguish by reasoning that I’m allowed to want more time and also want her to not be in pain. I know what I’m feeling  isn’t a unique experience, but I don’t know how to find a sense of stability in this— perhaps it’s the process of grief. 


Grieving the living is hard, but approaching the next part of grieving the absence feels so much more visceral. And as life marches on, I’ll have to continue to find ways of seeing to her memory while wrestling with her absence. Sending hugs to everyone here, this isn’t an easy thing to handle. Take care of yourself, please."
"My mom has always been very nervous about home security - the kind of person who locks everything and does a couple rounds before going to bed. She lives alone and dementia has made her anxiety about home safety worse.

She had a door stopper on her front door, but I removed it because I thought it would be a safety risk in case I or someone else needed to get in her house. Is this really the case though? Couldn't the police/emergency responders get in through her windows?

It's been a couple times that she tells me she's looking for it and starts crying because she lived through a couple break-ins in her home country as a child. I would love to give the door stopper back to her to make her more comfortable at least until her dementia progresses further but worried if anybody needs access to her home."
Has anyone experienced a loved one refusing to change clothes that they have used the bathroom in? Today is the 1st time my uncle has not let me help him and I feel my only option is to wait and change him later if he'll let me. I'm concerned because he's so prone to UTIs and getting him into a shower is no longer an option. I wipe him down the best I can. Any advice or experience is welcomed thank you!
"Bit of background...

Husband has been having memory/anxiety issues related to MCI/poss early-onset dementia for a couple of yrs now. Has had an assessment with the memory clinic nurse, then referred to specialist psychiatrist. Now has an assessment appt with specialist neuropsychology Dr in a couple of weeks.

Later at night and early in the morning are the most difficult times, for him and me. He is more confused and anxious at these times than the rest of the day.

He often wakes up ages before he's supposed to, usually around 5am, with terrible anxiety about things. This morning, he woke up really upset, thinking he had lost his money, because he couldn't see his wallet. The wallet was in his bedside drawer, right next to him. I gently told him this, and gave the wallet to him, but he still thought he'd lost money, because..... I don't know why.

I'm getting so bloody tired of being woken up, my sleep is messed up and I can't settle down again either.
I'm thinking of sleeping downstairs, just so I can have a little bit of quiet time.

I know this isn't anyone's fault, I know it's not his fault, but I can't help feeling the way I do. I'm tired. All the time. 

When everyone else has gone to bed, I stay up late so I can have peace and quiet, as its the only time I can do. 

As he doesn't have a diagnosis yet, this makes things more difficult in terms of support and related stuff. And he's only 61.

Just wanted to get this crap out of my head, just for a bit. 
Thankyou.

Edit:  he's on Mirtazipine 30mg and Melatonin prn"
"Been taking care of my husband for several years now, he is not progressed to the point of not being able to do some things for himself but I am still on duty 24/7.  Yesterday he was rude to me in the grocery store for no reason, just out of the blue mean.  We got to the car and he started to apologize and I started screaming at a volume and pitch I have never done before.  It was shocking to me but I couldn't stop.  I guess the burden of what is to come and all we have lost and all the times in the past he has been mean just came together in a furious ball of anger.  It took hours for my heart rate to go down and I slept on the couch.   I had no idea that kind of rage was living inside me. Please, no one tell me his being mean is the disease or that I need counseling and support. I just needed to get this off my chest so I can start new today."
"Im thinking of putting my dad in a nursing home.  The one im thinking of still doesnt have any activities provided.  They say its because of covid.  They are constructing a new building right now and say activities will start again once that new building is done in May.  

Is this normal in the US or are they just bring super cheap and trying to save money?  But would open activities again cause they are heavily marketing right now due to the large number of vacancies needed to be filled with their new building."
"i’m 14 and my dad is 54. he’s been diagnosed with dementia since about late 2018. it’s gotten worse and i’m not sure what to do. i get angry and impatient with him which makes me feel terrible after. even when he attempts to talk on the phone with his friends and family, him stuttering makes me so upset. or when he attempts to make conversation with people and can’t find the proper words, i feel embarrassed. my sister (9) is oblivious to it and my mom struggles to help him as it gets worse everyday. he’s been taking speech therapy for these days but it’s no use. he is unable to recognize letters and words and he’s finally able to say a letter it’s the same three “a, j, x”. i want to be better and try to understand him but i’m unable to. i cry thinking about how i will lose my father and i can’t do anything about it."
"My wife is in in-home hospice and got outside on her own when I forgot to latch the door. She walked a little ways and fell face-first on the sidewalk. When I found her soon after, her face was covered in blood. I was afraid she had cuts that needed stitches or broke or cracked a cheek bone. You must call hospice first, not 911, so I called and they told me I could call non-emergency paramedics but they couldn’t take her to the hospital, or we would pay. I cleaned her up and put ice on it while waiting, and paramedics checked her good when they got here and luckily no cuts or broken bones.   


Question is, what if a hospice patient  falls and breaks a limb or pelvis and needs to go to hospital? Is the patient paying for hospital bills? Thanks for any info."
"does anyone else have parents/grandparents that just sleep all day? my grandma is on an anti seizure medication which the doctor warned us would make her tired, but she’s sleeping for 20-22 hours a day now and when she is tired, she can no longer do things like walk, talk, or understand basic instructions. when she gets up in the morning she is fine, and within 20 minutes she’s asleep again. she is for the most part immobile without some form of help for stability, but earlier today it took three of us to get her up from a sitting position. is she nearing the end?"
My MIL has been getting harder to take care of so we decided to bring in a home health care worker 2x a week to help out. The 1st women was a pleasant white women who my MIL tolerated until she left and then went off on us for letting the “cooky lady” in. Today the company sent a young black women she was nice and polite but the 2nd my MIL saw her she became angry. After 20 mins of MIL ranting to this poor girl we finally said she shouldn’t have to take this abuse and she could leave. I’ve heard stories and that health care workers are used to it but I’m not and I was just so angry at her for treating anyone like that. I guess really I just need to vent.
"So, my great grandfather has dementia. I have no idea how far the disease has progressed but I want to understand how you are supposed to deal with things that he may or may not understand. I’m the youngest in the family and I feel as though I have the least say in how these things are handled. Recently, my great grandmother had passed away, his wife of over 60 years, and nobody has really told him what happened. I feel as though he knows but since I can remember he’s always been a quiet man never really objecting to what you told him. My family has tried to tell him the she “went to the store” or “is out right now” but she hasn’t done things like that for many years now and I feel like he knows. He will ask about her from time to time and always get those answers and that seems to satisfy him for the time but the question always come back in a different way weather it’s where’s your “mother, carol, grandmother, things like that. He always seems to remember people faces and has a huge smile when he see us. What I really want to know is would it be a good idea to actually tell him what is going on. Or would that bring unnecessary problems if he did not remember a few days later. If anyone has dealt with this with family or friends I would really appreciate your insight. 

Thanks!"
"My granddad has had dementia about 6 years and it’s currently very bad he’s very aggressive and angry and swears all the time. 
But the weirdest thing he does is every time he sees words he reads them he’s too wondering through the house looking for things the read and them reads them out loud. 
He can be screaming swear words and other rude things and then just sees a letter on the side and suddenly starts reading it. 
Just wondering if anyone else has seen this and if you know why they do it?"
"My mom has a new passport after ""losing"" it (I'm pretty sure it's in her house but she hoards and we've never been able to find it). She lives alone with daily visits from my sister and I. She lost her state ID, passport, social security card, and Medicare card in one go last year. It was difficult but I got her a new state ID and passport.

My sister and I each have 1 of the IDs - I have her state ID and my sister has her passport. My mom very much wants to travel to her home country, and I think this is why she asks almost every day if her passport is safe with my sister. 

At this point she needs daily care and attention (we're starting to look at 3rd party care options) and I don't think traveling is a good idea. My parents were divorced a couple years before she started showing dementia symptoms, and it's like she's completely forgotten why, and she talks all the time about staying with my dad who lives in their home country. I also don't speak the language so I'd have to rely on her and that makes me very nervous. I'm also scared that if we did go, she would refuse to leave the country. I was waffling on a trip before and it breaks my heart to not go, but I just don't think it's a good idea.

Today she called my sister very angry demanding to have her passport. I almost want to give it to her knowing she'll lose it again, but what if she doesn't believe us when we tell her she has it now? It's been so important to her that she remembers my sister has it.

Has anyone ever made a fake passport for their LO? 😔"
"Any recommendations on what walker to get?  Im looking for a wheeled walker that would be easy to use outdoors.  It needs to have some resistance to the wheels as my sister is afraid the walker will wheel foward away from my dad if he puts pressure on it suddenly.  Or is there a universal clamp or something that can be attached to wheeled walkers to do this?  

Do not want to spend more than $250."
"I'm sure others have experience with helping your LO get dressed. I typically help my Grandma because she does not remember to take her overnight pull up off and dress correctly. Some mornings she just stands there and does not try to dress herself. I'll prompt her to remove her nightgown (she has to pull it off over her head) and she will just stand there and shrug her shoulders. Then I prompt her by touching it/pulling it up slightly at the shoulders and repeating that she needs to pull it off. I don't like to remove it because she has back issues and not great range of motion in her shoulders. Then once I do pull it off she just kind of stands there. And the process just becomes more difficult because then she pretty much refuses to help. 
She has incontinence so most mornings her nightgown is wet (or will be shortly from her sitting) so I don't want her left in it. But when I'm met with her uncooperative attitude, I'm not sure what to do. Other than just getting her dressed and hoping that changes her attitude. 


How do you handle these situations?"
"My aunt has had arthritis for years and took extra strength Tylenol in the mornings and evenings but also rubbed a numbing crème onto her knees. (She can’t take Advil or any kind of NSAID because her stomach bleeds if we’re not careful.) 


Anyway, I believe she had some kind of mini stroke, followed by some dementia symptoms but she’s doing better now that she’s taking Namenda. Strange thing. After the dementia symptoms began and before she began Namenda, she never complained about arthritis and she walked fine. Is there something about Nameda that awakens “pain pathways” in the brain and could it have reactivated her ability to feel arthritis pain?"
"My mum (who I've just moved to memory care) has always been a very religious, born-again christian. Like, my childhood was no music, no dances, could only could watch Little House On The Prairie kinda thing. 

Well, mum has now taken to saying ""tough titties"". And it makes me crack up each time."
"Hello I am looking for insight and opinions from those with firsthand experience. I am interested in starting an Alzheimer’s-focused nurse consultation program.

The goal of this would be to empower those in the early stages (MCI) and/or general older adults with research that can put them on the best possible path to preserve their cognitive abilities through personalized regimens backed by research. There could be testing for certain vitamin/mineral levels, gene carriers, causative agents etc.

There is a LOT of intriguing research regarding supplementation for Alzheimer’s, hypotheses for causes, etc. that most people and even providers know nothing about. A lot of these supposed interventions are also very simple to implement. Do people here with experience feel there is a need for something like this? We lost my grandmother to Alzheimer’s and while I’m not sure we would have entertained a program like this early; I am sure in retrospect we would have done everything we possibly could have.

Additionally, what are some other necessary improvements when it comes to Alzheimer’s care? Thanks in advance for your guys’ insight. Frankly, I think the current approach to Alzheimer’s is shameful; it appears the currency paradigm of care closes doors to alternatives and will make you feel stupid for asking about them.

I have NO connections to any entities and no other people except myself; Just looking for insight as I see a great need but wondering if perhaps I’m just crazy."
"Growing up my grandma was my one person, my support, my emotional safety net, she would call when she would get feelings that things weren't okay. Now.. she of course is a shell of that person. No empathy as I've read is common here, she gets angry a lot and then I get frustrated..

I deal with my own mental health issues, and don't have any supports besides what I had with my grandma. I moved her in with me a couple years ago and it has just gotten gradually worse but now.. it's really bad. She doesn't really answer when you say things to her, she still reads a lot pretty much all she ever does, she doesn't ask me how I'm doing anymore nor does she seem to care at all.. 

And I'm struggling a lot, I'm struggling with my own mental health because of that I lost my job. I'm struggling with the guilt I feel for not being able to treat her with the same level of care and understanding and patience that she always showed me. I try so hard but some days are so hard. I'm struggling with losing my only support person in my world all while dealing with all of this.. alone. I'm only 28, my mom's useless and isn't helping or stepping in. So it's on me all on me, everything's always on me. And I don't know how much longer I can deal with it? 

Sorry for ranting, I've lost a ton of people in my life to death, and those were far easier to deal with then this."
"Hi everyone  
  
Question... My parents are paying me a visit (first time in years, due to Covid) and my mother is displaying very strange behaviour. With all respect, she has always been a unique character (no education, very limited social connections her entire life, never worked, anger management issues, diagnosed bipolar, chronic depression, etc...). I am grateful for the sacrifices and care she gave me. I am a successful, well-functioning adult because of her, but truth off my chest - it took me years to get my own mental health straight after some of the damage she has done, I do not love her, and although I don't want to deny her access to my family, I want to keep a healthy distance. Anyways. She doesn't strike me as massively different as usual, she is her natural self. But some of her bad temper/behaviour seems just... ""amplified"". I am starting to wonder if this is a medical condition. It is hard to explain. A couple of examples in the last 48h. 
  
She wanted to cook a roast chicken and chips for us at dinner (great!). She asked how to prepare it, I recommended she just put the chicken in the oven a 180*C for 1h30 and leave it (keeping it simple). An argument ensued (she always gets angry very quickly, it is unpleasant but nothing unusual). She wanted to know what to do for the stuffing (we don't need stuffing, it's good as it is), if she needed to cover it in butter (no, it's not a turkey, chicken is fatty enough), how to cut the chicken (no, keep it whole, we'll carve it at the end), etc... I just stuck to the simple instructions. She kept entertaining suggestions until, in the end, I lost patience, insisted on my simple steps and she reluctantly agreed to just put it as is in the oven. Anyway - fast forward half a day, my family arrive to her holiday rental for dinner. It all smells good, I go check on the chicken. She decided to turn the chicken upside down at some point during the cooking. Whatever. She left it for 2h30 (and it would still be roasting had I not asked her how long the chicken had been in the oven). When it came to taking it out of the oven, we had another argument about what cloth to use. I recommended against using a thin polyester cloth she randomly grabbed to take out the hot tray. For reference, this was not at her home, so it was not the equipment she is used to using. She insisted and went for it, the cloth started to melt immediately on the tray and I had to actually forcibly step in and intervene to remove it and stop her from burning herself. She got angry again, saying that she had lived more than me and could take a chicken out of the oven. I took over (with a thick cotton cloth), which made her cry. Oh and she had forgotten to cook the chips (so we ate the chicken while the chips were cooking).   
  
Another argument was about her laptop. It refused to turn on (blatantly, the battery was empty). She told me it went in ""security mode"" (... what?! -,-') and she needed to bring it to the repair shop (... what!!??). I tell her it just needs to be charged, and ask her where the charger is. She says the charger is in the laptop, because it is portable. We argue about chargers/batteries for a while, she gets angry again. I show her the charger, connect it to the laptop, put it in her hands, and tell her to just plug it in and leave the laptop be for a while. She tells me she doesn't know how to do that, gets angry, goes back to ""the laptop is in security mode"". I tell her to plug it in and that she knows how to plug something in. She gets angrier about me being ""unhelpful"" but as I walk off, she reluctantly complies. Lo and behold - after 15min the laptop just boots normally. We discuss further (calmly this time, yay), and she tells me she regularly goes to the local computer shop and pay $40 to get her laptop out of ""security mode"". Yes, I want to kill the shop owners.  
  
Anyway, I could go on. It is like this all. the. time. My mom has always got angry quickly her entire life, I lived my childhood in-between shouts and arguments. But it kind of feels it is worse, it now happens for everything. And I mean EVERY thing. She argues about opening the car door. She can't peel carrots properly, gets angry when I peel them further when she is ""done"". When my young son greets her with a white blouse, green scrubs and a stethoscope around the neck, she asks me what he is dressed up as (and gets angry when I am surprised she can't see it's a doctor costume - ""how am I supposed to know"", she says). I don't know if it is me being shocked by her attitude because I have lived a long time with no contact with her or if she has got worse. But it is exhausting. It is impossible to have a conversation on anything that is remotely non-basic, it goes completely over her head and she just doesn't understand what it is about. My dad confirms the type of interactions is his daily life. He is numb to it. I only admire his patience explaining the simplest of things again, and again, and again, in spite of being shouted at in the rudest of ways. I can't stay calm like he does. His relationship with her is clearly beyond repair, but he stays at his post, sticks to his principles/duties like a boss and won't leave her despite all she does to him. She never worked, has no pension - if he leaves she is absolutely f*cked, which he will not allow. I am in awe about his ability to remain steadfast.
  
My parents live abroad, I can't do much with their medical support. But I wonder. My dad says she had multiple brain scans, and they were all OK. Is what I describe dementia? Or is it just who she is and I forgot how bad she was? How do I know the difference? How should I behave?  
  
I am sorry if this is not the right forum, I just don't know where to look or who to turn to. I would appreciate any advice or help.
  
Thanks"
"I just need to vent, guys. I care for my FIL who has dementia. Hard days typically means wandering the house and telling stories that only make half sense. He's tried to wander off, but we've since installed the toddler things on the door knobs. Today it's 75F and gorgeous out. I left the big door open that has the child locks on it and just have the screen door shut. He comes out of his room with his cane and is trying to leave. He has a story about the preacher, his wife, and the neighbor and some incoherent things. I redirect him by changing the subject and things are good. He comes back minutes later and tries to leave again. This time I shut the door and try to redirect his attention again. It only made things worse and he raised his cane at me. He didn't hit me, but I really thought he was going to. The emptiness in his eyes broke my heart. I just hate this disease. Everything about it. I was able to get him calmed down almost immediately, so it wasn't a full melt down. But damnit... It's. Just. Hard. Some. Days. I'm sorry if this is rambling and jumbled, but I just needed to let it out. Everything is fine now. He asked for eggs five minutes later and probably has no idea what happened or just has no empathy. Maybe both idk. Anyways thanks for reading guys."
"We just transitioned my mom, who has mild to severe dementia, to a assisted living facility. The facility didn’t think she’s at memory care level, so she’s starting out in the regular assisted living area but with very high care level.

Care while she’s in her room is modeled around a call button hanging around her neck, coupled with periodic check ins and motion sensors.

Any tips on how to help her remember the button is there?

We’re only a day in but I have to continuously remind her the call device is around her neck and that she should use it. It may be partly because we’re taking an approach of being around the first few days to facilitate the transition. So she hasn’t had a trial by fire situation where she’s alone for a extended period, particularly overnight. I’m worried about a bad experience of needing something and forgetting the button, and she sees she’s alone, so she panics. That could sour the seemingly happy transition she’s been having. 

It’s a facility that specializes in dementia so it must be possible. I plan on asking them on this topic, but wondered people’s experiences. I understand  I need to learn to trust them, but it’s scary."
"Something that I observed over the 2 years that my grandma had symptoms is that from September until March her dementia is worse. From march to August she seems so fine. She remembers most things and is in a good mood almost all of the time. How is this possible? Also in the mornings she feels more confused but late in the day is way better.
Do some of you have similar observations or is it just me?"
"He complains that he doesn't understand what's happening and he looks to mum to tell him and reassure him. She doesn't know what to tell him. 

When he's at home, he often doesn't recognise my mum and becomes verbally violent and confrontational and to get out of 'his' house. He has mildly assaulted her once. Now it's getting worse and he doesn't recognise her more often than he does, and he locked her out of the house and then the police took him to hospital.

He's distraught when anyone suggests he has or might hurt my mother but it's because of the problem that he doesn't recognise her.

Any practical help welcomed."
"I know by now that nothing that my dad with dementia does should shock me, but have others dealt with a lack of empathy from their LO? 

My mom was listening to her messages, and she had a voicemail from one of her dear friends asking my mom to come rescue friend, because friend didn't know where she was. My mom could here the all too familiar sound of a oxygen flowing from a nasal canula in the background. To make a long story short, her friend was in the hospital with Covid and was experiencing delirium. We were familiar because we went through the same thing in 2020 with my dad and he almost died. So understandably, my mom was very upset. My dad got mad at the whole situation saying that her friend was rude to call and upset my mom like that. He kept saying that she never should have called and kept her business to herself. She died. My dad was still mad at her for calling. This is someone that my dad would have also considered a close friend.

More recently, my mom's childhood best friend died suddenly of a heart attack. My dad has know this person for 55+ years. She's the godmother of some of my parents' children. We considered her family. When we found out, I went to my dad and told him while he was watching TV. He didn't say anything. So I repeated myself. He shrugged his shoulders and turned up his hands in the ""Yes, I heard you. What do you want me to do about it?"" look. 

It's shocking to see him so indifferent. Like seriously, not the least bit sad, sympathetic, surprised, or shocked. I got more of a reaction from him when I told him dinner was ready.

Edit: Thanks to everyone sharing their stories. It’s been really cathartic for me."
"New to the group. Forgive me if there are resources here covering this. If so, pointers would be appreciated. 

My father just turned 78 and his memory has been failing for at least 8-10 years, but initially it was just forgetfulness. About 6 years ago he had the first of several episodes of what were initially diagnosed as transient global amnesia. He would seem fine, but think it was years prior. In 2016 he thought it was 2012. (We we’re a tiny bit jealous, as we wished it wasn’t 2016, but so it goes.) He was oddly calm about it, but would act like he had time traveled without knowing it… for about 5 minutes, and then reset to the beginning. He went to neurologists, he had tests. They told him it was nothing. But it happened several times over the next two years, and meanwhile his memory got worse and worse. 

Then he began to have seizures. I think that it was seizures all along, but he crashed his car for the first time 3.5 years ago. That time he convinced everyone that he fell asleep. The next crash was 2 years ago, and that time the paramedics witnessed a seizure. Not grand mal. He often seems awake and agitated. Sometimes combative. His license was suspended and he went on meds. And he thought he was fine. But his memory got worse and worse. And whenever he sees a doctor he just charms them, and they never diagnose any cognitive decline. So he thinks he’s fine. 

Right before New Years he totaled his brand new truck. This time he had a grand mal in the ER. I forbade him to drive again, and he agreed, but reluctantly. I went to the neurologist with him this time. Once again all scans were clear. They changed his meds and seem willing to let him drive after 6 months. BUT he can’t remember when he has seizures. Unless he crashes a car he doesn’t really seem to believe that they happen. And now he is behaving on a day to day basis like he has dementia. He nearly burned down my stepsister’s house the other day trying to light a broken wood stove 1 hour after being reminded not to use it. Many other examples. 

The thing is, I don’t live very nearby. I only see him occasionally. I have arranged to legally take charge of financial stuff, but I can’t be there all the time. And none of his doctors seem to think there’s anything wrong except seizures. How can I approach them in a way that they will take seriously when he is so invested in convincing them that there’s no issue? Everything is landing on my stepsister, who is also dealing with her mother’s physical decline. Especially since now neither of them can drive. I am really getting worried that he’s unable to care for himself."
"Hi everyone, this is my first time posting to this subreddit, and I’m hoping I can get some advice on how to handle this. So my grandmother, who is 78, has had dementia for about 10 years now, and she’s a pretty “typical” dementia patient. She has gotten significantly worse over the years, and she now requires around the clock care from feeding to bathing and everything in between. It’s certainly been hard to adjust to, as she only started living with my parents and me about 5 years ago. 

It fell to me at first to help her around whenever I would get home from school as my parents work full time jobs, but back then she was much more capable and didn’t really require much help. Now we’ve struggled to find her a caregiver who can accommodate her since she does not speak English, and it’s been up to our extended family to provide care most of the time since no one of us can afford to always be with her. Luckily, we’ve recently found a care giver who speaks our native language and is able to  be with her most days when we can’t.

Now New Years is a very major holiday where we’re from (Albania) and it’s always been my grandmother’s favorite to boot. About 1 month ago she seemingly woke up and decided it was New Years and kept going around asking everyone what the plan is and where we’re going, what we’re eating, where are the gifts, etc. She has had delusions in the past, but they never stuck stuck around, and we figured this one would be no different, but then, the next day, she had the same conviction, that it was New Years. This happened the next day and the next and the next day, and it’s still ongoing. It’s gotten to be a big problem, as since she thinks it’s New Years everyday, she expects there to always be festivities and gangs of hoodlums roaming around like it was when she was younger in the old country, and she always becomes extremely anxious when anyone leaves the house because of this, as she fears for our safety. She never used to mind, so long as someone stayed with her, but now if she realizes anyone is gone, her anxiety causes her to become agitated and lash out constantly. 

We’ve tried telling her it wasn’t New Years at first, but that went as poorly as you might expect, then we tried giving her a calendar to mark the days, but instead of using it whenever we put it out for her and cross off dates she just hides it somewhere in her room, and even when we find it and show her it doesn’t change her assertion that today is New Years. She does always trust her phone, but even when staring right at the date on it she still won’t believe it. 

My parents and I are at a total loss for how to move forward, as her belief that everyday is New Years had put serious stress on us and her, and it is starting to become debilitating. Do we just have to accept this is a part of everyday life from now on? My theory (and hope) is that it’s mainly due to the weather, and once the trees get their leaves back and it’s not cold and cloudy everyday this will end. I would really appreciate some advice on this from anyone willing to give some.

TL;DR

The first two paragraphs are skippable, but otherwise the title tells all you need to know."
"Have managed with the doctors to keep my wife in the hospital here in San Diego for more days while searing for a facility in Arizona. 

We seemed to have found a good one but she so easily melts down (even after a week on Olanzapine) that I can’t tell her we’ll be going straight there and not home. 

So I have to lie and I hate it. And yes, I know it’s necessary for her safety, but that doesn’t make it any easier. 

Not just a vent for me. How have others handled this?  She will really blow up when we actually get there, so much that she might not want any of us (me and our two adult children) to see her there at all. She already blames our daughter for  all that’s happened (see prior thread). 

Any experience and advice on this?

Thanks"
"Any ideas appreciated! This month I (clinical researcher and prior MRI training) have been helping my friend desperately look for help for his clearly demented (74 year old) mother (he has no other family). 

It began over the summer when she had a dizzy episode, syncope, and bad lasting headache (undiagnosed TIA?). Since then, she’s been declining rapidly and now constantly perseverates and forgets after 5 min. PCP told her to follow up in a year! I told my friend to request scans/neuro tests, and then I read through all the reports: MRI shows significant atrophy, no tau, spinal tap shows cognitive recovery in following few hours and then return to dementia, neuropsych scores are severe in learning/memory/visual, and neurology eval says “Alzheimer’s”.  

BUT she was ultimately diagnosed as “mild neurological disorder” and won’t get meds until she becomes severe. My friend said he was told there’s nothing else they can do (which is disgusting of our health care system), so I’ve been compiling lists of top neurologists and clinical trials. What else can be done for her that I’m missing?? Thank you!!"
"Hi everyone! As someone who lived with a family member suffering from Alzheimer's I understand what happens behind closed doors. One of the hardest things my family and I were not warned nor prepared for was extreme changes in mood. A friend and I are working to mitigate the mood swings to make not only the day easier for the patient but for you as the caregiver as well.

So far all of this is based on my experience with my father. We are looking for people who are willing to share their stories to help us better understand what others living with this disease face on a daily basis. If you feel as strongly and feel like you can contribute please reach out.

"My mom has LBD and has pretty impaired cognitive functioning. She’s either angry with him for doing something she’s hallucinated, happy but can’t hold much of a conversation, or completely dissociated. 

I recently moved a few states away for grad school and have no idea what more I can do. We FaceTime daily but that can only do so much. Flights back are so expensive and taking time off of school isn’t really an option right now. 

I know he is incredibly drained and lonely even if he doesn’t always admit it, and I want to think that there’s something more I can do to help him. Thank you in advance for any advice❤️"
"Dad is late mid-stage Alzheimer’s. He had been obsessing over buddies to hang out with. He was a social butterfly before diagnosis and he loves his people.

His oldest best friend has now died, my godfather, a man more a brother than a friend.  

His friend told us before he died he didn’t want him to see him in the hospital and not to tell dad until he came home, but he never came home.  His wife left it up to us whether we tell dad that his best friend died. 

I have two images in my head- one of dad hugging and holding his best friends wife and kids in mutual, adult grief. Dad being at the funeral to support and show love. 

The other image is dad spiraling into depression. Then forgetting, getting told again and again with some sort of hellish parody of “50 first dates.” Dad misbehaving and acting out during the funeral. 

What do I do? Two best friends were kept apart at the moment of death. Do I keep them apart forever? This is my worst nightmare."
"Looking for any feedback regarding the classic symptom of hallucination with Lewy Body Dementia. My mom has been diagnosed with LBD, but to my knowledge, does not hallucinate."
"My grandma needs constant care now. I go a few hours a day and take my toddler. It’s fun, my son just plays and watches tv, and talks nonsense to my grandma and grandpa. 

But… grandma thinks my son is my twin brother. She keeps asking where I am. She thinks I am three years old and missing. I just tell her,  “she’s” okay. 

Should I tell her who I am? What is the correct way to approach this? Thank you."
"One of my parents has been leaving salt and pepper shakers in the microwave a few times and (from what I can tell) not thinking it was them who did it. I only brought it up the first time but am afraid to again. My mom’s family has a strong history of dementia and her own mom (my grandma) now has it. It seems like all women on her side at some point get dementia. So I think it’s my mom who did this but I don’t know. Does anyone have advise on what to do? I need to be sensitive about it all. 

Also my mom recently picked up smoking weed again for pain so I’m wondering if perhaps she’s just high, but given her close family history that seems unlikely."
"My mom was diagnosed with dementia in 2021 when she was 63 and I was 25 (f). To make a long story short, she was in and out of the hospital so many times due to her health issues from alcohol abuse which led to Wernicke’s, which is how she has  developed dementia. My mom is in assisted living now because it truly got to be too much of a burden providing care for her while trying to work. (Not to mention that it was hard for me during the pandemic as a recent grad school graduate to maintain work after the pandemic hit. There was always a contract ending and no true traditional employment offer until the one I have now.) My mom would go out of her way to get alcohol whenever she wanted, which was against her care plan, and that wasn’t acceptable.

My godmother, aka my mom’s best friend, keeps making comments such as “All that facility is doing is housing her. She doesn’t have dementia as bad as her other floor mates, so I don’t see why she needs to be there.”

Yesterday, my godmother texted me asking when could my mother come home. I didn’t reply because I’m in week 2 of my new job and I had to make time to visit my mom in person as well as do everyday house chores. Besides, I get several other messages during my day that need more immediate attention.

When I woke up this morning, I got a text from my godmother accusing me of “lying” to my mom about not talking to her. She repeated her same points about wanting my mom to be out. 

Still, when my mom is home and in and out of the hospital because of her self-destructive behaviors, my godmother will be at peace at home with her husband, two dogs, and fun weekend planned with her grandkids. 

I don’t want to be my mom’s parole officer or maid. (She had a bad habit of making bio waste messes around the house.) I feel like between COVID and caring for my mom, I lost a critical 3 years in my 20s. I want to travel more and not have to think about complex care plans like I have a kid or pet, which I don’t. I’m already POA over her estate as her only child and take care of the home I share with my mom as if I’m the full owner.

So I went from regular college young adult to real-world adult that couldn’t afford to make financial mistakes. That’s why I don’t think anyone—especially my godmother—should be telling me I need to bring my mother home. I want to have a quality of life, too, just like my godmother has maintained by being very hands-off with my mother. My godmother has not visited my mom at home as much as she has in assisted living.

I have an urge to tell my godmother off, but I’m fighting it because it’s not even 10am in my time zone. Any tips or ideas for a response if any?"
Has anyone had any success with a sleep aid for dementia patients that get up several times each night? I want to do some preliminary research before speaking to the doctor. TIA.
"Hello everyone! I am a 24 year old living in a bit of a complicated situation. For some background context; my homeless uncle was moved in with us for his health and safety. He is 60 years old and has had speech issues for a while (stuttering and making nonsense or talking about random things totally off subject). We could tell his memory was not where it should be but we thought it was normal for his character. He refuses to go to the doctor or address a few issues but I believe it is dementia but I am unsure of what stage it could possibly be. 

Recently my family and I have been having issues with my uncle. Almost every time he goes to the bathroom there is feces smeared on the toilet seat and I am the one that usually has to clean it up. I’ve spoke to my mom about it and she basically has took the turn a blind eye pretend it’s not happening route which I can understand her logic behind but the issue is still occurring. I went to the bathroom tonight and there was feces smeared all over the toilet seat and toilet. This time it was considerably a much more in depth issue to handle. A few days ago I had to bleach and scrub our shower because of a fecal issue all over the bottom of the shower, I just cleaned it up sort of did what I had to do and brought it to my moms attention. 

He does not shower, we have reminded him many times to shower but he refuses and goes without a shower for a month or two and we honest to god try so hard to get him to shower but I don’t know how to force him to shower. He can shower on his own but just chooses not to. He is very similar in changing clothes as well, will only change his clothes once a month despite us pleading with him and trying to find compromise. 

I am trying to understand how feces is getting smeared all over the toilet and the only explanation that makes sense to me is he soils his clothes and sits in it and it just transfers to the toilet. I’m not sure what else would be an explanation for it. 

I have no knowledge on how to care for someone with dementia, this is all new to me. My mom is more of an authority figure for our household and she works a lot so she’s not at home or handling these issues as much as I am. I understand that as we get older we have accidents, we lose our memory, etc. I am not blaming him by all means and I am not out to embarrass him or shame him in any way. I’ve read about different stages of dementia and to me it sounds like he could be in the late stages. Again, I am new to this so I would not exactly know. I have tried so hard to get him to go to a doctor, pleaded and begged for him to shower and change clothes. I have tried making compromise like using wet wipes or a damp wash cloth. We have unfortunately had arguments and small fights about showering, changing clothes, bathroom hygiene, and going to a doctor. I am sort of the one that is handling these situations primarily and I feel like I am truly lost. We are a low income family so it’s extremely difficult to be able to put him in a care home or have in-home help or aid to come. 

I would be extremely grateful for any tips, advice. My mom could do a little bit more to assist in help and support in my opinion and we are working on that. I am concerned for my uncle but I can’t force him to go to a doctor or change clothes, no matter how hard I try I just can’t seem to get him to understand."
"When I come to visit which isn't often as we live in different cities but she seems so bored and lost, I can understand with her just being stuck in bed and can't really do anything, she has a TV but I was just wondering if there's anything for her to do, when people visit they ask how she is but mostly talk amongst themselves as she can't really hear properly and obviously doesn't remember much so no one really knows what to say.
I feel awful, I really hope someone here could give me some ideas to make her more involved and less bored. 
She will even roll over pouting with her back is to us cause no one is talking to her.
First time we're dealing with Dementia in this family so any help and advice would be appreciated."
"Mom is doing so poorly at her care facility. They are running out of options to help her constant state of anxiety and extreme behaviors she is having. Palliative sedation was discussed today. I can’t even put into words the mind fu@k this is to try and process. Essentially to keep her calm they have to use extremely heavy medications which basically just keep her “snowed” all day so she has zero quality of life. Everything about this disease SUCKS! I just want her suffering to be over. My poor poor momma. It just won’t let go of it’s evil grip on her. This is utterly just soul crushing. 

Thank you as always for being the best group of people on Reddit."
"Funny moment with my dad:  Today, I was driving and talking to my mom (who was seated at the back) when, out of nowhere, a chicken bone comes flying across my face and hits the windshield. My dad now tends to throw food when he’s done eating, because he panics if he doesn’t immediately find a trash can afterwards. Really frustrating sometimes, but today it was just really funny."
"My father 63 with Parkinsons and Dementia he has been in an Older Afukt Assessment Ward for 5.5weeks as a result of am acute new presentation. Dementia being the new presentation/diagnosed.

He is still fairy mobile and walks without an aid (OT) has reviewed this and confirmed stick/walker not needed yet, but has had 3/4 falls since being in hospital.

He is complying with medication changes, responds well to prompts and is taking part in some of the group activities (normally quite anti social) although he does take himself off to bed frequently.

We have a multi disciplinary meeting tomorrow and I belive this is to discuss next steps and options for discharge.

What sort of things should I be asking? 

I want my dad out of hospital but I also want him to be safe and have the care and support he needs.  I'm 33 and with full time. I provide a much support as possible but I am not able to  prove 24hr care."
"My mother had been diagnosed with Mild Cognitive  Impairment.

She lives a lone, can drive, able to go shopping and live a fairly normal life.

She has memory problems and can be repetitive, which can be annoying. Buy she presents well when meeting people, so you wouldn’t nessersarily know there was a problem.

So life is ok, until something goes wrong - As an example she had a dog which last year died of old age and had been going on about getting a new one.  Last Thursday she got a young dog from a rescue home, then on Monday it seems it got out, and rather than go look for the thing, forgot she had it and went to her Monday morning fitness session.

(So able to go through the process of getting a dog, but unable to remember she had one!)

The dog was found and my sister told her to go and get a dog tag cut, so she went down the local town to get a dog tag made and somehow lost her car…..it took us a week to find it, but it seems she parked it close to where she wanted to go, forget she had done that and for some reason walked half a mile to the local supermarket and then got a taxi home.

However, she couldn’t explain where her car was and came up with all sorts of reasons - it was being taken for a service, my sister had hidden it to stop her driving, she had been scammed and tricked into giving someone the keys etc etc.  And she was not pleasant - not about the car, but that she was trapped in her house and couldn’t go anywhere and would likely starve….she’s a 10 minute bus (which is free for pensioners) ride from town, but refused to consider that.

She is also bored, and the problem here is that if I or my sister take her out, she won’t remember and then after dropping her off home, she will then phone up complaint she hasn’t seen anyone.

So what I need really is a pointer as to where to start with dealing with someone who is getting dementia - tips and tricks that make life easier and less stressful.   For instance someone mentioned don’t tell them you’re taking them out at the weekend as they will be constantly calling asking when you were picking them up; instead call them on the day.

Many thanks
Matthew"
"I have had to put my career on hold, I've gained weight and stopped working out, I've basically just become a shell of myself in some ways. It's hard to find a balance. Every time I think ok now I can finally get my life back on track something else happens to derail it."
"This question for those of you who were a caregiver to a loved one but are no longer a caregiver anymore. 

The reason I ask is because my mother was my father’s caregiver. After he passed away,  I knew she would need time to adjust and find her path again but never did I think she would turn to drinking. Her drinking and behavior is very concerning to me. Is this common with other caregivers you know?

I’m well aware this may just be my mother’s problem but thought I would ask just in case."
"I am trying to find out some information regarding finances for my in laws. 

My father in law has been recently diagnosed with dementia and will be going into a nursing home of some sort as his wife cannot care for him. She may not be too far behind him but at least for now she can stay at home with her daughter if needed be. He is a veteran of Vietnam and currently at the va hospital. They have very little money, basically just their social security, but they do own a home. I believe he has Medicare and va medical( not va disabled though). 


They are thinking of selling their home to help pay for a better nursing home, but i believe that insurance will not pay anything if they have money in the bank. Thus causing him to get a year of a better nursing home while making his wife lose her home. Or, they could just keep the house and not lose it? Also he made some poor financial decisions ( bought car on a credit card) before anyone realized he was suffering from dementia. Three card is in his name. 


So many questions, is there somewhere to get actually legit answers for finances in these circumstances?

Thank you so much for any help"
"I'm finally putting my hubby in a home, and the guilt is eating me up. 
He got dementia young at 48, and he's 58 now. My 40s have been spent taking care of him. My kids have only known sick, except for my oldest (19). Both my sons are relieved; he's going to a home while I'm falling apart. 
I know I'm doing the right thing, but it feels so bad."
"I think many of us here have placed our hopes on something that would soothe, comfort or engage our loved ones with dementia.  I have learned, yet again, that dementia is a formidable foe.

My mother is getting into the later stages of dementia and is in memory care.  She's always loved dolls and babies and I thought I would get her one of those weighted baby dolls to cuddle and coo over.  I read all the reviews.  I made my Amazon purchase carefully, spending more money than one should for a doll.

It arrived.  It was adorable.  It was huggable and sweet faced and I couldn't wait to see my mother's reaction.  Oh, she loved it and exclaimed over it!  A true Hallmark moment.   Then, another resident came over to exclaim over the dear baby and its wee feet and soft skin.   She looked so wistfully at the doll in my mother's arms that I felt like Santa with an empty toy sack.

Sigh. That resident has no real family.  I felt terrible.   It was sad.  I went home and bought another doll and waited for the Amazon truck.

I bet you think a Hallmark moment is coming, don't you?

I took the doll over to memory care this morning...cue the violins swelling...!

Ha.  The lady wanted NOTHING to do with the doll.  She was having a day and rejected it.  I said to the staff, It's okay, if someone else would enjoy it...sigh...they can have it.  The staff said baby dolls were much loved and someone would surely enjoy it.  They added my mother was crazy about hers.

I checked in on my mom in her room.  No baby doll.  I asked, Where is the baby doll? 

""What doll?"" She asked in confusion.  I said, ""The new baby doll!"" as I started my search through the closet and under the bed.  My mom said, ""Someone stole it""  just as I opened her nightstand to find the poor doll crammed in the lower drawer.   

She was surprised to see it but told me to take it away, someone would want it and steal it!

On my way out, I saw a resident had fallen asleep cuddling the other doll.  

There's no Hallmark moment in dementia.  There are things we can buy to make our loved ones' lives easier, but as I have learned, we can buy dolls or fidget blankets or memory marker boards or therapeutic mechanical cats and none of it will make a bit of difference to the person who has no idea where they are or who their family is or that they used to have hobbies and careers.

All we can do is our best, but don't take it personally if the things you are trying aren't working!"
"She was sent to a rehab hospice three hours from her home. She couldn't get any water or good down at the end and quickly deteriorated.  Dementia and cancer of the stomach.  

I didn't want to go but I did.  She was unforgiving and controlling for all my life. But now, just a frail body almost ready to shut off.  Because hearing goes last, I sang some of her favorite songs, including the old ones she loved in church.  Then I told her I forgave her.  

She died about an hour later."
"My partner has dementia and lots of anxiety and depression. She seems to sundown mornings. This morning was pretty bad. She's struggled with constipation on & off, though we eat decently high fiber. She probably forgets to drink water, and doesn't want to exacerbate urinary incontinence. On a hunch, I asked ""when's the last time you pooped?"" Three-four days ago. Ah-hah! Will work on that, see if it helps! Thought it might be useful to share.

Update. It wasn't just constipation. She's being crabby and anxious after the Main Event too. 😖"
"Hi all - my father was recently diagnosed with dementia, and he is hallucinating daily. Small children in the house, men cutting down trees in the backyard, etc. I suspected Lewy Body Dementia b/c of the early hallucinations, but the doctor ruled this out due to him not having tremors. I am suspicious he has LBD, but for now it has been ruled out I guess. The reason I am writing is b/c he suspected his new memory medicine (Rivastigmine/Exelon) was exacerbating his hallucinations, so he is switching him to Donezipil/Aricept.  But my question, is that he is adding 5 mg of Lexapro, and my Dad already takes 100 mg of Zoloft. My mom inquired about this, taking two antidepressants together, and the doctor assured her that it is ""fine, and the Lexapro should help with the hallucinations....""

I'm no doctor, obviously, but as someone familiar with antidepressants, I've never heard of Lexapro helping with hallucinations - much less being combined with such a high dose of Zoloft. Does this sound legit to be mixing two antidepressants in a patient with dementia? Thanks in advance for any insight or experience."
I'm having trouble with these low effort surveys on here that seem to only be interested in your email address. Should they be reported to the moderator of this group or to Reddit itself. It's hard enough taking care of someone with dementia. I don't think people looking for help need to be scammed.
"My dad has dementia. He's in his 60s and this last year he was getting more and more needy. I can barely take care of myself and so I bolted. Totally stopped all communication. We used to be ""close"" but fought perpetually so I don't know if it was genuine or if it was just an automatic attempt to survive. I feel guilt for abandoning him but also am terrified at the thought of getting back in touch. I'm afraid it'll go right back to all this weight being thrust onto me by a belligerent angry man. I know he has people who take care of him but I feel pity at all of us kids leaving him to die alone. My stomach hurts I feel so guilty but I can't bring myself to talk to him again. I think I've spoken to my dad for the last time ever and I feel sick about it. I don't know what the right thing to do is. Do I willingly go back and let my own mental health slip again just to ease my conscious? Or do I ignore the guilt since I'm doing better-ish after cutting off communication?"
"Over the years, my mum (64) has accused several people of coming into her property and stealing things such as jewellery, clothing, toiletries, cleaning products etc.

She has often accused my dad of conspiring with others and allowing them to take these items for whatever reason. When I've quizzed her on it, her 'go to' reason often ends up with, ""He's trying to mess with my head.""

We've taken her to the GP in the past who have said she's  showing early signs of dementia but that's all. They prescribed her some medication for anxiety/depression and that was it.

Things have only gotten worse over the years and she has often ostracized herself from her family members, in particular, her sisters, who have often been recipients of her wild accusations. They have all been very supportive but they have felt a lot of pain from the wild accusations that she has thrown at them as well.

She will often refuse to leave the house in fear of something going missing. She won't want my dad to leave her side.

I don't know if anyone can help... Just wondering, if anyone has faced anything similar? If you have, (or even if you haven't), any advice/suggestions would be very welcome."
"I've spent almost two hours typing and trying to re-type out a description that accurately explains everything, but I don't want to taint it with my current frustrations, I just need help.

My mom takes handfuls (by her own description, in front of me) of cough medicine pills every day. She's on two anti-seizure meds, one of which is supposedly to help with mania (again, only according to her). Plus years of heavy alcoholism

But her behavior has changed drastically within the last 3 months (long after the start of drug use). She's started picking fights, with me, my stepdad, her sister, anyone who disagrees with her, even over the slightest of things. What concerns me is that every time these fights break out, she very, very quickly breaks into tears, seems to get confused, and accuses whoever she's fighting with of thinking she's crazy. At one point during one of the last few fights, she said ""All the women in my family have gone to insane asylums"", fully unprompted, in an argument about spending habits. 

I guess first: Are any of these things signs of dementia, or do y'all think it might just be drug use issues?

If these are signs of dementia, is it possible that my mom, a smart, aware person for most of her life, is starting to notice the decline, and these fights are a reaction to her fear? (secondary question: If so, what can I do to help?)"
"Im a city bus driver. Today I had to call it in for a confused passenger. Ive never dealt with one before.  I dont even know if this customer has dementia.

The customer was going to work. But he had no idea where his workplace was, what street name it was, what bus number to take or even what metro station to get off at. I asked him whether today was his first day of work and he said no, he's gone to work often.

Oddly enough, he knew the name of his workplace (which wasnt helpful) and the phone number of his sister and his home address.

Is it possible for him to have dementia yet still have good memory of other things? Could it be possible that he's not even employed and simply thinks he's going to work?

As I was driving my bus, he kept wanting to get off my bus and wander about random neighbourhoods to see if he could find his workplace. I absolutely did not want this man to get off my bus. As I drove, I said no that's not a good idea. I dont want you to get lost outside. Its freezing outside. Please wait, I have someone coming to help you find your workplace ok? IT TOOK A LOT FOR ME TO CONVINCE HIM TO STAY ON MY BUS UNTIL SUPERVISORS/POLICE ARRIVED. But he ultimately said he trusts me to help him and sat down.

I dont know what happened to him ultimately, but does this sound like a case of dementia? Did I do everything right?"
"My mother has been living with bipolar disorder her whole life (mainly controlled with medication), unfortunately she had to come off meds due to damage caused and in 2021 had a manic episode which required hospitalization. Usually her episodes are \~3 months, but this one went on for over 12 months. In addition to bipolar she had regular TIAs 'mini strokes' for several years and had Covid-19 last year too. 

There has been a significant decline in her cognitive function and she has now been diagnosed with dementia at age 68. The doctors indicate that bipolar disorder combined with TIAs and other health issues have collectively damaged her brain over time. Before the latest manic episode she had fine cognitive function except for the occasional memory slip.

It seems like very sudden onset, more like a stroke than what I understand from dementia. She has lost most communication, all motivation/interest in anything, poor mobility, a good chunk of memories (although hard to test since she doesn't communicate much). She paces back and forth, has panic attacks, rocks back and forth, but doesn't really do much or speak much and it's hard to get her involved in anything. Basically the symptoms seem quite advanced for her age and the fact this has come on following a manic episode is leaving me confused - it feels like she has jumped forward about 20 years over night!

I also worry about my family as my dad is now essentially a full time carer and he's not young either. I am trying to offer support but don't know how. I am still coming to terms with the diagnosis, but I am interested to hear from others whose parents have had dementia, and especially anyone who has seen bipolar with dementia or experienced this speed of progression."
"My dad has a brain tumor that has cause a cognitive decline over the past 2 years. During all this he’s had Covid and been hospitalized and almost died TWICE. Because of Covid, his cancer treatments have been put on hold twice. Right now we aren’t sure when they will resume. His hematologist oncologist wants to leave him be for now to let him recover from Covid. If he declines more, then we will address it. 

Currently he is in the Veteran Affairs hospital. He’s 100% disabled veteran. They are going to admit him to CLC (Community Living Center) as a temporary resident for rehab. The idea is once he’s stronger he will come home. However, they told us he could be a permanent resident and he qualifies for free as a VA benefit. 

He currently lives with my 72 year old mom. Taking care of him is killing her. She has given up her life to take care of him 24/7 because of his cognitive decline. 

I’m pretty sure I can convince her to transition him to permanent resident. How do I convince my siblings that this is okay. I have 3 brothers? I’m sure they would all hate me for pushing this and thinking I have an agenda. We all live out of state. So none of us can help my mom take care of my dad regularly. 

My only agenda is to save my mom and give her, her life back. She’s physically healthy and mentally sharp. There’s no reason why she should stop living while he verbally abused and bullies her everyday because he doesn’t know any better."
"Hey all,

Just joined this sub today because I am currently the chef of a care home specializing in individuals suffering from dementia. Most of our residents are in their 80s/90s, a couple in their hundreds even!, and a couple in early stages who are still in their 50s. Since starting work here I have unfortunately seen first hand what a horrible disease this is. One struggle we have is getting the residents to eat. I have researched and experimented at great lengths with different foods and techniques, and have seen some improvements. These changes include serving familiar meals that they grew up with, finger foods, small portions, courses served one by one, and lots of cueing and encouragement by the care staff. But there are still some residents who no longer recognize what food is, no longer receive hunger signals from their bodies, and basically live off of supplements (Boost, etc). I have watched these residents take food out of their mouths and look at it as if it's something foreign to them, then set it on a table and wander away. Meanwhile losing weight day after day. I have also seen residents who haven't eaten in days finally take a few bites of food, and how it lights up their faces and moods. Seeing things like that make my day.

I'm reaching in hopes that someone could offer me some new tips and tricks, are you a caregiver and have you found something that works for your loved one? Being a chef and having all the credentials and experience is one thing, but when it comes to this disease the best experience comes from those who deal with this disease regularly and first-hand.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions you may have!


Edit: wow thank you all so much for your kind words and seriously AMAZING tips for me! I'm going to go through all the comments and make a list and see what we can make happen at our community! I honestly was hesitant to post because I was afraid people would tell me to quit my job if I'm asking questions like how to get the residents to eat. It's been hard not to take it personally. So I really appreciate how kind you all have been especially 🙂🙂 you've given me several avenues of hope."
For two weeks we have a family member with dementia visiting. Being outside of their normal routine will be challenging. Any advice for things we can do to help this person during the stay? Thank you!
"My mom has had a series of strokes over the years but has been able to care for herself, with help from me, for the last five years. She lives with me. Yesterday, she stopped making sense altogether. She is being assesed for hospice this week but I don't think she will be accepted, which is fine. I ruled out UTI delerium with antiobiotics and rehyrdation and honestly she does seem a little better but the crazy words and a few strange actions lead me to believe she's had another stroke. I guess I am attempting to find out how this will play out. A nursing home will terrify her so that's not an option and I can pretty much lift her. She is losing weight even though she's hungry BUT her overall weakness since yesterday is really pronounced. She slept all day yesterday. I am afraid of a vegetative state and my incapacity to know what to do. Thanks"
"Hi everyone i’m a 18 year old living with my nan and my dad. My dad has dementia, i’m not sure what kind but it’s in his frontal lobe and he’s only 52. The doctors think he got it from working in a smelter breathing in bauxite for 20 odd years.

It’s got to the stage where he sometimes forgets who i am or who nan is. He has these convulsions where he is addicted to icy poles (frozen and unfrozen) and he often asks me where does he live while he’s sitting on the couch to which I reply “You live here” and he just doesn’t believe it.

He doesn’t remember where his bedroom is and he refuses to leave the house and when he does he gets immediately scared and wants to go home and always asks me do you know where i live i want to go home and that kind of thing.

It’s so scary seeing him like this it was only 2 years ago where my family was all together and happy and then this tore everything apart, mum divorced dad because she didn’t know what was going on so we moved in with nan and now me and her look after him. It’s getting really hard.

Any advice would be appreciated so so much, we plan on getting someone to come and make sure he showers because he won’t do it. Is there anyway to make him feel more comfortable leaving the house and just being at home? I bring the dog in the car with us and that helps a little but he still gets scared and confused… distractions can only help so much. 

If anyone has been in a similar situation especially at my young age please let me know how you dealt with it. It was manageable before he forgot who i was  for the first time and now it feels like i’ve lost him and it’s tearing me apart :( 

Thank you 🙏🏼"
"What creative ideas have you seen or done that would be enjoyable/fun/mentally stimulating to residents in dementia care home ?

Reading stories, puzzles, outings,  music,  dancing ... but what else ?

Open slather, throw in whatever comes to mind .. 😀



Background
-------------------
Mum transitioned to full time dementia rest home care today.  I see myself spending a substantial amount of time there.  While there is time for quality one on one, it appears there is alot of time among and with other residents.  I'm looking to bring fresh ideas and contribute to the wider community as well as my mum ."
"It is very concerning because we are located along the road and the neighbors have seen this morning's situation. I do not mind whatever thought they have on what is happening in our household. I cannot control what they think about us. But it is very disturbing already, she keeps on having tantrums then keeps on saying she wants to die and will attempt to jump off the balcony. We are on the 2nd floor so basically we are very visible to all those down the ground floor and of course the other building apartments. We cannot really explain to each one of them that mom has dementia. But it's already being kind of traumatic for me and my sister already. Because whenever we get out of the apartment, a lot of judging eyes are already on us. As if we did something wrong. I think, that is also the reason why we mostly order out rather than go out. It is really embarrassing. Sometimes, I already expect that one of these days, a social worker will come and visit just to check on us and my mom. Because I think the neighbors are already being concerned that she is being abused, when we never even laid hands on her. But the way she cries and always shouts at us, will probably make them think that way. Sometimes, I already feel terrible for hating my mom for the way she is. But now I even feel more terrible because of hating my mom even more because of the image that she wants our neighbors to perceive about us. I wish there could be centers here in the Philippines that are free who can take care of her instead of us. I know our culture does not really support that kind of idea and it is an unconventional way to treat your relative moreso your parents. But, now I understand why western people do it. Because I think, it hinders your own life by dedicating it solely to taking care of them for years, until you have no years to live for yourself. It is just hard. I am crying right now as I am typing because I feel worse for feeling this way. But, how can one be so calm in situations like this? I feel like my work is being hindered because of what she is doing to us everyday. Today, while trying to calm her down, I took the blows, she slapped me and punched me so hard because for some reason she is very mad, and wanted to die. She wanted me to open the door to the balcony so she can jump off it. I've never felt so embarrassed of her. Our neighbors' thoughts doesn't matter but everytime she does it we can't help but feel embarrassed.

Whenever she wishes that she would die. At the back of my mind, because I am very tired, I couldn't help but wish the same too. Because I am very tired of this everyday. The doctor already gave her additional medicines to calm her and everything but it only gave us additional expenses. Sometimes, I really pray that God would really help us in helping her serve her purpose, if she still has some left. If she already served it, I wish that God would let her go peacefully, no crying, no pain, or anything. Because as my hate grows for her, my love is the opposite. Right now, I feel like I am only taking of her because I am obligated to. I wanted to give back to her as what the elders usually say, but does giving back means giving my own life as well? Was this her plan all along? To bring us to the world and let us suffer? I know that we are living to suffer, but is suffering supposed to be this consistent and continuous?

Sometimes, it is very hard to appreciate things that you have when all the worst things just keep on being highlighted along the way.

Sometimes, I feel like if this keeps on going, I will be the one to let go first. I feel like every hate I feel lowers down my own life expectancy. I'd rather hurt myself, I'd rather die than hurt my mom that I love the most, even if she is no longer lovable. I just pray that I still have the courage to go on. Because sometimes being the eldest person of the house, I have to keep in a lot of emotions just to keep everyone stronger. Cause when I falter, I fear that we will all breakdown into pieces. I'm trying so hard to keep myself sane."
"My mom has been taking care of my grandma who living with us and is suffering from Parkinson’s and early stages of dementia. She can’t work and hardly has any free time anymore and always tells me how exhausted she is from everything that comes with caring for her. We can’t afford a full or part time caregiver, and I’ve heard moving someone with dementia into a nursing home causes them to decline even faster. What other options are there for us? My grandma is only getting worse and it’s taking a huge toll on my mom. How can my mom get her life back and my grandma get affordable care at the same time? My grandma only has Medicare and we don’t have a lot of savings. Any information, recommendations, and well wishes are very appreciated!"
"So my parents are making poorer decisions: Way overspending $2000 on roof work without getting a second bid, choosing not to go to the hospital. Previously my wife's father overpaid the phone bill by $25,000!

We want to avoid these problems. My parents have a lawyer as the POA, and not myself or my sister, the only siblings.

So what do we do when they sign a contract for a $10,000 cat patio? or a new car? Or are thinking about doing it and getting bids?

&#x200B;

EDIT: What I'm getting at, is if I think they are making wrong decisions, do I just go to the lawyer with evidence and tell him? Repeatedly until he takes action?"
"Alright to my Bro doing the right thing and reconnecting  with our mother

 I see better days ahead for all of us I get a weekend it's been over 3 years I get to have friends over or even a scandal it's what I call fun"
"I came across something a few weeks ago that suggested to reduce cholesterol levels or some marker in the blood that begins with T and keep it within range in your 30s and 40s and 50s and 60s to reduce your chances of developing dementia and Alzheimer's. 

I'm in the early days of thinking my mom might have dementia. It isn't showing up as a typical forgetfulness.  Is showing up in mood swings and crazy ranting that doesn't make much sense.  It's not every day.  I was getting ready for work this morning and she had all the laundry appliances running on high even though we have some hight energy costs looming and I made a suggestion to turn of the laundry appliances because the clothes must be Dr by now.  The clothes were already air dried but she had them in the tumble dryer for longer. She was using the tumble dryer without a care in the world towards the rising energy costs.  Then she started shouting at me and it was just crazy making.  All while I was trying to get ready for work. 

I recently found out that her doctor is concerned about her blood results that showed high cholesterol. She said this. She said she refused medicine and she wants to control it through the diet and she wants me to find out how on Google. 

Sometimes I question my own judgement and now I am thinking if dementia is setting in but we don't know it yet."
"I think my mom have have the onset of dementia but it's not showing as forgetfulness.  
She has some angry outbursts ranting at me and often with things that don't make any sense.  It's hard to describe. 
I think maybe dementia is setting in but it's not showing up as forgetfulness.  I think another aspect of it is that she wants to have as much control over everything as possible."
"Sorry if I'm just clogging this place up, I have a lot on my mind after I visited my grandmother yesterday and I need to get some of it out somewhere.
I'm twenty years old and trans FTM. I've been out for around 6 years now. As my grandmothers dementia progressed, I knew that one day she would forget about my transition. I also knew that it wouldn't be personal if she did forget. It's just how dementia is. 
Even though I'd told her it's okay if she slips up, and I don't mind what she says or whether she calls me her granddaughter or grandson, she still did her best. 
In January I visited her, and I was unsure if she remembered me due to her seemingly avoiding talking too much to me. Afterwards my dad spoke to her and asked her upfront if she knew who I was. She apologised to him, saying of course she knew who I was, she just couldn't remember my gender and didn't want to upset me by making a mistake. It was sweet, but also sad. And I felt really bad about it, too. Despite her mind working against her, her top priority was my comfort. I visited her again two weeks ago and this continued.
Then yesterday, me and my dad went to visit her in her new care home. She couldn't tell who I was, and she asked me to take my mask off, which I did (with staff approval.) Upon seeing my face, she immediately grabbed me and pulled me into the tightest hug a frail 83 year old could possibly give, repeating things such as ""my beautiful granddaughter"", telling me how much of a pretty woman I was, and talking about how she'd been waiting for me to visit her for so long. She probably got a lot of confused looks from other residents and maybe even staff, but I didn't care. And I didn't care that she forgot, either. I always told her it was okay if she did. 
It's a sign that her memory is still obviously deteriorating, but really, that's to be expected. She has two types of dementia at once (dual dementia) so sadly, things are probably going to decline quickly. But right now, I'm just glad she doesn't have to worry about ""slipping up"" anymore."
"We're facing the following problem.
My mother is recovering from a thigh fracture right now, as she cannot reliably walk on her own.

She ist sitting most of the time in a chair, she cannot get out of bed.

As the pain lessened, she started to walk on her own again. 
She fell, nothing happened. In the last year she fell about six times, nothing happened, except for bruises. The fall before that she broke her pelvis.

It's only a few meters, but enough to ruin everything. In the moment, sometimes the day or the following days she's aware that she cannot and shouldn't walk alone. ""Discussing"" this issue, she agrees that she shouldn't do it. If she does it, she mostly cannot tell why she did it.

Sometimes it's about getting a jacket or going to another room.
An emergency button, to accommodate her desire to walk is not feasible, as she's using it all the time i.e. to talk to someone in the middle of the night.

We had a webcam installed to monitor her, but this is not feasible, as one cannot monitor her 100% and the stress and pressure is unbearable. Besides there is a delay and she also fell if one saw her getting up.

We haven't tried a pressure mattress yet and reading what I wrote may be the best answer for a timely response to an incident that already happened.

Fixating her in the chair (no idea how to do this) sounds wrong and it's not clear if this is legally possible. On the other hand, at this moment, it feels like the only viable option, to prevent involuntary self-harm and for us to continue the home care.

Am I missing something? Has anybody faced a comparable situation and what was your conclusion or solution?"
"I'm 64. For the past few years, I've had minor memory issues, which I regarded as a normal part of the aging process.

Yesterday, while training someone at work, in mid-sentence I lost a word, the name of an object sitting on the counter. This is new.

I don't have medical insurance; Medicare won't kick in until July at the earliest. Until then, I plan to assume the worst. I'm going to spend the next three months simplifying my life and establishing a regular routine.

If anyone has any suggestions, I'd welcome them. Thanks."
"Dumb question, I know. But I would guess if I woke up the next day and my alleged son told me I had dementia, the first thing I would do would be to take notes. Take notes of everything I learn or relearn. Do people with dementia tend to do that? Does it work to any extent?"
Disclaimer: I’m not the carer. The person is able to be distracted to an extent but is getting to the stage where they are mentally gone back to their childhood and the place they lived then. They’re becoming afraid and looking for help to get back there and the usual distractions aren’t working. Any suggestions?
"TL;DR: how to explain guardianship process to loved one, and looking for ideas on how to convince her to go to assisted living without POA or guardianship due to guardianship process taking too long.

Summary:

My first concern is if/how I should explain the guardianship process to my aunt. She is going to be served notice of the guardianship application next week. She is extremely savvy. Her logic may not be largely intact, but she owned a nursing agency for 30 years and was a very successful, independent woman, and her drive and tenacity have not left her yet. She's aware enough to know the objective of guardianship is take control of her finances (in addition to her medical care). Any ideas on how to spin it so it's not as threatening to her?

Lastly, does anyone have experience convincing or coercing someone who refuses to leave their home into assisted living (without POA or guardianship)? Guardianship will likely take another 6mo, and we don't have enough liquid assets to keep her in her home that long. A caseworker mentioned telling my aunt she needs to stay somewhere for a couple weeks while the house is fixed up. It's a good idea, but my aunt has already figured out it's a ruse. My fear is she'll completely cut off all contact if I try to do anything and then we won't be able to care for her.

Details:

I am in AZ and going through guardianship process in Harris County, TX for my aunt that has Lewy Bodies dementia. She has no children, no POA (too late now), and will not add anyone to her bank accounts. She requires 24/7 care as a fall risk and she's losing the ability to care for herself.

The issue is she is almost out of liquid assets to fund her 24/7 care and refuses to go to assisted living. She says she ""will die in her home"". She has other assets (home, car, misc. collectibles) that could be sold, but she refuses to let anyone help her with finances or selling assets. I'm applying for guardianship, but I'm concerned it will destroy what little goodwill I have left with her. She believes her current condition was caused by a family member assaulting her a few months ago (she actually had a UTI and fell in her home while alone), and that we (family) are trying to put her in a mental institution and steal her assets. I don't take it personally, although my mom (aunt's sister) and other cousins do. My mom is not capable of handling the financial situation, and my cousins are out because my aunt 100% believes they're trying to kill her. I know everyone thinks their LO's suspicions are next level, but my aunt tells every caregiver, medical professional, basically anyone, that we are trying to kill her and steal from her. She spends hours every day talking about it. She has already been committed once due to her paranoia, but they discharged her at first signs of being stabilized. And now she's back home and refuses any medication or treatment. I'm afraid she'll cut off all contact with me and my mom and we won't know if she's being cared for or not.

Edit: spelling"
"I’m new to this sub, so please excuse any ignorance or insensitivity I may show on this subject. I am distantly familiar with some of the behavioural changes that may occur because of dementia. I feel for those who are coping with unusual and new behaviour from loved ones which causes hurt and pain from this condition.

My question has to do with people we know through causal relationships  who may be showing signs of dementia. I met a woman nine years ago through a hobby we both share. At the time, she was early 60’s and seemed like a kind, good humoured, and well adjusted woman. She has no kids, divorced years ago, and no family in the community. She has friends who I know very casually.

I have recently become reacquainted with her through our shared hobby. She’s early 70’s now and seems like a different person. Paranoid, agitated, and angry. She’s also prone to outbursts. Because I’ve heard of behavioural changes caused by dementia, I am wondering if she is showing early signs. It’s hard to believe she’s the same person. I didn’t  know her well in our first social interaction nine years ago, because when I am involved in my hobby, I’m pretty focussed. I’m pretty sure that I would have had an inclination if her current behaviour was a true reflection of her character.

I’m hoping this makes some sense. My gut tells me this disturbing behaviour is somehow caused by dementia or some sort of degeneration. Going on this assumption, I’m wondering what is best way to handle aggressive verbal outbursts. I’ve been biting my tongue because any response seems to agitate her, but it’s wearing and I can’t always avoid her.

I have observed her having these outbursts with others involved with our shared hobby, and I see most people trying to avoid her. She complains that people ignore her because of her age, and I can see this hurts her. Sadly, it’s not ageism, it’s simply people trying to avoid being verbally abused, or listening to her viciously gossip about others. Talking her through situations only seems to cause more agitation. 

I know she has a couple of close friends in the community, so I’m hoping she’s getting some needed social support. I am not inclined to get involved too deeply in her life, as I have my own life and responsibilities. I guess I’m seeking advice on best ways to handle the situation."
"Hello, everyone! I was wondering if anyone could help answer the above question. My dad is currently 67 years old, has a pacemaker, uses oxygen, and about month ago was in the hospital for internal bleeding (I never found out the reason) and seemed to be doing as okay as anyone could be afterwards. However, he came over to my house today to meet my new dog, he didn't bring his oxygen with him, but all seemed normal until he asked me something along the lines of ""Do you remember the little dog mom and dad had? the one they had when you left."" I couldn't remember what he was talking about. I asked ""the dog your parents had or mom's parents?"" he said his parents, and then a little later corrected and said ""The little dog my parents had when Carol moved out"". Carol is my aunt, his sister. Im almost positive with the way he worded his question earlier that he was mistaking me for his sister, something he has never done before. They left about 5-10 minutes later so my dad could go back on oxygen at home.

I haven't discussed this with my mother yet, but I'm planning to soon. This seems like an early sign of dementia but I was wondering if this kind of confusion could happen because his oxygen levels were low or if this is something long term? Any answers or advice is greatly welcomed. Thanks!

TLDR; Dad mistook me for his sister while potentially low on oxygen. Early sign of dementia or temporary confusion caused by low oxygen?"
"I am blind so my husband drove me an hour to where she was assigned.  I had not been sleeping for days.  My body was so fraught with grief, anxiety, tension.  

The staff greeted us warmly. Did the self covid test before going in.  

My mom was shrunken, pale, week.  The cancer eats her so that she cannot eat.  But dementia forgets this.  She asked me to pray, feed her, and hug her. She drank a few drops of liquid.  She tired. We left.  

I know it sounds terrible, but a weight was off me. My brother too (he's the poa/decision maker). 

Tonight I am calm.  I can sleep."
"My grandmother (77) has been acting strange over the past year or year and a half. It started with her forgetting little things more often, having more problems cooking, and needing more help with technology related tasks. Not unusual, except sometimes these tasks were things like changing the batteries in her remote. Then she wanted to add Mom onto her bank account to help her make sure her bills are paid and everything. In all fairness, though, she was preparing to go stay with my Aunt for a few months, so it made sense to have us handle that stuff. She's back from her trip, though, and it's a lot easier to see the changes. Still nothing massive, but she's repeating the same stories a lot, the dogs got fed twice the other night because she forgot Mom had already fed them (she was in the room when they ate the first time and definitely saw), things like that. She's also been kind of mean to my mother lately, and the other day, she accused us of throwing some of her cups away. That also isn't like her, but she and my mother have fought before, 

She brought it up to me earlier. Someone with Alzheimer's happened to come up in conversation, and she made a comment about how she knows she's going to end up like that someday, she just doesn't know when. It's worth mentioning that she knows a good bit about Alzheimer's. She was a psychiatric nurse for awhile, and both her mother and her husband had it before they passed, and she was their caretaker. She also said that she knows my aunt thinks she's having memory problems, but she doesn't think they're that bad yet. I asked her gently if she's seen a doctor about it, and she said no, she didn't think it was necessary. I suggested that it might be a good idea, because maybe she just needs to use Oxygen for her COPD more often or something similar. She just said that she doesn't think she's out to lunch yet, and that it isn't that big of a deal yet. I wasn't sure what to say and I agreed. I figure that it's still kind of true because aside from maybe needing a little more guidance in her finances just to make sure everything is covered, nothing is preventing her from taking care of herself yet. But is there a best way to talk to loved ones about this? She's not the type to be afraid of talking about this kind of thing. She's been continuously making adjustments to her will to make sure everything is right just in case for the past 20 years, at least, she has already paid for her funeral and picked everything out (except for the flowers, because she doesn't know what season she'll pass in), toured several nursing homes for herself as well as papa, and let us know which one she'd like to be in if it was impossible for her to stay at home, etc."
"I NEED HELP 

My fil in December got confused and thought he needed to wipe his ass everytime he peed. With kidney failure that’s every 10 minutes. So to remind him I put a sign above the toilet paper “for poop only” and put a lock on my cabinet where I keep tp. 
It was all good until about 2 weeks ago. When I realized there was a couple empty tubes in the trash. Weird but I’m also kinda lazy so I figured I hadn’t changed the trash in a while. I changed the trash and left 3 rolls+1 on the dispenser so I could keep an eye on it. 


Well a week later my wife let me know that the trash was full as she knew I was keeping an eye on it. There was 12 empty rolls in the trash and my container was half full we learned he can open the cabinet. Of course I hid all the tp and tissues (upstairs where he can’t find it) 

We now give him 3-4 square unless he poop then we check to see if he poop (because he will lie to you trying to get tp) then give him a reasonable amount 


This now has caused the issue where he will sit and push to try and poop just to get tp. And tell you he was diarrhea (he doesn’t) 


Help. I’m out of ideas. He can’t use a bidet he’s too far passed that."
"My mother has always been distrustful of everyone, most of all me. Everyone is always out to get over on everyone else, especially family. She handled all her own affairs, no financial advisors, no help from anyone because everyone was always out to cheat or steal. In her mind one ever does anything nice just to be nice, there’s always an ulterior motive. Down to the simplest act like sending a greeting card or gift. Her dementia has only amplified this. On some level I get it. I mean, if I was confused ALL the time I’d be agitated, wondering who I can trust. But I’m her only surviving child, and I’m living a successful life in my own right. And not only do the accusations come all the time, so do the insults. She takes real events and memories and misremembers them, casting me as the bad guy or the idiot all the time. When someone does something she doesn’t like/trust/approve of, I am behind it. I’m so tired of it. I’m killing myself trying to help her, worried about how much work I’m missing for her care, fielding constant phone calls to hear her complaints and calm her anxieties. Only to be insulted and accused of all manner of wrongdoing. I’d like to cut and run, but I’m all she has and I just… I’m not that cruel.
Thanks for letting me vent."
"Both my parents have dementia and I made the idiotic, but well-intentioned, decision to move back in with them to help them. 

Dad was diagnosed around 5 years ago, but has been relatively stable. He and mom are still fully independent, but they sometimes struggle with simple tasks. 

Now, it appears my mother (who is undiagnosed ATM) has suddenly lost the ability to hide her dementia symptoms, which she had been doing potentially for years.

Every single day, she tries to do something super easy, and goes into a tail spin / has a full on meltdown. She repeats the same phrases (“I’m tired, I’m tired!” , “I do all the work”, etc.)

She basically does nothing all day, but tells us and herself, and her friends/family over the phone, that all she does is work all day and how useless me and my father are. She will do 5 minutes of work in a day and will spend the rest of the day about how she hasn’t even had a chance to rest. 

If I try to help her, she inevitably screams at me and explodes, blaming me / calling me a horrible son, worthless, comparing me to more successful cousins / family friends my age.

If I do nothing, she just fills the house with her yelling and cursing. I feel like there is no way to win or help. 

Has anyone experienced this? If so, what remedies have you tried? Hoping there may be an alternative solution that I haven’t thought of or discovered through reading."
"She's always had a propensity toward punching down, casual digs, and generally assuming the world owes her.  Me going to college and having my own life = abandoning her.  Story not unique.

I've been around here long enough to know there's nothing to be done about it.  So I guess I'm just venting."
"TLDR: Many folks here have talked about hard transitions they had with loved ones when they arrived at assisted living. I was curious if you found any particular actions or activities as helpful in turning the tide. 

By next week we’ll have moved my mom, who has mid to severe dementia, to an assisted living facility near my home (after a cross country move). 

A source of guilt is that we’re choosing not to discuss the living arrangement in detail. She knows she’ll have care (she already has it in her house). But travel with her even in health was difficult, and she’s generally happy at the idea of coming for an extended stay with us. So we don’t want to discuss things that might bring anxiety to the move process, and she’d probably forget anyway.

A source of anxiety then is how she’ll react when we’re there, since we won’t have discussed it. I keep telling myself that it’s not my pre-dementia mom we’re doing this for. That we can’t expect any particular response even if we discussed it at length. So we’ll just improvise as we go.

The anxiety above is why I’m posting to get feedback on people’s experiences, what works.

Her facility is really wonderful. As far as they are concerned we should give my mom as much space as possible, that they are willing/expecting to do the work to gain her trust and make her happy. My inclination is to visit every day, though, at least early on, so that there’s somewhat of a vacation feel to the initial few weeks. Then we can start integrating longer solo periods (e.g. I have work today, kids have after school, see you tomorrow) or something like that."
"Caring for someone with dementia can be brutal.  Deeply frustrating for all parties.

Which is why we sometimes share whatever humor we can find, maybe dark, along the lines of laughing-so-we-don’t-cry (or scream, etc)."
"I decided to join this sub a little bit ago to start educating myself on Dementia, and to read about people’s experiences as care takers. My parents have done their due diligence in regularly getting tested for Alzheimer’s and as we had feared, my Mom’s (70yo) test results were not great this year. To be fair, they weren’t the worst-case scenario, but they were concerning.

After gently encouraging her to see a neurologist, they confirmed that she does have MCI. We think we might have gotten the diagnosis relatively early in her journey as she doesn’t currently have Dementia. My Dad, sibling and I are doing our best to learn more about MCI and Dementia, and reading up on ways to be compassionate care givers and humans to my Mom on this journey.

My parents are extremely responsible and have always been good about transparent communication with my sibling and I. Late last year we put together a Trust and designated myself and my sibling as the POA (financial and medical), outlined their DNR requirements and made a lot end-of-life plans. It was difficult and there’s more to be done, but knowing what they want and how to ensure they live the rest of their years with dignity and the most comfort possible has given me some comfort.

That said, I have been really scared about my Mom’s diagnosis. I can imagine she is too since one of her biggest fears was losing her memory the way her Mom (my grandmother) did. She’s strong despite her understandable fears. I just want to do what I can to support my Dad who will be her primary care taker and find ways to live her life to the fullest while she’s still very functional.

Thank you all for sharing your stories, your advice and recommendations, and for providing a safe space to talk about a really difficult thing."
"Just shoot me. Kill me or her. No one deserves to live this way - me, keeping time by her bowels, or her, shitting on herself and forgetting who we are."
"Sorry this could get long. Mostly a vent.

First post here. My mom is showing signs of dementia. She has been for a year or two now. She remembers who we are, who she is, her past, even her bank account numbers and things that have been the same for several years. But she often forgets where she is, how long she's lived in her apartment, the day/year, current events. She often forgets things she just said or things we just told her. She tries to write everything down but then loses her notepad she was writing in, so she scribbles all over anything within reach taking notes of every little thing. She has an appointment with her doctor soon to discuss everything and seek help.

Yesterday I became exponentially worried. She fell for a computer scammer. I had to leave work early to come help her reset all of her passwords and call her banks to make sure nothing was compromised. I spent six hours there in total, and tried my best to drill it into her the steps to take to avoid it. We agreed that leaving notes above her computer was a good idea so that she'd see them warning her and be able to stop it in its tracks if it happened again.

Well, today, not even 24 hours later, she did it again. She called me crying because she doesn't want me to remove her computer. She self isolates due to depression and doesn't have contact with the outside. She orders all her clothing and groceries on her computer and phone, but I would rather take them away than risk her losing what little financial independence she has left.

She lives in independent living right now and if she would just leave her room she'd be able to have church service, watch movies, have dinner, play games and more all in the same building! But she hasn't left in over two years because she's depressed, so instead she non stop orders things online and is living almost like a hoarder (not unsanitary though), and now falling victim to scammers left and right.

This isn't the first worrisome thing. A few weeks ago my husband, son, and I went to visit as a surprise and came into a smokey apartment because she'd left a pie in the over for who knows how long and it was black and burning in the oven. She had no idea because she forgot she put it in there and couldnt smell the burning or see the smoke. If we didn't show up she might have started a fire and the worst could have happened.

She's fought us left and right about taking away any iota of freedom. She's physically capable of caring for herself, she can bathe etc. But she gets confused and forgets extremely important things from one second to the next and even today she told me she doesn't know how to protect her from herself.

I don't know what to do. I'm barely 28, just got a good job, my son is under 10, I'm trying to go back to school and I'm so tired and overwhelmed. I don't know how to help her. I didn't sign up for this. Not to mention, the first 17 years of my life I had to watch my dad suffer through Parkinson's before he passed away at 81, so I know the horrors that can come next. Now it feels extra traumatic watching the only parent I really had with me during my whole life going through the early phases of memory loss too.

I've looked into memory care but I don't know if we could afford it, especially since she's still somewhat independent physically. We want to buy a house in the next year or two and have a special ADA suite added on for her so we can care for her and also utilize her LTC insurance to help. We don't want to just put her somewhere and let her rot away, we love her and are scared for her and just want the best.

Yes I was raised by my grandparents and no the rest of our family isn't in the picture. It's just me, my husband, and my son. We don't have any other support or resources. Thanks for letting me vent.

TLDR my mom is showing signs of dementia and is at risk of being scammed and I'm too young to be prepared to handle this and it all makes me very sad and scared and I don't know what to do."
"My father is pretty late stage dementia but still moving around on his own from time to time at night to go to the bathroom. When he goes back to bed, he has trouble getting back into the bedding. 
Any tips on helping with this would be immensely helpful, I want him to maintain his dignity and independence at whatever level is possible as long as possible."
"So my sister husband and I went to go visit my grandparents at their house in Florida last week and either my grandpa hates me and my sister or his dementia has gotten very bad. The first  two days were fine he was his happy loving self. But wow on the third day we were there WOW did he wake up on the wrong side of the bed. He told my sister and I that we were taking advantage of him. That we were disrupting his lifestyle.. and that we were never allowed back. For context we are in our 30s and have been visiting them for years. We had not visited in 3 years due to Covid/work and he had been asking my grandma why no one visits anymore… now I know why. My aunts and uncles had been mentioning that his dementia is bad he went on medicine and it seemed like it had subsided. My aunts no longer stay with him they get a hotel. My grandma loves for us to stay it keeps her company and we help with things around the house. The next day was fine he was joking with us saying too bad we weren’t staying for longer. Oh but the worst was yet to come the next morning. I woke up to him asking my grandma (they were outside in the patio outside my window). He asked if they had asked us to come see them or if we came on our own. My grandma replied that we had come to see them on our own (assuming that’s what he wanted to hear) oh wow did that set him off he barged into my sister’s room telling her that we were worthless, to get our things and get out, that we don’t help them with anything, we are “cheap”, that he told us not to come. Meanwhile we are always helping them be it cleaning, cooking computer needs etc. But wow he was RELENTLESS. He was even “apologizing” to my husband for our behavior right in front of us. Like a mean girl talking about someone in front of them. My poor grandma sits there and can’t say anything to him (they are old school like that) and she had not addressed the elephant in the room. I can see she is so tired. She tried to make plans for all of us but my grandpa “wanted to go home” and she would cancel. I know it is so hard for her, she talks to my mom about how he can get stern and other times doesn’t remember her. My mom even had my clean out my room at my parents house for her to stay when need be. Then when we left he did not remember me he looked at me like he had a totally blank stare and was trying to be polite. He did remember my sister and husband. Maybe because I heard the yelling that morning and hid from him all day. He was perfectly pleasant and said next time we’ll do this.. (meanwhile he was kicking us out a few hours before). It definitely hurt that he didn’t remember me, I think it may have clicked as I was out the door as he gave me a cheerful wave. This has never happened before and I can’t help to think these are subconscious thoughts… (don’t want that to sound empathetic I just kills me to hear that from my previously loving grandpa) but then again I haven’t been around him for an extended period of time in about three years. I wish I could understand where the rotten words were coming from… or if he’s at the “hallucinations” stage he thinks all of this because he can’t remember… Anyone have any insights?"
"I'm hoping someone else out there has some experience with this. I placed my mom with (I'm guessing) about Stage Five/Six Alzheimer's in an Assisted Living facility back in September. In December, they moved her into Memory Care. In the six months that she's lived there, they've sent her to the emergency room in the middle of the night three times. For reasons that don't seem medically necessary:

Visit One: The facility staff said that she was wandering and they were afraid she was going to wander out of the building. (This was before the move to the locked Memory Care unit.)

Visit Two: She was found in another resident's room without clothes on. They actually didn't even tell me she was sent to the ER. I got a notification from the hospital's patient portal app. The facility refused to speak with me to explain what happened for about 24 hours. When I finally got a hold of someone, they claimed that she got aggressive when they tried to remove her from the other resident's room, and that's what triggered the ER visit. (Turns out, she had a UTI.)

Visit Three: This one happened tonight. There's a stomach bug going around the facility. My mom was sick and threw up. Supposedly, my mom asked about going to the hospital. I talked to the head nurse, and we decided mom would NOT go to the ER. (If she was still stick tomorrow, I'd take her to urgent care.) Less than two hours later, I get a notification from the patient portal app indicating that my mom's in the ER. Then the facility night shift med tech called me after that. I'll admit, I went off on them a little bit. The first med tech I talked to claimed that my mom was threatening to hit herself, and that's why they sent her. The second med tech said nothing about behavioral issues and said they just sent her because she was sick and that they sent ALL the sick residents with the stomach bug to the ER. She also said that if my mom says she wants to go to the hospital -- despite having Alzheimer's and me saying no -- they HAVE to send her.

From the early test results, seems like she has a UTI now too.

Is this normal? Do other memory care facilities frequently send residents to the ER for reasons that are not medical emergencies?

The facility she's in is private pay. But these hospital bills are starting to add up. I just got the bill for the ambulance ride from Visit Two. It's $700! Plus all the tests and x-rays and whatnot. Each visit probably costs more than $1,000 even after insurance. We just can't do this every other month. 

Maybe it's cruel to even be mentioning money, but I just don't know how long she'll need care and don't want to burn through her savings.

And sending a woman with Alzheimer's to the ER all by herself seems cruel. On top of this, after the first two ER visits, I noticed a drop in cognition that she never quite 100% recovered from.

This is supposedly the best facility in the area. And I'm worried and angry, but also afraid that my being difficult will end up getting my mom labeled a problem resident or something. Does anyone have any advice??"
"My dad had a TBI in 2020 that jump started his dementia. I've worked with mental illness and been around elderly my whole life. My sister is a CNA and has been my father's primary care giver since his fall. 

I live 1100 miles away. 3-4 times a year I come to spend a week with my parents and give my sister a break. I also make sure they have all the supplies they need and any adaptive equipment that might be helpful. It's not much and I have a ton of guilt, but I do what I can without giving up my whole life. 

I go home tomorrow and I am exhausted. I don't know how my sister does it. By far the most frustrating aspect of my father's condition is his unwillingness to complete his personal hygiene. And by that I mean not yell at me while I'm cleaning him or to let me help him to the bathroom instead of sitting with a soaked bottom. 

I can handle the crazy talk. I can deal with the same questions 100 times a day. I'm ok with the inability to hold a conversation with what used to be a very intelligent man. But if anyone would've told me that he would refuse to shower or even go to the toilet most of the time, I wouldn't believe them. 

My father was always meticulous with his personal hygiene and dress. The man had heart surgery and insisted we take his dirty clothes out on a hanger in a garmet bag so they wouldn't get wrinkled. He ironed his undershirts. 

The memory aspect I'm ok with. I accept that the next time I'm here he might not know me. I just wish he would let us care for him and keep him clean without a fight. Any words of wisdom on this subject would be appreciated, but I really just needed to commiserate. 

My respect to those of you who do this day in and day out.  You are the kind of people who give me hope in humanity."
"So, mom's in late 70's and has dementia. Bro and I took care of her in her own home for about 4 months. It was awful for my family to have me MIA several days a week suddenly. I work full time,  have 4 kids -- 3 in HS and 1 started  college, husband works 60+ hours a week,  very busy, so not able to pick up much slack for me at home.  Bro has no kids and lives 40 mins away I live 20 mins away.  Bro owns mom's house and has high paying paying gig work and lovely, successful wife. 
Bro moved mom into his home to sell her home. He likes arrangement  and mom seems to be doing well. I was not part of planning. I  am  expected to cover 1 or 2 days of weekend. I can't take it. I am fried with my work/family and now my two days off are committed to caretaking or squeezing all housework/parenting into 1 day on weekend. The kicker? Mom favored bro and had issues with me (even bro admits she has issues with women but thinks i should overlook this).  Bro wants to do caretaking  and I don't think i can do it.  Do I have options?"
"She hasn't tried to use it in years, but today, I caught her trying. 

So this is another level of stress I don't need. lol (If I don't laugh I'll cry)"
"My MIL has had a very rough couple of months. She lost her husband, moved across the country to be closer to my wife and our family. 

As you would expect, she is very confused, scared, and agitated at times. We just got her a phone in her room (not sure if that was a good or bad idea), but she was using the facilities phone prior. 

It's difficult to pick up the phone when she calls because we'll have to tell her again (and again) that her car isn't out front, she's not going home, etc. It's extremely taxing for my wife when they have the same conversation over and over. 

Have others experienced the same, and how did you deal with it? Also, is giving her a phone a bad idea?"
"My mom and I care for my grandma who had a heart attack last year and is dealing with numerous physical issues as well as showing signs of dementia/mental decline. Her mother had dementia so I know it’s likely that she will too and I’m hoping to get her into the right doctor and get a proper diagnosis soon.

My mom and I both live with chronic illnesses, I’m a FT student finishing my BA, we have two older dogs that are having a lot of health issues, so we’re juggling a lot.

Mom had to take one of the dogs to the vet, right after she left I heard my grandma head towards the laundry room (she struggles with walking but refuses to use her walker so I worry about falls) - I came in and said “please just leave the laundry for now”. She really can’t work the machine anymore and I don’t expect her to but of course I don’t say that.

She got very upset and her reaction was a mix of shutting herself in her bedroom but also telling me I’m going to end up alone, I can’t even take care of myself so I shouldn’t try to take care of her, she’s going to move out, etc.

I know it’s the disease (I have a bit of a healthcare background as well) but it really hurt. It’s like she somehow knew what to say that would hurt me most. I tried to explain that I was washing the laundry in hot water because she’s been sick and I want to get everything really clean but no luck. She just kept repeating insults.

My mom and I don’t have a lot of help or people to talk to about being caregivers and I just needed somewhere to vent. Thanks for listening.

Edit: Thank you everyone! She later apologized so I’m not sure if she became more aware of what she said or how harsh some of it was, if this happens in early stages, etc. But I’ve read each comment and I appreciate it. It’s just a bit difficult to reply right now."
"My grandmother is in her 90s and had rapid mental decline the past two years. She’s in palliative care right now. As of a week ago she could sort of follow a conversation, knew who I was, and so on. The past two days she hasn’t been able to make a lucid response to anything I say. Tonight she’s talking nonstop to nobody in particular, sometimes calling out for her mother, sometimes talking to people who aren’t here. I can’t get her to respond enough to me to get her to eat or drink. What other progression is typical? I’m trying to prepare myself for what I know is coming, but I wasn’t expecting her to be so non responsive to me; it’s like I’m not here at all and it’s heartbreaking trying to get her to eat. 

Health wise she’s dealing with a lot of pain from arthritis but otherwise she isn’t facing any organ failure that I know of - aside from what I know is on the way because she’s simply not eating enough to sustain herself. 

Any advice or insight would be welcome. I know what’s just around the corner and I’m not ready for it yet."
"Title is pretty self explanatory, it could be for Android or iOS, the more suggestions the better, and thank you in advance.   


If you use it and could describe why and how it helps you, that would also be much appreciated. What are the features you like and what features did you wish it had?  


Thank you!"
"Dad has had noticeable MCI for several years, recently got a diagnosis of Alzheimer's / dementia, and was reported to the DMV by his neurologist. He has a wonderful girlfriend that basically lives with him and has been helping to organize his affairs as he experiences challenges. She now wants to recuse herself from everything, feeling (understandably) that it's not her place. 
The problem is that I live several states away, and my only sibling has zero desire or ability to be helpful in any way.

Dad misplaces his phone every 20 minutes. Even when he's holding it, he does not notice when I call, he can't respond to texts, does not check email... It is a source of frustration for me as I try to manage his financial affairs, medical affairs, will / trust, driving situation, etc. from afar.

I thought it might be helpful if he has an Apple watch or fitbit or something that will alert him by vibration or sound if he gets a text or call, and can be used to set a daily alert to check his email from his computer. He is willing to try to learn how to use it. Cost is not really a consideration.

Does anyone have knowledge / experience / ideas about devices that may aid in this situation?"
"Almost 4 years since her diagnosis, though she surely had it longer.  It was a slow, steady decline until January.  Then she got COVID and I think that just sped everything up.  She never fully recovered.  In February, she went to the ER because she was having seizures.  Turns out she had a urinary tract infection that went septic.  Spent a few days in the ICU, then several more days in a regular hospital bed.  From there to a rehab center, but still bed-ridden and her mind was deteriorating rapidly.  Didn't recongize people, thought she was a child at times, and in constant pain.  Last week, she was moved into Hospice Care and was giving straight morphine for the pain, which helped a lot but made her totally spaced out and even more incoherent.  And then yesterday, she passed away.  It's heart breaking, but at least she can finally rest and is no longer in pain."
"I've lurked these boards for years, trying to solve the riddle of what our journey would look like, when it would end, how it would end, what I needed to do to be prepared for everything.  I read the posts from others about their journeys trying to find similarities and trajectories.  There's not as much information out there about vascular dementia progression as there is other dementias, so I'd like to share our experience in the hopes of helping others.  

My loved one had vascular issues for years.  She had had heart surgery about a decade ago but was doing well.  She was still able to walk on her own up until a year and a half ago.  I had been helping her for years but noticed in late 2016 - 2017 that she wasn't caring for herself as well as she used to. I talked her into selling her house since I was too far away to come as frequently as she would need. She moved into an assisted living facility.  She didn't like it one bit, but she did it.  That's when things really started to progress.  

The moved really highlighted just how bad she had become. Her memory was still very good - thankfully that remained in tact for much of the last 5 years.  Little things started to go, but people and events stayed.  Her dementia seemed to mostly attack her ability to figure out or interpret the world around her. 

One of the first things I noticed was her having difficulty writing checks.  Not remembering bills necessarily, but moreso how to write a check.  Letters that she would write started to become more messy. Words would be misspelled (she was an impeccable writer and flawless speller) or inverted or used incorrectly.  She also had difficulty using the key to her door.  When we would go shopping, she had difficulty reading the packages and only recognized items she purchased each week.  

I admit, these seem like pretty advanced issues, but I didn't notice until I looked back in retrospect what all these things meant.  She was very good at covering, especially in her own home.  

While in the assisted living, her disease progressed slowly.  She was able to walk about, go out to the stores and get her hair/nails done, anything she wanted.  She ate with utensils and drank from a cup with zero issues.  She toileted independently and had no incontinence.  Her memory remained good.  The main progression I saw during this time was that she started getting rid of everything - she gave away stuff or cut it up or ripped it and threw it out. Fidgety type behaviors I guess.  She called friends and family for chats or gripes but the agitation that she expressed at this time did become increasingly worse. 

She lived at the assisted living for years until she started having falls.  She went to the hospital (during covid) and they wouldn't allow anyone in with her.  She ""came to"" in the hospital and panicked.  She thought she had been kidnapped and was being tortured.  They chemically and physically restrained her.  All they had to do was let me in to explain to her and hold her hand, but they wouldn't.  I will always resent that with all my being.  Covid was no excuse to do that to her.  

Needless to say, this event really damaged her.  She never recovered.  She was placed in a memory care unit from the hospital.  She went from walking with a cane to being wheelchair bound for the rest of her days.  Her dementia progressed rapidly. 

The last 1.5 years she spent in this facility she slowly became less and less able to talk. She could ask questions and would remember many things still but if you asked her a question outside of the usual ""how are you?"", ""are you in any pain?"", ""how was your dinner last night?"", she would be unable to understand or answer appropriately.  

She also became incontinent - first single, then later on about a year in, double.  She became unable to drink from a cup without a straw.  She stopped using utensils  and could only feed herself with her hands.  She spent much of her time with a blank stare and didn't engage much.  She had always been such a social person.  

The last few months, she finally started to forget me.  She knew me, and with some explaining, she would remember me, I am so incredibly grateful for that.  But when I would see her, she would look at me for a while, I'd tell her in as many different ways as I could, that I was hers until she'd finally remember... and then she was so happy.  I cherish that so much.  

The beginning of the end for her was a bump on her leg.  We don't know what caused it, but for a month, it didn't get any smaller.  She didn't express any pain at all and the doctors said to treat it like a contusion.  They assumed she bumped the wheelchair or table or something of the sort.  

One day, the skin gave way and it burst.  The wound was treated and it appeared as though it was finally resolving.  Unfortunately, it became infected.  She was taken to the ER at the first sign of fever. The amazing doctor there called me. She was so compassionate and respectful of my loved one. She said my LO had sepsis.  She had read my LO's healthcare directive and knew that she didn't want any antibiotics and so suggested hospice.  I agreed and the placement was made.  Before she left the hospital, though, an ER nurse called me and asked me if I wanted to talk to my LO on the phone. I spoke to her for a few minutes, told her I loved her and that I was on my way and would be with her in a few hours.  She didn't respond, but the nurse said she was blinking her eyes and was listening.  I am forever grateful for that nurse, because that was the last time I spoke to her while she was awake.  

She arrived at the hospice but wasn't responding when they tried to give her something to drink.  She was no longer able to swallow.  Fluids and food were then stopped.  Morphine was administered.  She never opened her eyes again.  I stayed with her as long as I could each day - leaving only to eat and sleep.  On her sixth day, I left to get lunch.  I kissed her and told her I'd be back.  

On my way back to the hospice, I got the call.  She had passed ten minutes ago.  I wasn't there.  I didn't want her to be alone, but I suppose that's what she wanted.  I wanted so badly to be there with her. I hope she wasn't waiting for me. She was so very loved and I was so very loved by her.  What a blessing our love for each other was. 

&#x200B;

Ultimately, our dementia journey lasted 5 years of active management although it probably began before then (I just didn't recognize it). I don't think she had any ""step-like"" progression like they say. Hers was just a slow, steady decline, punctuated  by two hospital stays.  There were no strokes or big health events.  She was 95. 

I hope this may help some of you on your journey with your loved ones.  While you're going through it, it's so frustrating and so hard.  The not knowing is tremendously hard.  Keep loving them as fiercely as you do, even when you don't feel like you're loving them, you are through your actions.  Love is an act as well as an emotion. Let your acts carry you through the times when your heart's just not in it.  And be kind to yourself."
"Hello everyone. My parents are suffering with early dementia yet are “functional” and living independently in a senior community. However, their short term memory is declining. I would love to put a large screen on their wall that I can update from afar (I am out of state) with reminders, notices, etc. that they can’t miss and need to interact with to get information. 

They are not good at writing things down (notepads, whiteboards). If I can update a device myself and post it digitally, I’m hoping that will help. 

I purchased an Amazon Show but they don’t think to ask it what their schedule is for the day. And I’m not sure how much they use it since I’m not there day to day. 

Also, my Mother is constantly losing her iPhone so we can’t rely on any reminders coming from that device. 

Any suggestions?

Thanks!"
"I (43F) moved mum (70F) into a memory care facility on Monday. She has called repeatedly asking to leave, offering money to pick her up, very upset. I know this is best for her but can't help but feel like I'm failing her. I was her source of security and could calm her when others couldn't. Now I'm the one causing upheaval.

Update: Thank you all for the kind words and encouragement. Mum ate breakfast today, participated in an exercise class and chatted with others in the hallways. And the got her to shower last night! Small (major) victories!"
"My aunt (73) recently suffered (an as yet unexplained to me) a health event & was hospitalized. She was diagnosed with congestive heart failure & was very cognitively impaired. 

She has since had stents placed to increase blood flow, but has permanent vascular dementia. I would say it’s fairly advanced, since she cannot recognize her own husband or children most days. 

I have not seen her yet myself. I’ve been trying to take care of the family members who’ve been more directly affected. But I’m dying inside. 

I’m mourning a person who is still here and I can barely stand to be in my own skin right now. 

I guess I need advice. Do & dont’s. That sort of thing. The very last thing I ever want to do is upset her. Even if she has no idea who I am, what can I do to make sure that my visit is a pleasant one for her?

I love her so much. I just…I don’t know how to do this. 

I’m sorry if this post is all over the place. I’m not exactly coherent right now."
"Hi. I’m taking care of my 81 year old aunt who may have had a series of mini strokes or may just be developing dementia. I took her in to see her doctor because she wasn’t eating enough and was getting confused. So he put her on 15 mg of mirtrazapine which I thought was awesome. She started eating more, sleeping better and was just more like herself, although pretty groggy in the morning. A month later, she began taking Nameda and she has been doing really well on that but, here’s the weird thing. She’s about 5’3” or 5’4” and weighs 155 pounds. When she first started developing confusion, I noticed she was better on days when she ate a lot — but it’s not like you can eat your way out of a stroke or dementia, right? 


Can anyone think of a reason why my aunt does better on days when she eats a lot?  Thanks."
"I am pissed...I am furious...2 years gone and I still cry, I still want to scream all my fury and loss up into the sky. If you have the time, I'd like to tell you a story. I will try not to ramble, but it's a story that needs to be told if only to hopefully put it to rest....
  Growing up it was my mom and I, we had my grandparents and aunt and uncle's but they were rarely around. My grands were abusive and the others indifferent. My mom put herself through college and worked her ass off to put a roof over our heads... something I never really understood the strain of until I grew older. 
  She had always been eccentric, always a little off but in a fabulous way in most regards. We had the first home computer in our neighborhood, one of the first to connect to the internet..she loved art, music cooking and medieval history.I'm telling you all this to gain a grasp of her intellect.  My entire life I never heard a lie leave her lips or a curse worse that calling someone a ""nut nut"". Was she perfect?? Fuck no. I had been asking her to seek help for mental health issues since I was 20...I'm 42 now. I promise you this is all relevant. 
  She started really sliding down hill around 15? Years ago. It's hard to judge times...like I said she was eccentric, I just thought my crazy mom is acting like my crazy mom. Until it was more than that. I blew off a lot of what in retrospect I shouldn't of because they were very, very big warning bells. What finally woke me up to her mind truly slipping was that she could not remember what car was mine parked in my own driveway, a car I had had for 10 years. 
 A bunch of other slips started happening, couldn't remember my kids ages, her personality started to rapidly change... very VERY! Angry. I did finally manage to get her to see a psych doctor. The list of disorders was almost a page long ( this happened before she got to far gone btw). PTSD anxiety depression were at the forefront.
 Then the delusions started. 'theres someone climbing on the roof"" "" there's a peeping Tom at the window'  she made multiple phone calls to the police about a random neighbor and a highschool friend trying to drive her crazy.   I became very good friends with the police. 
 I should state that at this time she was living with my alcohol grandmother as my grandmother's caretaker. They did not have the best if relationships at the best of times.  My grandmother was also a horder. 
 The situation progressed until the council of elders intervened. My mother's doctor would not listen to any of us, wanting only to focus on her diabetes...bitch the lady can't take her meds if she can't remember them.  She was finally placed in an assisted living facility. Unfortunately she continued to decline at a very rapid rate. She would constantly try to escape thinking my grandmother's house was right outside. She got very mean and very violent even as her body forgot how to function, by the end I couldn't get her into my car to take her home for weekends. 
 I'm losing steam writing this. 2020 hit and I couldn't see her at all until it was to late, but really it had been to late for at least 4 years...that was our last really coherent talk anyways. I got to talk to her on the phone a few times but always set her off. I got a call from the home that she was in the hospital for a UTI...later get a call from the hospital that I had better get paperwork signed cause it looked like she was checking out soon. Ketoacidosis. Her whole body is shutting down. 
 I run down there, an hours drive from here, covid regs so I can only stay 15 minutes and that's only because it's an end of life visit...fuck that. I climbed in bed with her, put on her favorite music on my phone and I laid right there for an hour. That is where we did goodbye. I had a few blessed minutes where she was there, where she knew who I was. It didn't last long but she hadn't known me in 3 years so I will take that time to my grave
 2 days later she was moved to another hospital even farther away, I was told to come say goodbye again. It was an active covid floor so I had to sign a bunch of waivers and get suited up in a marshmallow suit. I called all the fam on video chat, laid down next to her husk and tried to be as brave as I could as I talked and tried to assure everyone without breaking myself.  I got the call she had passed that night.  No wake, no funeral..just me by myself going to deal with the morge and her ashes. 
  Bottom line to anyone still reading...I'm still pissed. I'm furious something like this could happen to someone who tried so hard to be a decent person despite all the odds and unfairness and suffered so much before dementia got it's hooks in. I want her back. I want the time that was robbed. She died at 62, she left me in her 50s. I hope when my time is up I get to sock god one for all the people lost within themselves cause it's a living hell. 
 End rant

 Edit: thank you to the nurses at Cape cod hospital for not kicking me out after 15 minutes. You have no Idea how much that time ment to me.

"How do I pay myself? I am a power of attorney for a widowed parent with Alzheimer's.  She lives with me, and I am the primary caregiver.   I am not seeking to take advantage of her, but she has the funds and caregiving without payment is making me financially stressed. Still, as her POA, I don't want to write checks to myself because that seems like a conflict of interest. Should I set up a trust with the caregiver agreement terms as part of the trust? What do you guys do?"
"My wife and I moved in with my parents last summer to help my step-father with caregiving for my 78-yr-old mother, who has vascular dementia. Over these past 9 months we have witnessed and experienced this man's relentless barrage of condescending comments and criticisms towards all 3 of us, but particularly towards his wife/my mother.  

I saw snippets of this growing up and then when visiting home over the years, but pre-dementia my mother was assertive and able to hold her own in arguments. He was also less blatant and aggressive when others were around. This past year we've been seeing him at his unfiltered worst.  

We really suspect that 40 years of constant verbal/emotional abuse could be a major contributing factor in my mother's dementia. Her brain's solution to decades of unrelenting stress?"
"My mom (early dementia) and dad (Alzheimers) are both in a facility, but I am constantly having to respond to one ""crisis"" or another. Yesterday, it was my mom's dog being ""aggressive"" 14 years old and arthritic. So I had to help with that. Then my mom's friend has started calling saying my mom is either sad or frantic and I need to come visit. Or the care level is changing, so I have to sign papers. Or I need to find a new dentist. Or deal with insurance. Or argue with lying med techs. Or stand in shock at a shitty hair cut. Or clean up my dad. Or check my mom and dad's mail. Or gather their tax documents. AND still hold down a job and be a positive father. I'm exhausted and don't know what to do."
"Our electricity bills are gonna be ridiculous. Other than locking my dad in his room, are there any solutions? A device that kills power to the lights after so many minutes maybe. We could kit the house with sensor lights but I think he’d still use the main ones"
"My mom was a very driven career lady working in finance. She loved her job and lived a healthy lifestyle and  had good relationships. But then she got dementia at the age of 53. I was in grade 11. I mostly blocked the pain but all focus was on her. 

My dad became both parents. In 2019 he got diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and then all focus went to dad. We had found a routine with mom so she was sorted and not much had to be changed with her. 

Now that my dad has died attention is back fully on my mom. It’s so hard. I struggle spending time with her because she’s changed so much. I know that she is still my mom but I miss my mom mom. I didn’t get an opportunity to have an adult relationship with her. My dad was good in many ways but also very horrible in others as a dad and a husband. I found out in recent years after taking my mom to her appointment alone (cause I was older) with the neurologist that she was diagnosed with syphilis  encephalitis. It was all so much and I just bottled that in. I just think my mom (and my dad) have gotten really shitty deals in life and it’s hard to reconcile. My dad because he was raised under apartheid and I don’t know what demons he has from his childhood but I suspect some dark wounds- just from hearing how certain things are recounted. 

I’m mad at my mom for not leaving my dad before she got dementia. I’m mad at my dad for being abusive towards my family, cheating on my mom and leaving us with a whole lot of mess after his passing. 

I Love my parents but man I’m so mad at them. I know that them changing the things that I found as problems wouldn’t have changed their outcomes but they could have been happier separately and saved us a whole lot of trauma."
"What's your name?   

First time Mom asked me that, it broke me.   

She still asks every time I'm with her. But the horror and sadness are gone.   

Because her smile and attempt to take my hand in hers when she asks, tells me she knows.   

It's a true moment of connection."
My mum is 67 years old and is terrible at remembering words. She can’t complete sentences without having to describe the word she’s thinking of. I think she may have dementia so I told her to visit the doctor but she claims there’s nothing that can be done. Is she correct? Is there anything I can do to persuade her to visit the doctor? We are based in the UK.
"Hi everyone. My father was diagnosed with dementia a few years ago, but continued on pretty well until about 2 months ago. He fell and broke his back. He was placed in a nursing home as my mom can’t take care of him herself (i live 5 hours away and go up when I’m able, but I have children in school). He was in the first nursing home and was in so much unbearable pain. He also caught Covid. He lost 20 pounds in 2 weeks, was so frail and weak. He was telling me and my mom he wants to pass on, he’s ready. But then there was a few days he was feeling a bit better. He started eating, was more lucid and seem like his normal self, just very frail. But then he got bad again. He started hallucinating. Seeing things, calling my mom and saying they were coming to get him and they hurt him. My mom called the nurses and they said he was very out of it. He had to be transferred to a more permanent nursing home as the previous was mostly a physical therapy one. Now he’s gotten really bad. He hasn’t eaten in 4 days now. He hardly recognized my mom when she went a couple days ago. He won’t answer the phone, I haven’t talked to him in over a week. He’s throwing himself out of the bed. It just seems so fast, the decline. I’m trying to comfort my mom as she’s looking into funeral homes. I just feel so numb and it feels like this isn’t real. Thank you all for listening."
"My loved one was put into hospice 6 days ago. She's not eating or drinking and not producing much urine at all. Her color is good and her hands are warm. I rushed out to be with her - 14 hours of travel- and I can't stay here forever. I have a family and work to take care of. This is killing me. 

I've been here with her for the last 4 days. Today is the fifth day. I have to go home soon. I have kids to care for. I'm afraid she won't pass while I'm here and I don't want her to be alone. 

Have any of you been through this before? How do you resolve this dilemma?"
"Has anyone had any success helping someone with dementia sleep better at night? We've heard of melatonin, CBD, reducing caffeine, fewer naps during the day, etc. Some say nothing can be done but it happens every night and everyone is exhausted because of it."
"Our dementia mother-in-law will have something similar to a hiccup and then have a half-second of complete loss of muscle control (legs give out, arms drop, etc.) And she regains it right away.

Anyone else experience this and/or found anything that helps to reduce it?

TIA"
"If anyone is on tonight my family could use  good thoughts , prayers, vibes etc. My Grandpa (who has vascular dementia)has put us through hell tonight!! He is wide awake,has screamed at us ,tried to get in my parents room where we keep his phone at night so he doesn’t call people after 12am . He’s also mad cause we wouldn’t let him eat his 3rd bowl of cereal at 3am !!! He got so mad he started throwing things in his room. Dad had to take the tv out of there so he wouldn’t break it too ! Now my parents &  I are in our bedrooms doors locked just in case . I’m too wound up from witnessing this to sleep and am praying he goes to sleep and doesn’t call Mom for the thousandth time . FYI he is on Seroquel but it appears to be ineffective. Mom backed out of putting him in a nursing home because she thought he was too frail and would go down hill quicker. Tonight had me begging for her to make this stop by moving him but I don’t think she will 🤬. In case you wonder why I stay here, it’s because I’m afraid it would crush Mom if I left her here with no support . Dad is at his job all day and we only get 20hrs a week of help from the nurse aid . So if I left she’d be on her own . Plus I can’t because I have a broken wrist , no car and am self employed so renting a place is out of the question right now ."
"I’m 21 and my dad was diagnosed with alzheimer’s when i was 17/18. I lived with only him from ages 14-18 and feel I missed out on many of those years and potential experiences due to worrying about/caring for my father. He has narcissistic personality disorder so I was also dealing with that abuse at the time. I had decided not to go away to college because he would say things like “you’re the only reason i’m here” all the time and ask if i was going to stay with him. This obviously lead me to think if i left he would attempt suicide (which he has multiple times). 

I’m having a really hard time knowing what to do right now because i want to go back to a new school across the country next spring. I feel like i’ve made so many decisions based on everyone else’s happiness instead of my own, it feels like it’s been such a battle to survive most of my life, and i’ve finally been figuring things out for myself and feeling better. Some things are going on right now with his potential guardianship which has been extremely difficult and is taking me back to those years when i was 14-18, feeling so stuck and helpless. It makes me feel terrible because obviously i want to do everything i can for my father, but i need to think about me. I want to have him in my life and have a good relationship, i want to be able to know what’s going on with him and help to make decisions. I’ve realized i guess all i can do is give the court my and my fathers truth and at a certain point it’s out of my hands what they choose. It’s hard for these things not to absorb my whole life, it becomes all i think and worry about and i begin to feel so hopeless. 

I guess i’m wondering people’s thoughts on that, whether you’re my age or someone older. Am i being a bad person for wanting to go to school somewhere else? I’ve never left my childhood town long term, i’ve always wanted to. It’s so hard because i want to be true to myself and give myself these experiences, but i feel like i’m potentially betraying my father. Also if anyone has advice about experiencing a parent having alzheimer’s at a young age, or any life advice for someone in their 20s, i would greatly appreciate it. 

I think if my dad wasn’t sick he would be proud of me and excited for me. He always wanted to make sure i had the ability to do what i wanted with school and careers and express my talents. Thinking about that makes me smile but it hurts. 

- my parents are divorced, my mother greatly cares for my father and they have lunch once a week"
"I’m just need to vent. My mom has not been officially diagnosed due to not wanting to etc…the last two years have been hell. Her whole personality has changed. King story short she called my in laws 6 months ago leaving a message I didn’t invite her to a family party I was having (not true) and she wanted to know the date and time. No one called her back for obvious reasons. Fast forward she called them again, yelling at my in law that they never called her back etc.
I do not know how to proceed from here. She is making a fool of herself."
"My MIL (78f) got diagnosed within the past year with early stages of dementia. Her symptoms started two years ago, probably even before that but it never became super apparent until credit cards got declined due to non payment (beginning of 2021). As time goes on we notice personality changes, and increasing forgetfulness. My FIL says her driving is unsafe, but hard to say how true that is because he's a notorious backseat driver.  I have worked with dementia patients in the hospital, in a memory care unit and in a nursing home. I have really only dealt with the mid to late stages.  I have no idea what to expect as far as a time line from diagnoses until then. I have reiterated to my husband the importance of us keeping her safe.  I just don't know how.  I'm concerned she will randomly wander in the neighborhood. Or get lost driving. Or get into a car accident. I'm also not her actual daughter so I don't know how much say I have in any of this. My FIL handles finances now. When do we take the car keys? What do we expect in the next year?  How do we prepare ourselves? My coworker told me her grandmother with Alzheimer's was found in the neighbors backyard. The neighbors were aware of her diagnosis though, so she recommended we give the neighbors a heads up, but is that too soon? Too weird?"
"Not that I wanted to -- never trusted my mom's manipulative behavior and speech before she got dementia.  

Now she has not been able to eat -- cancer. She changed her mind and wanted to try chemo treatment.  But the oncologist says she would probably pull out feeding tube, transfusions, and forget what was happening. 

I am now blind and cannot drive the two hours  to see her.  My husband works and it's iffy if she's conscious if we went up. We are raising a grandchild and he's sick right now so we can't bring him nor leave him alone.  

One brother lives close to her and has poa etc.  The other has come to visit her for several days.  No contact w/ me because -- judgmental grudge from decades ago.  

I went for my own neuro exam this week, passed the test (mocca?) but down a bit.  Their comments were ""Well, it's probably just stress, not dementia"".  

This sucks and I wish it was over."
"We have moved my mom into independent living this past year. She is a very VERY needy person. Repeats same thing over and over. 
Make me an appt.
I need yougart.  
I need my cc back. When can I get it back?
I need a sweater. 
She has been taking extras from the dining hall, hoarding food. 
Taking pens from the check-in area.
Taking toilet paper from restrooms.
We found out talking to her neighbor at the facility, she took food containers from the said neighbor. 
She has always been like this though.  This is nothing new. If it is there, she will trick or treat it up like no tomorrow. 
She latches onto people too, doesn't know when to back off. And bothers other neighbors in facility.
She has been diagnosed with alzheimers and dementia. 
Thoughts? Comments."
"I’ve always known it’s only a matter of when, but the crisis is now here. 

Last night we were leaving a San Diego restaurant with our daughter and her husband. Being in the back seat she was having trouble with the seat belt and when I reached in to try and do it for her, she started hitting me. At first, I asked my daughter just to pull over and I’d Uber back to their home, but she somewhat calmed down. But I was done. If she was going to continue to refuse to see a dr, I was going to leave her. 

Things escalated over the next hour at home there, including her throwing the tv remote at our daughter. I decided to cancel the next four days of the trip and drive the six hours home the next day. 

In the morning, after some thought, I thought it best to have our son accompany us back to Arizona. I was frankly afraid that she might do something stupidly dangerous in the car. 

Well, that set her off and she refused and said she would just stay in the street, as staying at our daughter’s was clearly not an option.  She also started saying how she would die before going anywhere. That’s when my daughter called the police, aiming for a 72 hour 5150 hold, and a wonderfully professional police team with a social worker arrived. They handled what happened next exceptionally well. 

But after conversations with all of us and their sergeant, they were at least able to avoid the DV route and called for a transporter to a hospital. 

That’s when all hell broke loose with them, as she fought them, yelling and screaming as they were forced to restrain her. It’s hard to describe my feelings during this, as I was just shaking, as we all were. Never wanted it to be this way for her to get help, but not surprised, actually. 

Waiting outside the ER now. They’re waiting for a psychiatrist, but not until she calms down (after some meds that they’ll be trying to give). My daughter, son and I are just waiting. Don’t know who, when one of us can go in, would be the least upsetting. Probably not me. 

Horrible time, and I can’t over express how much love and support is coming from my mid-30’s kids. 

Longest post I’ve ever made here…"
"Hello. I am a 51 year old woman and I think I am going to be diagnosed with early-onset dementia, probably FTD, this week on Friday when I meet with the Nuero to go over my latest MRI results. I was tested 2 years ago for Huntington’s but the result was negative. My husband and I have been through so much with my previously diagnosed mental illness. I have been given almost all the labels: Depression, Anxiety, Bipolar, Schizophrenia, Schizo-affective, just all of them.

Now this extra crap to sling around. I started having bouts of aphasia around 5 years ago, which has progressed to stammering in public so much I’m embarrassed to talk. I don’t go out much anymore, I feel such inertia, and apathy, there is nothing to do that holds my attention anymore. I find that my “words” are disappearing in my head. I can still write but my coordinatnation is terrible. It feels weird to write. My head sometimes just “stops.” The thinking process, then I can’t remember what I just said 3 seconds ago! I cannot follow move or TV plots anymore, I just want to watch cartoons like the Simpson. I sit in my recliner chair in my computer room and just veg for hours and hours watching vids, listening to music, or reading. I can’t do any of my hobbies or online work too. I feel so STUPID! Like a Zombie, just not caring about anyone else or myself too.

Going to do errands is HORRIBLE! I get mixed up in the stores and sometimes go into a fugue state where I don’t know what I’ve bought until I get to the checkout and have to pay for 5 boxes of the same toothpaste. It’s creepy and weird. If the line gets too long I’ll scream out for them to hurry up too loud. I’ll huff and puff and swear too. I never useful to do bad stuff like that before. My husband always tries to calm me down or tell me that I’m embarrassing him in public. Makes me cry but it feels terrible that I feel like I can’t control myself anymore.

I had Covid in the middle of Jan. and it feels like recovering from it has made this worse for me. I feel more leaden, and stupider. I am depressed and anxiety all the time as I feel like I’m loosing what makes me “Me.”

What should I do if the diagnosis is positive? I know how bad dementia can be. How should I get ready? Just do my spouse and I can have a lifeline to hang onto. Thanks."
"One phone call Bro just to say hello to your mother if you keep waiting she will forget who you are do yourself a favor just do it

How do you talk to someone about regret could've should've it will ware on a soul"
"This is more of a vent post... my grandma is 87 and lived on her own up until a couple of weeks ago. She is in good health but doesn't get around well and is 90% deaf in both ears. For the past few months, she had had some hallucinations but they were pretty sparse and inoffensive – like she would hallucinate that there were rats in her bedroom, but then the next day she'd realize she had been hallucinating and laugh it off and be fine for a few more days.

Things have escalated dramatically over the past month. My cousin and her husband went to visit her and throughout the visit she was accusing the husband of stealing things and trying to kill her so he could sell her jewelry and hide her body. After they left, my parents got a call from her neighbor, who said they found her sitting by the road because she'd fallen while running from a knife-wielding murderer. My dad drove out immediately and found her terrified and hallucinating that there was someone hiding under her bed. She refused to go to the ER and they had to call EMTs. They checked her vital signs and checked for a UTI but everything was normal. When my dad got her back home he convinced her to come stay with them.

After my parents got her to their house she seemed to be doing a little better, they had her following a routine, eating on a schedule, drinking plenty of fluids, getting to bed at a reasonable hour. They put me on Skype to talk to her last weekend and she was lucid and able to have a normal conversation. However the hallucinations ramped up again and they ended up putting a baby monitor in her room because she would stay up all night long walking around talking to invisible friends and relatives, and one night they found her frantically trying to leave the house.

Fast forward to last night – I heard from my mom that she was up all night screaming that my parents were hurting themselves and trying to kill her. She'd locked herself in the closet of the guest room and was screaming that she would call 911 and that they would ""never get away with this."" They eventually had to remove the doorknob to get to her, and they found her absolutely terrified on the closet floor. They had to call EMTs to take her to the ER, where they're still waiting now (god bless the USA, it's been like 5 hours apparently).

Anyway, I don't know whether I'm looking for advice or what but I'm just absolutely devastated, both for my grandma and my parents who are suffering through this. They tried an antipsychotic but could not get her to take more than one dose.  They cannot do an MRI because she has a cochlear implant for her hearing loss, and without an MRI I don't expect them to be able to get a diagnosis anytime soon. They live in the rural southwest US and doctors/specialists are few and far between.

I guess if anyone has anything to suggest from experience that might make things easier for her and for my folks, that would be great. If not, then thank you for coming to my TED Talk lol."
"Mom is 76 years old . Is this early dementia, or normal aging ? She knows what she wants to say , but can’t quite get the words out . This has gotten a bit worse over the past couple years. Everything else seems to be good."
"Would like to hear about everyone's experiences good or bad with small residential assisted living or adult foster care based in a private house. 

Better or worst than long term facilities?

Do smaller homes have better staff to resident ratio?

If you have worked in or own one I would love to hear from you. Would love details about your facility and why it's better in your opinion.

Thanks in advance for any help or information."
"My husband has Lewy Body Dementia. Recently, he swears he’s seen a show already even though it’s impossible, it was just released. 

We always watched Outlander together and the new season just came out. He complains that he’s seen it already and so he doesn’t want to watch it. Obviously I don’t force him to watch the show but it’s so strange. 

It’s the same with any random movie. It’s eerie that his brain has suddenly developed this glitsch. It’s literally every single new movie or TV show. 

Meanwhile he watches the same series over and over, to the point that I have to go in a different room. Downton Abbey is a great show but 4 times were enough for me. I think he’s on the 10th round. It’s great for him, it is a “world” where he is comfortable. 

Has anyone else experienced this?"
So my grandma has dementia and i was wondering why it is that she can remember certain things. I did a quick google and understand that it affects short term memories etc but right now she barely remembers her kids (my dad and aunts) but remembered my dad’s newly wed wife so it doesnt really make sense to me. Lately ive been getting into psychology so id like to know for that but mainly if there’s triggers or something we can change so it doesnt keep getting worse or at the least remember her own kids it would be life changing for our family.
"Hello everyone. Sorry for the rant/vent but I just... need a platform of sorts to let some things out I guess...?  


As the title suggests, my grandmother has Alzheimer's disease. It's late stage. I feel like I could just wake up any day now and learn that she's passed away and it weighs on me.   
I'm 19 years old- so pretty young still I would say. I am also a full-time college student and so these things just continuously put weight on me every day. I am so afraid of her passing suddenly and the grief will just completely wreck my school life. I almost flunked high school due to depression and so I am trying not to make any sort of repeat with this newfound ""chance"" I now have. It's conflicting- because part of me feels awful for just ""waiting"" for her to pass away. Of course, I don't want my grandma to die, but this disease has destroyed her so much it's like she's just a physical shell at this point. She is my last grandparent, after all. But at the same time, me internally hoping that she will at least die when I am not in school is such a terrible thing to think about and I feel so... selfish, quite frankly. She's the one with the disease, after all.  
Every week or so, I see her- except it's just a depressing experience at this point because Alzheimer's has taken such a toll on her. I'm trying to spend at least a good amount of time with her while she's still here but it's hard to do so. She's incoherent and does not remember me nor a good chunk of my relatives and requires assistance to do the majority of things if not everything. I'm not surprised at this but it still hurts a bit, you know? Plus, I know she is the only person holding my family together because her children aka my aunts and uncles are in a feud over finances and god forbid what happens after she leaves this realm.   
I've been crying tonight like I do every few weeks nowadays when I think about her. My parents do not know about this. It's just so stressful, and it also feels like I'm looking into the future because dementia runs in my family. My other grandmother also passed from the same disease before I was born. Every time I notice my parents forget something it just sparks a tinge of pain within me because of that fear that they will develop the disease too and I can't really do anything about it. I was also raised in a culture where children are expected to take care of their parents when they're older, so the possibility of me having to be a care-giver myself one day also haunts me because I've seen what it is like and also feel a bit selfish for not wanting to do such a thing.   
I really don't know what to do anymore, or how to even properly cope with something like this. It's a cruel cycle of waiting for her to die so she can finally be at peace and then feel bad for thinking such a thing. Am I a bad person for thinking it'd be better for her to pass away at this rate? How am I supposed to live knowing about this slow and cruel decline towards death my grandmother is facing, and that she's almost at the finish line? I've always wanted for her to see me graduate but I know it is likely that she will be gone by the time I finish any sort of degree. Seeing my friends be able to interact with and spend time with their own grandparents is like a stab in the chest reminder that I will never be able to have such a relationship. I am happy for them yet I can't help but feel... jealous about it. I do have a few very vague memories of my grandma back before Alzheimer's got to her, but I've since long forgotten a good bit of it myself- such a cruel twist of irony, isn't it. I love my grandma very much but it also hurts so much seeing her like this. I am in pure agony.  
Still, if you're still reading this, thanks for your time. Really. I may not know who you are but just know I am thankful you'd put off some of your time to read this. I do not expect a lot of attention and for this to just float around in the Reddit ocean forever and that I am content with. I just want to let some of my thoughts go, and after typing this I think I feel a little bit better. Well, I stopped crying a bit ago at least, haha. Maybe I can finally go to bed."
"My mom has Parkinsons and Lewy Body Dementia.
She has several panic attacks daily and now has started screaming out in pain at night along with the panic.
She also yells several times each night for help.
She was recently in the hospital for 2 weeks and they checked her completely out.
They couldn’t find anything that could be causing the pain.
I care for her about 60-70 percent of the time and am at a breaking point.
If you could share some of the difficulties you’ve encountered with your loved ones; I’d really appreciate it.

I NEED this community, especially right now. Thank you all so much for being here and sharing your stories.
It really does help to not feel so isolated.

Dementia and Parkinsons are such cruel terrible diseases. I get so angry that my sweet beautiful mom is suffering so much and there’s nothing I can do.
I feel completely helpless.

Sigh, apologies for the rant.
I guess I just needed to vent somewhere and knew this was a safe place for that.

Thank you everyone again. I’m so grateful for this little safe place and for the support."
"Sometimes even the first half of the day. Not sure if this is the right sub. Grandma on my Dad's side passed away with dementia, Dad is fine, otherwise nothing else within the family that I'm aware of.

Most online publications reference early symptoms in 50s 60s. Should I be worried or am I overthinking it.

Note: I feel like I've always had really good memory, up until about a year or two ago."
"My grandma, who has been suffering from Alzheimer’s for a long time and in her late stages, broke her arm badly around 10 days ago from the bus doing an emergency stop.

My grandad is her main carer and is severely struggling as it is. After being admitted to hospital, they found she had a severely broken bone and she got a cast put on. She initially didn’t understand why she was the only one with it on (delusions of persecution) and started getting very angry. My grandma has now managed to take her cast off around 4 times and every time my grandad has to wait for hours (we live in the UK) to get it put back on. This is the 4th time tonight. She can’t remember falling, she believes that it is the cast that is causing her severe pain. Every time this happens me and my mum have to drive an hour to go help my Grandad because she gets very angry at him and he needs support. She shouts and gets very very aggressive. 

This is not sustainable and I don’t know what we can do. My Grandad is very reluctant about admitting my Grandma into hospital or getting an in-house carer full time until it is fixed because he’s very old fashioned and thinks the husband should do it all. I tried to find advice online for people with dementia/alzheimer’s who got a broken bone and I can’t find anything.

Has anyone ever experienced something similar(‘?"
"My once-frugal 75-year-old mother, diagnosed recently with dementia, has made many donations to various political candidates and other random charitable causes over the past 18 months. She has been financially scammed numerous times over the past 18 months, in one case giving out her social security # over the phone. She insists that her money is her money and she can afford to make donations and she can spend her money however she likes. It is true that she is financially secure and technically can afford to make these donations but it is awful to see this money flying out the window when it will soon be needed to pay for her care.

She receives stacks of fundraising solicitations in the mail every day, spends hours looking at all of this mail, opening the envelopes and putting paper clips on various letters, putting Forever stamps on the return envelopes.  If my sister and I do not secretly remove some of the mail while she is not looking, it piles up in stacks and she begins writing more and more checks. Currently there are hundreds of pieces of mail covering her entire dining table and is piled up on chairs, in boxes, etc. If she catches us taking it, she gets angry at us.

Today after I picked up two full brown bags of unopened fundraising mail from her home, I discovered I had also accidentally picked up her check register, which apparently had been left amid one of the stacks. 

My sister and I are both POA for all finances including on her checking account. When she discovers the check register is missing what do I do? Do come clean and tell her I have it and she can no longer have it? Do I pretend I don’t have it? Do I return it to her?  She is increasingly making incredibly poor financial decisions that are absolutely out of character for her, however for now at least she is still paying bills on time and is not always so impaired that she might not figure out that I am likely the reason her check register is now missing."
"I live in Las Vegas, my mother is in Georgia.  

This is the fourth visit. My mother and I had no relationship, and now we do. When she started calling me last summer and saying things like, ""God Bless You"" I knew things were serious.

This visit I came out to see an attorney and get Advanced Medical Directive, Power of Attorney, and a will done.  That happened yesterday afternoon. After months of telling me she had an attorney to see but could not find the name of the person and all she needed was, ""to update the will.""  After fruitless searching at her house for the existing will, at the attorney appointment she said she had never had one done. 

To be perfectly frank (the whole point of this post) I'm bored sitting here and a bit exhausted. The attorney appointment was a big step. It's done. The will and other forms are simple. And now the formality is after it's prepared and I've seen a draft to get her to actually go sign it. 

I suspect it will be another $450 round trip just to ensure she goes and signs it. 

Mom just asked me why she hasn't heard back from the attorney and she isn't sure he's any good.  It's Saturday and like I said...met with him yesterday afternoon. 

She needs the TV on constantly, can't stand having ""no noise"" yet she's never paying attention to it and wants to talk to me constantly. I'm a fairly quiet person and get distracted easily (ADD) so it's irritating...always was. There's a lot of old feelings coming back especially this visit. 

We've had the conversation 8 times at least today about me getting a copy of the will. When her mother died she didn't get a copy of a different will she wasn't aware of until two months after my grandmother died.  The house that was to go to her was already sold and she has no idea what happened to any of the contents of the house. She doesn't want that to happen to me. So continues to repeat it despite me repeating the attorney is going to email me a copy in draft and in final form.

By the way, that isn't what happened with my grandmother. The will part is true, but the house was sold with my mother's participation. She got the net proceeds from the sale. 

She needed help getting back on online banking since her bank was bought out and is transitioning over to a new Website. She continues to ask if she needs new checks because they say the old bank name on them and if the checks are going through because she doesn't know. 

I look at her check register. She's perfectly balanced the checkbook and is marking when every check she writes clears. 

She just asked me to help her get back on the computer so she can she her bank account because she doesn't know when her retirement and SS money comes in. We did that yesterday too.

And another thing bothering me. The notion of ""get her to a neurologist"" that well-meaning friends are telling me isn't QUITE that straightforward when you live across the country, or even when I'm here.  She claims she will find one and I don't need to worry about it. I've finally (this visit) gotten the name and information for her PCP which I told her I will make an appointment with to get a referral to a neurologist. 

I contacted four neurologists around the Atlanta area that I knew I could at least take her to. Three are not accepting new patients, one is ""not that kind of neurologist."" 

But I don't have to do that, her cardiologist said he would find a neurologist for her.  The same thing she told me in November..."
"If I'd known it was the last time I'd see you,
Could I have made it better?
Would I have taken photos or a video, or brought your favourite food?  I know I'd have stayed there forever. 

If I'd known it was the last time you'd feel my touch,
Could I have touched you better? 
Would I have used all my skin, or played a game?   I know I'd have wrapped you in my arms and body and never let you go.

If I'd known it was the last time you smelled like you,
Would I have tried to bottle that somehow, or rub you in a towel to soak you in better?  I know I'd have breathed in deep and not stopped until I could smell nothing else ever again.

And baby...
If I'd known it was the last time you knew me.
Should I have loved you better? 
Should I have annoyed you up close, or imprinted you on my brain from afar?  I know I wouldn't have let you go without holding your beautiful face, and looking into your soul through your soft eyes, and telling the deepest part of you:  

""I love you Nicky.   I promised I would never leave you. And so it is you who is leaving me now.   My memories of you, the feel of you, your smell, and all of who you are is forever printed on my heart.""  ""Oh, and Nicky.""  I would say as you quietly left me.  ""Nicky...  I love you.  I will always love you.""  And I would say it as you walk out of sight. And I'd say it until I die. 

To Nicky.  I never left you Moof. I love you."
"Slight Rant 

My grandmother is 91 and was diagnosed with alzheimer's last month, but we have noticed her having memory problems for several months. She is a stubborn independent woman, but she had to move in with my parents because she couldnt live by herself. She soon started to forget who they were. She has also forgotten who I am (her granddaughter), and most of her family. Her alzheimer's is progressing and it got to the point where my parents couldn't take care of her. It also became dangerous for her to be in their house; she has fallen several times, she thinks my parents are strangers and would become paranoid, she would open the front door and leave it open, she would turn the stove on and forget to turn it off, etc. 

My mom and my aunts found a nursing home that can take care of her since her alzheimer's is getting worse by the week. She was admitted last week, and so far has been fine. The problem is all of her friends started judging us for putting her in a nursing home! These people haven't even been around my grandmother like we have, never came to visit to see how she was doing, and now they want to us to take her out! My grandmother is also narcissistic, which has made her alzheimer's even worse and her friends are her enablers. 

Today her ""friends"" went to visit her at the nursing home and they told her that they're gonna take her out, so she can live with them in another city! Her friends never told my family they were going to tell her this, and now my grandmother is excited because she thinks shes leaving the nursing home.My family went through so much to diagnose her and get her the proper care and these people think they can judge us and do better. They are giving her false hope and promises, and making it worse. My mother was so angry this  morning and had to have a phone call with these ""friends"" of hers and told them to mind their damn business. 

I'm just disgusted by how judgmental everyone has been!!

UPDATE: 
My aunt had a stern conversation with her ""friends"" and they did apologize for telling my grandmother she can leave and for not believing her alzheimer's is getting worse. Unfortunately this morning the nursing home called and said my grandmother packed up all of of her bags and was sitting in her room waiting for her friends to pick her up. She told everyone she was leaving, and my mom had to break the news to her..."
"Hi all, 

Brought dad to geriatric psychiatrist last week and doc said his dementia is getting worse. He completely lost the apetite to eat, and would only obliged if my mom grind all the food to bits and feed him. I believe he has lost his ability to chew.  He could still talk in clear voice and seem to be able to engage in simple communication. His weight is now 38kg, down from 45kg before he was diagnosed with mild dementia after a  fall last year. He became bed ridden for 2 months last year due to that fall but has since recovered and can now walk, albeit slowly, but he prefer to stay in bed whole day. 

Appreciate if anyone who has gone through the same thing with their love ones could share what i should expect in the coming months... i would like to be prepared mentally as much as possible.

Thanks all."
"SURVEY CLOSING ON TUESDAY!

5-10 minute survey on Health and NHS Social Prescribing Services.

*Open to those aged 18-25* THANK YOU!

https://westminsterpsych.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0VWsLSGzIBiZ6ES?Q_CHL=qr

Social prescribing is a form of non-medical intervention that is being used in the NHS by healthcare professionals with the aim of enhancing people’s wellbeing.

The aim is to provide practical and emotional support as a way to help improve their wellbeing, rather than using strictly a medicalised approach when the reasons for ill-health may be partly or wholly due to psychosocial reasons."
"My wife has early stage dementia.  We have no friends nor family.(Her family is in Maryland; we're in Florida.) I have untreatable bipolar illness.  Irritability is part of the illness.  I'm irritable most of the time and the irritability bleeds into caring for my wife.  I feel bad about being short tempered or annoyed and vow to myself to do better but the next day, there's my irritable self waiting for me.

She's not at the stage where she/we need help, yet her short term memory has worsened over the past few months and I'm her memory.  All the advice for caregivers is to take care of yourself.  What does that look like?  There's a geriatric clinic near us but she doesn't want to go for another evaluation.  She still has awareness of her situation and family history of dementia.  She also has poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, which she tries to manage by eating less; she actually eats very little throughout the day.  I'm watching her slowly die.  How do you take care of yourself when you're always in the frontline of the war?"
"My dad broke his ankle.  He has a walking cast boot but we dont want him walking at night cause hes groggy and unstablw on it.  And yet he needs ro pee 3 times a night.  

So far, weve been staying with him to help him walk but i think this is impossible to keep up cause we qre exhausted.

I was thinking he could wear an external catheter instead.  Does anyone have any experience in these?  Is this a goo or bad idea?"
"Hi everyone! June is Alzheimers and Dementia awareness month. I am looking for a guest(s) that would be up to coming on my video podcast to talk about what A&D is, what are some signs and ways we can try to prevent/mitigate A&D for ourselves. You don't have to be a medical professional (though that would be helpful). 
We are filming on 3/27, time TBD. 
We are a fairly new and small podcast. 
Let me know if you are interested, know someone who might be interested or have any questions!

"I’m worried about my mother. She can’t remember the most basic things. She asks me the middle names of my children, names of family members, birthdays, etc. This seems like the early stages of Alzheimer’s. 

What is more alarming to me, though, is her obsession with things. I’m not sure if it’s related to Alzheimer’s and I want your opinions. 

For context, if it’s relevant, She’s on Klonopin and has been for 20 years. She doesn’t take it at the same time each day and often skips some to “save money”. 

She OBSESSES over stuff. For example, if an app she has resets and she loses her ability to login using Face ID, rather than a password, she will spend HOURS trying to fix it. 

When she asks me a question and I’m speaking with someone else, if I don’t immediately answer she will say “SAY” or “HELLO?”

She needs IMMEDIATE answers to text messages or she will send 8-10 at a time. 

She leaves hateful voicemails if I don’t answer the phone. 

She is rude to the waiter / waitress and doesn’t “read The room” or follow social cues. 

Are these all signs of Alzheimer’s or something else? Thank you for your help.

Edit: She is 67 years old."
"My wife is in the final stages of dementia and has only recognized me fleetingly the past few weeks. I seem to be the last memory she is holding on to. She's in a residential care facility and in the past few days she has declined rapidly to the point the hospice nurse believes she only has a few days left.

She had a minor stroke today and didn't get out of bed at all. She is on morphine. I went to visit her and just got back home a few minutes ago. While I was there she was in bed with her eyes closed and her mouth half open breathing shallowly. I sat with her and held her hand and just talked with her, telling her stories and remembering times we had together. A few times, when I asked her if she remembered, she squeezed my hand lightly. After a time she closed her mouth and seemed to fall into a deeper relaxed sleep.

She is a short distance from me so I went home but I wonder... should I go back there tonight and sit with her all night or should I try to get some rest and go back in the morning. On one hand I'm eventually going to get exhausted, more than I am, so some rest would be good but I do not want her to pass away alone...

The caregivers at the home said they would call me if there was any change and I could get there within a very few minutes.

What do I do?"

"My mother (70) is showing some pretty textbook signs of middle to late-stage dementia, maybe Alzheimer's (her father had it). Memory loss, confusion, going to take a walk to the store without telling anyone (sometimes getting lost), getting constantly scammed, personality changes, that sort of thing. She still showers and feeds herself just fine, but she clearly needs help.

She won’t go to the doctor, doesn’t even have one in her current state. I do have financial POA, but not medical. She only has social security (no other assets and no savings), so I’ll have to cover any other costs of her care. She has Medicare (maybe, it’s unclear), but not Medicaid (and I understand she’d need a diagnosis, which I can’t get if she won’t go to the doctor).

Her sister and brother won’t house her anymore so I’m trying to find her a place to live in my city, but I’m so overwhelmed and not sure how I can afford it. My area is super expensive and one month of care at memory places (and even some independent living) is more than my mortgage.

Is there a guide for all this? I have so many questions, and probably more questions I don’t even know of yet, and I’m at a loss as to where I start. Do I need a lawyer? A new job to pay for things? Can I make a doctors appointment for her and drag her in against her will?

What do I do?"
"My MIL has dementia (diagnosed in 2013), and her care is shared between 3 households. My household has observed declines in her cognition that is disputed by other households (they claim they don’t currently see the behaviors, but admit to past situations where the behaviors happened under their care). The PCP wants an MRI (not sure why) but a social worker from the medical group indicated an MRI is unnecessary since MIL has already been diagnosed with dementia. Has anyone else had more than one MRI recommended for their dementia family member?"
"I think I might end up with dementia.  We have a HUGE family tree. 
 In the history of that tree, there's one instance of Alzheimer's that lead to death, and random mental heath cases including one in my immediate family.  For each of us in the tree, it's like Russian roulette when it comes mental health issues in varying degrees.

Not sure if ADHD would lead to it, but I prefer to know and be prepared.  Going to states or countries that allow death with dignity is an option that I considered."
"Got an amusing story to share?

"Hi everyone, may I know if any of your dementia patient relatives are always like this? My mom is becoming worse everyday. She would complain that she cannot breathe. We already went to the emergency room to have her checked, everything seems normal. Feels like she's using it as excuse to get out of the house. Once we get home, she will complain again, but whenever we tell her that we will be going to the mall later on, she will calm down and settle. Then after a few minutes, she will be so uneasy, she will keep on walking and crying saying she can't breathe. It is a little bit embarrassing because we live in a 4 storey apartment building with shared terrace, and whenever she walks out to the terrace, she is always agitated and crying along the hallways. And she gets easily mad when we ask her to get back in and then will suddenly cry, I'm afraid of what the neighbors would think seeing this scenario. When we tell her that we'll be going out to go to the hospital or to the mall, she will again be okay, then if everything keeps quiet again (because my sister and I are working from home), she will again make a scene either inside the house or along the hallway terrace. Our apartment is along the road and many commercial establishments in front, so basically a lot of people seeing my mom like that. We tried to contain her but we also suffer because we can't do our job smoothly. Also, it's every minute like this. What can we do to manage this behavior? It is becoming so alarming because at times she would yell she wants to die then points a scissor at her stomach and heart or sometimes attempts to jump to the terrace (we're on the 2nd floor). It's really frustrating and lately, I feel that this is also taking a toll on my mental health. We live in the Philippines. I don't know which organizations to turn to. I don't think thee are dementia organizations we can reach out to. My sister and I feel so helpless. 🥺"
"I’ve read and watched so much about dementia and stages and common traits, but nothing could prepare me for watching my grandma interact with a stuffed dog the way she did today. I brought it to her and she was so excited but I had to choke back tears as I played along with her. This is the first time I’ve felt that she isn’t my grandma and it’s scary."
"Hi all, my mom was diagnosed a year ago with a combination of moderate vascular dementia and moderate/severe alzheimers dementia. She had a concussion 3 years ago which may have accelerated things, on top of living alone during the pandemic. She had not been engaged in a lifestyle that would have created a lot of cognitive reserve (no exercise, brain teasers, or new experiences, just reading novels and watching tv).

I wish I knew how long she has. This week a year ago is when I helped her move closer to me and I was shocked to realize how impaired she was when I finally saw her in person. She started Namenda and moved to an assisted living facility. She's happy there, participates, has friends, is stress free, but has definitely deteriorated in the past year. In the past 6 months, she is not enjoying going out to eat as much, doesn't want to be away from her apartment for more than an hour or two.

Is there any point in wondering how long she has until memory care, until she's nonverbal,  until she dies? Or is it all so individual there's no point in guessing?

With the one year ""Surprise! It's dementia."" anniversary, I guess I'm feeling contemplative."
"Hi everyone! Sorry if my wording may be wrong just had a few questions about this disease. 

My father had a second brain surgery a year ago to remove a benign tumor pushing on his pituitary gland. He is only 55 years old, sadly during this second surgery he had a massive stroke. He was in the hospital for about a month and has short term memory loss now and is a completely different person.

This has been a very hard thing to cope with and his next MRI is coming up on March 29th which will tell us what the neurologist thinks is wrong. They wanted us to wait a year to see how my dad is healing wise and sadly he seems to be getting worse, he doesn’t remember anything we said 5 minutes ago and he’s also gotten angrier lately and always thinks he has to go to work at a paper route which he did when he was 12.

My mom is his primary caregiver but us kids help out a lot aswell, I’m thinking that this is what he has because of all of the symptoms and how he is still declining. He is also on a strict diabetic diet because he has type 2 diabetes.

I’m just looking for advice for anyone dealing with these things and how to cope and if this is what he could possibly have? Thank you"
"Doctors made the decision to put Mom in hospice care.  I was just finally accepting the fact that she was going to a nursing home and now this.  She's so miserable and has zero quality of life, that I should be relieved she will soon be able to rest, but I'm not.  I'm just feeling sad and guilty."
"I’m struggling to provide care for my mother because she is adamantly in denial about having any cognitive decline. Yet she can’t remember how to use the phone, the oven, can’t drive to new places, and her short-term memory is shot. (Just a few examples) She also must use a walker to walk as she’s developed stooped over posture and has a short unsteady gait. I have taken over most of the things she used to do but at the expense of living my own life, yet she insists I don’t need to be doing any of what I’m doing, that I’m “undermining her autonomy” and that she’s “perfectly fine on her own.” I’m just wondering how common this denial behavior is? For context, she has Cluster B personality disorder, and I am the only family involved in her care. Thanks."
"So, my 80 year old with beginning dementia started taking 20mg of Nameda last month. She stopped smoking last summer (before dementia) but she was only smoking 1/2-1 cigarette a day. 


All of a sudden, today, around 7 pm she’s craving a cigarette. Seriously craving, as in going from room to room trying to find one even though I’ve reminded countless times that she doesn’t have any more. And, she’s started feeling arthritis pain in her knees today for the first time in months and months. Are these “side effects” of taking Nameda? Are, idk, brain paths opening up again or something?"
"So, my grandmother is 88 years old and has moderate to severe dementia. She has no interest in doing anything - no magazines, no computer games (which she used to love very much), she won’t do puzzles or sort laundry. She is very immobile, and has a multitude of physical problems including two bad knees and she just recovered from Covid-19… She doesn’t do much but talk nonsense all day and gets really, REALLY angry when told what to do. She basically needs assistance 24/7 and as a 20 year old college student I can’t constantly entertain her. Any ideas for what I could give her to keep busy? Thank you in advance!!"
"If you had read my other posts you will know the following.
1. My dad has vascular dementia
2. My mom is taking a lot of strain and can become quite mean to my dad.
3. I am close to losing my mind as well.
My dad is just going down hill the whole time...no matter what we try to make him feel better NOTHING WORKS..he had chest problems and coughs non stop..he has two kinds of inhalers, cough syrup, chest balm ect...i have tried postural drainage with him and coughing exercises NOTHING WORKS AND HE NEVER FEELS BETTER. He has literally lied and said he feels better but then a hour later says he feels bad again. 
He keeps saying he feels sick he feels dizzy and i do not know what is wrong with him. I do not know how to help him. Sometimes he won't even tell us that he has pain he can straight up burn his fingers badly while lighting a joint and won't flintch NO OUCH NO SWEARING NOTHING. He is smoking himself silly HE SMOKES WEED NONSTOP and then goes into a stress mode if his weed is finished and he can't find any he has even stopped smoking tobacco to smoke more weed. He cannot cough out anything in his chest never coughs out mucus or flem. Says he can't cough..he keeps saying he is blind or he can't see but the doctor says his one is fine and he should have no trouble seeing..his other eye has problems. I now have to help him eat sometimes because he is too weak to lift the bowl but other days he is just fine.I WISH MY DAD WAS NORMAL AGAIN I CANNOT STAND SEEING HIM LIKE THIS I CANNOT TAKE THIS ANYMORE."
"Hi there, I was wondering how everyone deals with lack of sleep/exhaustion while caregiving?

My grandma is up from midnight until 6AM usually, making a lot of noise “packing” for various trips, or getting stuck. I have to get up and corral her back to bed multiple times a night. 

I am just drained, I feel like I have no energy at all. Any helpful tips are greatly appreciated. I’m the only one taking care of her; the rest of my family has either passed, or they want nothing to do with her, so I’m solo in all this. 

Doc has her on donepezil (sp?) and risperdone. No sleep medication."
"I was just re-reading my mom’s recent neuropsych eval, and due to a fixed delusion that my mom has (that she has cancer—she doesn’t and never did) the report indicated that “DLB should be in the differential going forward.” (I didn’t even know what that meant the first time I read it). In recent weeks, my mother’s posture has become very stooped, to the extent that her orthopedist has ordered her to use a walker. (He has run X-rays & ruled out any fractures/orthopedic issues). She walks slowly and is stiff. She avoids all social interaction, is sedentary 24/7 and won’t make eye contact w me unless I specifically ask for it. It feels like she is going downhill very quickly. I’m just looking for insight in case anyone has seen their loved ones through a similar experience."
"My dad (92y) has a wellness appointment on Friday and my brother is going to go with him. We’d like to get him assessed for dementia but we feel the doctor was not taking my mother seriously when she asked for testing. There were some cognition tests administered and he apparently did “fine” and “just normal aging”. We don’t believe this and I guess need a referral to someone more expert? My dad is very confused all the time. Constant repetition of questions, comments, and stories. He also can’t safely prepare food and has gotten lost in his own neighborhood a few times (fortunately he is very sedentary and doesn’t really seem to want to go anywhere). His toileting is getting worse (very messy) but he still is handling it ok. Doesn’t want to change his clothes, or bathe, won’t accept help with dressing so has had on different shoes and clothes aren’t fastened properly. Anyway, what questions or requests do we make of his doctor? Thanks in advance for any advice."
"Im just really sad and don't really have anyone to talk to right now so I want to share what my family is going through right now.

My aunt passed away this morning.  It's been a slow burn.  She had cancer back in the early 00s, always had her routine appointments since she was cleared but since it had been 15 years with no sign of cancer again, they stop doing those kinds of appointments.  This is my tip for the day: continue making those appointments if this happens to you, or loved ones. Im uncertain if it would have saved her in the end but right now I wish it would have.

Anyways, it did come back. About three years ago. And about a year and a half ago, we were told she only had two weeks left to live by the hospital. Well, they were wrong and Im not sure if it's good or bad that she had more time. She suffered and she didn't want people to see her suffer. The last day I saw her was Saturday and I knew it would be my last time with her. I love her dearly and I hope she feels so much better.

Now, her mother who is my grandmother, has dementia and has been diagnosed for years. We are sure she knew her daughter was sick, especially after her bad spell and the hospital giving us two weeks. My grandmother was traumatized seeing her daughter in a hospital bed in her home and saying how God should take her instead. So we are sure she never forgot that, or her illness. But Saturday, when our family was together at the nursing home my aunt was in, my mom took my grandma back to where she lives and it seemed like she just forgot the whole experience of seeing her daughter. And my aunt looked and was much worse than she was after her bad spell over a year ago. Saturday was four days ago so now we know that she doesn't even know that she went to go see her daughter.


Today around 4:45am, my aunt passed away.  Now I'm not sure how my grandmother is going to handle this. It seems like she's reliving the pain every time she saw her daughter and I dont know how many times we will have to tell her she's gone.

This is the worst thing I can think of telling someone with dementia."
"I'm living with my grandma, who has dementia at about a level 4/5... that is she can still dress herself and bathe herself, wash her own clothes etc. but any complicated task...preparing meals, paying bills, at times even counting... overwhelms and confuses her.  She is often uncertain about the day of the week and repeats herself endlessly within just a few minutes.  Her short-term memory can be very bad, BUT her logic and reasoning skills aren't, she's very aware of what's going on around her, she even still drives because she's always aware of where she is and what the other cars around her are doing, just doesn't always remember where she's going unless you remind her.  She's never had an accident in her life.

I have the feeling from reading this sub that I've moved in a lot earlier in the process than most people do... which is great in some ways as I can try to make her life as good as I can for as long as I can, but on the other hand I can't just do as I know is best for her either, a lot of times too it's easy to forget it's the disease because she's always been kind of contrary and resistant to anything new that she doesn't suggest herself, lol.  

Anyway, she has acid reflux really badly.  This is terrible, but it took me about a week to figure out what was even wrong, because she can be a bit of a hypochondriac... my mom had warned me about it, but it still took me a while to spot the pattern of whenever I went to church, or to spend time with my other grandparents, she would claim her stomach hurt as she either felt embarrassed to not want to attend church, or was jealous of me spending time away from her.  

 So last week when she said her stomach hurt, I didn't take her seriously and she went and checked herself into the emergency room.  She wanted to leave as soon as I got there, but I convinced her to stay until they finished all the tests.  They found nothing after five hours, and we went home. 

 But the next day, she was still saying her stomach hurt and then she said her throat was burning and I guessed it was acid reflux.  But she refuses to take tums or pepto bismal most of the time, she says it makes her sick to even look at.  Same with water.  I've had to hide the instant coffee and soda, and it's torture trying to get her to eat anything plain, all she want to eat is candy.  Which she can go out and buy herself.  She sundowns pretty badly and stays up all night  eating all the stuff you're not supposed to eat for acid reflux then is sick in the morning, both because she wants to lay on the couch and sleep, and because she can't sleep because her stomach hurts her too badly.  She can't understand what's causing the pain and thinks she's sick with an illness that I can catch, so she becomes upset with me being near her, and upset with the food I'm cooking for her because she ""can't eat"" because apparently good food and meds and water make her sick to her stomach to even look at.  

Another thing is she seems to be too hot and then too cold all the time, like every five minutes she's asking me to check the temperature, and then to either cover her up with a blanket or rolling up her sleeves and then her pants legs claiming she's burning up.  I try to keep the temp around 70, but whenever I leave and come back she's got it at 78 or 64.   

I'm kinda at my wits' end here, both my mom and aunt live out of state and are counting on me to take care of her, but she is not allowing herself to be taken care of at all."
"All of my (23 F) grandparents on both of my parent's side have had dementia. My father is exhibiting signs of it, my mom will be any day now. I've seen how the people deep in the condition function, I've seen the people taking care of them all function. But both of my parents have had 4+ siblings to help them with it. They all take turns taking care of their parents, they share medical bills, information, care tips. I'm an only child and I know both of my parents and eventually, I will also succumb to the illness. I don't have this network of people who equally care about my parents wellbeing. I'm so scared of losing them slowly and alone. Idk, just venting."
"I’m kind of all over the place with emotions today. The past two years my mom’s health has been declining. She’s having trouble with speech, reasoning, daily tasks, remembering names and where she is. Yesterday she called the police because she was lost in her apartment. She lives in a Senior community, completely independent type of place. She’s 72 and has been there since the pandemic started. So today I visited after getting a call from her neighbor saying she’s having a bad day.

I live about 30 minutes away and work from home with a toddler. I usually have groceries either sent to her apartment or I get them personally on Sunday and spend the rest of the time digging framed pictures, bowls, plates, and other random items out of the drawers. I can spend a good 20 minutes pulling stuff out back to where they belong and the next day they’re all back in drawers. 

While I was there today, I encountered several nosy neighbors who basically said they didn’t think she had any family visit her or care for her. I’m the only family she has and do my best. She doesn’t really keep up with her appearance, brush her hair etc but that’s not really something I can control. I try to brush it for her and put it up if I’m there. I do my best to make sure her clothes are washed, has groceries, put her medicine out for the week and call her daily. Today was especially rough to the point my chest was getting tight and I just wanted to cry all day from the stress. 

I feel like I’m going crazy. Some of these people just have no idea how much I’m trying to keep it together. I know they shouldn’t matter, but it’s like I feel like a failure of a daughter. Right now I’m working with the VA to get her more benefits so we can look into assisted living. She’s a vet (was in the Marines) but these things take time and it’s a slow process. Just wanted to share this with other people who might understand better. Do you have days you just feel like you’re barely staying above water?"
"She complains that the room is spinning and she can’t feel her legs, yet INSISTS on trying to get up and walk constantly, and turns violently angry when you tell her to sit down, despite her collapsing multiple times recently. She will quite literally walk 8+ hours a day, and expects me to walk constantly beside her, despite being so exhausted that she’s about to pass out. I literally don’t know what to do to get her to sit tf down for any period of time more than a few brief moments"
"I want to visit with my dad more than I do but I never know what mental state he's in until I get there :( He sometimes is in the throes of a delusion or panic over fear of falling or... and other times he's calm and pretty happy to see me. 

He is currently in a rehab to recover strength after a hospital stay. He's been there long enough for me to try to figure out if there is a pattern or specific cause to the issues. Doesn't seem to be dependent on pain, hunger, tiredness, gas, or the phase of the moon even lol.

I *do* go, of course! It's just very hard trying not to get my hopes up before I see what's up.

It's especially hard when I have to leave right away because he's concerned for my safety because of some imaginary thing that might befall me if I stay. In his mind, he is bravely protecting me so if I don't leave right then, he gets even more upset! 

Anyone else have this sort of thing going on? Any tips??"

"The one thing my nan still does is make herself cups of tea throughout the day.

However more recently she's started putting milk and tea bags in the kettle so we've been trying to find alternatives of how we can safely give her hot water without having to worry about filling with water.

Anyone got any suggestions? We're rotating kettles and cleaning them at the moment, tried a hot water dispenser but they seem to have child locks which there's no way she could disarm herself."
"I'm 28 years old, so hopefully it would be a long time before I start suffering from Dementia (if ever, hopefully never). Taking care of my 80-year old father with Dementia is an eye opener for me. So this got me thinking.

Is there some kind of a will I can dictate, what I want to happen if ever get dementia? Like, currently I moved back to my home country (Philippines). If start suffering dementia here, I want to be sent back to America, and to be admitted to a home over there? I'm afraid that our laws here isn't strict enough when it becomes to protecting the elderly from caregiver abuse. I'm a citizen of both countries, so a visa isn't gonna be an issue. Also to tell them what food I like or don't like? I don't wanna be fed with something that I don't even like.

I just wanted to be in good hands when I get older. Especially, if I stay single by then."

I realize this group is for later stage issues, but I wanted to reach out in case there were people in early stages here trying to learn more. I am looking to do short 20-30 minute interviews, because I know the best program development comes from talking with people actually living with symptoms.

"So, if I'm being completely honest, we waited too long. The process for applying for Medicaid should have begun a year ago (or more). But, now we really need help and are looking at a Medicaid planner. Basically, you pay $$$ and they do all the paperwork for you and send it to the right place, and get you through the loops. Their mission is to (paraphrasing): Get you and loved one the support you need, while also ensuring you don't break the bank, and also getting through the bureaucracy nightmare and red tape.

So, has anyone found success using one of these planners? More specific details in the comments."
Anyone feel like they “beat” hereditary dementia because of taking estrogen?
"Hello, All! First time posting here so just want to say I admire and appreciate so many of the stories you all have shared. We are all in this together. 🌈

I have been intermittently helping care for an elderly relative with advancing dementia. She has a live in caregiver however life happens so I help wherever I can. She has been interested more and more in art so we have painted ceramics, paint by numbers, fine line coloring, and similar lower effort art related activities. 

She has awful arthritis so I’m not able to get her into more intensive art such as sculpting. She tends to forget what her original vision was for her pieces so she doesn’t free hand draw and sometimes will be stuck in a cycle of using one color so she doesn’t have to choose. 

Does anyone have suggestions for other art related activities I could introduce to her? I don’t want to rock the boat too much, I just want to make sure she is enjoying herself. I would hate for her to miss out on things that may be more stimulating for her. 

Thanks so much in advance!

TL;DR - Seeking suggestions for art activities that you’ve found useful/fun for someone with advancing dementia."
"Should I be concerned about my mom's memory? For context my mom is 51 and has always had a bad memory I'd know I've got one just about as bad. But idk thinking about dementia has got me concerned for her even though there's been no real family history of it. She does forget words or what she's going to tell me but usually remembers it a sec later and the stress from my dad being out sick for a few months might be also affecting her idk, I just wanted to vent a bit of my worries."
"Maybe this is a vent , maybe it’s an ask to see if I’m alone, maybe it’s a request for tips. My dad is 75 and caring for two years for my mom with Parkinson’s dementia. The entire time of caring for her he’s been nasty. He acts like she did this on purpose. He argues with her about her delusions when I keep telling Him not to. She complains he is mean and she is right. I live in a totally different city and he is utterly defensive and angry if I confront him. He has no compassion. I tell him “pray this doesn’t happen to you”. Finally after my urging he is putting her soon in a state of the art very nice assisted memory care. I’m sad she’s leaving her home but PRAY the structure and therapy will help and social interaction and that hopefully my dad will be nicer calmer with less stress . My brother just called and says he’s gonna confront my dad. I feel like that’s a bad idea . Anyhow - am I alone ? Any tips? Maybe this is a vent . My happy family has been RIPPED apart by this - this dysfunction didn’t exist before Parkinson’s dementia ."
"Really sorry about the format and rambling, this post is mostly me just getting all of this out of my head right now. 

For reference, we're in the UK (England),and my husband is 61.


Quick recap of how we got to this point...


Saw the GP at the beginning of the year re concerns about memory/panic attacks/general anxiety. 


GP made a referral to the Memory Clinic for a nurse assessment, which we had about 3 weeks ago. 


As a result of that, the nurse made a referral to a psychiatrist for a further assessment and possible diagnosis. We had that appt today. 


Unfortunately, neither of us (mostly me) feel that he focused enough on the memory and related issues, instead the impression I got was that he (the consultant) thought the memory issues were caused by depression and anxiety, rather than the depression and anxiety being the result of memory issues. Whilst at the appt today, we found that my husband had scored 71 on the Addenbrookes assessment, which I know is..... not good. 


The consultant we saw today is reviewing the information gained from today's appt, and is discussing it with his superior (the psychiatrist who is head of the department), and will call us tomorrow to give us his findings. 


My questions really are about how do I properly and fully convey my concerns about this? I honestly do not feel he really took our concerns as seriously as we do.


My thoughts are that the consultant we saw today thinks the memory issues are caused by the depression and anxiety, rather than the depression and anxiety bring a result of the memory issues. 


I absolutely do truly feel that my husband does have a form of dementia, but I think the consultant is reticent to diagnose that because of my husband's age (he's 61).


Does anybody have any ideas or information as to how we/I can help the consultant to fully understand this?"
"Hi all,

I've posted before about my grandpa who has vascular dementia, and need some advice again. The way my grandpa takes pills has always caused anxiety for me and my mom as we knew it would cause problems, but my grandpa kept saying that he hadn't lost a pill before so he didn't need to change. However, over the last few weeks we've had quite a few instances of losing pills. Thankfully we've been able to find them and figure out which pill it was so he's never gone without all of his meds. This weekend however two pills were lost/unable to remember if he took them/couldn't be found, so he went without what we assume are two meds. Despite this, my grandpa is still refusing to change how he takes pills, and it's causing lots of fighting. For those curious, one of the pills was found in the tissue box, we have no idea how it got there.

The way he takes his pills is that he dumps them from a small cup onto the table or sometimes from the cup to his hand to the table and separates his 5 pills to take separately (3 small pills, 1 big pill, and 1 big pill). He then THROWS the pills in his mouth, similar to throwing popcorn. His hand and mouth never meet, he has absolutely horrid  hand-eye coordination, and he is usually in a rocking recliner when he does this. Pills have been lost in numerous ways from rolling off the table to being thrown and rolling into his recliner. We've tried to help by having 3 separate cups for how he separates his pills and telling him to just dump the pill from the cup directly into his mouth, but he won't do it. Even with the pills in separate cups he still dumps them on the table before throwing them into his mouth. 

What can we do differently so we don't have to worry about lost pills? Do we give him each pill separately since he's refusing to stop and that way we would at least know which pill he dropped/lost? Do we keep forcing him to do it the way we think it safer?"
"We live with my 93 MIL who was diagnosed with dementia last year.  A while ago , she was convinced we were out of bread rolls, now she’s convinced she has no clean knickers.  She has about 30 pairs of the things!  I put them in the top drawer, she kept looking in the second drawer, so I put them in the second drawer.  Now she doesn’t look there and is convinced she has no clean pairs.

As frustrating as it is, it’s always lovely hearing her little gasp of surprise when she’s shown the myriad of knickers in her drawers!

Funny thing is, she could always find her hankies that are kept next to the knickers, but can’t find her knickers!

Edited to give a little background."

There is an excellent new series on TV called Ptolemy Grey, a story of an old man with advanced dementia who is offered a new breakthrough drug that will restore your memory and body to Pre-Dementia condition BUT it doesn't last forever and cannot be done twice.

Question: If you had advanced dementia would you

Like to see how the rest of your life plays out but CAN NOT change it in any way?

Just let it play out as it normally would?"
"Hi everyone. I want to start off by saying that I am a teenager, and I live with my 68 year old grandmother who was diagnosed with dementia sort of recently. She moved in with us a few months ago from another country. I don't live with her full time, I live with my mom also and my grandma lives with us for one week and with my aunt the next week, they each have her on alternating weeks. The thing is, my mom and aunt are unfit to care for her. They try their best and I know that they do, but they get easily frustrated, angry, tired and are burnt out at this point. My mom and aunt argue with each other all the time about her and they both argue with my grandma as well. They both work full time and have kids so it hasn't been easy on either of them and they are both just upset all the time, always angry with everyone because they're angry at the situation they're in. It's been hard for me because I'm currently in school and I often have to miss out on lectures or come home straight after class rather than do homework at the library or something because my mom needs me to watch my grandma, and I always do it, but this along with all the fighting and negativity surrounding this whole situation has become unbearable for me, for my mom, for my aunt, for everyone. I think for everyone's sake, finding some kind of facility that will care for her would be the absolute best thing to do.

The problem is, every facility or nursing home my mom has looked into is really expensive. Even with my aunt's help (who is already struggling financially), there just wouldn't be enough to cover these costs. What also adds to the problem is the fact that my grandma is not a US citizen (we live in the US). She has a visa which allows her to be in the US for 6 months at a time. That is how my grandma is here now. During this time, my mom is trying to get her citizenship worked out but I honestly don't know where she is in this process. I don't know how any of this works, so I'm not sure if she can get health insurance and if that can help cover the costs of a nursing home. I've tried researching what we can do, but nothing has really been clear to me because I really don't understand a lot of what I'm reading. Our state is North Carolina. I'm wanting to know if there's anything we can do to get my grandma full time care that won't cost an arm and a leg with her citizenship status. My grandma is really sick. Aside from dementia, she can't walk, bathe herself, feed herself, she wears diapers and my mom and aunt change her, she is completely dependent on someone else. She couldn't live on her own and her dementia is worsening rapidly. I'm really hopeful that there is something that can help us, this whole situation has been so miserable for everyone, I just want to come up with some kind of solution.

So, I guess my question is if someone knows anything regarding what we can do for her care under these circumstances, or if anyone can point me in any direction with knowledge about this kind of thing from our state, just any advice really. I think she is going to pass soon. I'm not really sure what my mom and aunt have arranged, but these nurses come to each my moms and aunts house when my grandma is there several days a week to bathe my grandma and give her medicine. It lasts for an hour each time they come over. Like I said, I'm not really sure what it is exactly, but I know my mom has these nurses in her phone as ""hospice"". I believe this is some kind of program that provides this for us, and they also allow us to put my grandma in a facility for only a week once a month, but we've only done that one time. I wish I had more knowledge on this program and what it is exactly, but my aunt took care of it for the most part. I know that we had to apply for it and my grandma was approved because of how sick she is. I know that its free. They've provided us a bed for my grandma and they gave my aunt one too, and a recliner chair and wheelchairs, all for free. Since this was possible to do for my grandma, I'm really hopeful that there's something else out there available to her that will ease this situation for all of us. It is something that helps out a lot but since the nurses only come for an hour 3 days a week, it's not exactly enough, I want to find something for her full time. I know that probably won't be free, I'm just wondering if there's something out there that's affordable. I apologize for my very limited understanding of how things work, I am still young and my mom doesn't talk to me much about these kinds of things, I help out with my grandma when it comes to cooking her something or shifting her position in bed when she's uncomfortable but that's really all my mom wants to involve me in. Thank you for reading and I hope to hear back from someone soon"
"Brief Background: I love my mother and want to take care of her. She is in her 70s, I am in my 30s. Most women in our family end up with some form of dementia. She has been forgetting things every now and then but she's aware of it. 

Why I'm posting is this: I once read that making a playlist of music that the person with dementia loves helps them in some way. 

What other little things like that help? We have family photos. She LOVES Words with Friends and that probably stimulates the mind. I'm just curious if anyone has had personal experience with something that helps their parent or patient. 

Also, what are some phrases I should say or avoid as this advances? 
I ask because of an incident that will always stay with me. When Aunt P had advanced dementia, we were told to avoid bringing up her deceased daughters (drunk driving accident) and to not ask if she remembers certain things. And Aunt M ignored this and asked Aunt P if she remembered my cousins doing something and then my Aunt P was confused and started asking where her daughters were despite them being deceased since the 1980s and started crying that they weren't there. 

I just want to be somewhat prepared so I'm not going into this blindly and I've seen people on Reddit help folks out so I thought I'd ask. My apologies if I didn't format this right or if this is in the wrong place. 

Thank you!

EDIT: While I appreciate the power of attorney suggestions and all the super serious responses of what to do when her dementia advances, I must clarify that is not what I asked. I asked for the personal little things that could help based on everyone's personal experiences. So I apologize if my post didn't express that clearly. So I mean stuff like the playlist of their favorite songs. My mother plays words with friends so maybe games that can help stimulate the mind. My Aunt P LOVED gardening and would always be happiest when we wheeled her outside to the flower garden. I'm just curious about the little moments you folks have had that made you smile for a bit. 

I am not looking for advice medically and what to do eventually medically and legally. We already know what to do. We have that taken care of. 

Someone responded with how the things I mentioned may not work. Again, I should clarify I was not asking if something would work or not. I am aware that some suggestions will not work. But it doesn't hurt to try! 

I feel like some are taking this post as I'm coming into my mom's dementia with a blind eye and don't know what to do with her while being grossly unprepared. And I can assure you that our family is prepared. =) 

So thank you for the replies, but I hope the edit clears up what I actually am asking for."
"TLDR - when moving cross country from their normal home to a care facility, how have people handled explaining the move, and any interim steps before getting to the care facility?

We’re moving my mom to a care facility, near our house which is across the country where she lives. It’s the right thing since she doesn’t really have a support structure where she lives and I’ve been having to fly back and fourth a lot to extinguish fires.

We’re brainstorming the best way to handle the move. She’s mid stage dementia so her cognitive swings can be large. I have POA so have full legal rights to decide care.

I’m worried about communicating too much and causing undue anxiety or even torpedoing the option.

She is excited at the prospect of visiting us and seeing her grandchildren. So we’re considering leaving it at that, then revealing the living arrangements once we’re there.

But even once we’ve cleared the cross country trip, at least, we’re not sure if it’s healthier to start in our house which she knows, then move her, versus going straight to the facility. The downside of being at home would be her getting the impression that it’s a viable option and causing agitation/confusion when we move. The downside of going straight to the facility would be potential for feeling ambushed with the choice. Of course, she may not even understand what’s going on, we may just be able to sell that it’s a temporary stay while we figure out care options.

The care facility itself couldn’t be lovelier. I’m really hopeful she’s going to be happy there, if we can land it."
"Hi all,

Recently my mum was diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia. We were expecting something as she had had sudden body weakness, hand tremors and some confusion around forgetting words at times, but certainly nothing so drastic a diagnosis. She just turned 70. She went through extensive testing so I'm not questioning the doctor at all, but after a weekend of research and emotion, I guess I'm looking for advice as to how to prepare for this sudden new future we have.

I'm an only child, so no siblings to lean on, and our extended family all lives abroad in different countries and are relatively elderly themselves (I'm not close to cousins etc), so there will be little to no support (parents don't want to tell them at the moment anyways). My parents live in Scandinavia, I live in the UK, so I can't even offer support at the moment of being nearby. I know I'll have to have a conversation with my dad about potentially bringing her closer as the disease progresses. We're lucky that at the moment she's still herself, no real memory issues beyond forgetting the odd word, just physical at the moment though she does find it hard to focus at times and the doctor has taken her driving licence.  The question:

Have you got any advice on what I could be doing now to help her and my dad, or even help myself for the long run? I feel like the bottom of my world has fallen out and I've got to find a way to make sense of it and plan. Maybe there's nothing I can do right now but to ride this emotional roller coaster, but any advice you can give me, or if anyone has had to support parents through this from afar as well, would be gratefully received.  TL;DR- Mum diagnosed with dementia, I want to help but in different countries."
So my mom's 70th was last week. But this Saturday we had a celebration for her. My family and my brothers family. We all all had a great time. Food and drinks. When we sang her happy birthday I got emotional. All the emotions hit me at thest time. It was great seeing her enjoy herself. It's one of those moments where she knows what's going on and was pleased that everyone was there for her. She was tired but didn't want to sleep because she knew what was going on. We took pics and just enjoyed the moment. Just wanted to share this with you guys.
"I look after my mother in her home for a few days each month. She takes four pills each day; three in the morning and one and night. During the days things are usually okay. However, at night she keeps requesting her daily meds even after she’s taken them. She gets really upset when I try to explain she’s done for the day. I’ve tried everything to calm her down, addressing her worries, changing the subject, even called my dad on video (I’m watching her while she’s at work). But once she’s got her mind set on doing something, she doesn’t stop. She’s come into my bedroom a few times and to wake me up and ask for me for her meds. I was wondering if anyone had any tips for handling something like this. I considered a placebo, but I don’t want to setup a pattern where she begins to expect that too. Any recommendations would be appreciated."
I'm going to visit my grandma tomorrow who has pretty severe dementia. She's currently in the hospital with a pretty bad case of pneumonia. Are there things I should say/shouldn't say? Last time I saw her she still remembered my name but I was informed that she's in pretty bad shape now and may not remember me. I just want to keep her company and make her feel better.
"Is vomiting a symptom of dementia? Two days in a row she’s vomited up her dinner. She has no nausea, no fever, no incontinence. She’s sedentary all day. She forgets to eat if I don’t provide means. I’m at a loss y’all."
Does anyone know any good household chores someone with mobility issues other than folding laundry? I want to keep her busy and her mind off of missing the home she's sitting in. Maybe if she feels useful it will feel more like home.
"Hello everyone. I am new to posting here but have browsed this sub recently. I am really mentally struggling right now. 
I have noticed since around November-December that my mom (74) has become increasingly confused and forgetful. She cannot remember what day of the week it is or any dates. The doctor asked her what the year was and she said 2000, but then changed it to 2020. She has also trouble with recalling the name of certain items and she no longer drives. The doctor’s have diagnosed her with dementia but are still trying to determine the type and cause. Tested for UTI (negative), no thyroid issues, no b12 issues.
My mom was the caretaker for my daughter (2 years old) up until I began to notice the memory struggles. She is obviously upset with not taking care of her each day as her (only) granddaughter is her world.
We are in the process of moving my mom in with us. 
All this being said… how do you mentally handle this? I am struggling more than words can express. I am not finding joy in things that I used to and am losing significant weight. My mom was my only family member growing up and losing my mom in this slow process is killing me. I don’t know how I can make it."
"I've posted here a couple times before. I've been caring for my mother for the past four years. She has dementia, Dr says probably Alzheimer's. Mid way through last year her POA was activated, she doesn't have any assets and lives off of social security. For four years she has lived with me and I've taken care of her medications, food, laundry, and every other little thing aside from toileting and bathing. Obviously with the nature of dementia I've watched her decline over the years, it's to the point where she doesn't really know who I am half the time but she luckily always seems to trust me. I've been beyond burnt out for the past several months. But working with state assistance programs we finally found an assisted living facility with memory care that is a great fit for her.

Within the next week we will be moving her in. I know with every fiber of my being this is the best decision for her and her health. As well as my health since I really have not been able to take care of myself over the past several months. It sure doesn't make it any easier, she tells me ""my heads messed up but it's not that bad"" and ""I don't need to be in a nursing home"" (she's not going into a nursing home, it's a community based residential facility, assisted living).

She can't make food for herself, can't tell the difference between a TV remote and a telephone most of the time, she doesn't know who her son or daughter is, can't adjust a thermostat without assistance. But I can't be her caregiver anymore, I just want to be her son again nothing more. She also tells me how much she hates being alone, though she's alone a lot of the time. I have to work a full time job I have bills to pay, and selfishly I want to be able to spend time with friends and enjoy hobbies along with going to the gym. 

I know this is the right decision, every single family member knows it is the right decision. The doctors agree it's the right decision. None of that makes it any easier. I'm absolutely terrified of how moving her in will go. I'm an anxious mess, but at the same time I can't wait to have my life back. So many conflicting feelings."
"I tried searching the sub but didn’t see anything related to disability. 

I’m wondering how many people on here have loved ones that were approved for disability based on their diagnosis of dementia? My mother has FTD and we just did her ssi application and I was supposed to have until 3/21 to process the disability claim but they randomly denied it on 3/8 without any medical information input. I’ve been going back and force with one of her doctors who keeps sending me records that aren’t correct due to a computer error. The national number doesn’t pick up even after an hour on hold and my local office legit has their phones off and has had their doors locked since 2020. I’m just wondering how many people had an approval for disability? Did you do it on your own or did you get an attorney?

Edit: she’s only 62 so she isn’t eligible for regular Medicare for a few years"
"My mom got fired from her job because of how forgetful she’s been and bizarre her behavior is recently. She has trouble following a conversation and forgets words/ various timelines. She is always confused. She went to the dr and they told her she had bad thyroid problems and that this might be the cause. I was relieved. However after getting an MRI they told me she has mild atrophy. I do however see improvements with her since she took off of work, stopped drinking and is on thyroid medication. The dr just prescribed her memantine. 
Does this mean my mom has Alzheimer’s? Or dementia? I don’t know what’s going on. I’m very scared and sad. Should expect for it to get so much worse?"
"My dad went missing for 3 hours today. He has been showing mental decline for a year or so but this is the first time he's 'wandered'. He remembered my sis in laws phone # thank God and knew enough to stay at the hospital until he got a hold of her. How he got there, where he went and why is still a mystery, he had no idea and was clearly shaken up and scared too. He was supposed to go live in an independent living lodge but now it seems that's not going to happen....he probably needs a dementia ward in long term care. He will be staying with my sister in law for now and we can at least share in the responsibility with him coming here for the weekend. Ugh so scary and so stressful 😫 but thank God he wasn't hurt or lost all night."
"Being the most horrifying way to leave earth, I would've assumed that there have been some breakthroughs, but I overestimate how far science has developed :("

"Mums been discharged from hospital and is now bedbound. Is delirous, has carers 4 times a day to help with double incontinence, and needs feeding. Feeding can take 50 minutes to eat a sandwich, and 20-30 minutes to drink a cup of juice. All feeding is by hand by myself or siblings. All household duties are caried out by myself daily as i do not live there. 

Local council is now asking for full financial assessment but no NHS continuing healthcare assessemnt has been carried out

Does the healtcare asssessment have to be carried out before the financial assessemnt to pay for the care?

Does anybody have any advice?"
My mother-in-law's favorite sister-in-law died a few days ago and we just found out. Do I have to tell her?  I think it might confuse her more and definitely distress her. Thoughts?
"Hi guys!

We recently have done a trial run with a caretaker to just hang out for a couple of hours and socialise with my dad/make sure he doesn't go outside by himself/basically keep him company while I do homework for my classes. She's from church, and she knows him and he said he knew her, so we figured it'd be alright. But now when she's actually here, he hides in his room and doesn't come out until she's gone. One time he came out she managed to coax him out she talked with him for about an hour or so, and I thought that was okay. But the next day she came and he saw her, she said ""Come out and we can chat as friends :)"" and he just said ""I don't want to talk to you."" 

My dad used to be a social butterfly, and he liked talking to everyone but nowadays he mostly spends time in his head or talks to his hallucinations.  Is it normal for people with dementia/Alzheimer's to withdraw like this? Just wondering if anyone has any similar experiences!"
"For those of you who have gone through taking car keys away from a loved one with Alzheimer’s, what are some tips you can give to make the transition easier from driving to no longer driving?  My mother lives in a very rural area with not many options for in home care as she is so far away from larger cities. We want to keep her in her home as long as we can but we worry with her being so far away with no neighbors to help if needed. Appreciate your suggestions!"
"When people with dementia remember something, whether it be they are told or just happen to remember, do they remember like it’s something new and shocking or do they remember like “Oh yeah, I forgot” as if they have always known and just forgot recently?"
I’ve been part of this forum for a few months now and I noticed that many of the caregivers here are the grandchildren of the dementia patients.  I feel for these folks who have such a heavy burden at such young ages.  It was hard enough for me as a middle aged person to manage my mom’s care.  I hope they can get the support they need for such a hard job.
"My lovely wife sundowns… in the morning. When I'm pre-caffienated to make things worse (like, 7 a.m. so don't try to suggest I wake up to slam coffee earlier). She's waitlisted for Adult Daycare, and meanwhile goes to group therapy, mostly to get her out of bed & to socialize. 

Pitches a b*tch *every* morning. ""Don't wanna go! I'll do self-harm! Aaaagh."" Like getting a cat in the carrier to go to the vet.  Why does she hate therapy so much? And return from therapy in a far better mood every time?

Was reading *The 36 Hour Day.* Suggestion there: figure out what's *really* twonking the loved one, rather than what they struggle to *say* is bugging them.

Ah-hah! She was kicked out of home as a young adult, 2/3 of a lifetime ago. Still haunts her. So what she's really fearful of is not ""going to therapy,"" but getting locked out when she returns home. Addressed that concern with reassurances, and the morning went a bit more smoothly.

Not sure I can keep up the Hail Mary Hat Trick mindreading act, but there it is. Hope this helps someone else."
"It's weird because my grandmother had dementia for over 10 years.  It was progressing but slowly. First episodes, confusion, some irrational behavior but she was still her. Then she forgot how to cook, forgot to bathe, and forgot to eat. My parents took her in a year ago to be her caregivers. It progressed to incredibly fast, so so fast. She went through Covid as well which I hear makes things worse but still. Every month was worse than the last. Her memories were gone, she became extremely agreeable to everything, started eating things that were not food, forgot when she ate and was always trying to ear more,she had to be spoon fed and she had to use diapers and was 80% bedridden. Then she had a stroke. My grandma passed away yesterday. I just wonder, did we do something wrong here. Is it normal to just decline so so fast? She was 91 years old but I don't know if age has anything here."
"Sometimes on Fridays we share the humor we find in the situation of caring for those with dementia.  It can be dark humor, because it can be a dark situation.  And the humor's unlikely to be understood by people who haven't been here.  No offense intended to anybody including those we're caring for.

(Sorry, I've got nothing.  But go for it...)"
"I so rarely get personal online, but I just have to vent this before I burst. 

My mom started showing signs that I saw about 9-10 months ago that dementia was creeping in. You all know the deal - the repeated stories, the forgetting things, confusing timelines a little, and agitation when anyone tried to help her do anything - but she was still very much in control and lucid. She was in denial, as I’d asked her about the memory loss several times and she just brushed it off, but she’d just have moments. She was still running the show. 

Saturday she fell and suffered a subdural hematoma. It’s been a sharp decline since then. 

The bleeding has stopped, she’s physically well, but she’s completely lost in her mind. Adding to this is the fact that I had not been able to see her in 4 years owing to living 600 miles away and COVID. (We had a trip planned to visit in August 2020 to see her for the first time in a couple of years… so you know how that went.)

Last week I talked to my mother and she was excited she’d found a new primary care doctor that she really liked, that she and my 83 year old step father were given a pretty clean bill of health for their age, and we talked about a lot of things. She said I love you at the end of the call like always. 

I drove 9 hours to come see her yesterday, knowing she was confused after the fall but my stepfather sugar coated what he’d told me a lot. I’m not angry - I completely understand why he’s in the state he’s in. But I just wasn’t quite prepared for today. 

Today I saw her for the first time in 4 years and she sort of registered who I was, but kept telling me she had to get off the phone and go cook dinner, and I didn’t even get the normal I love you from the end of calls. And it only got worse after that - that’s one of the laugh to keep from crying bits. Later she bit and scratched me because she was very angry that I would not take her home, and I’m currently trying very hard to get some tiny bit of rest in a chair next to her bed in the care facility, because she is just relentlessly trying to get up and go home after repeatedly stripping off any clothing we try, she’s completely unstable on her feet, and we were advised against bed rails bc she is super agitated and would hurt herself on them more likely than not. So I’m exhaustedly keeping vigil until my stepdad comes back in the morning. She keeps telling me I’m her good baby boy and it’s time to go to bed. I’m her only child; her daughter. Her dog is the good baby boy she’s talking to. 

I’m so tired and broken. My stepfather is just lost in a haze and can’t face the reality. I’m so sad I didn’t get to see her when she could see me. 

I have so much to do and I can’t stop crying. The doctors have said that she may regain some lucidity, but it’s unlikely we will get her even back to a week ago and that most likely she won’t be in control. 

I have some resources to lean into and we’ve been lucky enough to receive excellent medical care; I knew this was coming in a way, and I’ve checked out this sub and other research a few times to confirm what I was thinking and trying to keep an eye out for when it was time to step in. But I was not ready for this sudden change. I thought I had more time. We had a trip planned in October hoping to be in a semi-post COVID world enough to feel safe seeing them. I’m shattered. 

Oh also my actual father has pulmonary fibrosis and prostate cancer and likely won’t make it til April. His mind is still sharp but that’s almost a curse at this point as his body fails completely. My step mom is taking great care of him, but it’s just so much grief to bear at once. 

I’m not sure where I’ll find the strength to get through this. I know I will, I just cannot figure out where it’s gonna come from right now."
"TL;DR at bottom

My nana and I fairly close. There is very rarely a day we don’t speak in some form despite the 800 miles between us. She is coming up on being 80 this year and I’m concerned about personality and behavioral changes that are increasing in frequency over time.

She is often forgetting the words to various things. When I try to help and offer solutions she gets flustered and that is turning into anger now. 

Her hoarding behavior has taken on new heights. Before I moved away she was a pack rat who kept various sentimental things and had a storage room that was reasonably filled. According to her now she has two and a half rooms full. Full meaning you literally can’t go in there. This are closed off rooms that don’t impede her ability to move around the house or affect immediate safety. The items hoarded are not immediate health hazards (mostly files and new things). But her unwillingness or inability to throw out a grocery receipt from 1998 is concerning. 

She used to walk a lot. I’m talking many miles a day up until the pandemic. It began with a reasonable concern about her health in going to shops but she eventually stopped taking leisurely walks and has since developed into a refusal to leave her home almost entirely. My mother (who I am NC with) lives with her for the time being and she does her errands for her. 

She has turned to seemingly manipulative tactics for attention. Calling me in tears worried that I’m hospitalized because I didn’t call her for a few days despite the fact that we did text back and forth that morning. Calling me in tears again concerned about my sister having Covid and worried if she’s going to be ok even though my sister never had a severe case and was recovering well and she didn’t tell her she had Covid until after she was on the mend.

She is denying things she has said that I have text and voicemail proof of that I show her and she holds her ground saying to just move on from it and she didn’t say that. 

What in the world can I do to help her? I cannot afford to go see her financially or otherwise. I can’t afford any type of attorney either. I cannot reach out to my mother to help her for my own safety. Most of my other family does not speak to her due to these escalating behaviors. She is refusing to go in for a check up and claiming her mind is as sharp as ever. While she is right in some ways there, in most ways she is not. She isn’t perfect but I love her so much.

TL;DR- what can I do to help my nana from so far away with no money, denial from her and no help from other family?"
"That sums my day up pretty well. It is now day 12 and she continues to refuse to take a shower. Everyone in the household is being affected by the hygiene issue. I’ve tried shower chairs, music, warm fluffy towels…nope and nope. I’ve tried talking to her about it, if there’s a reason - fear - concern but no. She just doesn’t like to be told what to do - she stated this quite clearly, several times. This is now a regular battle. I have had to rebook medical appointments….I am embarrassed and feel like a failure. It’s actually distressing to myself and my daughter. Then there’s the increase in potential UTI etc…more pills, more dr.’s, more hospital visits. I’ve been going through this cycle with her for months….

I am currently ill and my energy levels are pretty close to bankrupt. I really need some solid suggestions if anyone has any please…"
"Mom was recently diagnosed w MCI & early stage vasc dementia based on a 2021 MRI and a several-hour neurocog psych exam. She was deemed well enough to live independently. But I live with her and know this is not the case. She can’t even use the phone correctly anymore. She can’t dial numbers. She has a follow up appt w her neurologist in 7 weeks but today I called to see if we could expedite things. I reported that she had become violent w me, (she bit me and brought the garage door down on my car) that she had hit a parked car and that I was concerned about her driving. I stated that I do not intend to live w her permanently—I am only here temporarily (because she lied to me and told me she had cancer). The nurse l i t e r a l l y said “**well this is what happens when our parents age; it’s our turn to take care of them**.” (My mother emotionally & physically abused me my entire childhood, so if I were to show her the same level of “care” that she showed me she’d probably kill herself). Sorry I just needed a place to vent. I feel so trapped and I keep trying to reach out to her doctors and am met w indifference. My mother is in denial that she has any problems at all yet still depends upon me heavily yet becomes nasty and combative at the drop of a hat. I fantasize about my mother dying in her sleep. When I wake in the morning and hear her stirring downstairs my heart sinks. I am turning into a monster. I simply cannot take much more of this. (And yes I am in therapy). Thanks for listening and letting me rant."
"Mum got to the point where we need to consider a full time carer or a home. Did ask my dad to sort power of attorney but never did and now he not accepting the fact and letting lack of hygienic and eating go.

As such I want to take over and get her assessed for a home but assume I need the above.

Any advice on this or how you went about care when not all family's agree would be much appreciated"
We recieved a complaint about my dad being unable to aim and making a mess in his assisted living bathroom. Other than upping maid services what can long distance family members do? Are there devices or aids that help?
"My mother is being sent to a mental institution. She's been assessed as a danger to herself and others.  She started the day by trying to punch and kick my stepfather.  She picked up the phone and dialed 911.  She had them send her an ambulance. She demanded they ""take her to a nursing home."" My stepfather had them send her to an excellent nearby hospital.  She, as I mentioned above, was assessed. They are putting her in a mental facility and they say she will never go home again. She'll be sent to a nursing home with capacity for mental illness.

For context, she has dementia, and about a year and a half ago she fell and cracked her right ocular socket, bashed the back of her head and got a massive hematoma and concussion.  She then, a few months later, fell down the main staircase in their house. She hit her head and also broke her ankle. She had a massive stroke. A few weeks later she fell down another flight of stairs and hit her head.  On top of her dementia she also has brain damage, memory loss and a a memory span of about 2 minutes.

Recently she's become more aggressive and paranoid. Culminating in today where she's threatened to kill herself and my stepdad.

I just needed to share this with folks who can understand."
"Im 40 and ive been crying for the last 7 months.  My wife and I suspected my mother was developing dementia about 6 years ago when she started ""hearing music"".  Then she dealt with thyriod cancer and radiation pills for the last 2 years and the dementia ramped up.  My dad started answering the phone as my mom became more confused and often asked for her mom (died 50 years ago).  The last 2 months she hit late stage HARD.  Angry.  Thousand mile stare.  Constant desire to go home and find her mom.  Sleeping most of the day. Not recognizing my dad who has been her caregiver through it all.  Falls, weakness.  2 weeks ago she stopped eating.  This past weekend she collapsed and my dad had to take her to the ER.  They admitted her, treated for a fall and UTI.  She was afraid and scared, confused, couldnt swallow, wouldnt eat.  She was mostly unintelligible but puckered up to get a kiss from my dad before we left. The hospital talked around what was really going on even though we knew. Then they brought in palliative care to dicuss hospice.  We made the decision based on her end of life health orders to move her to hospice.  She will pass soon, morphine assisted sleep, seemingly peacefully.  I read some james patterson to her.  Mu dad played her some music.  We left for today. This condition stole my amazing mom.  Funk you dementia.

Edit: i have a standing weekly appointment for phone counseling. My dad is in a caregiver support group.  I have an incredible wife and 3 amazing young boys.  We are as supported as can be thankfully.  Just venting with people who understand.  Thank you."
"I hope this post makes sense and hasn't been covered already. I tried looking through but could not see an answer. Sorry if it's a bit all over and will try to keep short.

I'm 29, my dad is 67 and my mam 57. They live together. Around five years ago my mam first phoned and said I may notice a difference in my dad, he's forgetting things more. As I didn't visit home often, I didn't really notice much. It wasn't until COVID that I really noticed, and the last six months, have got particularly worse. A few years ago, he had memory tests and passed, but he's had more recently and did not do well. It's to the point now where every conversation we are repeating. Taking a list to the shop for two items is pointless because he forgets he has a list, doesn't brush teeth, struggles with movies now etc.

However, this is not the only thing we've noticed. My dad gets extremely down and has very sudden mood swings, he's restless to point that he's taken two months to do some invoices that should have taken days. He can be quite insensitive when talking to people - rude, almost cruel, sometimes pretty vulgar, and not realising it. He can be so angry, and his mood changes so quick and he gets down. He struggles in group situations and will become withdrawn because he can't keep up with conversation, and when replying his response doesn't make sense or relate to the topic. It's the personality change that has been really difficult to see - he is so angry, down, fed up, withdrawn. He constantly wants to go out somewhere with my mam (who is often tired from work) and gets really upset/angry when she wants to go out with a friend as he feels he is being left alone. I'm trying to come home more to help, I work from home, but he often wants to go out somewhere and it's hard to say no.

He has had memory tests, CT scan and is having an MRI scan on Sunday. After looking at the types of dementia, we thought all the personality changes could mean it is a form of frontotemporal dementia - but of course this could be totally wrong, he just has all symptoms listed.

It's been five years since they first went to the doctor. The awful thing is my dad still believes he is just getting old and this is standard forgetfulness, but as I said, we can barely have a ""normal"" conversation now. We still have not had a diagnosis, but something is definitely not right, whatever the outcome is after MRI. 

We were at my dad's brothers funeral today (72, Parkinson's). It is the first time we have mentioned it to my Aunty as we are not close and she told us you are much better trying to sort power of attorney before the diagnosis. My friends mam also said this, as she had to with her own mother. We were planning to talk to my dad about this after more results come through but now we think it is best we talk to him as soon as possible. To be honest, we are both concerned about whether he will get much worse before we get the diagnosis and then it will become much more difficult.

Does anyone have any advice with the situation? The big concern is waiting for a diagnosis and by that time he could be much worse, but he is a very proud person and it's going to be an extremely difficult conversation.

Thanks for reading and sorry if I went on abit, or this has been answered.

Edit: UK based and sorry for ignorance on this matter!

Edit 2: Thank you so much to everyone who took the time to reply to my post, and the detailed responses. It means a lot. 

I'm frustrated at myself because I've read over the gov web pages/AgeUK/Alzheimer's websites so many times. My mam's reading comprehension isn't the best, so I've read them to her and explained what I've read. She has been working in a care home for the last 18 months and we've done all her at home tests together, including one on POA, so I don't know why we didn't think we could get it started beforehand.

I've always called my parents my best friends, and my dad will always be the person who could make me, and my mam, laugh until we cried and our sides were in agony. I'm staying home 2/3 weeks at a time at the moment, because my mam is still working and for some reason, my dad is a lot more understanding and mellow with me than anyone else. We're going to talk after having breakfast today.

I know that's unnecessary info, I guess it just feels good to put it off my chest to complete strangers.

Thank you so much. Don't really post on Reddit but so glad I did.

Edit 3: Spoke to him this morning with my mam and he was very honest about things and seems to have come to terms with the fact that everything isn't normal and he is getting worse. He's very happy for my mam to have POA and me to be replacement should anything happen to her. Started the application form, just need to print it out and he has asked our neighbour to be certificate provider. Thanks everyone. Such a big relief and so happy to be moving forward."
"My father was very mean to his caregiver last night. It was completely out of character for him, should I tell him today while he is in a different state?"
"My mom, who has Lewy Body dementia, was always very weight-conscious, often telling me or my brother how we need to lose weight (even if we were exercising and generally healthy and happy, just not skinny). It was frequently a point of conflict for us. So when I moved home to help take care of her, I prepped myself emotionally for the comments she would undoubtedly make, because a) I was already ""curvy"" and then gained a lot of pandemic weight and b) dementia means you lose every filter.

But the completely unexpected thing is that now, she is always telling me how good I look. How pretty I am. What an attractive woman I am. Not *once* has she commented on my weight. I like to dye my hair bright colors like blue or red, and she frequently comments on how much she loves that, so she still does pay attention to appearances - she just doesn't give a damn about how much I weigh. (Also, oddly, she will always notice if I do something different to my hair, even if it's subtle - even if she isn't quite sure who I am, she knows my hair isn't like it was yesterday. Dementia is weird and wild.)

And it's like a small gift that this disease has brought me. To know that what matters to her about me *is not my weight*.

I'd give it up in a heartbeat to have my mom back with all her capability and memory, of course. But having her say those things... I didn't realize how much I wanted to hear that from her, and it means so much to hear it now.

I don't even know why I'm posting this, but it overwhelms me a little and I guess I just wanted to share.

&#x200B;

*editing to add: My mom generally was always very encouraging toward me and told me often how she admired my intellect or my emotional intelligence, so she has mostly been a very positive presence in my life. But the weight thing, that really was the one big problem, and I think like most people I tend to remember the negative thing someone said over the positive things they also said.* "
"As I sit here hammered, reminiscing my dad who truly was and still is my hero, he is unfortunately knocking on heavens door. He’s at the point of no return but still a happy charismatic man. His interest and appetite for food is out the window. We know what will happen next and it sucks. 

He has had dementia for 22 years and I’m in awe but very happy that he’s lasted this long. Cheers to you Jhonny M. We love you!

r/dementia thank you not only for just me but for everyone, such a good community. Keep on keeping on! ✌️"
"About 4 years ago, I was going through a divorce and in need of a place to stay.  So I crashed in my mom's spare bedroom, intending to only stay a few months while I figured things out.  But, about three months after I moved in, she was diagnosed with dementia.  So my siblings and I discussed things with her, and being that it was early stages, she pretty much understand everything we were saying.  It was decided that I would just continue to live with her to ensure that she was safe.  Plus I became her chauffer as the doctor forbid her to drive anymore.  And the slow decline began.  It really wasn't too bad.  Especially compared to what others have gone through.  She never got aggressive or violent.  She got frustrated at times, like when she looked at picture of someone and couldn't figure out who it was, but she knew that person was important to her, because otherwise why would she have a picture of them.  And she would get depressed when I would tell her who it was.  It was heartbreaking to see her not recognize her father or her sister or her grandchildren.   But, overall, things weren't bad.  She never wondered off or anything like that.  Then 2022 happened.  

She tested positive for covid on the Jan 7.  She recovered from covid, but never got her strength back.  On Feb 4th, she went to the ER. She was diagnosed with a severe UTI and Spesis.  She was admitted to the hospital.  On the 2nd night her oxygen dropped to 48% and she was rushed to the ICU where she spent 2 days.  After that she was moved back to a regular room and spent a total of 10 days in the hospital. She was then sent to a rehab center.  

She has not made any progress and today the rehab center informed us that they will discharge her  on the 18th.  But, she needs 24/7 care now.  So, she will have to go to a nursing home.  And I guess she will just spend the rest of her life in a bed.  

Frankly, I've reached a point that I never thought I would.  If she's not going to get any better, then I'm hoping the rest of her life isn't going to be very long.  My prayers are now asking God to take her.  Let her go to heaven and be with my Dad and with her parents again.  

Dementia sucks."
My mom was diagnosed with vascular dementia last year. Along with some mental confusion came hand tremors. The medication prescribed by her doctors seems not to help. I was wondering if anyone had any experience using THC or CBD to treat the tremors or if there is any information about it.
"Hello! I just got my mom a tablet and I'm looking for games for her. The word puzzle I downloaded has coins that you win and buy. I'd rather just buy one so she's not confused and doesn't have ads.

Thanks so much!!"
i have been a pca for about 5 months buts just started working with residents in memory care. i get lots of help from my coworkers but wanted additional tips from people who also work with those who have dementia. mostly just need tips for redirecting or how to respond to them when they are confused in a way that isnt lying to them coz i do feel really awful doing that and want to avoid causing them any sort of distress if i can. any help anybody has to offer is greatly appreciated \^\_\^ thank you
"Hello,
My mother have middle stage dementia and for a long time likes to go to bed very early, sometimes 17 or 18 hours. The worst problem is that she stays in bed until 10 AM and only exits it to go to the living room to eat and drink when I tell her, and when I exit the living room and let the TV turned on, after a couple minutes she wants to stay in bed again, so I have to keep ""fighting"" through all the day to make she stay out of her bed until it's the right time to sleep. I put a new TV in her bedroom and I think it maybe can help she stay awake more time, and I'm planning to hire a in home caregiver to help me, but I don't know how to orient the caregiver if my mother tell she wants to go to bed. I'm supossing staying in bed or trying to sleep for so many hour isn't healthy for her, and I want to make she sleep fine through the night. I also have a care camera to see how she is sleeping at night, and most nights she seens to be sleeping fine.

Can anyone give me some tips on this problem?"
"A friend of mine ordered me a book on Amazon titled: Dementia Myth: Most Patients With Dementia Are Curable by a Dr. Vernon Coleman. I haven’t opened it yet because I’m not quite sure how to handle it at the moment. Part of me is curious and part of me is furious.

Before I take a look, has anyone else come across this book? It says he’s a UK doctor. Is there any merit to what he says?"
This grief I have felt for so long with my dad going through dementia I’m worried I will never break out the fog and feel like me again. My libido is gone. My energy is gone and I can’t remember the last time I was anything like myself. Will this ever pass?
Thank you everyone for your support over these months. We are pretty sure 90 year old grandmother has passed overnight. The hospice nurse is on her way. It’s been a ride. I’m glad she is at peace.
"My dad, formerly diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, has been rediagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy. It doesn't change anything obviously, but it explains his symptoms and rapid deterioration much better.


Mostly he appears to be early stage, with some of his symptoms presenting mid stage. Palliative care will become mandatory as his mobility decreases and he requires more help to toilet, shower and eat.


Thank you to everyone on this sub for being so supportive and honest when I asked how realistic I was being regarding caring for my newborn and dad at once - the new diagnosis will all but guarantee that when I finish maternity leave at Christmas time, he will enter palliative care, but for now he is safe here and his decreasing mobility makes him less of a risk yo my child as things progress."
"My relative has dementia. And I'm shopping around some activities for him. 

So far I have mix and match card games. (I turn cards over and he picks two and I flip them only for him to try to remember where previous cards were). 

I also got a coloring book. 

Which is better for coloring. Markers, crayons or pens ?

Any advice I can have for activities?"
"But unfortunately the dementia is progressing rapidly and she keeps saying she is going to call the police. Is there any way to let her have her phone with full functionality but block her from being able to call the police? Or is there a way to let the police know that calls from that line should be disregarded?

Thanks for the help"
"i live with my grandparents & aunt who came to help when my grandfather had a stroke, he’s since had a second stroke and is nearing some of the later stages of dementia soon but he still eats and walks with a walker and talks, he remembers mostly just important things but has bad short term memory. he cannot go to the bathroom or do any hygiene on his own so my aunt and grandma do it. he’s very combative and angry so when they clean him (maybe he feels uncomfortable?) he starts yelling and him and whoever is cleaning him start fighting if he hits them. he likes me a lot and attaches to me, he listens to me maybe 90% of the time maybe bc i don’t fight with him so therefore i beg to help as he’s much more calm with me but they won’t allow it. my grandma does not want to put him in a nursing home but my aunt has been coercing her and my grandma feels backed into a corner and has begun calling places. i understand it’s hard for everyone but i think it’s wrong as my grandpa has verbally expressed numerous times that he absolutely does NOT want to go to a nursing home. Now my aunt just said if he gets violent and hits her one more time she’s going to call somebody to have him ‘picked up and taken away’ saying she will tell them he’s a danger to the family. is this even possible? i love my grandpa and i think that doing that to him would be honestly beyond cruel. i live in Florida and i’m not sure if this could even happen, does anybody know?"
"After several hours of a neurocognitive psych eval two weeks ago, combined w results from an MRI done in June 2021, her neurocognitive psychologist gave the diagnosis of “mild cognitive impairment” & “early stage vascular dementia” but based on what I’ve seen (I live w my mom) I feel like I’m taking crazy pills. Here are just a few examples: 
1. She wrongfully believed she had cancer and told everyone that she was having a hysterectomy for her cancer 
2. She cannot drive to any place she does not already know 
3. When she drives w both hands on the wheel she wobbles and weaves 
4. She cannot remember how to use her cell phone to do simple things like make a phone call—she could not remember my phone # the other day & could not figure out how to call me despite it being saved in her contacts
5. Backing out from the driveway, she hit a parked car (owner didn’t contact insurance, he said it was an old car & didn’t matter)
6. She never knows what day it is, misses appts or shows up on the wrong days/times 
7. She gets aggressive & violent w me over nothing 
8. She’s sedentary 24/7 

She is intelligent and charming and knows how to “turn it on” long enough to fool someone during a phone call. I am keeping a list of all of my concerns to share w her neurologist, but that appt isn’t until the end of April. I am worried she may hurt someone in the meantime w her driving, but I also can’t say anything to her doctors in front of her (she was abusive to me growing up & frequently explodes at me when she feels I’m “under-riding her authority”.) In your experience, have doctors sometimes misdiagnosed dementia? Is there anything more I can be doing to keep her and others safe? I’m really stressed and I keep communicating w her doctors but it feels like it falls on deaf ears."
I am currently doing work experience in a care home with some dementia patients in and I was looking for some advice on activities to do with the people to get them to do something they’d like. Thank you
"Can dementia happen really quickly? I've always thought it took a decade or two of gradual decline but I'm worried about my mother. She's 82. My dad died a year ago and her dog died a month or two later, so she's now living on her own. Since then she's declined quite quickly. I thought initially it was just because my dad had done all the practical stuff and she was out of her depth having to make decisions (even though I've been doing most stuff), but it's more than that now.

She stayed with me for a few weeks in November and I had to label my bins because she couldn't work out what rubbish went where, even though I told her a couple of times. She's now labelled her own bins as well. She couldn't work out how to put the lid on my kettle or use the chain on the front door. I got suspicious in December when she called a wine glass a ""stemmed tumbler"" - it's technically accurate, but no-one ever says that! She's used odd wording a few times since then but she's now tending to call everything ""stuff' because she doesn't know the word. She keeps telling me about things she can't find because she can't remember where she left them.

She's now finding lots of things confusing. She can't find the words and admits to feeling muddled.  She's on a number of pills and I asked her today how she knew what pills to take when and she just stood there. She had no idea how to explain herself even though she had lists of her pills and a schedule in her hands. She was in tears because she knows something's wrong. She's doing well at keeping lists and documenting what she's done,  and keeping her calendar up to date, but it's getting harder for her.

Her speech seems to have slowed down in recent weeks.

She admits to feeling slow and muddled and gets upset so I try not to push her about it. She thinks one of her medications is to blame and wants to stop taking it, but this started before she started those pills. Certainly it's much worse now, but she's only been on those pills for a month or so. 

Can it really happen that fast? I've started insisting I'm present for her doctor's appointments, which she's happy about because she can't remember what the doc says, but I'm worried about upsetting her by asking the doctor about it in case I'm wrong. It seems too sudden, but I don't think it's the pills - they may be making it worse, but I don't think they're the cause."
"My cousin was left with the care of his 90 something grandmother and I sit with her occasionally when he had to go out.  I’m with her now and my cousin apologized because it’s very obvious that she needs her brief changed, but wouldn’t do it before I came. She fights him on it every time. I told him I’d try, but she insists, defiantly, that she just changed it. I don’t know what to do."
"My father is in his fifties and complains about severe memory loss which has manifested in the last year. Sometimes he can’t even read a sentence and remember it. He has a vast amount of interests though and when he acquires new information in any of these fields, he doesn’t seem to have any problems at all. Do dementia/Alzheimer‘s patients portray this as well? Especially given the big discrepancy in memory retention depending on whether he‘s interested or not, it seems more likely to be a symptom of his depression (and therefore reversible), which has gotten more severe over the last year."
"Hello all. I’ve been looking at this thread for a long time for comfort purposes. My father in law has vascular dementia, he’s 64. My husband has been unwilling to get guardianship and make him go to assisted living up until last night for some reason. FIL has been living in his house, his wife passed from cancer about a year ago which was very stressful and I’m sure caused some acceleration that’s evident. He’s only recently been diagnosed with dementia, but I’ve been thinking it for a long time. My husband, SIL, and BIL needed more convincing so I’m glad we got the diagnosis. Anyways, he is so depressed and miserable. He has not showered for months (last time he showered he was forced to because he was in the hospital). He doesn’t trust himself to cook anymore. He can’t hold many conversations, but rather repeats the same conversations over and over. He latched onto topics like, he’s going to be homeless. Or, he’s going to run out of money, or his daughter will be homeless. He can’t shower because the water is too expensive. There’s no food in the house even though there is always food. All of these statements are not true. He won’t allow home nurses to come into the house, so assisted living it is. We found a really really nice place. But I know we will have to threaten police…. It will definitely be a kicking and screaming ordeal. And, he is miserable as it is. He experiences no joy or happiness day to day. And I think he will be miserable there as well. Does anyone have transition tips or tips for dementia with depression?"
"My mother in law passed away this afternoon. I did what I could to help her be comfortable. She had the luxury to die at home, surrounded by her family.  She could see everyone that loved her one last time. 
May you Rest In Peace Bea, I will miss you."
"My grandmother passed away lastnight. I'm still trying to process it. It's almost not real yet. I was with her in the end. It was quick. I thought we had more time. But I guess you never truly know. 
My heart is so heavy. I miss her so much already. 
I know I will be ok but the pain is just  so raw. So fresh.

 I'd do it all over again though. Eventhough watching her decline was hard, watching her go was gut wrenching. I wouldn't have had it any other way. 

There's so much I could say right now. Such a wide range of emotions. I just can't find the right words. 
 
She meant the world to me. She was more than just a grandmother. She raised me. She was my only parent. I am crushed. 

 But She is finally at peace. No longer confined to a bed (over a decade) no longer in pain, confused, scared.  

Thank you to everyone on here who has given me advice and kind words. It has meant the world."
"Mother with Parkinson’s dementia now cannot figure out how to get dressed (puts two pants on or a shirt as pants). Now suddenly experiencing incontinence. I’ve urged my dad to move her into memory care where more structure , help , safety and to protect his own stress levels. Is incontinence a sign that the end is near ? She struggles to find words - stutters - difficulty communicating - but memory is intact. Knows who we are. Remembers events recent and a long time ago. Has certain hallucinations she holds on to as real (like she will repeatedly tell me there are kids in the house or my dad has a girlfriend , there’s NO convincing her otherwise or she will get angry so now I change the subject ). She is blissfully unaware of her condition thankfully ."
Try putting a couple of drops of Mio in their water before giving it to them. Its very effective in getting them to drink more
"My mom has dementia and wanders a LOT. She recently had a bad fall that unfortunately progressed her dementia and we no longer can leave her unattended while she moves around during the day. Her wandering has increased greatly and now she walks around ALL day. I am not exaggerating, after breakfast she takes off and shes around the whole day until bedtime (and even sometimes during the night). Because we don't leave her unattended, means that one of the family has to also walk for hours and hours every day. She will not sit even if we ask her to/physically get her to sit. She is not convinced to sit even with the TV on or even food.
We've tried anxiety meds, as the dr. recommended, but its done nothing.
Does anyone have other suggestions? Her AND the family are very very tired, I'm worried someone will get hurt down the line."
"There have been SO many gift threads here and I've gone through as many as I can, but not found anything appropriate. I was hoping someone here would have some bright ideas!

My dad (who lives with my mum) has advanced dementia but is cantankerous, grumpy, and has no interests. Before he got dementia, his hobbies were cooking and drinking, and all the gifts I got him were related to those two things. However I'm trying not to get him alcohol as he already has 2-3 beers a day (he's an alcoholic so drinking less than that is out of the question for him). Music is unfortunately a trigger for his drinking, so my parents try to avoid it as much as possible. He can no longer cook at all but forgets and gets incredibly grumpy when my mum won't let him, so anything cooking-related is likely to wind him up. He spends his days watching the news and sitting on the sofa snoozing, not doing anything, really. They do like to go out sometimes for a walk along the beachfront or to a cafe.

I've got him previous gifts of the obvious things - clocks, photobooks, etc. He would be extremely offended by things he perceives as babyish like fidget items. He already has warm, comfy clothes galore. He has no interest in activity books or anything like that (we've tried). I spend as much with him as I can already.

I'm honestly at my wits end with knowing what to get him. Does anyone have any suggestions?"
"Since October 2020 I’ve been trying to convince my dad, who is 85 years old now, to put my beloved mum in a specialist care home for respite care, to give him a much needed break. Recently he agreed because he’s physically & emotionally exhausted, we help daily but are not caring 24/7 like he is.

We researched local dementia homes & found one recommended just for ladies with dementia & only 10 residents at a time. We took my mum to be assessed & we’re very impressed all round. Last Thursday she went in for a 2 week stay, my parents have been married 63 years & it’s the first time my dad has been without her at home, he has been lost.

Today (3 nights later), we’ve been informed they want her out because she’s been awake each night wandering & the ONE care worker on duty cannot cope as 3 other residents also wake each night! 

My mums in a strange environment unknown to her, the home specialises in dementia! It takes a while for dementia sufferers to settle & this home are chucking her out!

To me the problem here is a staffing issue, bad management in a safe number of staff to resident ratio is lacking! 
What would happen if the one staff member became incapacitated during their shift? 
Who would look after the residents who all have dementia? 
Am I being unreasonable because I’m pissed off?"
"My grandmother and I rewatched Forrest Gump recently, and it completely delighted her. Any other good movie or even TV recommendations? Period pieces are welcome! All of the recommendations I’ve found on Google are “I Love Lucy” and other old shows. Looking for something a *little* more modern that she can follow and also not be bummed out by. Thanks so much!"
"I’m worried about my memory since I have really short memory, I do remember things from a while back but for example I don’t remember what I did just few days ago. My grandma had dementia, and doctors told my dad to be worried and try preventing it. At the moment I’m just 25 but I already have really bad short term memory . I think to do something and 1min, sometimes 20sec later I forget about it. Then remember it after 5 mins or so. Sometimes I go to take a teaspoon but I take spoon instead. I constantly forget where is my phone.If there’s something important to do in few days I have to write it down.Just wondering if there can be any tests or exams done as it makes me anxious constantly."
Sending out love and positivity to everyone here battling though this disease. My dad was admitted to the hospital early yesterday morning. He has severe COPD and fought off lung cancer a little over 2 years ago. They said he has a pretty bad lung infection and the cat scan has shown a mass in his left lung. I haven't told my mom about the mass yet. I feel it's better to wait until he is back home. The last time he was admitted to the hospital (September last year) is when my mom's dementia symptoms showed up. We are so afraid she is going to decline while he is gone this time. So far so good for now. It is beyond rough trying to juggle everything that needs done around here. No time at all to do a single thing for ourselves. Thankfully I have my husband to fall back on but we are wearing thin. We can't even sleep in our own room we have to stay in the living room so my mom isn't alone. We are hoping he gets released today so we can at least sleep in our room but at the same time we know he needs the medical attention.
"My mom’s dementia is destroying my dad. He’s had literal breakdowns where he’s had to be hospitalized. They had an unhealthy relationship pre-dementia (her being borderline abusive, him acquiescing to everything). With dementia every interaction seems to give him PTSD and she seeks him out all the time since she’ll have forgotten they just talked a minute ago.

We’re soon setting off on the road to put her in an assisted living facility. One big step there is that she’s move across the country with me, her son, since I’m really the only other person she has left for support (other children live in other places as well and couldn’t take on the caregiver role).

My mom likes the idea of living close, since she doesn’t really have anyone other than my dad where she is now, and she’ll get to see me and her grandchildren who she has a great fondness for. We haven’t discussed the assisted living setup yet but I’m hopeful she’d agree to it. My dad, on the other hand, has a rich life of family, friends, and work. Moving him I think would be a strong net negative for him. He also doesn’t really need care (although someone to bring him food would be nice).

Without my mom there we as a family discussed the situation, and concluded the ideal would be for her to come, my dad to stay. 

I’m just at a loss of how to approach that. I really fear that the idea of the separation would completely derail everything. While my dad was hospitalized my mom had moments of confusion where she said my dad was just abandoning her and was quite agitated. She readily accepts 3rd party care at home, thank god, but she has no concept of just how involved her care needs are. That’s probably part dementia and part her narcissism. so I’m not sure a frank discussion about their impacts to each other would land.

Anyway, ranted for a long time, curious what others have experiences in similar situations."
"Her neurologist changed her diagnosis from Lewy-Bodies to FTD, based on her symptoms, last year.

I think she is in stage six. Doesn’t know where she is, doesn’t recognize rooms she has been in for over 20 years. She is starting to not recognize me for a brief periods of time more frequently, but we can still hold a conversation. Her conspiracy theories and paranoia have been out of control for years. “There are  holes in the floor”, “I’m going to throw her out the window”. She’s constantly fighting with me over simple tasks, arguing, her way of doing things is better.

It is a constant struggle to manage her anger issues. She is taking numerous anti-psychotics. Before this last week, things have been relatively smooth for a few months. This last week I have been having to wrestle her to the bathroom and through her toilet routine. She’s screaming so loud through the entire process she’s losing her voice. Today I moved her around the house on a chair with wheels.

I am in good shape and strong, but she weighs 150 pounds.

Any advice on what I’m about to face and how manage it better, would be greatly appreciated."
"I hoped she would no longer be aware, by the time she started to have problems swallowing. This breaks my heart. They say we are in the final weeks or even days, but they've been saying that for several weeks already. I'm ready for her to be at peace.

UPDATE: The hospice CNA visited today for her bath. She was a Doctor in her home country. She estimates about 72 hours."
"Today's discovery while looking after my 89 yr old mother ...   ""women love a double bed, especially if they don't get to use one while they're alive""

.. thanks mum for the heads up  🤣"
She’s had dementia for years now (13+) and I’m just over it. She just called me that she’s leaving her care home again. It wouldn’t matter where she was placed it wouldn’t be good enough for her. She was horrible before dementia and she’s more horrible with dementia. Her name is Donna and growing up she had the nickname Prima Donna - that gives you a hint as to her personality. I’m so done with her yet I’m the only family left. The disease sucks but it’s especially hard when the person sucks too.
"Idk if this is the right place to post this, but I’m done. I am a grand daughter who has been constantly abused, accused and not appreciated for almost 9 months caring for my gma. And I’m not sure if she is experiencing dementia but she has hallucinations, extreme anxiety, EXTREME, memory issues and paranoia plus more and I just can’t. Not to mention she also is a narcissist on top of that so that’s been fun. I have tried to be patient, kind, understanding and accepting. It just makes me think back to this post I saw where this person was shaming family who left their elderly relatives behind and wouldn’t come see them anymore. Some people are pure rotten, even in old age. I know my grandma could hide it well when she wanted. Refuses to go to doc appts she previously agreed to, accused me of anything even if it doesn’t make sense. Accuses me of not telling her information I have repeated many times. Refuses to accept any responsibility if she is ever wrong. Starts arguments on purpose when she is in a bad mood to release her own stress. Gaslights me. And more. And I’m done, I have had it. I have gotten NOTHING in return for helping her and even tried to save her from family who were doing shady acts and/or trying to kill her off! All I’m saying is that It may be important to look at both sides of an issue before accusing family of neglect. Maybe they tried everything. Maybe that “nice old lady” you know was incredibly abusive in her youth and continues to be now. She has done it to almost every member who was actually being helpful but refuses to yell at those who openly tricked her or don’t try to help. Sorry for the rant but I just had a breakdown."
"My husband has dementia, diagnosed a few years ago.  He is at that memory loss stage where conversations are hard to have yet for some reason I keep trying to engage him.  Been married 48 years now and I just want to be able to talk with him about ordinary things.  Most of the time he doesn't understand what I am talking about or he kind of does but is unable to respond.  He tries but generally forgets what he wants to say as soon as he opens his mouth to speak. Or he has something to say but the words out of his mouth make no sense at all.  We now can go for a long time without speaking to each other, silence isn't a bad thing, but it is a reminder I don't have him to share things with anymore.  So hard sometimes to witness his decline, I do try to take it one day at a time, but I know the future will be grim. Feeling sorry for myself this morning."
"I feel like running away and never coming back. As you have seen by my other posts my dad was diagnosed with Dementia..my mom has not processed the diagnosis years later and believes my dad does not have dimentia. She gets angry if my dad does not listen to her, falls or hurts himself..i know he cannot help himself but my mom thinks he can. She complains about everything she even complains that my dad does not say thank you anymore when she does things for him...she fights about things with him that happend in the past how he worked himself into this state how he smoked himself into this state..she gets into a full rage mode when he falls or wets himself...i dont know what to do anymore.."
"Today I (21F) received a very odd call from my father (68M). We live in different cities and don't speak too often, but we're not on bad terms so to say.

He calls and says ""Auguri"" which in Italian is used for both birthdays and other celebrations. My birthday is on the 20th of April, and I know he knows this, so I was confused and asked..auguri for what? He sounds convinced when he says it's for my birthday. At this point I'm weirded out so I said it's not my birthday today dad, which prompts him to ask me what day it is today. I answer it's the 5th of March and he goes oh it was yesterday wasn't it? I tell him no and remind him my birthday is on the 20th of April, but he seems confused by that answer, though he brushed it off and ended the call.  


Now this isn't the first time in recent months, or perhaps even a couple of years, that I've noticed he seems to be a bit.. off. As said I don't interact often with him but last time he would ask me the same questions repeatedly, things about my job I'd answered a thousand times, but to be honest I attributed it more to lack on interest on his side than age starting to get to him.   


This birthday thing though was very odd. He knows my birthday is on the 20th of April, it's a date easy to remember, he calls every year or sends me a message, after 21 years of not mistaking it how would you confuse it with the 5th of March? It's not even another family member's birthday, and I don't have siblings or anything. This left me thinking because his mother (my grandma), whom we lived with for a couple of years before she passed away suffered from a mild form of dementia and she would also be very confused throughout the day or not really recognize us sometimes. 

Do you think this whole thing could be a red flag? He lives alone in another town, doesn't really have any other family, and my mom wants nothing to do with him (for good reasons). I don't know if I should worry or not."
"It has been almost 10 years since the first diagnosis. My mom has been so strong for so long and found my dad the best treatment, I don’t know how she did it. He was the best dad and a great husband. Even until the end he was so happy and would belly laugh if you talked to him in a British accent. 

Tonight he has moved on. The whole family came up to be with him earlier today. He had developed pneumonia and an infection in his lungs. He wasn’t conscious but we talked to him anyways. We told him that he was loved and some of our favorite memories together. We didn’t know he would be gone so soon but turns out it was the perfect closure for us. 

It was peaceful. His breathing changed. My mom held his hand and said he could rest, he didn’t have to fight anymore and he could let go. One breath, two, then he was gone. 

I love my dad. My little boy will never really know how wonderful a man he was, but we will be sure to pass on his love. Love you dad. Rest well."
"My dad is 76 years old. He worked a very involved job until 2 years ago. His hours were reduced but then cut. He lives with my mother 3 hours from me. Once the work slowed down, all of his behavior started to rapidly deteriorate. Little things at first, showing us the same photos, telling the same stories. My mom doesn't drive and during COVID relied on him going to the store for essentials. He used this as an escape. My mother isn't easy to deal with, she does nag and harp on things and I think at first we felt sympathy for him as this was the first time in 40 years he didn't have an escape. But then it started. First it was online ""get rich quick"" click bait and compromising their accounts. Then it was believing ever spam email or junk mail as a collection. My mom tried to explain its not real, he would go behind her back. She hid their credit cards after having a few cards and bank accounts compromised.  I bought him a wood burning kit to try keeping him busy. He tried to make it a business. Now he is not wanting to pay taxes on it so he's just giving it all away despite the cost they are putting in for materials. He does a lot in secret. He also is in a purge phase. If he feels they don't use it, he either gives it away or throws it away. He's been taking items out of the church boxes with non perishable goods (the boxes like the book boxes in front of churches) to neighbors as gifts but telling them ""its from the poor people box"". The neighbors are starting to think hes the weird old neighbor.  My mother is having a hard time trying to keep him in line. He side swiped someone and claimed they hit him and it was a hit and run. I am trying to get resources for her. My brothers are local to them but one has gone no contact from all the craziness and his own mental health issues and my other brother is about to go through a divorce.

Does this sound familiar to anyone? My mom is almost feeling like she is being gaslit. He has always had a photographic memory and testing with the MD is confirming a decline but he remembers all the images or phrases in testing for mental decline."
"Hello! I'm new here but a brief back history; I have been a caregiver for one family member or another since 2010 when my stepdad had the wrong kidney removed at an incompetent hospital, which led to kidney stones in his good kidney, which led to gall stones, which led to gall bladder then bladder cancer which progressed to bone then brain cancer. I changed his colostomy bags, took him to the doctor, stayed at the hospital with him while my stepmother getting my six year old (at the time) sister to get new hump buddy's house and stressed dating this guy while my dad was still alive in the hospital! I hate her needless to say. My stepdad pissed 11/25/2011.

Fast forward to 2012 and I get a new job in Chicago, where my little brother lives, and a couple of weeks into living in Chicago I meet my now husband. Eventually I move in with him, which is difficult because he lives in the family home to help care for his stepfather, who has lost his left leg. Fast forward to 2014 and stepfather starts showing signs of dementia, but not just any kind. Lewy Bodies. He hallucinates all the time. Snakes in his room, angels in the trees, people hiding in my note mother-in-law's room. We had to hide the knives even. Eventually he just deteriorates and hospice has to come in and he passed 5/27/2015.

In 2016, my husband and I officially marry, but this is the year his mother-in-law starts showing signs of dementia as well. She has frontal lobe dementia and she is quite the chore for us. She can't remember anything more than five minutes. She can't control her urine or bowel movements. She's a fall risk who refused to use her walker unless we yell at her. She doesn't do anything ask day long. She'll nap and watch TV. I can't get her interested in anything else. She used to play her tablet. Not anymore. She treats me like a maid and calls me by the wrong name over half the time. I love her very much. I lost my parents when I was young and I had a great relationship with my mother-in-law. She was a best friend. Now she's like a shell of that lady. 

Sorry for the book, I am writer. Thanks for reading. Just wanted to let you know what you are in for!"
"Just remembered an incident that happened nearly 40 years ago that still makes me laugh - not to mention proud... This took place during the mid-80s, when my Granda was well on the way to full-blown dementia. Must have been Christmas, bc there were other (no longer local) family members at his house this particular night, and we were watching what I think must have been Minder on The Orient Express (a British comedy drama about low-level criminals).

The first laugh happened when a scene started with the train coming towards you, 'out of the screen'. My Granda shouted 'whoa!' or something and moved his cup of tea that was on the floor in front of him out of the way. I mean, it could happen to any of us, right? And a similar shot caused panic at the birth of cinema, IIRC, so nothing to be ashamed of.

But the big one came a few minutes later. The lead character/hero Terry was walking down a narrow corridor on the train when some giant goon starts walking towards him from the opposite direction. Terry stops, turns round and starts to walk back but his path is blocked by another giant goon, and the pair of them start to close in on him menacingly. All of a sudden my Granda leaps up (he'd pretty much stopped walking several months earlier so this was no mean feat), grabs the poker from the hearth and starts heading for the TV with it raised above his head. It took three of us to get the poker off him and get him sat back down...

I mean, yes, it's incredibly sad, and slightly scary to the young teen I was, but damn, I have never been more proud of the old fella than I was at that moment...

And with that, time for bed. All the best..."
"My lovely partner of nearly 25 years has been treated under an ever-changing kaleidoscope of mental health diagnoses (and drugs to match) for years. I've been asking for a dementia screening for about 3 years (been seeing stuff 10 years), and was brushed off repeatedly.

Finally it got obvious enough that a recent crisis hospitalization and a fresh set of eyes burped out a referral to a neurologist. Consult, MRI, and results from MRI in doctor-ese, to be discussed at a followup visit. (I'm grateful they posted results so quickly, didn't make us wait a month for the followup, though only the headline is intelligible to me.)

On the one hand, devastating news. On the other, was pretty sure what results would be. One hell is behind us; a fresh hell has opened its maw before us. At least now the beast has stepped out of the shrubbery and shadows, and we know what **won't** work so we can stop wasting our time. 

Thanks for listening. I've been hanging out on this sub in anticipation for a few months, and y'all are helping me stay calm and carry on."
"My mother (79) has vascular dementia. While she can hold a conversation; she can’t bath herself; and she can’t find the bathroom in her own house (among other things). So she is middle/advanced. She actually has an incredible memory for things 30+ years ago… just can’t remember what happens 10 seconds ago. Anyway…. My father (81) is her main caregiver along with a lot of help from my sister and I. She also has a nurses aid 3 times a week for 4 hours each time. However, it is just becoming too much for my father. His health is declining rapidly. We found an incredible assisted living/memory facility that we thought would be a great solution. They would have their own 1 bedroom “apartment” and have some cool and clean for them. (I wanted to move in!) we took my mother there today for a tour. She looked like she was a having a good time; talking with the residents ; commented on how nice it is. Then when we walked out; she was like “this is a nursing home, no way I am going to live here!!!” It was heartbreaking to hear; but to be brutally honest, I did not expect her to walk out saying she loved the place. (Maybe Hope… but didn’t expect it). My father is excited about the place (they would BOTH be living there). I honestly want to this more for my fathers sake…. He can’t do this anymore. I know my mom is not of sound mind… and I fear we will be taking here there “kicking and screaming”. 

After typing all this.. I am not even sure I am looking for advice… as much as a place to vent. This is really tough …."
"My dad is an alcoholic. He quit cold turkey a week before intake. A week later he had a seizure. Once admitted, it was discovered that he had a kidney infection. However, I discussed his previous alcoholic habits and abstinence periods. I expressed my opinion about korakoff syndrome. It's something that was discussed amongst my father's doctors and me. 

He legitimately does have confusion. But... When he's been on Ativan he's unpredictable. It's like he regressed by days. He only took a downturn after the treatment for alcohol withdrawals.

I have talked to his medical care teams: doctors, residents, nurses, specialists, hospitalists (I have some fucking beef with hospitalist!!! I know you're not all the same, but WTF are you learning to be such an uncaring sect of the field??), etc. 

We discussed stopping his Ativan treatment a week ago. He made great steps towards recovery. Lucid, could carry on conversations, remembering tons of things (I've been trying to keep his mind ""active"") cooperating, etc. 70% of normal. Including playing tricks on me.

No body agrees about his situation. They're all cagey about recovery (I get it, you cannot even hint at a promise of results). I (maybe irrationally) see improvement towards his normal self. The reintroduction of Ativan has halted and reversed his progress after recovery. 

I'm most likely in denial. Give it to me straight with how I'm wrong and what my expectations should be? Everyone seems to think I'm wrong, but they don't know my dad and seem to be covering their own ass. I'd like to have opinions from those in a likely similar situation."
"My mom's in a good place, a sweet spot if you will, with her dementia. 

She's in assisted living, has friends, participates in classes and games, is ok with me managing her affairs, with only rare paranoia/suspicion cropping up. I know it won't be this good forever. 

She knows she has some level of impairment, blames it all on a concussion 3 years ago (even tho she has 2 types of dementia and the neurologist has told her otherwise). Every once in a while it becomes evident that she's not aware of how bad it will get, or that it's progressive, or maybe even that its actually dementia; she asks me if she will end up ""like one of those people"" referring to the memory care residents in her building. I try to gently explain (again) that it's progressive but we don't know how long. She then says ""oh"" and gets quiet. It's heartbreaking.

Are we at a point that I just stop explaining and be vague? Is there a point to ripping off the bandaid again and again? 

What did you do with your loved ones?

Thanks for any stories, encouragement, etc."
"Absolutely destroying me to write this. My dad aged 63 was diagnosed with dementia in 2015. After many struggles and no end of saying our goodbyes he passed on 26/12/2021. My heart broke, not just for me but for my daughter who is now 17. She lost one grandad in 2017 to cancer, then watched my dad deteriorate until he passed. Now she’s just lost her great grandma on her dads side to the same thing. It’s the cruellest thing to watch. She’s asked me to go to her great nannas funeral which I would have done of course, but it’s on my birthday. The first birthday without my dad and also my 40th. I don’t feel like I can. My first birthday without him can I really go to a funeral? Im torn, she’s lost so many people and I want to go support her, but mentally I’m not doing okay and I don’t think I can face it. I feel selfish for not wanting to go, but I know she has a lot of support from her dads side of the family. What do I do?"
" 

We just moved my Dad to assisted living this week , on Monday, and today is the first day i haven't cried about it so far. All of the hardships and emotions aside, I'm trying to find ways to make his life there easier. I did order one of those TV remotes that has 4 buttons on it to make it simpler, but I was wondering if anyone has any ideas for having full access of the TV remotely.

I read someone set up a raspberry pi and IR emitter or some other crazy setup, but I'm not really at the point of pursuing that if there's any other option. I'd like to be able to turn the TV on and off and access all TV menus (changing input) as well as opening youtube and bringing up videos for him remotely. Is there ANYthing even close to something like that in existence? He does not follow instructions very well so 'push the volume button' would be a struggle. Complicating things is the multiple remotes, so if i DO hook up a amazon fire stick, he's not going to know how to use the remote.

Just curious what strategies others might have had for helping a loved one remotely with a TV. He's definitely getting some more activities this week than he was at home, so it's not like i'm encouraging him to just sit in front of the TV for 12 hours, but if he wants to watch the news or a sporting event or some educational videos, I'd like to be able to make that happen for him"
To any U.K. people… big piss-taking culture in my family (like a lot of families I suppose). So much of it is misplaced since my dad’s diagnosis of mixed dementia. Uncle (mum’s brother - who has also just received dementia diagnosis) just made lighthearted comment about my dad getting a disabled badge for his car (that only my mother drives since his diagnosis - grey area with DVLA) and dad forgets or doesn’t believe his diagnosis so comments like this must feel like having his heart ripped out. Any experience with this?
"My family and I just started Grandma on Seroquel , she is  in moderate stage of dementia. Getting close to end of middle stage. She is having increased sleeping problems, anxiety and depression and also real bad paranoia and delusions. We had her back in at specialist and they recommend Seroquel. They kinda labeled it as a wonder drug for this. They said it could have her sleep. Mood. And the paranoia delusional side. 

I was wondering if anyone has had there loved one on it and how did they respond?. Any side effects? Any positive outcomes? Things to watch for ? Just your story would be appreciated. Anything to help in this trying time.

Thank you"
"I’ve posted and commented before about my mother with advanced dementia and the sad ride that’s been but this post isn’t about her. It’s my MIL.

My husband’s father passed last summer (95, COPD) rather suddenly. Fortunately DH (dear husband) was able to be there the last two weeks of his life. Unfortunately they live 1700 miles away and with covid we hadn’t visited for 2 years. We didn’t realize how much his dad had slowed down and things were in great disarray when DH arrived; unpaid bills, no home maintenance done, etc. 

So DH spent 3 months back there getting things in order for his stepmother. Fast forward to now, 7 months later and we are both visiting, following up on previous action items that she did nothing on and to do her taxes. Been here 3 days and it’s apparent she has pretty advanced dementia. I’d put her about 1-2 years behind my mother in progression.

I feel like I’ve been smacked in the head with a bag of bricks. And I’m not looking forward to the sh!t that’s sure to be coming, this is going to be even tougher because of the distance involved.

No way she will agree to move out west so we can better help her, she’s already too far gone to comprehend the impact her disease will have on us. 

She forgets everything, repeats things incessantly and has already been scammed out of $2000. I’m sure there is more of that to come. DH is already Medical POA, has access to all her accounts online and is co-owner of her bank account.

She’s 88 & has a brother in the area but he is older and not much help.

We’re going to the gym at her church tomorrow and I think I’ll slip off to ask what assistance they can offer. I’ll also give the local agency on aging a call.

This is so depressing. 

BTW, she’s in Louisville, KY if anybody knows of any good resources here."
"I’m a HCA on a Healthcare for Older People (geriatric ward) in a hospital in the UK. I’d say around 75% of our patients have dementia at any one time. Generally patients will stay for up to 2-3 weeks on average until they’re better, though currently around 1/3 of our patients have been with us for a couple of months - the wait for residential home placement is terrible.

A hospital isn’t an ideal environment for a dementia patient, this we all know. I want to help make our ward more dementia friendly, and I’m on the search for suggestions big or small.

We don’t have a day room - just male/female bays with bed spaces in . Did you find a day room, (somewhere less clinical with soft chairs and a TV etc) was helpful for your relative? I feel for our patients, they have nowhere to go but sit by their beds or pace in the corridors all day. I can’t help but feel it doesn’t help with the agitation they experience. I want to know if it’s something truly helpful as I’ll need to put the idea to our Matron and fundraise like crazy as the hospital have said they will not fund it.

Any other suggestions of things that helped during admission? A side note - I love this sub, it has been invaluable to see dementia from a relatives perspective. Love to you all x"
"Hey guys, I'm currently living with my grandma with dementia. I would say mid stage. 

Every night around 8 I tell her to go to bed, take her to her room, watch her get in bed. She usually sleeps until 11. Then she get up and goes to the bathroom. After that she always wanders around the house talking for 1-2 hours. Then I have to remind her to go back to bed. Sometimes she will sleep the rest of the night, but usually she gets up and wanders around again. Any advice to help her stay in bed?

A little more info if anyone has any other advice: She doesn't remember who I am and doesn't understand everything I say. She can walk, but has back pain so I don't really take her out. She also doesn't remember to eat.

She should probably be in a home or something but my dad won't allow that. For the time being I am with her. Thanks for any advice."
"My siblings and I are dealing with an alcoholic father who now has dementia due to him being an alcoholic his whole life. He still lives alone and one of us is going there daily to check on him. He is refusing to go to an assisted living community. He has been prescribed meds for his memory and is refusing them too. Afraid if we make him move to a facility like that, he is going to cause problems and be asked to leave. Looking for any advise where we go from here."
Has anyone dealt with a loved one who was just way to aggressive to the point where even if you put your LO in a home the chances of them getting kicked out are very high. Any experiences or stories are welcomed. My uncle has vascular dementia and is on many medications to calm him but still he gets too out of hand that a care facility might not work and currently I'm his only option to live with.
"The doc made lifestyle recommendations for my mom that include cardiovascular exercise & eating a balanced diet—two things my mom is not likely to do. Since retiring a decade ago, she spends all her time in her recliner watching junk tv and is always resistant to my suggestions for social activities, follow ups w doctors, etc. (She’s also a narcissist and I grew up being physically & emotionally abused by her). My life keeps being interrupted by having to care for her (she has a bad back and has needed several surgeries) and I am burnt out & resentful. I’m trying to gauge how fast this disease progresses; I’m eager to try and resume my own life before I yet again get yanked back into a caretaker role. Thanks in advance for any insight you can offer."
"Looking to see others experiences with issues swallowing. My grandma is stage 6 (maybe now moving into 7) and has aphasia (trouble speaking) and now we think she has progressed to dysphagia. 

A few weeks ago she seemed to aspirate on a french fry at dinner. Luckily she seemed to cough it out (did back blows) and a few days later my Mom took her to urgent care to get a chest x-ray. Grandma was still wheezing. It came back clear and was told she is just shallow breathing and try having her do deep breaths a few times a day. Yesterday I got a call from her Senior Center that she choked on a pea at lunch. It involved abdominal thrusts and back blows to have her clear it and stop coughing. Maybe 30 mins later her coughing had calmed and she could speak. 

I was just wondering how others handled it. I saw they can do a swallow test. If your LO had to change their food consistency was it a fight? We have a family of 6 (including her) and I'm not sure if she would eat if her meal appears different than what everyone has. We are on the search for a facility this year just because her care is mounting and I'm getting burned out. And this is a new decline I'm dreading."
"Hello :)  
My mother has been showing cognitive decline for about 5 years now.   They mostly manifest as short-term memory problems, loss of concentration.    However lately, she has been showing signs of deeper agitation.   She calls her sons up and says she want to divorce her husband, that he's not a warm man, etc.   This is her sweetheart of 40 years.   Her caregiver in many ways.   She also has moved out of their shared bedroom.    But when I'm over the house, she acts like nothing is wrong, often.  


The pandemic (and my divorce) has caused her circle to shrink.   She lost my ex-wife and my in-laws.  She has been with her husband in their small bubble.   He is going deaf and is vain about getting a hearing aid.   I've been imploring him to get one.   My mom is so intuitive and sensitive.   When she calls him cold and too focused (only in the last few weeks), i have to connect that with his lack of hearing / awareness.    


Anyway, I set up and appointment with her neurologist today.   The purpose is to get her into see a neuropsychiatrist and this is the first step.   Perhaps there is some medication that she can take to help her depression (i know the dangers of treating dementia patients for depression).  


The problem is, that we've been mostly shielding her from our thoughts about her 'delusions'.  She does know she has a bit of memory problems...but that's it.   She always resists the medications (namenda) and visits to any doctor that is connected to cognitive decline.   It's as if her pride and indignation are coming to the surface with this condition.  She thinks she's a 20 year old superstar. 

Do you guys think it makes any sense to bring up my concerns with her in the room?   Or does it makes sense just to observe her visits, and have a follow up call with the doctor.   I just know that if it was me who was the patient, I would want to have agency and awareness about it.   

Thanks!"
"Yep, I'm here again.

Firstly, I'm going to be very transparent and divulge that about 4-5 years ago I had basically a nervous breakdown. I won't get into the reasons, but I was on medical leave from work for a year and was being treated for severe anxiety and depression.  The depression is gone now, I still have anxiety.  Because of this, I am very protective of my mental health.

On to the vent.

I hired an Elder Care attorney to help sort out how to get all of our ducks in a row for when Mom will need more care than I can provide for her.  Facilities are expensive, as you know, and my parents have very little money, which means they will qualify for Medi-Cal; however, the attorney said that we should never tell a facility that she will on Medi-Cal because they often claim there are only 3-5 beds available for Medi-Cal patients. She said to say we're private pay and once she's placed then we apply for Medi-Cal and once she's approved the facility will reimburse anything we paid out of pocket.

I had to fill out an application to get my mom on a waitlist at one of the facilities nearby.  I handed it in and they told me that this will get her on their waitlist, but that the likelihood that she'll be rejected when we've decided it's time because they don't have enough money.

So how the f\*ck are we going to get her into a facility if they're going to decide she's too poor to get in? I can't tell them she'll have Medi-Cal, so now what? What kind of circle of hell is this?

I've emailed the attorney about this and a few other concerns and I haven't heard back from her in a week.

I. AM. FREAKED.OUT.

What if I can't get her placed?  She deserves proper care and I don't want to have another breakdown, and I WILL if I have to keep this up. I'm exhausted and stressed out.

Vent over. Thank you all."
"The other day my mom was super happy about something she was telling me and she smiled really big, like scary big and intense. It was actually alarming seeing her face like that. 

Does dementia change people's facial expressions to be more extreme? Have you experienced odd or scary expressions with your loved one? I felt so bad but I even had to look away, it was just so unnerving."
"Hi lovely people. My dad just has his pension and SSI and lives in my home for the past year.

He’s stage 5/6 and I can no longer care for him, he needs 24/7 watching and care. So time for assisted living and memory care.

If I tell the assisted care places I am looking at that we are private pay, his income is “XX” per month… and we won’t be asking for Medicare assistance, what documentation do they still require (if any)? 

I read online that they will ask for bank statements to “prove” he (or I) can pay privately and how long they might have to wait before trying to bill Medicare, is this accurate?

I don’t want them in my business and bank accounts. Dads bank account I can understand more, and it will show his modest income. But I will need to supplement his income with my earnings to make up the difference between the AL home $$ and his income, and I’ve made different life choices than he has and therefore my bank account looks different than his. I just don’t see why it’s anyone’s business if the check cashes for them every month, year, whatever. 

I have POA, am dads health proxy if that is relevant in any way. 

Thank you so much for guidance if you’ve been through this experience!"
"My grandpa is frequently leaving the house without key and mobile phone. Most of the time he won't go far away an will come back in about an hour (he is doing chores around the house).
My grandma gets worried sick if she can't find him, so we thought about buying a tracker to make sure he isn't too far away.

The problem ist, that he will throw everything away, which he can't identify or labels as useless. (this would include smart watches)
Maybe a small hidden tracker would do the trick but we do not quite know where we should put it that it will be with him everytime he goes out without him noticing.

Does someone have an idea or experience with that?"
"My wife's father was diagnosed with late stage dimensia and has type 1 diabetes. He is very aggressive, can't walk, and his blood sugar crashes constantly needing medical aid. My wife had a meeting with the hospital and they explained to her that they cannot keep him any longer and he does not qualify for nursing home or hospice. They said our only options is to take him home which isn't an option due to the severity of his illness or they can remove his monitors and let him live out his last days without intervention,essentially euthanizing him (in my opinion). Has anyone else been in a similar situation and if so. What did you do."
Im a home health aide and I have an old kindle fire I'm going to give to my patient any apps you would recommend? It's an old kindle so only things you can get from the Amazon app store. Thanks. I'm looking for a good dementia clock mainly. Also any tips I was hoping I can get Alexa to say things without asking like in the morning say good morning tell her the date and time and the weather. Something like that.
"I (23) have spent my last 4 years looking after my father (87) with dementia. Now, I feel like I have truly hit rock bottom. Internally, I know I can not give up as he needs me, but my brain is exhausted.

What keeps you going through the hard times?"
"I and my two adult daughters live in Colorado. In October my very independent, very private, father had a fall and was taken to the hospital. He had been living alone a long time in Indiana. He was found to be very confused and had been diagnosed with dementia of the unspecified sort a few years prior but I did not know that because he never told anyone. We used to talk on the phone quite a bit but I hadn't seen him in person in probably the past 2 years. He never really wanted company. We had a good relationship, just didn't see each other much. When I got to Indiana to the hospital where he was after his fall I realized he was going to need a lot of help. I retained an elder-care attorney firm and we did all the necessary Powers of Attorney. My dad understood the need for help and wanted me to help him. I did understand the enormity of what I signed up to do for him as his power of attorney for health care and his finances so I'm not complaining about that part. I'm grateful I could have time off from my job and grateful that my father trusted me to help him. When he was medically well from the hospital he was released to a rehab unit to regain stamina and steadiness and balance in walking. He went through that rehab process fairly well and was ready to be discharged after about 3 weeks. His home in Indiana had deteriorated quite a bit. He was a bit of a hoarder had been confused for a few years and the plumbing did not work. I knew his home was not the proper place for him and I knew I could not take care of him by myself. I know more now about Home Health Options but at the time I really felt I was not equipped to do even that with him in Indiana. My brother lives in Florida and does not travel. He had not had a good relationship with my father since our parents divorced when I was nine and my brother was six. This was painful to my father and he expressed several times he would like a better relationship with his son. I decided we should go to Florida and ""see what it's like to be retired"" while we visited him over the holidays. That was how I presented it to my father but in reality it was to see if a memory care unit in Florida could be a good thing for him. My reasoning was that my brother and my father would have a better chance for a stronger Bond before my father passes and that I would be able to work at my job in Colorado during the Summers as usual and then come to Florida in the winters. As I said my mother and father divorced when we were both very young so my mother who also lives in Florida (close to my brother) would not have been an appropriate person to have my father stay with LOL. I did ask if I could stay in her extra bedroom while we visited. My father would be in the memory care unit and I would be in her extra bedroom and we would all be able to visit during the holidays and things will be great! Well not really. We got to FL Dec 6th, 2021. Dad was okay in the memory care unit walking fine handling his own dementia okay kind of more confused but in pretty good health and we visited often. Really we visited every day just not all day long everyday. On January 4th my dad stood up too fast and fell at his memory care place. We found out that he was pretty dehydrated and that probably made him faint when he stood up like that. He was taken to a hospital to check his head since no one witnessed his fall and they wanted to make sure he wouldn't have any head trauma from the fall. In that hospital he stayed there four days because of the dehydration and was doing okay. On the day they were going to release him back to the memory care unit he tested positive for covid. Luckily he ended up not having severe symptoms because he was vaccinated but unluckily he was then in an isolation unit and they would not let him get up out of the bed because they thought he was a fall risk. He laid in the bed in that hospital for more than 10 days. As most people know the longer you are bedridden the more muscle mass and strength you lose. Also unbeknownst to me he was developing bed sores. He got them on the backs of his heels, on his sacrum, one on each buttock, and was developing one on his testicles as well. The hospital told me repeatedly that there was no problem and that he had no bed sores from being immobile with no one moving him or repositioning him because he was in isolation. I asked them every few days.. When he was finally cleared to leave that hospital he was released to a rehab unit to try to get his strength back. That particular rehab unit alerted me that he had these bedsores when he got to them and that the one on his sacrum was severe . However they also overly medicated him with Seroquel, did not move him, did not keep him hydrated or fed either. My brother and I visited him every day but of course we weren't there all day long everyday and it never occurred to me that he might be further and further dehydrating and not getting food. On his third day there he had to go to the hospital by ambulance because of going into hypovolemic shock due to low blood volume which is directly caused by severe dehydration. He almost died. He was septic. He was in the ICU two days and then spent about two more weeks in that second Hospital before he was medically stable enough to be released to the rehab facility he is in now. They have him on a special bed and his sores are slowly healing thank God. He is able to eat and some days able to feed himself if his hands are not shaking too badly. He has been able to stay hydrated as well. I go everyday in the mornings until around 2 in the afternoon. My brother comes by around 2:30 or 3 but has to go back to work after about an hour. Sometimes but not always I go back in the later afternoon or possibly early evening it depends on how much I can take emotionally. Most of the time I think I did the right thing bringing him down here because if that memory care place had worked I think it would have been good. He was only there a little less than a month before this fall and ever since then things have been so hard for him. He was walking fine 2 months ago. Never needed a walker or a cane and didn't even touch the walls as he walk down the hallways. Now he just lies in the bed and even though there is Rehabilitation, he won't be able to stand until the wounds on his heels heal. I find myself feeling so guilty about bringing him here instead of being brave and keeping him at his home in Indiana. Now the way things are I can't even take him there because he can't sit up more than a couple of hours at a time because of the sores on his fanny. I feel like I have done a bad job for my dad who trust me literally with his life. He does remember who I am most of the time but a lot of his other conversations are very confused and anxious. He still tells me thank you when I help him get his water or feed him or wipe his mouth or hold his hand and he still tells me he loves me. I love him with all my heart he's the sweetest funniest man I've ever known. I really thought I could do better for him than what I have turned out to be able to do. Sometimes I don't know where the future is taking us and I don't want to be the reason that his quality of life has disappeared. I prayed so hard cuz he was in the ICU. I have the faith that Saint Anthony worked miracles with God to save my dad. I feel guilty because I don't know if he is glad to still be with us or not. I know it was selfish of me to ask God to save him or to ask Saint Anthony for the Miracles. I'm down second-guessing myself all the time I don't usually do that. Most of the time I can handle it but tonight I feel so confused and worried and lost. All I wanted to do was help him and I feel like I haven't done that even though I know it's not really my fault. I'm sorry for posting such a long pity party story but I know if anyone understands these complicated things it would be you guys."
"Here's a bittersweet little story for you. Take it as you will. I'm still trying to figure out what to make of it.

My dad died February 12 after a 5 year fight with Lewy Body dementia. The grief is complicated - the heaviness of sadness mixed with a lightness at the thought that he's finally free of the hell Lewy put him through.

A few days after he died, my mom came to me, held out her hand, and said, ""Look what I found."" She was wearing her old wedding and engagement rings.

The thing is, she'd lost those about a year ago. She'd taken them to the jeweler's for a cleaning, but made the mistake of putting them into a pants pocket instead of, say, her purse. When she got out of the car at home, she couldn't find them. She dug through her pockets, combed the street, house, yard, shook the pants out, and I and a few other people did all that with her. Nothing. Her rings, it seemed, were gone. It hit her hard, naturally. Her husband of 50+ years was slowly dying, and now she didn't even have the rings he gave her.

While nothing could replace their sentimental value, they were at least insured, so after a few months she started the process of getting replacements made based on the old designs.

My dad died on a Saturday. Then, the next Wednesday, my mom happened to shake out that same pair of pants and then...<plink> <plink> Out fall her lost rings.

Now, I'm an atheist, a scientist, and the person who, at age 5, tried earnestly to prove to my parents that Santa didn't exist. (It made no sense. How could he visit so many places in one night, deer couldn't fly, and by the way, we didn't even HAVE a chimney.) So I'm the last person to get superstitious or talk about ""signs from beyond"".

But half a dozen people looked in those pockets, over and over, and all could have sworn they weren't there, and I'll be damned if that wasn't a last gift from my dad to my mom - a little nudge from beyond to help her find the rings he gave her over 50 years ago, and that she thought were lost forever.

It's a pleasant thought, anyway. Just thought I'd share."
"I really messed up. 

I've been taking care of my mom the last 4 years.  She has dementia. 

Unfortunately, I forgot to get the car inspected, and the registration has been expired for almost a year.  I got two tickets today on my way to pay the house taxes.  

This is completely my fault.  For the record, the cop who ticketed me was very civil.  Even patiently waited while I pulled up my insurance card on my phone.  He was just doing his job. 

First thing tomorrow I will get the car inspected.  Then I have to handle the registration.  From what I understand I can handle the tickets online three days from now.  If possible I will ask for a reduction as I'm guessing they will be upwards of $100.

A squirrel or raccoon or something is in the attic, since yesterday.  The kitchen sink faucet is leaking and the valves are stuck.  It feels like everything is going wrong.  My mom said ""I love you baby"" the other day, first time in many months.  That one good thing happened and everything else seems to be falling apart. "
"Has any caregiver tried treating a dementia patient with Namenda? My wife, aged 74, is somewhere between stages 5 and 6 of Alzheimer’s. How effective is Namenda likely to be in her case? I’m skeptical about the benefits claimed for the drug, but it would be useful to hear what others have to say."
"I could tell it was starting to happen to my mom about 5 years ago - she started asking what's for dinner several times a day, then ""where are my black shoes"" when she never has had any. Then my dad passed away a year ago and she moved in with my sister after I had been taking care of her for many years at home. When I visit she can't remember if her husband is gone half the time.  When she asks where he is I dont know weather to say he's dead or he's just napping. It's getting worse as time goes on and I'm afraid she'll end up in a home somewhere if my sister can't handle it anymore."
"My mom is 75. Yesterday my son was speaking to her on the phone. He mentioned that he wasn't feeling well and had not gone to school. Three times during the conversation she asked questions about what happened at school. He kept saying, Grandma... I didn't go to school today. My mom is always been very sharp, and I have never seen this type of behavior in her before. Can things like this just happen occasionally without it being a sign of dementia? I suppose it could just be that she wasn't paying attention to the conversation. Is this something I should question her about it or just let it go for now? I don't want to worry her but I am worried! Thanks."
"I am a married 37f who will most likely be taking in my dad until he can get placement for assisted living or long term care as him living alone isn't helping him to thrive. He doesn't eat enough or drink enough water when left alone. He also sleeps too much and drinks too much coffee during the day. I know this will be a life altering choice and that my life will need to change to accommodate him but I work from home, have no kids and live life pretty much routinely so I think this is a better option.
Anybody have any advice? tips?"
"TLDR: My parents live across the country. I don’t know how to assess whether keeping things that way is sustainable. 

In the last 6mo my mom has had rapid onset of dementia, and needs full time care. My dad tried to be the caregiver, which lead to a deep depression.  I come to stay for a few weeks, established 24h care at home. I know we’re lucky we can do that. It goes relatively smoothly - my mom is not the easiest person so there’s always the occasional period where she’s upset, and at times we have to indulge bad habits like eating less than healthy food to keep the peace. But she’s generally accepting of care. I am managing all the scheduling and payments for care. My hope was to take the worry away from my dad so he could return to a normal life. He sleeps in a different room now. He has a local support network (family, friends) while my mom not so much.

I flew back thinking we’d gotten to a good new structure. A few weeks later my dad had a nervous breakdown. He was having trouble concentrating at his job, at home he was depressed, not seeing friends, etc… Even with care the whole situation is sad/stressful and the house can feel oppressive. He left the house and is in intensive therapy while staying away from the house. I had to fly back and coordinate that as well. A few weeks into the process and he doesn’t seem that much better. We’re not sure exactly when he should return home. I’m worried we’ll reintroduce him, and he’ll fall apart again.

But I can’t stay here forever and can’t keep flying back every few weeks on a new crisis. 

It would be very distributive for them and myself but one option is to move my mom across the country to live with me and my family and find local care here. I just don’t know how to think through that option. Having a working system where they live now would be a lot better for them I think. I’m not sure what’s the tipping point to make us execute on such a drastic change.

Have others here had similar experience or just generally have advice?"
"Hello, I am from the Philippines. I just wanted to ask help/vent regarding my 88 year old grandma who is now in the onslaught of dementia. 

I actually struggle a lot with her presence in our house. She smokes a lot, and this is all she thinks about every day. My father, mom and sister have weak lungs and this has been a struggle daily. My grandma insists on going out for hours on end, and she gets lost that we have to find her. I could not believe that this is the same grandma that read me bedtime stories and cooked delicious food. Now, I am seeing unpleasant parts from her. She becomes selfish, bitter, and thinks people owe their success to her. She brings back garbage from other people's houses. She backstabs her sister..she has a nasty tongue. Since she already forgets how she manages her money and when it's gone (from buying cigarettes), she blames.my mother. She also has a big sense of entitlement. This was shocking to me. She expects to be always prioritized and her wishes granted, from food to everything. 

We are currently in a tight financial spot and cannot afford any nursing homes at the moment. Nursing care here is EXPENSIVE. Nursing homes for elders is also not a prevalent idea here in the Philippines where caring for elders is deeply embedded in our culture. She cannot also stay with her other children because the condition of their houses is not fit for taking care of someone with dementia. 

:( How do you deal with this? My family, esp my mom, struggles a lot. Every day we have stress from just dealing with her."
"I see my 93 year old grandma once or twice a week to spend time with her. She is still with it enough to know her brain isn’t doing well (forgetting important dates when she used to be a walking calendar, difficulty remembering words and conversations, inability to remember who is who and who has visited her). She’s stressed about this, independently verbalizes her brain isn’t good and gets upset over this. I don’t know how to approach this topic with her. For what it’s worth she’s in independent living with a live in helper."
Hello so recently I’ve been going to the grocery store with my dad a lot and he’s always telling me that he thought he saw someone we know for example he would say “ I thought I saw Jim’s daughter” other times he would say “I thought I saw Jim’s wife” and even when I didn’t go to the grocery store with him he would always think he saw someone he knows. He also Forgets a lot of things like he would say who put this here and I would have to tell him That he did. Maybe I’m over exaggerating please let me know what you all think
"We're in the process of moving closer to my (50F) father (75) and in the process of buying a house in their neighborhood, so talking a great deal about houses and so forth. My husband is staying with my parents while he works and goes house hunting with them. I'm across the US and packing up here, so dealing with things has been rather epically insane. 

Unfortunately, we're starting to notice some bizarre behaviors in my father - he's using racist language he's NEVER used in his life (note: our daughter is mixed race), including dropping the N word, (""I don't mind living in a neighborhood with Ns"") asking the same question dozens of times over the course of days (""how much are you paying your realtor?"" note: my cousin, his niece) and today we had a conference call where he was CONFUSED for an hour and a half over simple things like WHY we had to put 10% down for a mortgage, how long a term of a mortgage we were getting, and making dozens of demands about our financial future that have NOTHING to do with him and aren't his business (""I'm just concerned about cash flow!"") They literally wrote everything down for him about the buying of the house there, selling of the house here and he STILL kept asking the same questions in this phone call! And he got angry about it. I recommended we all step away from the call, as 3 of us understood the situation and he needed time to review things. And yup, I made him even angrier with that.

Folks, this is our 4th house. He's NEVER shown any interest in our finances. Two weeks ago he asked if I was married (yup, 17 years to my veteran husband). He was also confused as to my legal name (I never changed my name when I married, so my legal name is HIS last name). 

He's always been stubborn and self-centered, but somehow this has become much worse lately. Honestly, I've likely just been blaming this sort of thing on his personality until now. But I'm not thinking that anymore! 

I don't even KNOW how to deal with him, much less have a conversation with my mother (75). Part of us moving there is to help them as they age, so this is rather startling to say the least."
"My mom says sometimes she will wake up in the middle of the night and feel absolute rage and says she wants to punch a pillow or throw something. This also happens randomly throughout the day and seems to be becoming more frequent. Is this a symptom of dementia? I ask because she keeps saying she's being over medicated, I'm not sure if the medication could be causing it or if it's normal for a dementia patient."
"I was wondering if anyone had any creative ideas on how to bond with someone with dementia? I’m 21 and my grandma is 91 and she’s been developing dementia during covid. During this time I was going through a deep depression and in turn didn’t spend much time with much family, which I now deeply regret. My grandma doesn’t really want to leave the house so I’ve been trying to think of some interesting activities I could do with her indoors. So far I’ve ordered some puzzles (big piece 500 count ones), and some note cards. As I’ve been regaining my will to live and trying to get my shit together I realized there are a lot of life milestones I’ll reach that someday i won’t be able to share with my grandma. She used to sew, which inspired me to pursue fashion design, so I wanted to get her creative again as a thank you. On one side of the blank notecards asking her to draw a flower, then asking her to on the other side write down what she’d say to me when I’d *insert life milestone here*. 

Sharing this to maybe give someone else a bonding idea! And if anyone has any other ideas please share :)"
"As the title says, my mother is making bizarre statements as though they are fact that are clearly delusions. Is this typical for early stage dementia?

Example: mother has decided that the reason she doesn’t like her new condo is because, “ it is built on the earth”. When I explain that all homes are and every home she has ever lived in has been built on the earth, she goes on about, “NOT ME! I NEVER live on the earth! I’m always one level or more above.”

Completely false. She lived in a house in San Francisco built over a garage as a child, and a townhome set up similarly in the last few years. Every other home has been, “on the earth.” 

Thoughts on this bizarre statement that she swears is fact? 


She has made similar claims recently regarding homes with windows or high wind areas…. That she somehow has never lived in such situations previously.

Is this a dementia thing? She is so matter of fact about it and can seem so lucid otherwise."
"Just a vent. I cant talk to people in RL so internet strangers it is.

I work full time, I have a business to run, and with COVID, it's been real tough. 
We also take care of our grandmother who has dementia and we have people who help, but she can be so abusive that we have to be present all the time to calm her down.
I am so tired. I feel stagnant, my days are not progressive because I lack sleep. The stress of maintaining the business and sustaining my family is really getting to me. 

She doesn't sleep. She wants to go to the bathroom all the time. Especially if she has an episode, she'll go every second. 
We'll prepare for her to go back to bed and once on the bed, she'll argue to go bathroom.
She needs the assistance to take her because she's so weak from the lack of sleep and just overall she's at that age. 
She refuses to wear diapers. 
Shes so mean, and when she doesn't get her way - the guilt tripping is so heartbreaking. She says the most vile things and I don't recognize her anymore. 

I'm on the edge, I'm so done. Im trying to be mentally tough, but I'm tired of being tough too. It's been the most hellish 3 years of my life and this is the cherry on top. 

I'm 23 and I feel so stagnant, so hopeless, exhausted and just about done. 
It's 2am and I'm at my wits end. I have to leave the to breathe.
I don't have the heart to argue with her. 

I'm just. Done."
"Hello all caretakers, or maybe also dementia sufferers, if there are any reading.

I wonder what is your experience with frailty? You know, falling when walking, being very weak, weak hands, not many muscles, having big difficulties getting up from the floor or ground etc.

Is it always a part of dementia? Can it be reversed with improving diet and exercise?

What is the bext management strategy for frailty?"
"I lost my grandma to vascular dementia a few days ago. I know she is in a better place because past few months she couldn't do anything and was entirely dependent on others and bedridden. I have always seen her being ill (she had a lot of health issues). She lived a long life, she was 90. She saw her great-grandson become an adult. But past few years we had been living together. The person I knew was long before she was physically gone. But there's this pain and hurt and grief in me and I don't know what to do or how to process it. Worst is, I'm all alone. I am an international student, I have been in a different country for the past few months and couldn't see her or be with her at the end. My entire family is back home. I have no friends here and no social support system whatsoever. And I miss her, even though we didn't do any 'special' things together. But all those tiny moments throughout the day made up for it - like her chair in my mom's room, giving her a bath, watching a movie with her at home every nye instead of going out, making her wear her hearing aid, lending my scarves to her because she liked them, her watching movies on my laptop with me, her making me try on her jewelry and forty year old clothes. How can I honor her memories? How does one cope with this?"
"Ok…I know this is super personal. I just don’t feel comfortable talking about this with my friends. Internet strangers it is. 

My husband has early onset FTD. We are still fairly young. He’s only 59. I’m 10 years younger. He is not the same person. His personality has changed significantly which is a symptom of his kind of dementia. 
Between that and the fact that I am basically a caretaker/ mom role for him these days, I just do not feel even slightly sexual towards him any longer. Don’t get me wrong. I love this man with my whole heart. He is the love of my life and my best friend…or was…but I just can’t. 
He has been wanting intimacy and I keep putting him off. Usually he forgets for a while until the next time it comes up. I really just can’t. No matter how much I love him I just do not feel sexual about him any longer. I can’t bring myself to have what would basically be pity sex. The idea of it just makes me…ugh. No. I just can’t. And I feel like I shouldn’t have to either. 
I feel horrible for feeling this way. None of this is his fault. It feels wrong to force him into celibacy when we previously had an active love life. But I really really do not want to do it. 
I would appreciate any advice, thoughts, etc. I’m truly at a loss as to how to proceed other than to keep putting him off and hoping he forgets about it."
"Some time ago I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/srbdmb/im_new_but_joined_some_time_ago_im_not_normally/) here about my father's accelerating downward spiral, but because of so much going on... I haven't been able to reply to any of the kind posts people wrote.

To update... My father was discharged from hospital with full live-in home care support last Wednesday morning. At first, things seemed to be OK, but then, on Thursday night I got a call from the Community Care people... My father's care worker, in a frightened panic, had called them because my father was raging that he'd stolen cheques... I was asked to call my father in an attempt to talk him down. Knowing how well my last effort went when he was extremely agitated, while still in hospital, I didn't have high hopes... As I expected, I was unable to calm my father down, and then he started accusing me of theft before slamming down the phone. I called back the Community Care people, and described my lack of success... Long story short, the hospital paramedics and police were called in.  Since then, my father has been in hospital, and his Community Care nurse is stridently urging that he be kept in hospital until a nursing home bed becomes available; I hope the hospital accepts her recommendation. For one, there's no way they are going to send live-in care givers after that, and two, my father is entirely incapable of being alone. Moreover, there's NO WAY I'm able to have him live with me; that leaves the hospital. What makes me angry and frustrated is that EVERYONE, including my father's hospital care team, thought something like this could happen, to the point of outlining, to me, the measures that would be taken if it did. He should NEVER have been discharged in the first place!

Yesterday, my father's hospital nurse called, because my father was ""confused,"" and wanted to speak to me about ""his missing things."" Namely, his wallet, cheques, money etc. I pressed the nurse for details (because I've seen this movie twice now), and he conceded that my father was indeed agitated again.. I replied that if I spoke with my father, it would only make matters worse, and requested they not call to ask if I can talk him down when he's agitated.

The thing is... I want to visit my father... but I'm very apprehensive. Yes, I can call in advance to find out what kind of a frame my father is in, and yes, I can ask again at the front desk of his floor before going in, but... as everyone knows... dementia patients, especially those prone to aggression, are very unpredictable... On one hand, I want to see my father, but on the other, I'm afraid of risking the chance that I'll set him off... I just don't know how to handle this, and I don't know how to respond to his accusations. I'm very aware that when somebody with dementia is having delusions you should go along with them.... This, though... how the Hell do I respond to that?"
My grandma is the one with dementia but last night my grandpa got mad over a potato and   starting say fuck them kids they don’t know what the F… they are doing. He got ecola like 4 years ago and isn’t right in the head. I hate him all he cares about is himself. He bought a brand new computer and my grandma has been asking for a new bed for 5 years. How selfish of him.I hope karma catches up to him so bad. 😔😔
My moms on all the meds. She’s mid-later stage. Living w my sister. Convinced ghosts are stealing her things. Bawls over it daily. She’s on meds for it but still happening. It’s worse than the memory issue. Any ideas? I think we have to slowly removing all her things. Bags of clothes. Bags of old papers. She carry’s it around. StRtinf to be too scared to go outside. Go anywhere. Cuz “they’ll” steal her stuff. Help.
My grandmother who has had dementia for the last two years and is rapidly getting worse has been saying she has a cold everyday for the last year. She is constantly wiping her nose that is not runny and just feels run down. We’ve decided it is just one of her things that she focuses on whether it’s real or not. Is “being sick” a common thing dementia patients dwell on?
"Laying against him. A bonus day. I don't know how many remain, so I cling to what I can.

Dawn brings light, and renewed hope. This could be the day he recovers. The day he remembers himself.  And me. Us.

The last time we were together seems so long ago.  Unknowing how scarce the future would become,  that last day of us passed by as if it was normal.  So precious,  yet unremarked. Its loss not mourned until it was too late. Lover, I cry now, I thought you were coming back.

Those days since, well we've been moving around each other so carefully.   Like in those shops; you look. But don't touch.  The distance between each touch grows longer,  even as we talk and live and enter our deadly routine for the day.  We see each other clearly.  There are no walls or distance the eye can understand. But we are locked away. My heart reaches, but the brain says no, hold on.

Every day at dawn I think this could be it.  Last night's touch could've been the start of our renewal.   I missed the day it ended,  but I'll forever mark the day it returned.   The eagerness grows, yet that bright spark,  not nurtured,  fades. But it's early.  There's still so much time. Hold on.

Routine routine.  If it's done then look for more.   Maybe we got through yesterday, last week, last month,  because the routine kept us bound.  Today's routine may find the key.  And unlock his heart again.  Busy. Work.  Hurry up. What next. 

He's back. Be careful spark,  not too bright.  It might be the hope pushing him away.  Shhh. How was it, I hear you asking me... sad lover, can you see?  Did the day bring your prize?  Did you glimpse his true heart again? 

Maybe. Just...maybe.  But I did get one thing.  It's enough for right now.   One more night.   I lay beside him. Hold on."
"First time poster here, and I thought my first post would be a teary, exhausted plea for help. That's how I feel most of the time caring for Mum. I've never really liked her, and she wasn't the best parent.

On to why I like bin day. Today is the day I go to Mum's house and put out the bins. For my tidy soul I do like to fill it up with junk. Each week I insist we throw two things away. Today was a win! We threw out a broken toilet seat and a bucket of very old tennis balls AND I was allowed to take the plastic Christmas tree away (as long as I donate it).

Now we can stand in the doorway of the shed and for some reason I just feel like today was a good day."
"I'm 23 years old, obese, have high cholesterol, and have anxiety/depression. In September, I accidentally ate a THC edible. This led to the deterioration of my mental health. I have been feeling very tired all the time, can't concentrate, forget things, not motivated to do anything at all, and my sleep is bad all the time. My coursework has become harder to do over time. I don't recreationally do any substances and don't drink. My paternal grandmother passed away from dementia and if I'm not mistaken, so did my paternal grandfather. Do I have MCI and could this go away or is this permanent? Thank you for your help."
"My fil left the house today. Thankfully he was standing by the car!

I have tried dollar store door knob  covers for Children and he figured it out within an hour. 

Help. This is so unsafe.  I took the dog for a “walk” we were gone 2 minutes. It’s 19° F"
"It’s been a month to the day since he passed. I couldn’t bring myself to talk about it before but it just dawned on me that it’s been a month. A complete blur of a month.


He had Lewy body and it was awful. He fought hard until the very end. He was always so strong and seemed invincible even during his delusions. But he’s not suffering anymore. Although I am angry that dementia robbed us of his final 2 years. He was here but he really wasn’t. 


I appreciate this sub so much. I learned a lot from the posts and it was comforting talking to people who understood how it felt.


Wishing everyone here the strength to care for their loved ones battling this awful disease. May you find comfort and cherish the lucid moments."
"Both of my parents at age 69 have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. I'm 32 and an only child, single, no kids.  I already have POA.

They live in the country, with few family members around. I work full time remotely and can work from their place, but it's getting more difficult and stressful.  

I have to remind them to take medications, fill out their weekly pill boxes, clean, and go with them to appointments. If I don't help them with food they will just eat cereal and ice cream. There are few resources around and their neurologist is 1.5 hours away, which can take almost my whole working day when I take them. 

Dad has gotten more aggressive and they have both hurt each other several times. Mostly grabbing or pushing, I haven't seen actual punching. A few nights ago dad pushed mom and she fell on her face, busting her lip and getting a bloody nose. He was immediately apologetic and said it won't happen again but I know it's probably just a matter of time. I told them if it happens again I will have them separated. It's all starting to affect my mental well being. Both of their families blame me when I'm not there watching them 24 hours a day, but of course none of them have offered to take one of them in. 

They are still very independent in some ways so I think it's too early to consider placing them somewhere. They both still drive, mom likes to go shopping, dad likes to meet friends at the diner. That said, mom's short term memory is almost completely gone. She rarely can remember what happened the day before.  

I've hired someone to help clean. When I'm not here my cousin helps with their medications, but I can't expect her to do everything. I tried asking the county DSS, they said they would have to be put on a waiting list to get any type of home aid. I called to larger cities but most wouldn't service this area. 

In addition to working full time I'm also taking my architecture registration exams, so you can imagine how difficult it is to try and keep an eye on them, work, study, and do everything for them. I'm afraid that we couldn't afford a live-in caretaker but that's the only solution that I feel would work. Is there anything I'm missing here in terms of options? 

Thank you."
Moved grandma to a long term facility a couple weeks ago. It became increasingly difficult to care for her during the night time and she had foot injury. Family has been checking in on her constantly at the facility. Every time we visit red flags come up. Today we overheard a work say she’ll beat a resident if she doesn’t take her pills. They haven’t been checking her blood sugar and often times she’s been pushed aside to the corner to sit all alone. There always seems to be a lack of workers among other things. I want to take her out of that facility but I don’t know what to do. She was getting better care at home from family even though we were burnt out. It seems so cruel to ship her off to some care home to be abused by strangers until she dies. I just want to care for her and make her comfortable but I’m out of options any thoughts or positive vibes would be much appreciated thank you.
Anyone here have experience with adding heart medications to an already fragile mind? I am seeing a big change in the behavior of my elder as start a beta blocker and a blood thinner. I had to get up in the night four times and I am worn out. Today I am limiting naps and trying to keep them more alert during the day. The getting up out of bed with an oxygen tube and a walker when they are half a sleep but driven to go go go. The scary part of when they won't go back to bed easily.
"I know many of us talk aloud to ourselves in our daily lives w/o suffering from cognitive decline. But I live with my mother, who suffers from some form of dementia (working on getting a diagnosis) and she talks to herself constantly (when she’s not parked in front of the tv). Usually she’s just narrating to herself what she’s doing, ie if she’s boiling eggs she’ll say “now it looks like they’re done. Time to run them under cold water” etcetera. I have to have a white noise machine running sometimes so I’m not distracted by it. I just wanted to see if other people w dementia sometimes exhibit this behavior?"
"If Dementia/Alzheimer’s were a horror movie, that would be the title. 

Bit by bit this disease robs our loved ones’ brains and leaves a body that appears to be them but isn’t."
"Dad had COVID last year around New Years. He was in the hospital for two weeks unresponsive (but not on a vent) and made a fully recovery (yay!). But after that, his dementia was 100000 times worse. I ended up having to put him in memory care and his hallucinations are almost out of control. Anyone else have this issue?"
"My Uncle has lived with us for four years, I've watched him go from a strong independent military man, to a preschooler who can drink and has been to war,
We are now at the toddler stage, can't dress himself, barely eats, spits out his pills, confused and scared.
Hospice has been a big help, they say we have about a week left.
I'm caught between sadness and relief that it's almost over.
I am not sure what I'll do with myself, I quit my job to care for him.
I'm just so tired and so sad. This disease is the worst."
"My Grandmother (who didn’t have dementia) just passed away. My grandfather has dementia and it has gotten worse since she passed. He asks where she is about every 2 hours. My mom has been telling him she died and he has to relive that heartbreak over and over. 

My mom insists this is best for him but I disagree, I think she should lie and tell him she’s at the store and redirect the conversation. She’s very upset I even suggested this, so what’s everyone’s opinion? Do you lie or continue to tell the truth?

Edit to add: apparently a grief counselor told her to never lie to him 😑"
"Cross posting from /r/alzheimers. Last month my mother moved her father into memorycare down in Florida. He had been living with my aunt and uncle at their house with my grandmother (his wife) in the West Palm Beach area, but it got to a breaking point of not being able to care for him. Today we were told he is being kicked out after physically assaulting a nurse for a 2nd time resulting in the nurse being sent to a hospital. My mother is scrambling to find a new facility that can care for him, as moving him back into my aunt's house is just out of the question. Does anyone have recommendations in Florida, specifically near the Palm Beach area for dementia/alzheimer patient living facilities that may get violent?"
"It’s been several months since I posted in here. 
We made the difficult decision to place Mom in a care facility on 12/16. We had been on a waiting list and had passed on two previous openings. 

Things were unraveling quickly and we knew “it was time” and I have no regrets as I know I was mentally as well as physically at my limit. My hair was literally starting to fall out from the stress of her daily care needs. 

Sadly she is not transitioning well - she does have some good days but she sundowns badly. They are still trying to find a medication cocktail that helps keep her calm but doesn’t have her “snowed” all the time. 

She was able to  walk when she left home but now is unable to and uses a wheelchair. She struggles to even stand up to go to the toilet. 

i visit as often as I can, she is always happy to see me but is sad when I leave. They say she calls out for me often. 

Her hospice nurse thinks that as rapidly as she is declining, that it wont be long.  

I know you can all relate when i say that I don't want to lose my mom but this sloe bleed is absolute hell on earth. 

All I can do now is love her as much as i possibly can and pray for peace for her and for us. 

Tremendous appreciation to everyone in this group.  it has been a God send to me."
"My grandma was diagnosed with early on-set a while ago. I'm not really sure how to react. I tried asking for advice and people told me that ""oh maybe she'll remember you"" or she would if i loved her, or that sometimes dementia patients remember things you wouldn't expect.

I know it's not easy for other people to comfort me or help me, but in that moment I felt so much like that ""advice"" was absolute bullshit. It felt like they were trying to feed me some romanticised version of dementia. I know that there are ups and downs with dementia and i'm not trying to take away the little silver linings people with dementia/caring for someone with dementia find. In that moment I just didn't want to hear about the bright side I guess. I don't really know how to cope. It feels like someone dumped a huge pile of information on me and now I look at her wondering how much is going."
"My mother (58 f) has dementia. I(24f) live abroad and this is the first time i am visiting her after her diagnosis. She was a bit lost the last time I came but wasn't properly diagnosed.

My father is her primary caretaker, my brother lives nearby. They both help her around. She is primarily in her early stages, can read and hold a conversation properly, for the most part. Is a bit lost and forgets things easily. 

When I am here i try to give her brain exercises that stimulate her. I am not sure even if they help her but make her a bit happy, and seems to make her a bit foccused. I leave next week and i feel so guilty. 

I don't know if i should stay here and take care of her. But i do know that staying here makes me depressed and i don't really take care of myself much. I have gained a couple of kgs in the past month. I am not good at working from here, which i have been doing, and have been lagging behind.
 
I don't know if i should leave my job, leave my life there and take care of her. I don't even know if it will actually make any difference. I can't help but feel guilty about leaving her here and getting on the flight next week."
"for me but my aunt did fairly well. She got appropriately dressed by herself (it’s cold here today). Originally came out without socks but realized what she had done and came back out wearing with matching socks. The slippers didn’t match but they are the same style and similar colors so I called it a win. 

Me? Not so much. The awful animal noise at 3 am woke me up and I still think it sounded like a chihuahua had fallen off of the 6 foot fence and broke 2 legs. I went outside to check but couldn’t find anything. Maybe someone hit a dog on the street behind us?

I love the improvements taking Nameda is making for her. It’s not something I expected but with those improvements come dangers - like turning on the oven before she left the kitchen, opening the front door and saying she wants to go for a walk (I have an motion detection alarm) and trying to wash her clothes while I took a quick shower because I woke up 2 hours late because of said chihuahua screams. Walking with clothes dangling from her arms means she could trip while going down the 2 steps to the washing machine. Early bedtime for me tonight. Thanks for listening. Needed to vent."
"Back info: my mom is 67- the past two years she has drastically changed. For about four months she just straight up raged—screaming at us, if her phone didn’t work (bc she wasn’t operating it correctly) came and and threw it screaming up and down that she got sold a bad phone..I could go on and on. At this time she was also decreasing seraquil under doc supervision so we weren’t sure if rage was from that or could she possibly have dementia. She ended up getting in a car accident, which she does not take responsibility for however she must have gotten flagged by the dmv because she had to get tested for dementia, pass road test etc. she ended up passing it all and the memory tests came up more as red flags for dementia in the future if continues her lifestyle.

Fast forward 1 year later- the aggression is way better but she still is suspicious—she stopped her therapy (only went twice) bc her doc had her Credit card number and she claims she never gave it to him…
She looked at me and thought I was my aunt, twice. Was calling my husband by my uncles name. Asking same questions over and over. She didn’t sleep well for the last three days and this happened along w a UTI.

Oddly enough she is normal about three weeks out of the Month and that fourth week is confusion, agitating, perseverating on small things.
She also likes her pain medication.
I guess what I am asking is does this sound like dementia? Writing it out it does to me, just need more input any advise appreciated!

Also when she is in that state of mind she constantly is eating sugar…anyone else see the at correlation?"
"My mom seems to be going down hill at a pretty rapid and consistent pace. I feel like I’m constantly stuck in a phase of mourning if that makes sense? I get used to the fact that she has difficulty with speech, then bam she starts having hallucinations. I think the hallucinations have to be the worst of it, then on top of them she’s no longer recognizing my family members. I know it’s only a matter of time before she constantly doesn’t know who we are. Things are only going to get worse and worse until the very end, and that starts an entirely new mourning period on top of all the bits and pieces of her I’ve lost throughout the years. In a way I feel like there will never be relief from the grip my moms dementia has on me"
I was able to get my grandmother to willingly sign POA paperwork on a good day and have it notarized. What do I need to do with it other than get copies? Probate office?
My grandma thinks that my  clothes and shoes I wear are hers is there anything I can say that won't make her mad?
"My father gets upset and tells me that I am treating him like a child. He's in the early stages of dementia. He still has the ability to: get dressed, get ready in the morning, shower, use bathroom, handle money, most life skills. At this point he does not have a license, I do the cooking and cleaning and driving and reminding. What usually instigates this statement is when he says he is feeling dizzy/has low blood pressure. I ask him to sit down or take it easy. Sometimes not even 10 minutes later he wants to: Do yardwork outside, take a walk around the block outside

 Out of fear for his safety I have to try to convince him not to do [insert strenuous outdoor activity here]. He has no history of falls, luckily. It makes me feel terrible, as I believe I have good intentions. Any advice on this? Deflecting onto another topic doesn't seem to be a solution. He will remember that he wanted to do [insert strenuous outdoor activity here]. My only other solution might be bringing in someone like a nurse or carer who doesn't have a relation to him like I do. But that seems expensive for what I need out of it."
"The doctor has taken my grandfather off the diabetes meds (Metformin, Glypizide), and so we have to check his blood sugar more than we have been, and more frequently than the hospice nurse visits. 

Today went ok, but he was *not* happy about the finger prick. I'm picturing a day when he won't even give me his finger."

"My grandfather (Papa) has alzheimer's. My mom has POA. Papa is currently in an Assisted Living/Memory Care facility. 

Recently, he's started having delusions that ""someone"" is out to kill his kids or himself and is calling my mother literally 20+ times a day in a panic. He's also threatened to punch staff at the facility for telling him he has to leash his dog. My mom said he has his ""meltdowns"" in the afternoon. It sounds like he is highly agitated and getting aggressive. So much so that the facility has told my mom that something will have to change or he cannot live there anymore. To say my mom is stressed out is an understatement.

My mom has had Papa tested for a UTI and a couple other things. That's the first thing we thought of, but those tests came back normal. I believe he is on Zoloft currently, and I want to say something for high blood pressure as well. 

I think there's a concern for my mom with ignoring the phone calls that he'll get more agitated if she doesn't answer, and redirect his anger to the staff. But she is at her wit's end. 

So I have two questions: What can she say to him on these phone calls to calm him down, if anything? And does anyone have any medication (or other type of) advice?"
"So, we have noticed small things with her in 2019. After my papa (her husband) died it just got worse.. She was talking to herself in the beginning about stuff and we picked up on that. Now she just makes no sense whatsoever and it's hard to be around her because she is so mean if you have a different opinion. I have worked around people with dementia and I rolled with what they're seeing from day to day, but this is a family member. I wasn't too close with my grandma to begin with, but this is really making it hard. She doesn't want to go anywhere with my mother and I anymore. She has been very mean about her religion. She uses papa (the one person I was closest to and the one male figure I had to a dad) to get us to convert to Christianity saying that we obviously don't love him because we are going to hell. I'm glad he doesn't have to see his wife like this. It would make him sad. It's been rough.

She tried to run away to California to marry some guy. She stopped that. She is too lucid to be taken to a hospital without trying to run away again. We are trying to keep her as safe as possible, but it's so hard because this woman can be so stubborn. I love her, but it's been hard to be around her. Yesterday she told us that she is ""taking a stand against dementia, diabetes, my food allergy, and many more genetics passed down in the family."" She has diabetes and she believes she is getting healed. I am worried she will stop taking medication because she hears a voice in her head telling her to stop taking them because she is all better. She freaks out at me when my food is touching sealed containers of my allergen.

She isn't the woman she used to be and it's been hard to deal with. She won't listen to my mom and I because she only listens to men. She doesn't care if it's important advice, she will only listen if it's from a man. She used to listen before it got this bad. Now she is following my uncle who has only two good brain cells and despite this woman having issues falling asleep, memory, and she is hallucinating; he gives her the keys to his car. He doesn't listen to us so she is getting really bad advice from a man who has no idea how to take care of himself without his mother being there. He told us he does not care about what happens to his mother if she gets hurt or hurts someone else. She has gotten into small accidents on the road with NO idea how they happened. My uncle also says that ALL people with dementia and Alzheimer's are the same, so she cannot have dementia because she isn't acting like the people at the home or like my papa. I am worried about her. I'm tired of him not caring about her. She stopped taking showers. She smells like a barn.. I have no idea how to tell her to take a shower because we have tried a lot of things!! Including just telling her to try taking a bath in the evening to relax. I'm just out of ideas.. It's making me sad seeing her deteriorating like this and so fast!"
"First time posting here. It’s only been about two weeks since my mom got diagnosed with DLB after having a psychotic episode, and every moment since then has been a struggle. She regularly has hallucinations and delusions, but refuses to believe they aren’t real. 

She just admitted to us tonight that the reason she’s been so adamantly against giving me POA is because sometimes I am possessed by one of the demons that she sees and now she doesn’t trust me anymore. So I guess now we’re going to have to try to get guardianship over her instead, before she tries to give POA to god knows who."
"Not completely cured, just managed their symptoms and became a little better and managed to stay there."
"My 75 year old mom still lives at home independently (with regular help from my sister, me and family friends). She was officially diagnosed earlier this month with dementia — a diagnosis we knew was coming for more than a year. 

She lives (for now, alone) in our family home, in the same neighborhood for 50 years, since she was 25 years old. She is very private and extremely independent; she insists on doing everything herself. She has has never really even had a cleaning service in her home even though she has the resources. She increasingly struggles with word recall, can’t hold a full conversation like she used to, doesn’t complete projects, rarely cooks, no longer calls people, has donated inordinate amounts of money to random causes, receives piles of fundraising solicitations each day, and has been financially scammed numerous times over the past 18 months. She can no longer operate a computer or use an iPhone to call an Uber.

How do we begin transitioning her to not driving anymore? Her close friend confided in me that he witnessed her mistaking the brake for the gear shift. In another incident, her car broke down while I was with her, and she was not fully able to explain to the driver from the towing company what had happened. She goes to the grocery store, church and other local errands.

Is it better to wait a while longer, or forcibly take her keys and risk she will feel betrayed?

My hope is that her doctor, at the next appointment in three weeks, will submit the paperwork to the California DMV notifying them that she has had a dementia diagnosis.

But how long does this process last, and what is involved?
Will her license just be cut off? Or will she be asked to come in and re-test?

My sister and I feel it is better to take a chance and wait for the doctor’s decision, as it is better for her to channel her negative reactions at the doctor than at us. Would welcome thoughts and advice."
"Hi all!

We are a group of graduate students at Stanford looking to better understand patients' experiences with clinical trials.

Specifically, we’re working on a project that aims to match people with trials more quickly and easily than many of the existing, cumbersome methods.

We’ve created a survey (below) that we hope gives you the chance to voice your own experiences finding therapies that work. We know that living with any disease or chronic condition is exhausting (never mind finding a trial), so we’re extremely grateful for the time you take to fill out this survey.

Of course, your privacy is extremely important, so all information is collected anonymously (unless you choose to provide your email for followup). Please let us know if you have any questions or suggestions.

"this might be long, but ig its bc im really passionate abt it. I am an activity assistant at an assisted living community for elders with dementia, and have been for almost three years. My job is to engage them in meaningful activities basically to keep their brains awake and running and hope to slow the process. Spending full days with these residents, talking to them and playing games with them among other things, they've become my family. my second set of grandparents. I love them, and they love me too, and don't ever fail to express that to me. it is so incredibly rewarding.

The worst part, however, is easily when they pass away. I cry so hard. I think about them everyday, I'm almost tearing up now just thinking about them. I mourn for their families, they knew it was coming, but it always feels too soon when its a loved one. Sometimes you never know when your last goodbye will be. The disease is scary, and unpredictable. 

But, if you have a loved one with dementia, here is some advice for you. When someone has dementia, it means their brain is decaying, and somewhat shrinking. There are certain things that can increase your risk of getting dementia, such as mental illness, alcohol abuse, etc. To care for someone with dementia, you need empathy, patience, and compassion. 

one thing I've noticed is that, when I ask a resident ""Can you help me?"" they almost always are willing to help. they want to feel useful. sometimes they are aware of having dementia sometimes they are not, but regardless, they want to feel as though they have a purpose still. helping to fold napkins or laundry, organizing silverware, drying the clean dishes, measuring the flour when we bake cookies, they are typically willing to help out. it makes them feel good. 

you cannot lose your patience and take it out on them. sometimes you have to just walk away for a moment and take a deep breathe, and try again. approach them warmly with a smile. keep them occupied, books, magazines, puzzles, crosswords. step into their world and help them to reminisce. ask them about their morals and values and beliefs. ask them what their opinion is on something. compliment them. it can help to slow the decline. not many people have time for this, and then turn to nursing homes and assisted living communities. it sort of depends. 

families tend to be in denial quite often, and it's most likely because they don't know much about the disease itself. research helps. 

the takeaway, as I said before, is to have patience, and put yourself in their shoes. when they need help to be showered or toileted, they start to lose their sense of dignity. we don't know how that feels, but that doesn't mean we can't make an effort to get a better understanding of what they are going through.

and if you do decide to turn to an assisted living community, really do your research fo find the place that fits best for your loved one.

thanks for reading, if anyone has questions I may have an answer."
"Everyday I hurt.  
Long Goodbye takes its toll.

Lucky to have family help settle the weight,  
and fill my soul.

I hurt.  
But I’m content.

I’m scared and know why,  
But their smiles make me fly.  
Memories with Mom too.

Details don’t matter.  
Not words either.

One way or another,  
she says “I know you”.

Still it all takes its toll.  
Each day shows more of the hole.

It’s coming.  
It’s here.  
I’m spent.

I hurt.  
But I’m content.

Kept going,  
is where I went.

To get through."
"my mother was codependent with my father before he passed away.  they both exhibited narcissistic behaviors as well.  she gained some friends before her dementia really increased, and then she effectively stopped all of those relationships because of paranoia.

So now she shadows me (i’ve lived with her since my father passed away) and is just continuing her codependent behavior with me.

this might seem a silly question if i read it myself, but when you’re in the situation sometimes you can’t see the forest for the trees.

is the only way for me to reduce her shadowing and codependent behavior (toward me anyway) by removing myself physically from her presence?

i want to ask for some companion care help to start coming by, with the idea that a) it’s another person and b) they might take her on outings to meet even more people.  but i have the feeling that while she still has me to concentrate on, she won’t give other people a chance.  she also already dismissed adult day care centers as “babysitting”.

i want to stay home and get things done.  but should i be looking into moving out instead?  it seems so drastic, but…?

TIA.  bless you all for hanging in there."
"As in the title, looking for some tips to help re-settle my dad for a short term stay somewhere else. As in my post history, I am pregnant but it's looking increasingly likely that the birth will be a C-section. This, on top of several other factors, has me 100% convinced that I can't have my dad here for 6-8 weeks after the birth while baby and I recover. I won't be able to provide the care that he needs, and it isn't feasible to have strangers in and out of my home helping with him during that vulnerable time.  


So he will be resettled somewhere temporarily for 6-8 weeks.  


Has anyone had to relocate their loved one for a short term stay? I'd really appreciate tips and hints and help on how I break the news to him and then how to make the transition as stress-free as possible. I know it'll involve meltdowns, but I'm hoping they're only minor and subside after a few days. He's pretty hung up on the idea of getting some steroids to try and help his ""auto-immune disease"" (because he's back to being in denial about it being dementia) but his GP thankfully will not prescribe them, and I've been very firm that he won't be doing illegal drugs in my house so maybe that's an angle I could suggest? Unsure.  


Thanks in advance x"

"Last year my father died unexpectedly (May 2021) and we put Mom in memory care. It was a little difficult at first and she had a severe UTI but recovered but lost her mobility. She forgot who I was so I did not speak to her for a few months but would talk to the staff to keep informed about how she was doing. Then she was put in the care of a wonderful nurse practitioner who worked with dementia patients. She changed Mom’s medications and it was like the sun peaking through the clouds.  Bits and pieces of my mom would shine through the haze of her forgotten memories. We began to talk frequently on the phone and I was able to visit once between multiple lockdowns due to covid cases in the facility. FYI, all staff and residents are fully vaccinated and staff are tested twice a week. About a month ago Mom tested positive for covid but had no symptoms or discomfort. There was one more suspected UTI but the trip to the ER confirmed no UIT but her bladder was very full and the doctor speculated this may be a very early sign of end of life. She now has an external catheter and the staff say she seems happy and is eating. She does sleep quite a bit. But the biggest change is she cannot say many words before lapsing into gibberish. She will say I love you, and sometimes respond with “I love you more…” which she knows is funny. But she calls all of the male staff Russ or Jeff (my dad and brother) and the female staff by my name or Mom. Conversations are short because I think she gets frustrated not being able to converse.

Question for all the caregivers, family and professional:
She has had Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia for 4-5 years at least. What stage would you say she is at, and how much time do you think she has? I love her so much and hate to see her like this, and I know what the end is like. I need to sit down with my brother and start preparing him for the loss of our mother. Thank you all and blessings to each of you for all your care and understanding."
"Good afternoon.  From the observable behavior of my mother (85), when compared to the DSM4 TR details of this disease my mother exhibits several patterns of behavior consistent with this diagnosis.  Below is a snapshot of these behaviours:

1.  Irrational thoughts or ideas.  Some paranoia that do not coincide with rational explanations. 
2.  Hallucinations and other manifestations of voices.  She has said she speaks with her dead relatives and that she has conversations with Jesus.  
3.  Delirium or confusion of basic ideas or thoughts.  Conversations have become very tenuous and have to surround things she understands.  
4.  Outbursts and tantrums.  When excited she will have a positive/negative outburst.  If denied what she wants she will verbally abuse you until she gets her way, may stomp her feet, or have a full melt down until she passes out.  
5.  Emotional instability.  She can wake up in a good mood or just begin crying over a simple problem.  
6.   Irregular sleep pattern.
7.  Wandering outside during irregular hours.  

With this very basic description, am I in the right direction that this is a qualifying behaviour?  Second, how do I go about getting her formally diagnosed to confirm?  My father is her enabler and protector, thus he will cater and support this behavior no matter the cost.   

Ultimately I really want my mother to be safe but it feels as though her behavior is getting more and more out of control.   Having her wandering around at 3am outside in 20 degree weather is not safe for her.   

Any feedback would be welcomed.  Thanks."
"There is no easy way to tell this story. I have been married to the same man for a little over 30 years. It hasn't been a bad marriage but it has always been a very needy one, on his part. My husband's mother was also an emotionally needy person. I didn't see this quality in my husband until I was well into the thick of our marriage. We've had a good life together, but his neediness has been exhausting over the years. Add to this he is not exactly a ""go-getter."" I think his mother's self-focus left him feeling alone in childhood & he essentially never grew up. Step in me pragmatic Mary Poppins. Take care of everything. Make things better for everyone. I'm not as nice as Mary Poppins though and as I get older I'm bitter.

The reason I say all this is because I'm now dealing with a situation I can't handle. My husband, I'll call him Winston, was diagnosed about 7 years ago with serious dementia and was told he needs to get his affairs in order soon. It was devastating news, of course. But the catch is, it was not provided by a reliable neurologist. We later found out that he was somewhat of a licensed practicing quack.  (a story for another time). Long story short his diagnosis was rebuffed by many other trusted doctors and neurologists who confirmed over and over that my Winston was not in cognitive decline and in fact, he was a relatively healthy man for his age and situation. 

So, good news, you'd think, right? Well not for Winston, he couldn't shake out that original diagnosis and settled himself into a funk and self-pity. He almost immediately start focusing on everyday absent-mindedness or slow recall to sure signs that he was in the mental decline the quack doctor said he was.  I was left to manage everything in our married life. Income, finances, children, medical and mental care for our family and extended family. Winston, in the meantime, became a couch potato, making his incorrect diagnosis a self-fulling prophecy. 

However, there is more to this story. Winston did not like to work. He never did. He did not want any responsibility in life. He was the jovial life of the party. Everyone loved Winston, he was good for laughing and up for anything fun. This is part of what attracted me to him when I was young. I came from a stoic hard-working family with very little time for fun or affection, and Winston showed me a world I never knew existed. He was a way out of my tough demanding family that displayed little support and caring for each other.  It was fun for a long time until it came time to really be an adult. Winston could not do it. He drifted from job to job. Winston often got promoted quickly because he was so charming and witty management loved him, but in a short time, they realized that was all he was and he end up getting fired, over and over. I kept us afloat all those years. I was a good worker, just as I was raised to be. I paid the bills and got us through rough times. I found Winston job after job that he'd eventually lose. I took care of the house, the repairs, the care of the children all the adult work.  I had to threaten Winston I'd leave him just to get him to mow the yard and take out the trash on a regular basis.

I always knew when Winston's current job wasn't going well because suddenly he'd be ill. He'd start calling in sick over nothing. That was usually the beginning of the end for every job. If I was ever sick, he was sicker, no matter if it was a simple headache or pneumonia. He was sicker because not to be would mean he would be in charge and have to manage things until I got better. 

So now Winston seems to have MCI and I don't know if he really does. After years of this, I think he's just trying to get out of holding down a job, helping me around the house. His job is not difficult and it provides a reasonable income and needed health insurance. He managed to keep this job for 7 years since his false diagnosis. 

I don't know what to do, and sadly I don't want to take care of him. He's drained the life out of me. I'm older now and not in great health. I'd like to take care of myself instead of him. Our kids are grown adults, and they seldom connect with us. I understand why, we have a sad home now, with little hope of a good outcome. I dream of just leaving Winston and starting a new life somewhere far away from all of this, but I know the burden of his care will fall on the children. Why should they have to deal with Winston when it was my choice to marry him all those years ago?

I don't know if he has MCI or not, but he knows I'm fed up. My compassion is running out and I'm not sure if he deserves the compassion I've given him. He does seem to be getting worse, at least when he's around me. He can't seem to manage the simplest tasks I ask him to do from holding up a curtain rod for two seconds to shoveling a short sidewalk. 

I'm lost and I don't know what my next step should be, but this can't go on. I've alluded to some of the problems with Winston to my close family and friends, but not wanting to burden them and be the ""Debbie Downer,"" I keep most of these feelings to myself. 

If you've read this far, thanks. I don't know what I expect in terms of help or support, but I'm not able to go to support groups without Winston. I work full time and in my free time, Winston is there and behaves in a way that makes me feel like I can't leave him alone."
"I know that there is really no answer here, but would still like to get some thoughts.  My 86 yo dad lives with my sister and her husband and MIL.  We are reaching a point where that will need to change and have started investigating memory care facilities.  My dad has a beloved elderly dog and any placement would have to allow him to keep his dog.  We’ve found several but they are very top end and, therefore, expensive.  Dad doesn’t have a ton of money but has about $400,000 from sale of his house.  Plus he gets about $2400 monthly in social security.  The place we liked the best will cost around $11,000/month and that will likely increase as his care needs increase.

So, what we are trying to evaluate is how long likely he is to live, as his resources will allow him about 3.5-4 years (we are figuring that us kids will contribute about $1000-1500 per month).  Dad is 86 and probably at about stage 5, but with some signs of decline beyond that.  Other than the Alzheimer’s, he is quite healthy:  no real heart disease, ok blood pressure, eats like a teenage boy, able to walk a couple of miles (with company)…

I know no one can predict, but what are some thoughts about the likelihood of him lasting 4 more years.  (Of course, if he has run out of money by that time, most likely he will be pretty bedridden and out of it and he won’t have the dog, so we could probably move him somewhere where he would be covered by medicaid, right?)."
If a care facility is not an option because of their level of aggression even though they are on medications. How do any of you deal with this type of situation? Thank you for any feed back☺
"My grandad has had Parkinson’s for as long as I can remember- it’s not genetic it was caused by chemicals from where he worked when he was younger.

The past year or so we have noticed a decline with him, it started off small, forgetting names sometimes and falling, but now we’ve hit a breaking point.

He was recently diagnosed with Parkinson’s Dementia (edit: changed from LBD after checking with my grandma on which one he was diagnosed with) in December 2021, but he was still able to do most things for himself, he could still cook and use the bathroom, have relatively okay conversations, he could still go out by himself and walk with the aid of a walking stick.

Since maybe mid Jan his decline has been slightly more rapid, with the biggest thing being incontinence. Since his diagnosis, I try to go to their house every night to help out, and spend most weekends with them, but I worry it’s not enough anymore.

In the past week, my grandad has gone from the man I knew, to what I can only describe as a shell of a man. He has declined so rapidly. He can’t dress or feed himself, he can’t speak (he mumbles but the words don’t make sense), he’s obsessed with winning money and Neil Diamond. 

I’m worried this decline has been brought on by something more than his dementia, but trying to get a GP appointment for him is difficult, whenever we call they tell us “there is nothing they can do” and tell us to “call the police and ambulance if we’re so concerned”.

I suppose this is more just getting it off my chest, but I feel the weight of the world on me right now. I work full time and spend all my free time helping my grandma because there is no other family to do it (my dad helps around work, but works long hours. My sister has no interest in helping, my aunt lives in Wales a few hundred miles away, she doesn’t work but won’t come help unless my grandparents pay for her to come help). This is so new to me, and this decline has come out of nowhere. I love my grandparents so much, and having to see my grandma cry in the bathroom, or my grandad not know who I am, breaks my heart.

My grandma is at a loss on how to handle this, what to do, where we go from here. We have got in touch with so many different people for help and now it’s just a waiting game. We’re looking in to carers but I feel if this decline is his new normal then a home would be a better solution for everyone, him included.

Please, if anyone can give any advice on how my grandma (his main care giver) or myself can navigate this, I welcome it. Any books, resources etc would be so appreciated."
"I fear my grandpa is slowly starting to think I'm his daughter and I have no one to tell this. 

He has no daughters, never had. There was never a child lost, no miscarriages. He has a few sons who all have sons other than my father. No girl grew up in his household, until I came along, first girl he raised. He retired few weeks before my birth. I am the first (and only) child he was there for everything.

Last summer he started referring to my uncles as my brothers. Each time he corrected himself. ""Your brother, I mean your uncle..."" It's fine, brother is a broad term in his language, elderly people use it for everyone. 

These slips started increasing, last month he called my older cousin ""your nephew"". Didn't realize for some time. Whenever I'm in the country I stay with them to take the load off my grandma. Whole month, he referred to her as ""your mother"".  

He doesn't talk much. He loves them and sits with them. But God knows why, he is so chatty with me. He always talked to me more, but now he is taking notes of things to tell me. He sits next to me and talks to me, no matter where we are. That's why others don't realise, and won't believe me. Some of them hadn't even believed me when I said ""this isn't just getting older, it's dementia"".

I don't know what to do with this, I'm scared to know what it means. I just needed to get this off my chest."
"I'm going to do you all a favor and preface this by saying this is gonna be long. Like, really freaking long. I'll try to keep the cursing to a minimum, but I am me and I curse a crap tin in real life.


ALSO: Mods, if this rant/question/seeking support isn't applicable for the subreddit, please remove or whatever.


As the title states, my bio mother has dementia. Whelp, she also has Parkinson's, alzheimer's, high BP, diabetes, and a slew of other health concerns/conditions. My brother and I (we're really the only ones to care for her, or that she can actively depend on) have been battling her for the better part of three, maybe four years, when she was diagnosed with early onset. This last year has seen a decline in her health, mental stability, inclination to take the necessary medication, clean her apartment, the list goes on. My guess is we're watch the last year of her life. The downward spiral for the last six months has been extremely dramatic. She fights damn near everything. Not physically, yet, but that time is drawing near. And, before any of you ask, she has qualified for caregivers, but only 20hrs a month, lest she, or someone else pay for more assistance. That's not gonna happen. Brother doesn't have that kind of income and I just got layed off. She refuses to pay for it, saying she ""needs"" all her money. Bro and I cannot keep this up. 24/7 care is fast approaching.


The thing I'm struggling the most with is that her and I have never been close (at least not since I was a 16 yo kid) and I still feel obligated to take care of her.. Shit happed, caused a divide, and we've never recovered. To actually say I hate the woman wouldn't be too far off the mark. And I still stop by and care for her five days out of the week. Through all the yelling, the arguments, the ""get the fuck out of my house"", the disrespect, all of it. It just drains me. And it isn't fair to her, either. She's quite clearly not herself. I try very hard not to take out my frustrations on her, but I slip up occasionally. It's been our dynamic for damn near two decades. Toxic, I am well aware. Part of the reason why, after becoming an adult, I never visited unless it was a family gathering. Neither of us are good for each other on normal conditions. Less so when she is becoming a worse human due to diseases wrecking her grey matter. I feel shitty and guilty all the damn time because of how I feel towards the woman, and I'm just saturated by all the bs she puts my little brother and I through. I know it's not going to get better. I know it's going to get worse. The brother and I tell that to each other now, almost as some kind of screwed up mantra. She wasn't a kind person to us before all of this, and it's become worse, as many of you on here have experienced. But we do for her what we can because we still care. At the end of the day, she gave birth to me. Physically raised me to be a healthy kid. Didn't do much mentally, but hey.... 


The culmination of all of this is that we reached a breaking point this last week. Bio mom went off on me for whatever reason, I had a REALLY shitty day, and I lost my cool on her. I stormed out of her apartment to the sound of her, yet again, yelling at me to ""never come by again"". I have come to my limit, and I don't know how to walk away. How to tell the family that I just can't anymore. They'll shun me, but that isn't an issue. My issue is that she'll be lacking the extra couple of hour a day that I could have been there for her. That now it'll all fall upon my brother again, minus the ONE HOUR she has a caregiver around, if she doesn't fire that person like she did the two before that a year ago. I just don't know anymore.


Sorry for the poor grammar and punctuation. My thoughts are literally everywhere this week. There's a lot going on."
"Just wanted to share my experience at the end…my Dad passed away last Friday February 18.  He had been stuck in bed for the past couple of months.  Dad became constipated and the regular routine of Metamucil, Colace, and Senna were no longer working.  Dad was 90 years old and really suffered as this big baseball was blocking his intestines for the last two weeks.  Fleet enemas did not work they only made him bleed a lot!  Soap suds enemas were difficult to locate.  So hospice protocol is morphine and sorry the blockage is too far up there to reach.  I’m trying not to be so angry but all they did was make him bleed and suffer.  Not the end I was expecting for him."
"My heart breaks right now so much because my grandfather is declining so much right now. As a family, we lost my grandmother in 2019, my grandfather was her caretaker. My aunt since then had been taking care of my grandfather with his medication, etc. but he’s been very depressed since then, understandably. His short term memory maybe in the last 6 months had been declining, then my aunt passed away from liver disease at 67. My grandfather since then has been declining in his memory, ability to eat, and ability to hold his bodily functions. My mom and my uncle have been taking turns coming out to CA from their respective states to take care of him. Since my aunts passing in November, my grandfather’s memory had declined to the point where he doesn’t remember what day it is, and what was just said. This past weekend, it was my moms turn to fly to CA to take care of my grandfather. My mom has been giving him ensure drinks which he has been drinking, but things took turn for the worse when my grandfather wet all the beds in the house. My mom discovered this early in the morning, stripped all the beds to wash the sheets, and found my grandfather attempting to climb into the bed she was sleeping in. He refused to wear the depends underwear provided. I’m so sorry this is happening. And, most recently, my grandfather woke up yesterday and ended up soiling his clothes. While attempting to put the clothes in the dryer instead of the washer, he ended up falling on his stomach with nothing on. My mom is witnessing all of this, trying to help him up, trying to tell him that he put the clothes in dryer instead of the washer. She called me crying her eyes out about all of this while my uncle tried to call me to ask me if o could help. My family is against putting him in a senior assisted living facility but I feel that may need to be the case. I told my my mom to call 911 if he fell, but she had excuses for not calling (they’ll put him back in bed and he’ll stay there all day again, there’s a few that may be incurred). I provided with her with local aging resources but there’s this resistance to seeking outside help. I provided her with local caregiver in-home care resources, and nothing.I have a cousin who is coming out to live in the house and take care of him but they don’t know her qualifications, she’s been wanting to move back anyway. They informed her of the situation and she’s okay to take care of my grandfather, my family’s plan was to give her money to take care of him. She doesn’t have a job, she has major health issues, and she keeps asking for money from people to help with moving expenses —my moms partner gave her $3000 and there’s a go fund me to help her move for $2000. I’m not sure why I’m posting I’m just angered by the situation, the discomfort with seeking professional help outside the family, and letting my cousin move in rent free to a house in a major Southern California City. Again, I’m not sure what I’m looking for. I think my grandfather needs to be evaluated for dementia but also depression too. I’m trying to stay out of it now because my mom and uncle need to decide what’s best but I’m sad, frustrated, shocked how fast his decline is. All I want is for him to receive the proper care from a professional. My family admits they can’t do this, they’re willing to let my cousin try but he needs to be evaluated by doctor, possibly anti-depressants, and provided with things like sunlight, socialization, and stimulation besides the TV. My friend recommended my family force my cousin to go through a certification course I’m caretaking before moving in but that’s not being considered. I feel like at this point, I need to step away and put my boundaries up with the situation and that it’s not my fight. :/"
My great grandmother always asked where my grandfather is. I don't know what to say. Please help me.
"Hi all, I'm (20M) new to this sub (literally just joined) and could use advice about my Grandfather, Ash, with dementia that I care for.

To start, my Grandmother abruptly passed last April from aggressive lung cancer. She took care of all of Ash's needs and no one in the family knew the extent of his dementia till after she died. Me needing a place to live, I moved in with him to take care of meals and medication during the evenings and have been here for 8 months. 

This is where I need advice. For the first time last week he started asking about my Grandma: where is she? her car's not here? is she out driving?... I don't know how to approach this yet he has begun asking more frequently. I try to deflect; say idk; and change the subject (usually the about the Olympics rn). 

I'm looking for advice about how I should approach this, maybe just reassurance I'm doing the right thing? I think it unneeded if I bring up her death if he asks, it would only cause grief for the both of us. But otherwise, idk what to say. 

Thanks in advance🙂"
"I read about Theuropeutic Fibbing from the Alzheimers association and it said using white lies to guide their dementia was more beneficial than going against it. Although this has been quite affective with my nan, she has begun accusing my step brother (a loving and kind man) of stealing her grand daughter away from her because she never sees her anymore and hasn't for ""years"" (which is not at all the case, she saw her months ago before they had a baby prematurely and have been looking after it for 2 months/COVID restrictions kept all the family from seeing them). 

I tried to contest this and it went somewhat well surprisingly. But only an hour later and nothing had changed (I'm not surprised at this, but I felt I had to at least try).

What should we do?"
"My Grandma has been gone over a year now sometimes I still think of the weird things surrounding the last few months and her unexpected death... She lived alone as my Grandpa pasted away a year before her I realize she should not of lived alone and tried to explain this to my mother but I think she was in denial and also I think sometimes my grandma would hide how bad she was... Anyways the last week or so my Mom, her daughter, gave her a notebook so my grandma could write things down to remember she did them... On her death I read this notebook which only had like a page or 2 in it. Two things stood out 1. She said ""Mom"" told me to write in this notebook so I'd remember... ""Mom"" not ""Daughter"" but ""Mom""... I did ask my mom about this and she said sometimes people with dementia will refer to there caregivers as ""Mom"" or ""Dad"" which she actually referred to my brother as ""Dad"" once so her grandson... The 2nd thing is the constant ""Jesus please help me""... I think about her death here and there still because of the mystery surrounding it idk what happened only she was very confused and couldnt figure out her phone to call us for help.... This disease is horrible and its incredibly sad..."
"My mom (80) has recently been diagnosed with dementia. Since her diagnosis, things haven’t been going well and one thing that sticks out is she talks about babies all the time. Prior to 2 or 3 weeks ago, she hadn’t mentioned them at all. Now, every conversation she’ll talk about babies to an extent. I was just curious if this has happened to anyone else and if there’s a reason why? Also she’s been much more aggressive and hit my brother today (I asked what time he got there to see her and she said one time and my brother said he got there later then what she had said and she got very upset). Is that common? Thanks in advance!"
"I don’t think this sub is appropriate to share my full story, but I am 43/F and have two parents who are physically and mentally ill, and a disabled brother a couple years older than me. My extended family has suspected my mom has been in early stages of dementia for several years now, but she avoids doctors so hasn’t been diagnosed. Even if she does have it, I’m guessing it’s still early stages as any stories I could tell about her aren’t nearly to the degree of severity many of you have shared.

All that being said, I visited my parents and brother after a somewhat long absence yesterday and it’s apparent that their entire living situation is declining and somewhat rapidly. I just need general help talking through their specific situation to prepare myself for what is still to come. Since I believe my mom’s dementia is still rather mild, I feel like I should discuss in more detail on another sub. I tried finding “elderly/elder care” subs but they don’t appear to be active. Are there any other subs you have found helpful? If not subs, what agency could I contact via phone to get some support and advice? I don’t want to tie up Dementia/Alzheimer’s advocates as I know there are others in much greater need than me. TIA for any leads. I am in the Pacific NW, USA if that makes a difference."
"My mom’s memory decline started slowly and has been accelerating more noticeably recently. 

Complications: I live several states away, so I am not able to be present in any daily kind of way. Everyone in the immediate family circle won’t touch it with a ten foot pole (there was one convo with dad in which he said he wants to “wait and see” what happens).  

My siblings and I decided something has to change, so I agreed to press my dad on it (with sensitivity, of course). That will be later today. Ugh.

Through some research I have found articles about addressing dementia with the actual parent who has it, but I can’t seem to find any advice about dealing with the *healthy* parent who is in denial, and how to sensitively tell them they need to get things going. 

Living far away makes me feel pretty powerless, and yet also guilty for not being vocal sooner. Thank for reading."
"My father was diagnosed with dementia about 6 years ago, and the decline has been rapid. 

Over the past few months, things have gotten much worse... he's losing his balance, pacing around the house nonstop for 10 hours a day, compulsively talking in gibberish... and worst of all, he now has a habit of going to the bathroom whenever and *wherever* he wants. Until recently he was able to communicate that he needed to go, but that's no longer the case.

I've been trying to convince my mom that it's time for onesies and diapers, but she disagrees, apparently wanting to spare him some dignity. 

He DOESN'T soil *himself*, but he soils every square inch of the floor in our home. At this point, she's mopping up after him multiple times a day, and wet-vaccuming the carpet in their room every morning. I wouldn't be surprised if she devotes 10-15 hours a week cleaning up his ""accidents,"" and when *she's* not home, the job falls onto my siblings and I to clean up the mess. At this point, I think it's fair to say that our patience is wearing thin with the situation. 

I tried talking to her about it today, but she's drawing the ""diaper line"" at him defecating in his pants. Until then, she's not interested in going that route. 

I understand that cleaning up someone with a diaper is equally as difficult as mopping floors on a constant basis, but I feel like his current situation is even *less* dignified than wearing one. 

Am I wrong in my logic? Are there other steps or fixes to the situation aside from diapers? 

I moved back in with my parents (as did my siblings) specifically to help with my dad, but we're all hitting a breaking point now due to this."
"Grandma got violent again. Scratched me up and my fiancé good while screaming at us. Couldn’t take it and called cops to have her evaluated again. 

I feel bad that I’m happy they’re keeping her at least for the weekend since nothing is open. They’re looking to put her in an I situation that’s covered by her medical/Medicare. 

Part of my feels bad cuz I know the confusion she must be feeling is out of control. On the other hand I’m angry I’m at her for doing this to us over LAUNDRY. Financially I’m better off with her here, but I’ll give so much more to just have her placed somewhere they can watch her and handle it. 

There’s no help when it comes to public resources. I feel like private institutions are ready to take them always and charge a fortune and public resources say “not our problem”.

I know I’m rambling but I’m just…. Tired."
"The following quote is probably the key to treating Alzheimer's disease:

""The inflammatory mediator peroxynitrite, when generated in excess, may damage cells by oxidizing and nitrating cellular components. Defense against this reactive species may be at the level of prevention of the formation of peroxynitrite, at the level of interception, or at the level of repair of damage caused by peroxynitrite.""

Nearly all the approved and prospective treatments for Alzheimer's disease limit the production of peroxynitrite.  It is like turning down the faucet on a sink with a stopper, you are only slowing the sink from filling up.  On the other hand, if your turn down the faucet and partially lift up the stopper, you stabilize the amount of water in the sink.  In Alzheimer's disease it is the difference between slowing down the progression of the disease and largely stabilizing it.

If you combine conventional treatments for Alzheimer's disease (such as Aricept and Namenda) that only slow down the formation of peroxynitrite with certain herbs that also scavenge and reverse part of the damage caused by peroxynitrite, the results are always better.

[https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/15/2/174](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/15/2/174)

There are currently two drug candidates for Alzheimer's disease that inhibit, scavenge, and partially reverse the damage done by peroxynitrite.  One is Trappsol Cyclo which is now in a phase two clinical trial.  The other is Anavex 2-73 which is in a phase 3 clinical trial.  The initial results are limited (especially for Trappsol Cyclo), but suggest that this approach to treating Alzheimer's disease is very promising.

"My dad was diagnosed with FTD when he was 55 or 56 and passed away at 58. His dad had it too in his 50’s. They have a MAPT mutation that I have a 50% chance of inheriting. I’m about to turn 24. 

I’ve went through waves since learning about my genetic risk of copious research into everything I can find about this until I can think of something to get it off my mind, to spiraling again. Whenever I see someone healthy in their 50’s or later, a part of me feels jealous.

I don’t want to get tested yet, but I will some day. What was keeping me calm was the idea that most scientists are cautiously optimistic there will be at least SOMETHING in 30 years, but now I’m terrified that although for MAPT mutations there is a strong correlation between individual age of onset with mean family age of onset, that I could end up getting this even earlier — in my 30’s or 40’s. Who knows. And I’m worried that because FTD is a less popular dementia than Alzheimer’s that it won’t get the attention it deserves.

It makes me worried that it’ll make it harder to find a partner and get married and have children, although there are ways to have children out there without risking giving the baby the gene. 

I’m constantly reading about the current research on this all, desperately hoping a breakthrough will be had and there will be some treatment for me before it’s too late if I have this.

I think about being a burden to my future partner and kids. Would I be better off dead than a massive financial and emotional burden? 

I just wish there was a treatment for this or something. I’m terrified."
"hello everyone.

my stepdad, (85), has been a victim of scams and it has gotten worse for the past few years. he has a landline, he gets phone calls from scammers asking him to send them money so he can claim his million dollar prize and all the typical scams.

it has brought so much stress to the entire family, especially to my mom (55)

we tried to help in whatever way we could. we tried call blocking, disconnecting the wires of the phone s when the phone ring (pretty much all the calls he gets these days are from scammers and for some weird reason he loves talking to them) but after a few months, when he seemed to have mellowed down, he calls the phone company to reinstate the service or deactivate the features and we're back to square 1. he doesn't have any more money to give. he gets the monthly social security or pension i think, and he just gives them all away. he buys vanilla cards. out of his desperation, he even started borrowing money from friends, and even random people. when he's off to send money to these scammers, he gets very restless and irritable you can't talk him out of it. he even gets really upset.

other than this, he's okay. i mean he's not as sharp as before but he's okay. you can still talk to him. he still remember important dates and appointments. he cleans the yard. etc. 

for years we've been sure that he has dementia, for which based on a test his doctor did to him, he does have early onset dementia but i still want him to see a different doctor which i am pretty sure he would resist to that idea but that's a different story. but yeah, today, i was speaking with my mom, she brought up ""addiction"". she reached out to someone in the VA to seek out help and instead, she was told that what could my stepdad be going through is addiction. now, i am not exactly sure what you'd call an addiction to constantly falling victim for scams.

but it got me thinking, what if my stepdad is? i remember when him and my mom met and he was still alright, about 12 yrs ago, he was even still teaching in school that time, he already had a history of giving money to what seemed like scams, such as resorts, vacation packages, and whatnot.

sorry for the long post, but could there be a possibility that we're treating the wrong condition here? should we be seeking out a therapist for addiction or rehab perhaps? or do you guys think this is just a  plain classic symptom of dementia?

we just don't know what to do with the phones anymore :C

i appreciate any help i could get here or suggestions on how to deal with scammers. and im sure my mom would be very grateful as well. thank you."
Is it normal to have days with surprising lucidity? My LO with Vascular Dementia (Stage 6) has had a few days this week where it feels like the fog has lifted a bit.
"to make a long story short my grandma got a uti and got some surgery and it's been a downward spiral ever since. my sister and i are the primary caregivers since my mom works but (and i know its awful to say) i am exhausted. before she was a worrier but now it's worst when mixed with confusion, she keeps going off without her walker and that can get her hurt, i don't know what to do and i could just really use from advice on what best to do."
"Hi all. My mom has recently been diagnosed with vascular dementia at the age of 73 and is struggling badly with the diagnosis and her changing cognitive ability. She is likely experiencing some sundowner-like symptoms. She is crying a lot, often in the evenings, repeating things like ""I just want to be me"". 

She's always been a powerhouse in the family, thinking of herself as a bit of a matriarch--always caring for others, taking care of house and home, etc. Very ""in control"" of herself and, in her eyes, her family. That said, she's clearly not coping with me needing to take over handling the finances, or my sibling and I doing more around the house. I've tried to get her to talk about what she's feeling. I imagine there is a grieving process involved here, voluntary or involuntary, for all of us. 

She's also been a caretaker for our father for a few years now--he is not in good shape physically, and we are faced with the fact that we will need to move them out of their house and into a place that is equipped to care for them. My wife and live out of state, but I'm within a day's drive and am spending more time with my parents as I can. My sibling lives in here in the same town with them.

Last week, her doc told her that this could be the most difficult time of her illness because she is still alert enough to be aware of it and of her mental struggles. She even hinted that things would get easier when she is no longer cognitively aware enough to know of her illness. I don't know the truth of that, but I'm reaching out here, with tears in my eyes, asking for kind words and any advice."
"I was wondering if anyone thinks a ""diary"" of people I knew, nicknames I had , songs in my childhood, etc so that if my mind loses ""now"", others, caregivers have a list of things that may be more relevant to my mental state.  

I know Alzheimers sometimes take patients backwards to early memories. I  I'm hoping it might happen to me in the middle stages."
"As title says, my mom is resistant to take new meds. So, I am wondering what is the point of bothering with a diagnosis if she won’t DO ANYTHING about it?

Would it help me when I need to take over her medical care or finances? (I have a POA already)

What more is a diagnosis good for besides treatment?

Thanks in advance. For reference, we are in the U.S."
"Learned very recently that my dad is most likely in the early stages of Alzheimer's. Willing to try anything (of course anything he is also willing to try) to slow it down. Looks like the coconut oil + mgt + ketogenic diet was a hot topic on the internet about 8 years ago, but it seems to have died out. Any anecdotal evidence from those who have tried it? If not, anything that has worked?"

"Mother-in-law is an early sufferer - she has wandered off several times over the past 2 months. We would like to get a gps-enabled bracelet tracker that also detects removal (she is prone to take off such things, so we would like to get alerted if that occurs). Not sure if anything like that exists? (Also, we would like to avoid device like watch so that it does not grab her attention)... Thanks in advance..."
"Edit: Just got the phone call. He passed while I was picking up medicine for him. I'm crushed. Hope you all have a good day.


To be frank Im not worried about my english right now. I thought we would at least have a couple more days with him, but my grandfather's health has deteriorated so much over the last 24 hours. We have him set up at home, and he's on very large amounts of morphine. His breathing is very shallow and irregular. He is so frail. It hurts to look at him, but I spent my evening standing by his bedside and holding his hand. The doctors reassured me he is in no pain. I wish there was a way to be able to know that he knows how loved he is. I wish he could reassure me that he knows I love him. Death is always apart of life, but I don't want him to feel alone. I hope my actions were enough.

I want to thank everyone who read and replied to my last post. I cannot express how much I am thankful. Your words and time was not wasted, thank you."
"The question about early signs of dementia got me going on a trip down memory lane, tagging the signposts of my mother-in-law's dementia.  We should have seen it for what it was much sooner.

Spring 2014 she made a left turn with oncoming traffic, causing a truck to hit the passenger side of her car.  My daughter, who was living with MIL at the time, was in the front passenger seat. MIL said daughter had been driving --  we thought MIL was shaken up from the accident. She insisted it was other other driver's fault. It wasn't.

After MIL and daughter attended a music camp together in summer 2014, daughter decided she didn't want to live with MIL anymore because MIL was angry all the time.

2015 - MIL had another accident. This time she ran into the side of her own house while parking her car in her driveway.

Summer 2015 - MIL went back to the music camp, stayed with her daughter (my sister-in-law). MIL complained that ""people"" were changing her class schedule and not telling her, people were mean to her and not letting her participate in workshops she was supposed to go to (she was trying to go to other people's lessons).

Feb. 2016 - MIL caused a three car accident and fled the scene.  On her way home from church, she decided to go to McDonald's for coffee, and ended up in a school parking lot, miles from the church, her home, or the closest McDonald's.  She pulled out of the parking lot into a five-lane street (two traffic lanes each north and south, central turn lane) cutting across four of the five lanes, causing two other cars to hit her and each other. She stopped but when the cop showed up she drove away. Her explanation was that she didn't know she had to talk to the cop and she was going home. Except she had no idea where she was and she insisted she hadn't done anything wrong.

(After that accident, the owner of the body shop called me to tell me she really shouldn't be driving anymore, even though she was really good for business)

Even after that, it took another year before my husband and his sisters got her to move into independent living and took her car away. She was there less than 3 years, the last part of which my husband was going to her apartment every evening to make her go to dinner because if he didn't go, she wouldn't eat.  

She moved in with us 2 years ago. She still bitches about the car."
He live sin NC and was staying with my aunt. She said she can't keep him there and he needs to move back into his home.  There's no way that will work. What can I do to get him government care? I was told he makes to much on social security to get free help. What a terrible situation.
"Has anyone had their loved one’s driving evaluated by an OT as prescribed by their neurologist? Also has anyone had their loved one sign a “driving contract” stating when the caregivers notice problems with driving, the person with Dementia will give up their right to drive? How did you approach the contract and how did the interaction go?"
Hi all. My dad's been suffering for a few years with dementia. He's probably at his worst in the evenings (sundowning). I try to take him out for a walk when I can but just wondering if anyone can advise anything else to try. He's on a bit of a cocktail of drugs which don't seem to be helping much. We thought maybe CBD oil might calm him but not sure if it's a good idea and might be too expensive without prescription. Has anyone given a dementia sufferer CBD oil or found any other solution. Thanks.
"I know these things are complex and present differently, but I feel like whenever I see a video of someone with Alzheimer’s, they speak fine, seem relatively put together, but they just can’t remember things. My mom’s memory certainly isn’t good, but she mostly has trouble getting words out and remembering how to do simple things. 

Thoughts?"
"Can't wait for this nightmare to start, and end.

Any advice?"
"My wife, with obvious, but undiagnosed (since she absolutely, angrily, refuses to go see any dr) dementia, is regularly complaining about being bitten by bugs. It’s not the season, and I’ve not had any bites. She shows me some skin mark sometimes, but no clear bites. 

Has anyone else encountered this? I’ve not read anything about this out there. 

The only consistency over the last five years has been her refusal to see a dr. What was once  angry denial is now an inability to even see a problem. Still don’t see a way until the inevitable crisis happens. 

Thanks."
"I would like to apologize for my english before I begin, but I need to talk somewhere.
  My grandfather is believed to be in the last stage of dementia. It's so incredibly hard to see him like this. To see him as a shell of who he used to be, to see him hurting so much. I know he's tired, so very tired. He just doesn't want to try anymore. It pains me to see him like this. 
  Lately while I've been monitoring him, he's frightened by me. He tries to attack me, and swing punches at me. He cries, and refuses to eat or drink. 2 days ago we took him to the ER and his doctors flat out told me, ""This is it."" Said we could make him comfortable at home, put him on meds, and let him go. My family has agreed to this, but he doesn't want this.
  I get scared when he stares off. I'm afraid that he's gone. He doesn't want to be alive anymore, because he can't even remember what there is to live for.  I feel like he's already gone, that he's left a long time ago. He doesn't want to be kept alive. 
  I'm afraid that when I wake up, he'll be here no more. I just wish he could be happy."
"My brother and I have verbally split the duties to care for my mum who has moderate dementia. She still lives at home. I have Power of Attorney and manage the bills, investments, accounts, tax, house maintenance projects, invoicing, all dog care and stakeholder comms (cleaner, gardener, daily visiting nurse) etc. I live three hours away. My brother's wife visits once a week to deliver shopping and takes mum to dentist, hair appointments. My brother does NOTHING apart from eagerly awaiting his inheritance. The issue is this: my mum's nurse had to take three weeks' off for an operation. My brother said his wife (my mum's daughter-in-law) would pop in everyday but would charge £500 a week. He told me it was NON NEGOTIABLE - I was in a hole so I had to agree and she has been invoicing me. His wife comes in an hour a day tops and does minimal duties. Basic food and shopping. Her invoice suggests she comes in four hours a day so the hourly rate becomes acceptable. Otherwise it would be 7 hours / £500 = £70 a hour which is laughable. As Power of Attorney I am paying the sum from mum's bank account but with great sadness. I find the whole thing totally unethical and greedy, particularly as my brother will benefit from a substantial sum in the will. I think my mum would be heartbroken if she realised his plan. My brother is wealthy and has a very senior professional job. Any ideas, is this legal, should a daughter-in-law be paid for attending an elderly relative. I am very sad and disappointed...."
"Is this a common thing you all have encountered? My family member says foods she once liked now taste like garbage or she chews and chews til she realizes she just can't swallow, usually things like bread. She can often eat a burger patty but she takes off the bun because she has to chew for so long. Sometimes she will throw up while eating if, according to her, she eats one bite too many. No doctors can figure out what is causing her nausea and gagging (she isn't choking on food, as far as I can tell) but I'm wondering if perhaps the dementia has begun affecting the part of her brain that controls gag reflex or stomach upset.

She takes anti nausea pills and says they help but like I said, it's not always vomiting but just not being able to swallow foods she chews forever and spits back out. And the drastic change in taste. She basically doesn't like any food she once liked anymore so it's getting really hard to find things she will and can eat besides boost drinks.

Any experience with this or advice you can share with me?"
"My mom has dementia. I have no idea what I am doing. She had a doctor's appointment last week and she was having a very clear day, and through the doctor talking to her, they decided that for her to be her safest, she should look into an assisted living facility. We have a couple of really nice senior communities around my area. But I have no idea what I'm doing. What questions should I ask them? What things should I look out for? My coworker said I'll probably need power of attorney, but I don't know what that is, or what needs to be done to get that, or if I need it. I have ADHD and anxiety, so this is all super overwhelming. I don't have any family to get advice from, it's just me and my mom. She has really good days, but her bad days are very scary, and she has been getting a lot worse very quickly. If more background info on her is needed for advice, I can provide any additional details. We've had a pretty rocky relationship, but I just want to show up for her now, and sort my own feelings out later. I really appreciate any advice that can be given."
"So if you read my first post about my mother being put in the ICU [Mom is in the ICU. : dementia (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/smb4l4/mom_is_in_the_icu/) here is an update.  

She recovered enough physically that she has been discharged from the hospital and has been moved to a rehab center.  However, her infection seems to have accelerated her mental deterioration.  She is convinced that everyone is lying to her about what day it is because she can't remember Monday.  She insists that yesterday was Monday and today is Tuesday and she doesn't understand why we don't want to tell her what day it is.  My sister told me that this morning while she was visiting her, Mom was convinced that someone had kidnapped her.  

It's not looking like she will come home.  Unless there is a miraculous recovery, she will probably move to a nursing home when she is done at the rehab center.  Part of me thinks that might be what is best and part of me feels guilty for not being 100% in favor of her coming home.  

Dementia sucks."
"This is a vent.  Please, I'm not looking for solutions right now - just a place to get out the frustration. 

Mom is trying my patience more and more often.  I believe she's in stage 6 and I know she can't help it, and I do well most of the time, but I'm so tired of the constant fighting.  Then after my limit I snap and feel like shit and I **hate myself for it.** 

I ask her to please drink her water because the doctor said she needs to and it's a fight. ""I drink tons of water, the doctor doesn't know!"" but she doesn't unless I give it to her

I ask her to please put her feet up (her ankles and feet swell up a lot) and it's a fight.  ""You don't see how much I do put my feet up!"" but she doesn't really ever do it unless I ask. 

I ask her to go back to bed at 2:30am because it's the middle of the night and it's a fight. ""I'm not tired!"" but she does go back to sleep once I can get her into bed.

I tell her that she absolutely must take her meds and it's a fight. ""I never take pills!"" but she takes them every day

It goes on and on. You all know how it is. 

She's getting mean. She's starting to mock me when I try to help her. She raises her voice at me now.

I'm working with an Elder Care Attorney to get everything all set for when it's time to put her in a facility and sometimes I wish she could just go there now because I'm exhausted and **I hate myself for it.** 

Again, you all know how it is.  The feeling of just wanting it to end and feeling horrible that you do. 

EFF dementia."
"My wife is 38. For the last few years, I have noticed she sometimes will switch words. For example, instead of saying to our daughter “go drain the bathtub,” she might say “go drain the sink.” It happens about once a day, and is noticeable because sometimes it’s hard to figure out what she’s talking about. (“What do you mean, drain the sink, there isn’t any water in it?”)

I have been mildly concerned. But She wasn’t concerned until today. Today, she somehow got times mixed up, put on her coat, and left work an hour early. She said she made two other “dumb mistakes” at work today, but doesn’t want to talk about them. 

It was concerning enough to her that she called a neurologist for an evaluation.

Are these things alone enough to merit concern for some sort of early onset dementia? Or are we getting carried away?"
"I care for my grandma with vascular dementia. 4 years now I've been helping her. Gradual at first. Driving her places, taking her shopping, helping get her to appointments and bible studies. Then she started her decline. Helping to bathe, doing her laundry, getting her dressed, and now even toileting. I've read plenty of stories and heard everyone who said ""We wished they went into a home sooner."" And I think we are to that point. She still likes being social but we don't live in a neighborhood. She goes to a senior day center that she calls ""school"". After more decline and now issues with eating, breathing, and aspirating- I've decided I'm done. I want to enjoy time with her and not dread it. She takes her anger out on me. 4 years she has been threatening to throw me out. Tried to physically fight me on occasion. And last month she told me she wanted to stab me. No idea why. I was cooking dinner and something set her off. 20 mins later she'll be calm and have forgotten the whole episode. But it'll take me days to come down from my hurt and anger that she treats me like this when she is supposed to love me. So I told my Mom (her daughter) that it's time. We would all be happier and feel more free if she was in a facility. We all currently live together as a multigenerational family. But we have dementia, autism, and PTSD all under one roof too. Everything revolves around her and who can watch her, where we can take her, if we need to leave because of her. It has gotten overwhelming.

I also think we are going to refer to it as ""boarding school"" since she likes ""school"" so much. And once we decide on one or 2- take her to tour and see what she thinks. Then she can finish her time at the current school out and graduate to the new school. I don't know if any one has used this line of thought. But we are going to try it."
"Background: I am the caretaker of my friend C, a 78 year old man with Dementia. I am very close with and work alongside his bio son who is power of attorney and between us, we handle C's life for him. 

About two years ago we went through all of C's credit cards and shut them down, or so we thought.  There were about two cards that we did not know existed and subsequently missed paying them off and shutting them down. The initial charges were small, about $100, but the late fees really piled on.

These cards over the past two years have substantially destroyed C's credit. We are worried that this destroyed credit will ruin his availability to get in to a nursing home of his choosing, which is a scenario that is approaching quickly. Do we have any availability to challenge these credit damages, on the grounds that C's Dementia has taken away his comprehension? How does this work? Do we have any options to get back his previously stellar credit score?"
"      Over the years I have watched Dementia slowly change my grandmother. 
Right before Christmas the final stage started as well as a severe drop in her kidney functioning. Those two combined (End Stage Dementia and going into kidney failure) and overnight it seems the person I once knew was gone.  The changes were noticeable enough. I knew it was coming but no amount of reading up on things and knowing what to expect can honestly prepare you for the moment when the scales truly tip.
 Nights like tonight. When I can't calm her down. When I can't reassure her that she's OK she's safe she doesn't have anything to worry about , are the hardest. 
     How do you comfort someone who doesn't even know who you are? They don't trust you because they don't know you.  Or even worse they think you are someone who has actually done them wrong in the past. 
   They don't believe anything you say because the reality they are living in is all their own. They are stuck in the worry and anxiety they have created for themselves simply because they have lost their grip on the true reality of things and there's no way to show them anything different. No matter how hard you try. You can't convince them of anything. There's no reasoning there's no explaining there's nothing. 
So you turn to medicine but they won't take it. Because they don't trust you. They know something is wrong. Something is off but it's not them (to them) so it must be you. The only person here. The person here 24hrs a day 7 days a week taking care of them as if they were a 6 month old baby. Bathing feeding changing walking them through every day tasks like it's their 1st time experiencing it. 
OK... 
 So you call the hospice nurse and they send someone out at 1:30 in the morning with a cream form of the medicine. Just rub it in like lotion on the wrist. Ok got it. Let's hope it works. She needs to sleep. I need to sleep. But let's be real even if I get sleep it's not good sleep. Oh well at least it's something. We will go with that.  
      Good days and bad days. And then the bad days start out numbering the good days. And it sucks. 
It's cruel. Dementia is cruel. To the person experiencing it and the people trying to care for the person with it. Especially when it's a family member. I hate it.
It crushes me. But this isn't a battle you win. So you do your best to just roll with the punches until it's over. It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to deal with. 
     I'm trying to stay strong. But nights like this all I can feel is sadness. 
 All I can do is hope  that tomorrow will be one of the good days."
"Now that the hard work of caregiving and finding a placement for him is mostly done, other family members have begun to show up and make plans to visit. It's shocking how we didn't hear from them for months and years, and now here they come. If my daughter hadn't kept him alive during the pandemic and his galloping dementia, they'd have no dad and grandpa to come see.

Okay, I can deal with my feelings about that. But *they are not vaccinated* and are *not reliable about wearing masks*. 

The facility where he lives requires masks and temperature screening when you arrive, but there is no monitoring after that.

Has anyone stood in the way of a family member wanting to visit during the pandemic? My daughter didn't give up her life for 7 months to keep him alive so the thoughtless dumbasses could put his life at risk. He is 83 years old, frail and befuddled. *He* was eager to be vaccinated, and got 3.

I'll have to talk to the lawyer; maybe as POA I have some standing to dictate who can see him. This is literally keeping me awake."
"A lot of public libraries now have physical kits to check out, and I know the ones in our area have kits to help with seniors at different levels of dementia and with different themes. Our local library has a kit with a CD player and some oldies music, simple puzzles, cards with prompts on them to get conversations going, and dominoes. 

Not sure if this link is static:

https://ls2pac.splashlibraries.org/?section=resource&resourceid=1176386567

Find out if your local public library has any kits, boxes, or media. They might also have classes, programs or other free resources to offer. 

(If they don’t remember funding is getting cut something serious right now for libraries.🙃)"
"So my dad watched a Netflix movie about an auto-immune disease the other day and has since been fixated on the idea that he has auto-immune and not dementia. It would be lovely if he did, truly, and he's early enough in the degeneration process (mild) that it is possible it may be a misdiagnosis.

&#x200B;

However.

&#x200B;

What I am not okay with is him deciding on his own that he will get a GP to write him a script for prednisone (a corticosteroid) without any diagnostics being run by the specialist (who he will see in May). When he told me he was going to try prednisone, and if a GP wouldn't prescribe it he would get it ""another way,"" all of my alarm bells went off. I then dove down the rabbit hole of what chronic corticosteroid use could do to his brain and guess what? Memory problems (in some cases so bad as to be labelled ""reversible dementia"", but this is a misnomer because it is not always reversible damage) is at the tippy top of the list.

&#x200B;

I can't seem to communicate with him that not only will substance abuse not ever happen in my home, but that odds are very good if he self medicates in this way he runs the risk of accelerating everything he's already fighting against. My dad was a veterinarian for nearly 40 years before retirement so he is clever and knows a lot more about drugs and treatment than a layperson, but he also has a degenerative brain condition. Not looking for solutions, just some sympathy. I know that this is the right community to empathise with what's going on."
"Does anyone know of a support group for teenagers with parents who have dementia? My father has a rare form of dementia (primary progressive aphasia or ppa), I've given up on any hope of meeting someone who's loved one has the same condition. Still I thought it'd be nice to join a support group with people my age, none of my friends understand what I'm going through, no matter how hard they try. I just want someone I can relate to on some level, who understands the pain and hardships that come with the loss that is having a parent with dementia."
"I have sung the wonderfulness of this sub reddit to anyone who’d listen. I don’t know how I would have coped til now without you all. Thank you dear fellow dementia supporters / carers for being the most compassionate non judgemental people.

My mother passed today at 5am. 85 vascular dementia. She stopped eating and developed a serious bedsore. I’ve had a lifelong complicated relationship with her due to her narcissism and physical abuse when I was young. But that woman gave birth to me she’s still my mum / mom

We were not close but I looked after her and made sure she had the best care possible.  I fought off several scammers and managed her complicated estate all the while suffering her vitriol 

And yet  I feel so damn guilty so damn guilty for not visiting her in final days just one more time. I visited her last in December to say my goodbye as she was in palliative care. I held her hand I kissed her told her I loved her. It was a good visit she was cold but not awful.

How do you deal with the guilt of end of life by the bed absence?"
"My dad thinks there's nothing wrong with him, so I don't know where to start. He isn't himself anymore, he has major memory lapses. A couple days ago he said he was with my brother, who hasn't lived in the state in years. We had to call 911 two days ago because he was screaming fuck you and shut up at 1am when no one had been talking too him, I asked who he was screaming at and he told me I was a bitch and I made him this way by waking him up at night. I was in bed until he started screaming, and he was definitely awake because he turned and pointed at me when I came in. This isn't the first time we've called 911, the other times in the past few months he was extremely aggressive and threatening to kill us. This time he was threatening to kill himself if we kept ""pissing him off"" when we weren't talking to him. He'll be fine later and can't remember what he did clearly, unless he's lying which wouldn't make sense because he's never been like this in my life. He's never screamed at me or called me names until he started getting confused. He can't remember the names of things, and sometimes can't even find the words to describe them, and then yells at us for not knowing.

I'm mentally ill already, this is way too much for me to handle. We tried to get him hospitalized when he was threatening to kill himself, but in the emergency room he couldn't understand why they thought he was suicidal. I just can't handle living with him anymore, and I feel bad for it but he was pretty absent and I don't feel like I owe him my life. I can't do this without relapsing, me and my mom aren't capable of taking care of him. I don't want to make him worse, and I don't want to lose all my progress in treatment. 

We have no money, he has no retirement fund and he's still a couple years too young to retire anyways. He needs to get treatment that we can't give him, what do we do? I can't keep calling the police on him every time he wants to kill me or himself"
"My 78-yr-old mother has a habit of forcibly pushing air out through pursed lips with every breath. Every...single...waking...breath. It is constant and drives us all crazy. Her doctor said it's just a tic and there's nothing we can do about it.  

Has anybody experienced similar? And more importantly, has anyone figured out a coping strategy for her caregivers?  
 
The one positive aspect is that we can always hear where she is, so there's less worry about her wandering off unobserved."
"Today was the 1st time I couldn't get my great uncle to see his Dr. We went into the waiting area and as soon as the nurse called his name, he bolted from me to quickly walk out to the car and refused to go back in. I had to cancel his appointment that he very much needed. I feel like I'm failing him in this way. If anyone who has any tips,advice or suggestions I will appreciate it. Thank you."
"hey you guys. thank you for filling this space with life. i do have a question and would be so thankful for resources / opinions / tips. (english isn’t my first language so sorry in advance for any mistakes.)

so my mum is in an early dementia state. we’re still in the process of finding out what exactly is going on, but that’s not the point here. i‘m starting to inform myself, try to learn how to deal with her in a way that makes it easier for everybody. also try to get my family to go that road with me. i worked in a home for the elderly for a few years and i think i got a good idea of what is helpful: agreeing with her, supporting her, connecting to her world, stuff like that.

the thing is: i got sooo much anger. i love her, but she is a narcicisst (of course resulting from her own family trauma) and everything was always about her. i supported her when her parents died when i was 13. i was always the strong one in our family, the smart one who knew how to resolve things. i can’t seem to get over this and i am sooo angry that now she has a disease that makes everything about her AGAIN. these feelings really get in the way of being there for her and finding adequate ways to cope. i feel so ashamed admitting this. i am in therapy and all, but honestly, i‘m making baby steps on this one. so i thought i‘d ask you guys if maybe some of you experienced this and how you dealt with it. i know many people have complicated relationships with their parents :-) 

thanks in advance and have great day!"
"His diagnosis of Vascular Dementia was in January 2018. My eldest son summed it perfectly: ""Pappy is saying a long goodbye."" 

&#x200B;

We were fortunate in that throughout his confusion, dad mainly grasped that while he might not know us, we knew and loved him. We were fortunate that he was able to be cared for in his own home. In the last few months, when dad refused point blank to shower, a great team carers called in every morning & thankfully succeeded in encouraging dad to shower. 

&#x200B;

An infection of the lungs saw him admitted to hospital the first week in January 2022. Four years after the initial diagnosis. The doctors, nurses, therapists, and nursing assistants could not have looked after him better, or tried harder to get him well enough to return home. They were wonderful, and allowed us to visit everyday,

My mum, his bride of over sixty years, God bless her, had difficulty coming to terms with his illness. It broke her heart when he couldn't remember her, and insisted he ""had to go home now, to his lovely wife."" It broke our hearts to witness her grief. It's going to be so hard on her. I'm feeling blessed that my siblings, their kids, and my kids are all determined to support her & do what we can to help her feel less alone. 

&#x200B;

It feels so strange. My dad has been our family's rock. Almost to the last, he was saying ""let me know if I can do anything to help."" I loved him so much but accepted he was leaving us. Now he's gone. I thought I had already grieved for our loss, and we had all the opportunities in the world to say a final goodbye, and tell him we loved him, but it still hurts. 

&#x200B;

To all those accompanying a loved one on this traumatic rollercoaster of a journey, I hope you have support in place, either from family or carers, and sincerely hope you take every opportunity to find a few pockets of peace.

To the Mods: I hope this is allowed. Also, I want to say how I appreciate this sub, and being able to share experiences, frustration, and grief. Thank you all."
"Today is the day we move Mom to assisted living. The last few years have been on a decline but since January 1 it’s been decided that we  are moving to my hometown and then assisted living. 
Getting ready I’ve had over 10K steps a day by noon three days in a row. Ex bf lent me truck, ex husband dropped some foods for us to help
Me cook less. My friend is helping me with
Mom. It takes a village!! 

Buying furniture building ikea organized her space it’s not done and we leave for the facility in 30 minutes. 
Fingers crossed it goes well. Please everyone pray for us"
"For background, my 82 yr old MIL has dimentia (I don't know the specific level or formal name). She isn't able to drive, cook, she forgets names, she can't be left alone,etc. She lives 1000 miles away and we haven't been able to spend much time with her over the past few years. 

The past few years have been tough, but the past few months have been extremely challenging for her. She lost her husband two weeks ago and because of her condition we decided to sell her house and move her into a memory care facility. Because we live out of state, living with her is not an option. As I write this it sounds horrible that we haven't included her in the detailed conversation, but she wasn't able to understand and contribute to conversations with her husband and family months ago.

My wife and family quietly packed up part of her house without discussing it with her until the end. They explained that she was moving to a place where she can be cared for and safe. My wife and her flew to our house and told her that she was staying with us for a while. The reality is that we're getting her place at the memory care facility ready for her to move in shortly after her things arrive. 

She only remembers a few pieces of the conversation (s) about moving, and incorrectly remembers the details frequently. She will tell us that someone (she knows it was family but doesn't remember who) came in last week and started packing up the house. Then she said that someone told her that she was moving but she didn't have other details. 

My wife will explain that they packed up their house and they're trying to figure out the best place for her to live. Luckily, she understands that she can't stay in her house alone which is very helpful. 

This conversation happens again and again and again. My MIL brings this up somewhere between once an hour and as frequently used every five minutes. My wife had that conversation 10 times in less than an hour and a half tonight. She also wakes my wife up multiple times per night to have the same conversation. 

How can we either help her understand and remember the plan, or reduce the frequency of having the same conversation? We have been truthful with her about the plan (except that we have decided on moving her to a facility) but she forgets within minutes....not sure what to do from here."

"Husband worked today, worn out, sleeping in a chair in the living room while I watch the Super Bowl. Mother-in-law toddles in with the art project she made at the senior center. She leans over my husband with the construction paper envelope, explaining to him that it needs to be fixed. He tries to wake up but can't. She takes a couple of steps and aligns herself perfectly between me and the TV screen, mesmerized by the half-time show. She sways and bobs to the beat. She turns around and holds out the paper and asks where the stapler is. I get up, take it from her, find the stapler, affix the name plate that had come loose, give it back to her. She's delighted and takes the envelope, moving off down the hall, talking to -- who knows? -- the universe, I guess -- about how it's fixed now.  Leaves the actual craft behind.

It's so much like living with a three year old that it's creepy. I just wish she enjoyed bath time as much as the kids did at that age.

"So let's set the the table, as my folks used to say.... I(28m) here am completely in over my head and hanging on by a thread.
Here's the timeline. December 28 2021 the man that raised me, my grandfather who was only 55(he married into the family when my mom, his step daughter, was 9) I haven't lived with them in some years now but after his passing I was shutdown for a little while, testing positive for Covid and Flu January 10th doesn't help either. Well, my mom volunteered to take care of my grandmother and my grandfather's lingering affairs(mostly bills as he'd just moved to a new house 2 hours away as opposed to living 20 minutes away) he kept their health to himself and shouldered the burden... well fast forward to 2 Mondays ago my mom decided to decieve me by asking me if I could watch my grandma for 4 hours, I of course agreed since I'd just tested negative, this turned into ""I can't keep her in my house anymore, I just can't deal with the dementia."" Knowing I'm the last close living relative my grandmother has, however I live in a 3 bedroom apartment with my girlfriend(35) and her 2 kids (9, 12). My grandfather's affairs including their house still up in the air, my grandmother's health history up until last Monday on a doctor's appointment was a complete mystery to me. Idk where to start I'm struggling just to get her to shower and eat (she's still completely physically capable)"
"My 88yo mother with deteriorating mental functionality can't make calls on her flip-phone.

My sister says, ""We should get her an iPhone!""

I actually burst out laughing when she said that.  My sister also wants us to buy all of my mother's food at Whole Foods, buy all of her clothing at L L Beans, etc.  No expense too high, that my sister isn't paying.

OK, but I'm getting cynical.

Dementia caregivers -- have you had any luck introducing a smart phone to your caregivee?

I know smart phones are intuitive.  I'd be lost without mine; it's my memory, my schedule, my GPS, my contact list, my entertainment, etc etc etc.

But is my mother going to be able to figure out how to ""wake up"" a smart phone, then what to press to find the phone, then what to press to find the right person she wants to reach, then what to press to make the phone call?

What do you think, DCBT?

"How do I make her stop sending away for subscriptions? How can I make the junk mail stop???

She is mildly impaired and loves to send away for subscriptions and anything that says it’s “free to try, send back if dissatisfied”….  She is in an independent community so I can’t monitor everything. At least she saves all the mail for me, with invoices and other bills mixed up, put in the wrong envelopes. And I don’t understand how I swear I get it all one week and the next week come back to a duplicate bill from 3 months ago. 

Can I just ignore all these invoices? It is exhausting piecing it all together and either paying or trying to cancel them time and time again."
"My 93 year old grandmother was diagnosed with alzheimers nearly a year ago but the last 3 months or so she has been rapidly deteriorating. For a few weeks, she had become very aggressive and was having trouble sleeping. Because of this, her doctor prescribed her antipsychotics. When my mother told me this i was immediately put off. I’m not a doctor, but I work in pharmaceuticals, and I have my own mental health issues as well as friends with psychotic disorders, so I have done extensive research in the field and like to think I know a good amount. These drugs are designed to block dopamine receptors in patients who have overactive or irregular dopamine production in their brain. Alzheimers and dementia have nothing to do with overactive dopamine production, they just prescribe this to sedate aggressive or unpredictable patients. My grandma stopped being aggressive, but it is CLEAR she is experiencing all of the negative side effects of the drug. She is constantly confused and almost never knows who is around her or whats happening, she is always tired and sleeping, and can barely speak anymore. My mother seems to think every time she remembers something, thats the antipsychotics working. I’ve explained to her that the drugs mechanism of action simply CANNOT make her memory better, and if her memory is getting better it is DESPITE the antipsychotics, not due to them. She wont listen to me and refuses to hear anything I have to say, because “doctors are always right.” Im at my wits end and im afraid my grandmother is going to die sooner because of these drugs. Ive even considered calling the doctor and speaking to him directly. What can I do? I would rather have a slightly aggressive grandmother with most of her memories in tact, than a zombified sedated confused grandmother."
"My father is about 5 years into Lewy Body Dementia. He is completely immobilized but does have a surprising about of alertness. He is “not there” a lot but I also am suspicious that he is flat out bored. He watches TV all day everyday. The same shows. From when he was a middle aged man. He is a man of few hobbies to begin with, but he loved to gamble and play cards. 

Before I even suggest this, I was hoping to get some people who know to weigh in on an idea and how to carry it out.

I was thinking maybe he could at a good time have enough alertness to play a little blackjack. He can’t sit all the way up so I would need to hold or suspend his cards up so he could see them. I could be wrong that he could try it and it would be upsetting. Or just the logistics could make something enjoyable like this to be stressful. 

His memory is truly confusing to me, and I’m sort of new coming into the picture but he can forget immediate things, but does know I’ve been here for two days and who I am. He remembers he was a musician, the instruments he played, but no idea what songs he played. We were estranged for many reasons for over 20 years, but he knows exactly who I am at all times. 

Any ideas?"
"Hi

I made a  chess inspired memorisation game on the browser. You get to see a chess position for a certain amount of time, once the time is up, some pieces will be removed and you have to reconstruct the position from memory by dragging pieces. I think this small game could be beneficial for dementia patients, especially when they like chess, id love to have some feedback on this.

"My father's cognition has been deteriorating steadily over the past few years, but when (and after) he was in the hospital last summer, I noticed a sharp decline. The last seven months have been a particular living Hell. His care team and I had been trying to persuade him to accept some form of home support so that he could be wait-listed for assisted living, all to no avail. Whenever the subject came up, it was always ""I'll think about it."" He said much the same thing when I suggested he get a TV, or a microwave... I'm not sure if it has been the dementia, natural stubbornness, or him trying to cling to the little control he has left.... Sometimes I even wonder if his refusal to eat adequately (he's skin and bones and claims to have no appetite) is a part of trying to control something.

A couple of weeks ago, though... everything accelerated.. As you may have surmised, he has been living alone, and to date, he was, more or less, coping... kind of... maybe. I wish I could have him live with me, but, for various reasons, that simply isn't an option... In addition to seeing him once a week, I was phoning him every day... On January 29, he didn't pick up the phone. Since he was sill going out to do his own shopping, I wasn't *too* worried at first, but I after trying to call again a couple of times, I knew something was very wrong, so I called a cab to his place, and let myself in. I found my father, bruised, and bleeding in places, on the floor of his bedroom, semi-conscious.... Immediately I called 911, and he has been in the hospital since. Apparently he suffered an Nstemi ... we're not sure if his fall caused the heart attack, or if the attack caused the fall... Until this evening, when he called me from the hospital, he thought he was on a boat after having been on some kind of a trip... This time, though, it was a lot worse... he accused me of locking him up ""on the boat,"" along with a lot of really hurtful stuff... and I just couldn't reach him.... couldn't make him understand I'd found him on the floor... 

Last week, I met with his care team, and they have determined, after observing him in hospital that he has reached another lower baseline of cognition... They feel (and I concur) that it is no longer safe for him to be alone, so when he is released, he'll be getting live-in support, which means I need to acquire a bed for the homecare worker and place it in his living room/dining area, and make it relatively private.. 

All things considered... I'm *extremely* worried at how this is going to go... My father is stubborn, fiercely independent... Also, when he was young.. he climbed mountains as a hobby... and being a marine engineer gave him considerable freedom of movement, not just in his profession, but also because he could pick and choose where he lived (we moved around a lot...)

Just...seeing him like this....it's.... the worst thing I have ever experienced, and it's tearing me apart at every level... I'm a pretty secular person, but... honestly, if there is such a thing as Hell.. this is it. I doubt I need to tell anyone here that, though..."
"I made a post some time ago about my grandmother having a really ugly fit, wanting to get out to the house and to another that doesn't exist anymore. But fortunately my dad actually made something for her and took her to a new doctor that gave her new medication, and her levels of anxiety and that stuff got down, and she's pretty calm. And now, after months of this, she has started to do a real unusual thing: I think she's ""touching herself"" (if you know in what sense I'm talking). She touches herself and mumbles to herself, even when all of us are around, but I never can listen clearly to what she's whispering (and to be honest, I don't want to). It's really uncomfortable, and none us talk about it because... I don't know, it's such a weird thing and it's often too."
"My dad passed away this morning. I think it was the best exit we could have hoped for. He just sort of stopped eating last week, closed his eyes, and never really woke back up. Hospice was wonderful and did everything they could to make him comfortable, so I don't think he really suffered on his way out.

I'm depressed but relieved - Lewy Body took so much from him and made him suffer so much, and he was already, in many respects, gone well before this. So I'm glad he's no longer trapped in its claws. But I'm sad because he didn't deserve any of this and now I REALLY don't have a dad.

In sum, fuck dementia."

"I've watched like an hour of these videos and my main takeaway is ""be sweet, gentle, don't rush, don't get cross, try to figure out why she's upset, slowly guide her....""  It doesn't matter how gently and sweetly we try redirect or to massage her into the correct choice to alleviate her discomfort (like accepting pain medicine or letting us change her diaper). We can spend 2 hours sweetly and gently meandering our way to the action point. She directly goes to ""NO"" and as soon as we take any actual action no matter how gently, she still goes straight to calling us liars, screaming TAKE ME HOME, CALL THE COPS, THEY'RE POISONING ME, stiffening her muscles, ""kicking"", scratching. And this was around noon today, when we're supposed to get her awake to avoid oversleep and then sundowning. I'm so tired."
"My grandpa(81) was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and put on quetiapine (50mg) and two other drugs I don’t know the names of. 
I visited them today and he asked “where’s the boy?” I don’t have brothers, neither does my mom, I’ve never brought boys in the house so there’s no “boy” he could’ve asked for. Is this normal? He used to only ask about where his dead mother and grandma was but never this."

"A bit of background - I'm 28m, working as a surgical trainee about 300miles from my parents. My brother 32m (only sibling) lives a similar distance and is finishing a PhD, he is lovely, but has a history of severe depression and struggles to deal with negative emotions. My dad has early dementia, just about holding onto a part time job but is in complete denial.

My mum and I have been trying to help dad and gently suggest he should get the last scan. My brother is aware and we don't hide anything but also we don't actively talk to him about it. The vague plan is once I get a reg job (same training region for 5 years) my parents will move to be near me (I can't afford to live where they do). 

Just had phone call with my mum - she was saying how dad's getting worse etc. I asked her how she is doing, she broke down in tears. I try to come home minimum once a month for a weekend (I work 1/4), we call every weekend and I try to call midweek to say hi. 

I'm planning on asking mum about possible depression this week (exam so I'm down there). Is there anything else I can do? I'm trying to organise a trip for us to go to Kew Gardens as we both enjoy plants but that won't be for months. 

I just feel somewhat useless - I barely see my new gf anyway due to where we live. But I feel like I need to be home more to help my parents. 

Any advice? 

Tldr what can I do to help my mum deal with dad's early dementia (on denial)."
"I know I post in here a lot but need to vent somewhere...my dad had a bad day he pooped himself and had to be washed. It upset my mom a lot. Since my wedding the 11th of December he has just gone down. Gotten worse, more confused..more falling, peeing more on the floor then in his commode. Looking more and more out of it. He also had a bad chest always sounds breathless..he takes a puff for allergies and puff for astma, we have tried cough medicine and antibiotics. .nothing works...he keeps coughing but never coughs out mucus saying he is too weak. My mom refuses to accept that my dad has dementia and gets very angry at my dad when he does stupid things saying he does it on purpose, he just laughs. I have accepted my dad won't get better, i have accepted he won't be the same dad anymore, but that does not mean that i like seeing him like this. It hurts and breaks my heart. I feel so overwhelmed and depressed."
"I know this group is good for learning of other experiences. So I'd love to know what this might mean. And what your experiences are. My grandma's health history are of what follows:

My grandma, has macular degeneration in her eyes. She has been getting treatment for it, which is a needle in the eye full of whatever medication and it's kept her sight going years longer, she would of been completely blind by now.

She hit her head on a tile floor 3 years back causing a skull fracture where she went through delirium afterwards due to a massive sodium imbalance. A normal blood sodium level is between 135 and 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). She hit 111 at one point where 110 you will go into a coma (it was a battle, a tough one that really made things difficult at home, she lives with us and we take care of her). She had dementia before this for many years but after this injury it definitely has sped up in progress. and she has to have sodium medications to keep her levels up for the rest of her life.

She also was 91 when she found out she has ciliac disease. Which is handled quite well

-------
Now done with all this medical background, and moving forward.

My grandma who is 95 now, was rushed to the hospital on  Sunday Feb 6th with stroke like symptoms. Slurred speach, couldn't form a conversation, started talking about herself in third person I think allowed her to talk a bit better. Called the ambulance, and one of the police trained medical professionals showed up did some tests, checking the blood levels/etc. 

What indicated its not a mini stroke (which that's what appeared to be what she was having) is my grandma's automated response to ANY DOCTOR where she sounds 100% normal, so that means she's still aware of some things going on. (she's like a kid, too afraid to tell the doctor she's not ok, almost like she's scared to be scolded) basically the conversation was this:

Paramedic: ""How are you feeling?"" 
Gram: ""oh great, I'm just fine, 100%!"" 
""No problems?"" 
""No, don't know why youre here, I feel wonderful!""
""Do you know what year it is?""
""..... Yeah...... Um........... September?""
""How old are you?""
""Um..... Its a big number................. I don't know....""
Few minutes later we have now 3 paramedics, two of which are from the ambulance that arrived, so they start conversing about the situation my grandma then want to talk to them, as she's sitting on the couch:
Gram: ""Hey doctor?""
Paramedic: ""Yes?""
""I'd like, um, when, like, um, uh, when? Ok is it? Um..""

She couldn't respond to questions that weren't related to how she felt, and she couldn't make sentences on the spot. They took her in, where she did make a recovery at the hospital.

They found nothing in cat scans, or anything unusual, sugar levels were somehow normal (she can go through a small bag of sugar in less than a week) her sodium level did drop to 131 (where she can go into a very mild state of delirium however, during delirium episodes she can still form sentences even when it hit a level of 116 so that wasn't it)

No sign of a blood clot on the brain etc... She was fine to go home at around 4am. 

Now visiting the eye clinic to get her shots a couple days later, the doctor there said it sounded like she has vesicular dementia. As this did affect her eyesight a bit when it happened(at least I think it did, she wasn't clear and we couldn't understand her). And he told us a lot of patients that are being treated like she is, have had this happen.

He explained that this could have been a clot (on the way to the brain) that might of limited the flow of blood to the brain. Which in turn leads to the symptoms she had. It can affect various parts the brain, eyes, etc. Leading to sentences not being formed, blindness, and made her incapable of making decisions.

Were still not 100% sure at home what may of happened here, but it does sound like a clot that blocked the passage of blood for a time frame, and she wasn't getting enough to the brain. 

I know I wrote a lot, but it's for a little bit of an understanding and I'd rather not get things wrong. We are talking to doctors next week about this incident, and from the sounds of things this does happen to people who have vesicular dementia. 

Her conginative ability is I'm estimating a range of 40-30% (doc said 30 last time but I think it's higher at home) right now, it was a drop from 60% in a four month period, but it hasn't decreased or increased from what I can tell so far. At least prior to this happening. 

Has anyone had this happen, where someone with vescular dementia suddenly loses cognitive ability in a small period of time. I know id mention this more to a doctor and will be talking to them about it this week, but really I'd like to know more about this by the experiences of others. Like has this happened to a family member? and were they able to come back from it? When this happens could it become permanent? Or is it like a cycle of vescular dementia? 

What have the later stages been like? And what symptoms have you seen towards the end?

My family doesn't want surprises, its been very very difficult, If its a cycle, its not like we're not going to call an ambulance based on responses of Reddit. But I don't really know what the worst can be. what do we really expect towards the end of her life? So we can kind of mentally prepare too. 

Thanks for any response"
"After my experience with my dad who passed from dementia related issues last year.  One of my best friends told me that his mother has been diagnosed with dementia. 

I feel very much compelled to help him because I don't him to go through the problems that I had with my father.  However, in my case I had to deal with my stepmother and half brother.  So my friend has gotten Medicaid for his mother, a Power of Attorney, Healthcare Proxy, and a home aide for his mother.  All which I told him about and he heeded my advice. 

Unfortunately with my father. He never had an aide. No Power of Attorney, only Legal Guardianship which was a pain in the backside. No Healthcare Proxy. No Medicaid.  This was very hard on us. 

So I feel compelled to help those when I hear they have family members recently diagnosed with dementia."

"Just out of curiosity, who here has been trained to cut food up before bringing it to the table, and who has been trained to cut it up at the table in front of the resident (and their neighbours)?

I have been told that cutting it up away from the table protects the person's dignity and makes it less obvious to nearby residents that the individual needs their food to be different. Other people have been told that it's better to cut the food up in front of them so they can see it while it looks ""normal"" and not just a ""pile of mush"".

"My dad has mild dementia and was prescribed Namenda/Memantine 5mg twice a day for 3 months. He tolerated the medicine well without any side effects so the neurologist increased his dosage to 10mg twice a day. His paranoia and memory are much worse since starting the increased dosage.

We let his doctor's office know today...they will let us know how to proceed, but I wanted to ask on here if anyone has had similar observations after dosage increases.

Update: his doctor got back to us today and advised to stop the medicine completely for three weeks to see if the enhanced confusion was a side effect."
"My Dad was removed from his facility two weeks ago and has been in the hospital since. He is moving into a new facility because his old one decided they didn’t want him back due to his irritability and aggression. The hospital didn’t have any issues with him, despite having to keep him to his room, something he hates. But we are moving on to better things, I hope. 

My question is, how I can help him settle into a new place? He isn’t orientated to space and time at all, so he won’t remember his old place at all, but he will know he is in a new place that isn’t “home.” Of course I’m bringing his things, photos, his guitar, and what not. But is there anything else I can do except be there?"
"My mom was the cleanest person ever. She kept her house spotless. She now won't change her shirt for anything. I have begged, pleaded, blocked her from leaving the room (not one of my finer moments I must admit), cried, screamrf (again not my finest moment) and bargained. I might as well talk to a wall. I explained to her that she can have the shirt back once I wash it. Hubby says pick my battles. This is a pretty disgusting battle. The CNA didn't have any better luck than I did. I'm over it. I feel like crying over a dirty shirt but it won't do any good."
"Hello,

&#x200B;

I hope this is a proper place to ask a question like this. I've been researching dementia for some time now, for a writing project. The project itself is written from third-person, from the perspective of several different characters. However, one of these characters is suffering from nerve cell death in their brain for a number of different reasons, and warning signs of early-onset dementia are making themselves present. Everything that I've read about regarding dementia is usually from a third person (even in journalistic form), so I'm having difficulty trying to imagine what it is like to actually \*have\* dementia, making it difficult for me to write from this particular character's perspective. I feel like it would be a little cliche to just go off symptoms as viewed from the third person (I.E. character finds character suffering from dementia wandering around, lost, having forgotten where they are or what they were doing). For example, there is a sequence where the character awakens--as told from their perspective--having forgotten who they are and where they live, but because it's early-onset, the episode doesn't last terribly long before they suddenly have mental clarity and realize who they are and where they are.

&#x200B;

Can anyone explain what it's really like to \*live\* with early-onset dementia? What are these episodes of ""forgetfulness"" actually like, from the perspective of someone actually suffering from the disease? Is it just like that--an episode? Where somebody loses touch of their own reality for a period of time before suddenly ""remembering""? It sounds a little silly, describing it like that, but that's why I'm here asking this question, because I'd like it to not be a silly depiction. I'm also open to any reading material if anyone has any recommendations.

&#x200B;

Many thanks"
"My grandmothers memory has been deteriorating for a while now but recently she has started forgetting a lot of conversations we've had and I'm starting to think she's forgot my visits too. She angry with me all the time, thinks I'm doing nothing to help her but I've been supporting her a lot. She's scared, I understand that but its heartbreaking knowing she is so angry when I'm trying my best. It's just me and her and I'm so out of my depth. We're no where near her needing to go in a home but she says she never wants to and I can just move in with her. But I know there will come a day I can no longer handle it by myself. I'm terrified of the future and I'm worried it's more than just bad memory due to her age."
"My dad caught his pants on fire a few days ago and burned a good part of his upper right thigh and abdominal area. Ever since he got home from the ER (they just patched him up and sent him home. It took less than 2 hours with an ambulance and Uber back) he’s very confused and he keeps asking me where my mom is, he doesn’t want to eat, keeps getting undressed or trying to leave to “go home” and stuff. Before he burned himself, he was able to eat, drink, remember that he lives with sister, watch TV and so on like usual. He knew reality. My sister said it’s been about a year since he was this confused. 

Can an injury cause this? Should we be concerned?"
"It happens every night now, my grandmother keeps trying to stand up, but she cannot since she cant support her own weight, so we have to lift her up many times throughout the day. This isnt an easy task for me or my mother, since grandma is also obese.

She doesnt believe that the house shes lived in for the last 15 years is hers to be in, and she keeps asking to go to the house of dead relatives. 

Both of them refuse to believe that they have eaten dinner, or lunch, or any time in the last week, even though i know they ate. Every night is a bunch of yelling from grandma who is sitting on the ground telling grandpa to help her stand up.

I really wish they both could pass away painlessly, our life would improve so much.

My house is constantly filled with yelling, by grandma or my mother, who absolutely despises the fast that grandmother own children are waiting for them to die to claim any sort of property from them, while she is there to clean and deal with the craziness dementia brings."
We're considering hiring an in home aide that doesn't work through an agency. We've never completed a background check and we're looking for any feedback on the process. Do we need just the SSN and DOB from the aide? what information can we obtain? We are in NY btw.
"Sorry I dont know where to go for question, i don’t understand dementia. im 17 and was adopted by a now 82 year old with dementia. 

Hes throwing away my birth certificate, my driving permit, my social security, some physical records, and even my entire adoption book that told me everything about my biological family. 

he isnt mad at me, he doesnt hate me. why is he doing this and is there anything i can do to stop this? i dont live with him anymore but i was told by someone in his house that he did all that and isnt even explaining why. i cannot bring important stuff like that with me to keep safe right now. i have to go through the process of proving my identity now to get everything back.

he did this same thing a few years ago when his grandson passed, he lived in the house and as soon as he passed, he started throwing away everything in his room in trash bags after everyone had discussed to keep it the same.

his wife is having her important stuff found in the trash and some are even gone for good like physical bank records and her other important pieces of paper like some that are medical. 

thought about hiding these things and locking them up, but his wife is old too and cant move far so it wouldnt be fair to make her go through the extra trouble of hiding things when shes done or unlocking it all the time. is this a thing with dementia? is it common they throw away things that aren’t even theirs? he doesn’t throw away his trash but doesnt have a problem throwing away legal papers.

either are at a point where they need in house care or nursing home. every time i mention dementia people reply with nursing home but that is not nice. he can do basic things on his own still, hes just a bit odd with behaviors like this. the one thing i cant seem to get around. he refuse to get help for his dementia. he is diagnosed but has refused to get tested again to see the progression. is there a way to persuade someone with dementia not to do these behaviors?"
"My dad, like many others, goes in and out of being cogent and/or confusing/confused. But one thing he still does is try his hardest to make everything into a joke. It's one of his strongest personality traits that he hasn't lost.  Today, he caught me by surprise when he was lamenting his lack of strength and getting old (he's 72) and still found a way to make it funny:

""I have to bring a pillow to the dinner table now because I don't have a butt anymore.... So if you find my butt anywhere, please bring it to me and slap it back on!""

Anyone have an extra butt lying around he could use?"
"2022 has not been a good year for my mother.  In addition to having dementia, she tested positive for COVID about a month ago (I did too).  While in the middle of the two week quarentine she fell and couldn't get up.  I had to call an ambulance for her.  Turns out she fractured a vertabrae in her neck, though fortunately no surgery was required and she work a neck brace for a week.  The doctors felt it would heal on it's own.

Meanwhile, she didn't seem to be recovering from COVID.  I was down a few days and now I'm fine, but she continued to cough, have muscle pain, and was very lethargic.  I thought that since she was older, she was just taking longer to recover.

But she kept deteriorating.  She stopped eating. She didn't want to get up and get dressed, which no matter how bad her dementia might be on a particular day, was still something she insisted on doing every day.  But she got more and more confused and lethargic.  She even quit caring about watching tv, which was something she has really insisted on doing the past couple of years.

On Friday, I kept thinking that things were really wrong.  Just a feeling in my mind that something was off.  And Friday evening, she had a siezure.  I called 911, when they arrived, she couldn't support herself, my sister and I had to hold on to her to keep her from slipping out of her chair to the floor.  She was totally out of it.  She wasn't answering any questions, her blood pressure was extremely low, and then she had another siezure while the EMTs were there.

They took her to the ER and she was diagnosed with sepsis, so they admitted her to the hospital.  Early this morning, she got worse and was moved to the ICU.  She was having trouble breathing so they hooked her up to a machine to help with that. Not a ventilator but something else.  Also, her kiddneys are only working at about 15%.  In addition, she is still really confused, she's pulled out her IV three days now.  And she takes off her hospital gown and pees on the floor.  When she got asked if she thought she was in the bathroom when she peed, she had no memory of doing that.

There is a part of me that hopes she doesn't come home.  Her quality of life has declined some much in the past 10-12 weeks, it just breaks my heart.  My father died back in 2001, so she's been alone for 20 years now.  She's so tired, lonely, and exhausted that I just don't know if I might be better for her go on to whatever is next."
"My bride of 50 years has been living with a diagnosis of vascular dementia since 2015. She has been taking memantine since a couple of months before Namenda went off patent, so that’s 6 or 7 years. She recently seems to have progressed stage 5 to stage 6. 

I’m slowly learning to manage the tone of my responses and am trying to remain cheerful. But I am struggling to deal with situations when she becomes delusional. Particularly when she starts gathering clothes and makeup and wants to go to some other “home” that doesn’t exist. I’ve had some success getting her “stay tonight”  but don’t see that as a long term solution. Any help would be appreciated.

Edit: typos


Edit 2: Thanks for all the replies. To date we’ve been largely cruising along for a number of years. Our PCP of course keeps filling the memantine prescriptions (10 mg 2/day), but I suppose we’ve (I’ve) just been waiting for the inevitable. I’ve just recently started to identify community resources since the delusional behavior is new. Before it was just her not remembering - easily manageable. This is a new ballgame. I have reached out electronically this weekend to our PCP, so we’ll see what Monday brings. Thankfully our son has had good luck calming her via FaceTime as he’s 2500 miles away. Again thank you all for the replies."
"My grandma developed dementia about 7 months ago. Her mental state degraded rapidly over a short time. With the help of a nurse and a special diet and therapy her condition seemed to halt. A month ago she got positive of COVID and had severe problems with the lungs and heart. She had to breath with an oxygen apparatus. The doctors told me to be prepared as in 90% of the cases, patients with her health issues rarely survived more than a week and it seemed impossible to save her by medicating her at home. She would have had a slight chance to survive if she was addmited to the COVID special hospital. I strongly rejected and continued to give her the medication at home and monitor her breathing day and night under the surveillance of two private doctors. The therapy did wonders and after a week she got better. Last week she started to remember my name and guessed correctly the month and was fully aware of where she was. She even remembered her closest family members who don't live with us. Today she recalled perfectly the former presidents in our country and I was in tears. One interesting aspect is that she can remember what she had for lunch a day ago(something I can't remember for myself), or what we spoke about during this week. She has trouble remembering her time we went to the emergency when she got COVID, but somehow she still has a few memories. Even her behavior is very calm and very appreciative and totally different from the earlier stage. Of course she has her moments of talking nonsense, confusing the reality with dreams or having visions, but she is in a better mental condition than 6 or 5 months ago. The doctors told me that this is very rare to happen and suspect that her brain got a boost from immune system after getting COVID. Her doctor told me that it is impossible to regain full memory, but not unheard of when patients recover slightly during later stages. I'm still amazed."
"I’m a student from Australia. A few friends and I are hoping to work on a project to assist people living with dementia and their caregivers through a technological solution. Right now we’re hoping to understand more about the experiences of caregivers, and would appreciate if you could fill in this short 3-5 minute survey to help our understanding. 

[https://airtable.com/shrT4l2T9wikoscu2](https://airtable.com/shrT4l2T9wikoscu2)

Thank you so much in advance. If you have any feedback on the survey itself, please let me know in the comments."
"She has pretty rapid dementia. My parents asked me to move home to help with her because Im the most helpful and it's work that I'm good at but I've never seen dementia up close until now. I need some tips on how best to help her along with not letting it effect me. From experience, does anyone have anything they wish they had learned before taking care of their loved one?"
"My dad is 70 years old and was diagnosed with mild dementia mid last year. This has been the most draining and heartbreaking situation to go through for my mom and me. My husband and I are dealing with infertility and I will be finally starting IVF treatments next week. I need to find a way to keep my mind and body relaxed in order to have a successful outcome. The timing of all of this is horrible and I’m just bracing myself for constant bad news. 

He retired in July and had a great career which required him to always have his licenses renewed and memorize things. The fact that his mind has always been so active and now it’s not is so hard to accept. He also has so much anxiety and doesn’t want to do anything. This is so unlike him. Growing up and living at home was always so pleasant. We’d always take family road trips or day trips. Today I told my mom he should no longer drive. 

 How can I possibly stay strong with while he goes through this cruel disease?!"
"I've lived with my grandma my whole life (33 years). She always gave me food, shelter, and even helped pay for college. We are a poor family; in the spring, I will be the first in my family to get a bachelors thanks to her. We've lived in this trailer since I was 1 year old. These days she acts like she's in another world, she cries frequently, she can't form sentences, she obsessively picks at the carpet, she's forgotten her husband (died 1996) and parents and me, and she requires assistance with everything.

Today when I finished feeding her, I asked if she remembers all the times she said, ""I had the best grandma"". She said ""yes"". I told her that ""I think I have the best grandma"". I told her how much I appreciate everything she's done for me in her lifetime and that I love her, and I already miss her so much. Her response was half of an incoherent sentence before she took a bite using her invisible spoon. I told her I would go get her some ice-cream.

I went to the kitchen and bawled my eyes out and still as I type this. I was a robotic, monotone, and mildly autistic person my whole life so being vulnerable is difficult for me. I don't even know why I'm typing this, I guess I just want to hear what everyone has to say and maybe hear some relevant experiences."
"As the title reads my mother in a nursing home is in late stage vascular dementia.

She’s bedridden incontinent refuses to eat but drinks plenty fluid. but refuses protein drinks cos she’s deemed them ‘medicine’. Refuses all oral meds but is on morphine patches.

She’s got a ulcer on her buttocks and it now has puss and a smell is noticeable so sounds like an infection. Palliative team will attend next

I know without a doubt this isn’t due to bad care the home is incredible I’ve seen how they work and they’re not understaffed have t had covid outbreak they manage it well.
They thought she’d pass at Christmas but she made it through no co morbidities either.

Has anyone had experience with their loved one having an infected bed sore?"
"We went to pick her up because she developed some sort of hoarding behavior and couldn't really get into her house anymore. She was apparently sleeping in her car, even in the snow for were not sure how long. 

Now she's visiting us while we try to figure out the best plan for her and she has never been here. 

She's obsessed with finding missing objects. (Delusions or past memories) 

She went walking down our street in the rain yesterday to find a jacket she thinks she thru over the fence at some building that doesn't exist, here anyway. 

We are worried about her safety but also wondering how best to manage her anxiety around this. 

When it's not the jacket its the dogs she left next door or her billfold etc. 

I'm thinking she may have a bit of ocd or hoarding related ocd / obsessive thoughts or fixations. 

Are there tasks we can do or things we can say or medications we can try?"
"I’m in rural Northern California. 

Mom has dementia. Transitioning from stage four to five. 
My sister (who she has cut off and disowned recently because of something that didn’t actually happen - but is 100% real in her mind) and I have talked extensively over the last few years and we made the decision to a) leave her in her home as long as possible, and then b) when she it wasn’t safe for her alone we would put her in care. We were making a plan to rotate staying with her while we arranged that, and help her pay bills with her still being the primary agent. 
Her paranoia and personality shift has now made that impossible. It’s evident I’ll need full conservatorship within the year. Knowing it can take Months . 
now I’m at the stage where I need to take action both financially and medically and i have ZERO knowledge of how that works. I need a social worker or something. RESOURCES. I’ve made calls to a few attorneys for first step consultations, and I contacted “a place for mom” so I can get a list of memory care units to get on waiting lists… but I’ll need to have guardianship before then because she will not go willingly. I don’t want to wait until she’s completely non-compos mentis because I don’t know how well care for her when she’s there and we have to wait months to get in someplace. 
Ghaaas… 
I need a checklist or steps of what to do. 
I need like, a guide or something. 
It’s crazy that this is so complicated and difficult. 
I mean I am willing to do what’s needed… but HOW?"
"*(Dealing with someone with dementia can be dark and isolating.  Sometimes on Fridays we try to look at the lighter side of things.  Sometimes this includes some dark humor, I guess.)*

Mom: ""Stop vacuuming at 3 in the morning!""

Me: I don't vacuum at 3 in the morning.

Mom: ""Then tell your wife to stop vacuuming at 3 in the morning!""

Me: My wife doesn't vacuum at 3 in the morning.

Mom: ""Then LOCK THE DOORS!  Somebody has been coming into the house at 3 in the morning and vacuuming!!""

Me: ...

Me: ...

Me: ...

(I mean, where do you even go with this?)

A few days later, when it rained heavily, our cellar's sump pump went on.  (Old house, leaky cellar, sump pump automatically pumps out the water when needed.)  I'm used to the sound so I didn't think anything of it until finally it clicked, and I was able to convince my mother that this was the sound she heard and no, we really don't have someone breaking in to vacuum at 3 in the morning.

*(To over-analyze this and pretty much kill any humor, this is where my mother goes A -> B -> C but only says C, so it's very difficult to understand why she's saying C.)*"
"Anyone struggling with the decision to place a loved one in care?
I know it’s time but it’s heartbreaking. My beautiful mom is getting worse and losing her capability to choose where she’d like to go
She’s been in the family home until now, however we’re getting to the realization that she needs more care than we can provide.
Any advice or similar experience would be appreciated.

What an incredibly cruel disease.

I wish us all the best with this debilitating illness and the heart wrenching decisions that come with it"
"Does anyone have a getting lost plan?

"I got a call from my moms PT nurse about her blood pressure.  They gave her her Lozartan and I came home from work to monitor it. But as soon as I walked in mom was very aggressive. She has been getting increasingly aggressive over the last few weeks/months. 

Today she was wailing and thrashing my apartment. I walked outside to assure my neighbors that she was not being hurt. As I re entered she was in my bathroom with a bottle of Dayquil in her hand and a bottle of bleach in the sink. I suspect she tried to drink the bleach, but could not open the bottle. Then she started chugging the Dayquil. 
I got it away from her and moved her to bedroom as she hit and scratched me. 
So now she is on a 5150 hold.  But since she has Alzheimers...what can they do? 
I also contacted her neurologist re: medication levels but have not heard back yet.

I don't know what to do anymore. I'm doing this alone.  
In the mean time anything hazardous is being taken away. Plastic utensils and cleaning supplies will be stored in the garage until I can get decent locks for the cabinets. 
Any other tips?"
"So my mother (54) has been shall we say not herself. First notable event was getting into a fistfight with my brother at my other brothers wedding 2 years ago, since then stories of abusing her partner, deep dives into conspiracy theories and lately trying to force my siblings and I to sign up to an anti covid vax group. She also seems to have forgotten I have a 4 month old son she’s seen once. All of this is 100% not who she used to be at all.
Talking to a friend she seems to think it may be early onset dementia. Now neither of us are professionals so I’m left with how do I go about bringing this up with her to get her to go to her gp about it? If done a kinda quick google and she does tick a few of the boxes so to speak, but as we all know Google isn’t an md"

"I'm 32(f) and since we got an early diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia, the plan has always been for my father (62m) to move in with me and my partner when he was no longer able to comfortably drive. He had been travelling in a caravan, trying to enjoy his retirement as best as one can when faced with impending loss of everything that you are.


My mother left him when we got the diagnosis, so she's not an option. My younger brother doesn't own a house to provide for dad. I'm the only option.


I am currently 6 months pregnant with our first child after close to a decade of infertility. Child is both very welcome, very unplanned and terrifyingly inopportune timing. How realistic am I being about the possibility of caring for a newborn, and for my dad at the same time? I also work full time but for the most part dad manages ok by himself during the day.


So far he doesn't have many aggressive episodes so I manage ok, but I don't know how the change in the household (both routine and noise) will or won't trigger him. Would love to hear from folks who have lived through what we are facing.


I don't want to place him in assisted living any sooner than is necessary for him, but I also have no way to know how badly this might go. 

Thanks in advance x"
"Hi all. 

I suspect mom has the beginnings of vascular dementia. Her mother had it, and apparently mom has been running around with unchecked high cholesterol for fifteen years… and she is really starting to do weirder and weirder stuff. Extremely emotional, impulsive, muddied and crazed thinking… bordering on paranoia. Then days where she seems her normal sharp self.

I have been keeping notes for the dr, who wants to run cognitive tests. 

My question is this - I talked to the dr with mom in the room and told the dr about emotional changes, mom immediately got dismissive and defensive. I want to reach out to the dr, tell her that I am keeping notes and that perhaps we should talk separately. I’m just not sure WHEN to reach out. Should I do it now? Wait till the tests? What happens then if mom is NOT diagnosed because it is too early/she is having a “good day”?

This whole thing is freaking me out… input, please! Thank you!"
"How do others deal with sundowners when you live with a parent with dementia? I work nights, get up around 11am, take care of stuff around the house, then work. I’m used to playing music, having friends over, cooking after work. I can understand rearranging my life during the work week, but my dad needs complete quiet and darkness after 4pm during the winter, and that’s been killing me the last few months. 

The slightest sound can send him into an angry episode, and he has no concept of time, so me making dinner at 7 pm is the most insane thing to him. I can’t imagine their is a way to change this, I guess it’s more of a vent."
"New to the sub, and I'm hoping this community might have some insights for us! 
I recently have noticed that my mum (64) is saying a lot of things, multiple things in each conversation, that are demonstrably false. She's always had very different views from me, and she's not highly educated so for a long time I wrote this stuff off as normal. But these days it's becoming more common for these conversations to make her irrationally frustrated and angry. Last night she was spitting venom at dad for not making a recipe for dinner because he said they didn't have the ingredients and she made him list them out and started yelling that she had some of the stuff and he could substitute other things and then threw out some wild stuff like 'dont forget, she was making it for 8 people!!'. These conversations never make any sense, she gets so frustrated when people don't just agree with her and do what she says they should. So I asked my sister, who works as an OT with elderly people, what this might mean. 

Now, she doesn't see them as often as I do, she lives interstate, and she believes that it is dad who is in early stages of cognitive decline but she isn't sure about mum. I spend a fair bit of time with dad, we get along, and I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary. But I get along better with him than I do with mum, and my sister gets along better with mum than she does with dad. Is this playing a factor in all this? Has anyone else had this happen? Also, is there any way of testing our theories? Or do we just have to sit and wait for it to get worse and then somehow try to convince them to bring it up with their doctor?"
"Anyone experience something like this?  

My grandmother is 90, mid-stage, but early-ish mid-stage.  

Just over a week ago, on the 23rd, she went into the hospital.  

It was just a little over 24 hours, and she didn't actually need to be there.  

She woke up with a bad nose bleed around 3am, my grandfather couldn't get it to stop, called for an ambulance.  They were able to get her nose to stop bleeding, but she started going on about being dizzy, she can't sit up, she's going to pass out.  

The thing is, she's known to do this.  She's had a few other mental issues her entire life, and this isn't something new.  My grandfather panicked though, and told them to take her to the hospital.  

Bad choice given what hospitals are like now.  

Long story short, she had to lay on a bed in the hallway from 4 am to 5pm, before finally getting a room.  Had a doctor look at her that night, then again in the morning.  

All that happened is her nose was dry (not surprising they run their heat at 76F at night), and she must have been picking at it.  

Noon the next day, she's back home.  

Since then though, it's like her dementia symptoms have doubled in severity.  

She just lays on the couch most of the day.  She gets completely out of it for hours at a time, like she never has before.  The six months or so, there have been issues with her getting angry when sundowning, but not too severe, and it was only in the evening.

Now, she's getting angry and throwing tantrums in the middle of the day.    

She's began going to bed some nights with her clothes on and insisting they are her pajamas and fighting about it with my grandfather.  She's stopped putting on makeup in the morning or fixing her hair.  She no longer wants to leave the house.  She won't go out for lunch or dinner.  



I told my grandfather he needs to make her an appointment with a doctor, but this seems so weird.  

Her dementia has been a slow and steady progression over the past five years, with some plateaus for several months here and there.  

But now, for some reason this 30ish hour hospital stay, which was for nothing serious, has triggered her to the point where her symptoms are more like someone who is entering the late stage. 

At first we thought maybe she was just a bit frazzled from the experience.  I probably wouldn't be in a good mental state if I was stuck in a hospital hallway for 13 hours with nothing to do.  

But she's still like this 7/8 days later, and seems to be getting worse.  



Has anyone experienced something similar to this with a family member?"
"She asks me about what day it is multiple times a week, she tries to microwave food with the door open while yelling it does not work. She calls repairman and when they can not find anything wrong , they leave she called  4  electricians in 2 days. She wants the deck repaired I got her a few phone numbers she called a couple to come look at it, at least one called back she would not talk to them because she did not want the deck repaired that day.  We have a freezer full of chicken she buys pre cooked chicken and thinks they need to be cooked for over a day in the crock pot., they end up being thrown away because nobody eats them after a week.  She tells me does not know the last time she took her pills almost daily and does not know why they were prescribed?

Does she have to get lost or something big before something can be done?

I have colon cancer and needed rides and other stuff for the last 7 months , but I need more peace than I will ever have around her. If I get worse we would both need more help than the other one could provide."
"I am unable to work full time because I am caring for my mother who was recently diagnosed with dementia. Is there some sort of assistance the government provides caregivers that aren't able to have their own income due to situations like this?

Also, what type of power of attorney do I need, and are there any other documents I can get taken care of that will help me properly handle her situation in the future? 

Basically I am just trying to prepare as best I can for whatever is coming. I'm already on her bank accounts as a second signer, and she has a will and her funeral wishes in writing and the costs prepaid etc. I just assume there are things some of you may have wish you'd known before it was too late or a huge hassle. 

Any advice in that regard would be much appreciated. Thanks for answering so many of my questions already, thankful for this sub."
"That's all.

I needed someone to say this to me, and there's no one to say it at the moment, and it occurred to me that just about everybody here knows what I mean and needs to hear it too.

We got this."
"Just some idle thoughts on a Monday.

Before my dad was diagnosed, the idea I had of dementia was of someone just getting gradually but peacefully more forgetful.  A slide into dottiness, let's say, and a loss of ability to take care of themselves. Awful, of course, but the main burden on the caregiver would be seeing to their needs. 

I had no idea that feeding my dad or making sure he took his meds would be the absolute LEAST of our problems. I had no clue about the bizarre behavior that was in store, of the anger, the paranoia, the accusations, the aggression, the obsessive-compulsive behavior that turned every attempt to provide any kind of care into, potentially, and hours-long battle. I had no idea of how utterly relentless that behavior would be, day and night. I had no idea how my dad would turn into someone I no longer recognized, and not because he forgot me, but because he did things - awful, scary things - I would never have imagined he'd be capable of doing. 

And no one with that knowledge warned us about any of it. All the neurologist warned us about was that he might hallucinate, and if he did, there were meds for that. She didn't point us to resources. I googled for them myself. She handed out pamphlets but the pamphlets didn't say a damn thing about how our loved one was going to lose their minds in a way more reminiscent of severe mental illness than mere dottiness. I did find resources online and started to get an inkling, but that was only through support groups like this.

Do we just not, as a society, want to talk about this at all, to the extent that doctors won't even tell the truth for fear of spooking the patient or family? I think that's the case, but that leaves us all to stumble through this blind, not knowing what to expect and being blindsided by the reality of it. Has anyone had a similar experience? And if this is how it works, how do we change it? Can we change it, or will any attempt at raising dementia awareness fall on deaf ears, because no one WANTS to hear about what it's really like unless they have to know because, hey, they're in it up to their necks?"
"Our journey just got a little more complicated - Mom's having problems with soiling herself. This just started and I'm at a loss about the logistics of dealing with it in a way that allows her to keep her dignity as much as possible. She lives in a Memory care facility and it's a nice place, we take her out a couple of times a week for lunch or ""shopping"". I also take her to a local park/garden and we walk. However, with this new twist I'm not sure how to handle it. 

First off - diapers. So far I don't think she's full-out having bowel movements in her pants, although I can't swear to it. She just told my father about this yesterday. We thought it had happened before but it was sporadic. What is a good option for this type of incontinence? 

Also - I haven't changed a diaper in 22 years (my youngest child who is now an adult). Is the procedure pretty much the same sans changing table? If you're out with your LO and this happens, how do you handle it? I don't want to shame her if we have to change her diaper when she's out, or just leave and take her back to the MC to handle it if I can avoid it - that would seem punitive for something that's out of her control. 

If you are able to change the diaper, what the heck do you do with it if you're out? 

Any tips, ideas, assistance would be highly appreciated. Thank goodness for this sub - you all are a godsend to me.

TIA."
I'm wondering if care homes for patients with dementia are covered by medicaid/insurance typically or if it's all out of pocket. I'm trying to determine if when the time comes all my mother's savings will just be sucked up or if she will have some of her stay covered.
"Can it stay at a certain stage? Does it have to? Idk how exactly it works, but does it always have to end in death?"
What signs or situations made you realize they weren't able to live alone?
"My father has early onset (under 70) dementia, but my mother has no cognitive difficulties at all. He's probably middle stage and starting to really struggle, but my mom understandably doesn't want to give up parts of her own life. She wants to go on an overseas vacation with him, and with my family (and kids), over the summer, and I'm really worried because of how hard a time he has with new environments. She seems determined to do this and deal with the consequences, but I'm worried this is going to be a form of torture for him.

Has anyone done any sort of major travel with an elderly family member with dementia? Is this a terrible idea and something I need to discourage her from?"
"I dont know why I'm so sad. She got the diagnosis in December and selected a home for herself. She knows she can't live alone anymore. 

All I can think about is myself. I dont have a mommy anymore. I can't ask her for advice or go home to her house. I'm only 30, she is 67. The youngest person in the home. We have to take care of her now."
"So my great grandmother hasn't been diagnosed clinically with dementia, but we're 99 percent sure she having early stages of it.

Sometimes she'll ask us who lives in the house with us, where she is, that the house doesn't actually feel like our home. She's having a hard time recognizing voices aswell"
"My grandmas mental state has declined so rapidly in the last month. She has been fine living in her house with cameras that we set up for the last couple years (front yard, back porch, living room/kitchen, no bedroom or bathroom). This month it seems like she changes each week, getting so much worse. She’s gotten a lot angrier and keeps telling us she’s got all these children she has to care for. Shes forgetting to eat and becoming a lot more hostile towards us. 

We’ve been weighing our options and sending her to a facility is the best way because she needs 24/7 care. It breaks my heart knowing what has to be done but she needs the help. My mom and aunts are dragging their feet because my papa passed after being in a facility for 6 months. They worry putting grandma in one will kill her quicker than her staying in her home. 

What’s the least painful way to approach this?"
"My Nanna is not a typical case as her dementia is secondary to a nuerologocal disease (Progressive Supranuclear Palsy). She is being cared for by palliative care and nursed for at home by my Mum and myself. Lately, as her dementia has progressed, I'm not sure if she is hallucinating or filling in the missing parts of her memory with what she thinks is should/could be. Like, she sees someone in a hi-vis workshop and decides its her favourite son. But then she comes out with whole narratives about how my cousins (who she shan't seen in months) have new jobs or their exes are after them etc. It leaves Mum and I saying WTF a fair few times each day lol"
"I haven’t spoken to my father in over a year, and he lives in another state. I recently called him and he mentioned his home is filled with over a 100 ghosts, he explained that other people can’t see them, but they sit in his chair go through walls and they sometimes look like a swarm of flies and turn into ghosts. He also mentioned he has started playing publishing clearing house sweepstakes and won 14 million but he hasn’t gotten his money yet. He says he fills out surveys every night on his phone. Could his eyes be affected by the constant looking at surveys? I’ve never known him to get into sweepstakes marketing so it’s a strange development. I’m concerned that something is going on with his health or mental health and I’m not sure what to do at this point. Has anyone seen seeing ghosts and entertaining sweepstakes and money scams as early signs of dementia?"
"Hi I'm new here, dealing with a family member who is likely in the beginning stages of dementia. Thanks to covid we had to wait a long time to get her to a neurologist, but the appointment is around the corner. What can we expect?

What I'm mainly concerned about is that since she doesn't believe anything is wrong, she will downplay everything to the doctor. A family member will be present with her at the appointment so she doesn't go alone. Ideally we'd be allowed to speak the doctor privately without her present, because some of the things that need to be said are uncomfortable to say in front of her. For example, I think it needs to be pointed out that she has basically stopped bathing aside from washing her hair in the sink with dish soap, but that's kind of embarrassing to bring up in front of her.

I guess overall I just don't know what to do if she doesn't think anything is wrong, and I was hopeful that we'd get a definitive diagnosis (maybe not from this first visit, but eventually?) that would help her understand what's going on and realize she needs more help. She is making all of these grand plans for her life that absolutely should not happen with how bad off she is right now. For example, she wants to adopt a dog, but she couldn't even take care of her cat and we had to rehome it. She wants to buy a house, but she can barely manage an apartment at the moment (it's starting to look like an episode of Hoarders). She couldn't handle her finances at all so we've already taken over that for her. IMO she needs to move to a retirement community that has a memory care unit that she can eventually transition to if/when she gets worse, but she is NOT receptive to that idea at all.

Anyway thanks in advance for any advice, and for just for letting me rant a bit (figured this community would be understanding)."
"Hey all,

Anybody else caring for somebody who has a natural tendency to just pull whatever plug they see out of the socket with no rhyme or reason? For me it was kind of endearing at first because it was their way of ""helping save electricity"", but it's slowly evolving into ""let me unplug this and hide the electronic device"", which is problematic because they disconnect the cord and put them separate from the device.

This is more of a rant bc I know it's not a huge deal and in a way it's funny but damn it gets frustrating trying to track everything down or coming back to the house and having nothing turn on lol"
"So my father forgets a lot since he was a child, but in the last couple of years I noticed he's having hard time with working memory. He works as a sales person at his pastry shop, he does mistakes in calculation 2/3 of times. Especially when there are multiple orders. I
n the past 2 days, he forgot the car's key inside the car and didn't lock it. Also last week he left the pastry shop without locking it. It was literally open for theives. I took him to a neurologist last year but he assured that nothing is wrong, he asked him easy stuff like name, date and what did he ate. 2 months ago, the cardiologist ordered a sleep test to rule out sleep apnea, but it showed a mild sleep apnea.. I don't think this is the real cause.."

"hi. i just wanted to vent tbh because i don’t really know anywhere else i can vent where people could relate. my grandma has Lewy Body Dementia and my grandpa has Alzheimer’s. before the disease, my grandma taught me how to play the piano. She loved singing, keeping up with her friends on Facebook, and she loved church. I’d go over to my grandparents’ house on Fridays and she would tell me countless stories about Cuba (we’re Cuban lol). She loved getting dressed up and taking care of herself and now she’s a hollow shell. She obviously doesn’t remember any part of who she used to be and she’s like a little girl. I just miss her so much. My grandpa still recognizes me more. He used to help me with my math homework, go on walks with me and the dog, and go on every single ride at Disney World with me. They’re both in an Assisted Living Facility with Memory Care as the disease was progressing too much in both of them. The facility isn’t allowing visitors anymore due to Covid and it’s breaking my heart to think of them there alone. I never want them to think we abandoned them. My dad had to put them in a facility because he works 60+ hours a week and couldn’t give them 24/7 care and I’m in college so I couldn’t be as much help as I would’ve wanted. I just really miss them so much. These memory diseases strip you away of everything that made you yourself. :("
"A family member was just diagnosed and is refusing the medication offered by the doctor (I think because then it becomes real for them). Just wondering if we should push the issue, if it makes a huge difference. Thanks."
"My dad, 73, has vascular dementia and has been living in a facility in Florida since 2019. In the past week he’s had three aggressive incidents (not out of the norm for but way more than normal) and they are trying everything they can to kick him out. Granted, at this point I don’t want him living there anymore, but they keep trying to put him in a psych hold. 

Im trying to find him a new place to live but memory care is so expensive So I’m not sure what we can afford. So I’m not even sure where I can place him. The VA state home doesn’t have any beds near by. 

A system that allows this to happen to one of its most vulnerable members is a cruel one."
"I lived with a sweet old couple for a couple months a little while ago. The husband has dementia and his wife was taking care of him.

She used to tell me stories about her husband - his success, intelligence, and general business acumen. I could feel the heart break behind her words as her husband had clearly deteriorated over the years to resemble less and less of the person she described..

Getting alzheimers/dementia honestly terrifies me. 

As far as I know, it doesn’t run in my family from my dad’s side.

But my mum was estranged from her family at birth, and I don’t know if it runs in her family.

I’m 34. Is there something I can start doing now to lessen the risks of getting it later?"
"I was walking down the hall with my deaf, nuts, mostly miserable mom at her assisted living facility and another resident came around the corner walking towards us. My mom said ""oh, here comes this old fart""."
"Hi everyone. Due to advanced dementia, my grandma needs 24/7 care which includes controlling when and what she eats. This means that we feed her at particular times every day, particular type of food (she has 0 teeth left). 

However, we have an issue: 1) she forgets whether she has eaten or not 2) I assume, her brain doesn't understand the feeling of being full anymore, and it seems like she is in a state of constant ""hunger"", even if she has just eaten a full meal 5 minutes ago. Also, she would literally eat however much food you put on her plate, and I mean it - if she had access, she would just be eating everything non-stop in ridiculous amounts. 

She is roaming around and ""spying"" on us whenever we do something in the kitchen, thinking that we don't feed her. We started locking the kitchen cupboards, fridge, and the kitchen itself, because we have found her multiple times standing there and just eating plain bread in the middle of the night, etc. 

She never tells us that she is hungry, never asks for food, and always says ""no"" if you offer her more after she finishes her plate. But we can very clearly see that she thinks she is hungry all the time and thinks that she hasn't eaten anything for who knows how long. 

This makes it very hard for us to eat in peace because of her hiding around the corner and judging. It also means that we sometimes feel guilty and overfeed her. 

If anyone has a similar problem, how do you deal with it?"
"My grandma is awesome. A+ person, A+ grandma but she does laps around the house all day checking on me, checking on this, checking on that. I've gotten coloring books, but see can't see so well, I got big bold type playing cards but she forgets what we're doing after each hand. I know she's just bored but I'm running out of ideas. The same questions over and over I can deal with I raised 5 kids so I'm as patient as they come. I just want to help. And I want her happy and content. Any ideas are welcome and would be a great help.




Edit: thank you to you ALL. You've given me great ideas and paths to follow that I would have NEVER came up with on my own. This truly is a great community and I appreciate you all from the bottom of my heart!"
"My mom (mid-stage dementia) will be moving to an independent living facility next month and I'm looking for any advice or tips I can get. 

She has accumulated *a lot* of stuff over the past number of years as the disease has crept its way in, and there's so much to consider taking/giving/selling/junking. Not only furniture/belongings, but just junk in general. She loves her stuff. She's very trusting of me and I hope this all goes ok, but I have to be very strategic about this. There is not a lot of time and a lot to do. Plus, her new apartment would never fit even half of what's here. 

What have others' experiences been like when moving their family member with cognitive decline? Is there anything helpful you discovered in the process that you'd like to share? 

Thanks in advance."
"My mom is getting progressively more and more resistant to taking medication, especially in the evenings.

We've moved what pills we can to other points in the day, but she absolutely HAS to take two trazodone pills just before bed, or she'll be a complete wreck the next day.

The issues:

Trazodone is incredibly, incredibly bitter. They're ""coated,"" but it's a very thin coating that does nothing to keep the bitter taste sealed. AFAIK that's the only way it is available. We've been coating them in two additional coats of cake glaze (we tried a pill coat thing, but it was expensive and not great, and most pill-swallowing aids coat the mouth, not the pill, and if you think you're opening my mom's mouth and spraying stuff inside without all hell breaking loose, well...). That mostly works, except....

She's started holding the pills in her mouth while swallowing her water. Yeah that's right, she'll take the pill, drink the water, swallow, sit for a minute, and then spit out the pills. She's worse than my cats! 

Due to her holding them in her mouth, the cake glaze dissolves and they're super bitter again; even though we'll give her new ones, she's more and more reluctant (understandably).

She doesn't reliably eat dessert, so pudding is already iffy, and then the trazodone are so bitter that you really need excessive amounts of pudding to fully cover the taste. 

She has to take them right before bed, because they knock her out quick. 

I would be so grateful for ANY ideas about what to do."
My Grandad passed away over the weekend. He owned a large ranch with multiple sheep dogs. My Grandmother has dementia and is taking one of the dogs with her as we help move her to a new apartment closer to our family. She has problems remembering conversations more than several minutes apart and if I take the dog out for a walk she gets very distressed in the meantime. How can I leave her some form of reminder or help her know that her dog hasn’t run away so she’s at ease while I’m out with it?
"My mom (vascular dementia)was assessed at this level. I have read all that I can but wanted to hear more personal experiences and insights. I don’t know what to expect, how long it will be at this level, and how to get my head wrapped around it all. She currently lives with me and I’m starting with a caregiver next week to help a few times a week."
"My mom(54 years) is diagnosed with Lewy Bodies Dementia by multiple reputed neurologist in my country(India).

What surprising is how rapidly her case deteriorated. Within a couple of weeks she went from “normal” to severe dementia. She is severly lethargic, doesn’t recognize me or my sister(still recognizes my dad most of the times who lives with her, my sister and I are in US), has trouble speaking clearly, confused, has hallucinations and insomnia(occasionally). She was functioning and working before the symptoms started suddenly. While symptoms align well with LBD, the rapid progression at a young age is quite surprising. Some days she is quite normal(good enough memory and motor functions). She also improves when she is taken to a different nature surrounded location(they currently live in a small apartment in the city which is quite polluted).

Reading through other cases, it looks like the condition(LBD) develops over a few months if not years. 2 weeks is a really small time for full blown deterioration. I personally suspect this could be due to long covid as she had a very high readings in the antibody testing after the symptoms started. She is double vaxxed though, so can’t be certain about the cause of high anti body count.

We are planning to take her to a couple more neurologist for reevaluations. Is there anything we could do to rule out other causes of the symptoms we are seeing? Her blood work for toxins and vitamins/minerals came back normal. Lumbar puncture and MRI was also normal."
"My 96-year old MIL can’t stop talking. She constantly repeats a handful of phrases (please help me, the power’s off, I’m all mixed up, something’s wrong). 
She’s awake all night, sleeping for maybe an hour at a time.
We’re exhausted and at wit’s end.
Xanax doesn’t help, and she has bad reactions to other psychotropics."
"These last 3 days have been pushing me, my mom and my husband to the max...
It all started when we had dinner on saturday night in our living room we were trying to have a movie night...my dad fell...pulling down the big screen tv, my laptop and my cellphone. This putt us all into a state...i lost my cool, my mom lost her cool. I am ashamed to say that i got mad that our things could of been broken...we are poor we cannot simply go out and replace a broken tv or get a new cellphone or laptop.( the tv was gift from my husbands family, the laptop is years old but i use it for studying and my cellphone is old aswell..I am from South Africa here not all people can just replace things if they break) I freaked out as I start my 4th year of Uni and with out a laptop i cannot study at all. I am glad my dad is ok just have a few bruises but we were all shook up. Mom was so angry I have never seen her so angry at my dad. She blames him and HE NEVER ASKS FOR HELP and if he did all this drama could of been avoided. 
My dad fell 2 more times...all because he refuses to ask for help. Since the falls he just looked out of it, my mom also fell and hurt her back so things are not happy in this house. I just wish my dad would ask for help and he refuses to tell my mom if he has any issues or pain and we are REALLY GETTING SICK OF IT."
"I need to talk about this..

A family friend has had dementia for several years and it was pretty bad.

I wasn't very affected by it as his wife handled most things and made sure we saw him only on good days.

I've known that dementia kills. Like, it's just something you are told.

But yesterday he was out on a walk with his wife, as they do every single day,

and he just stopped existing. Mid step. No ""It hurts"" or any other words.. He just left in silence.

I'm of course grateful that it was quick. He was not weak or in need of help walking or anything.

But I just can't wrap my head around what happened - that he was just gone, mid-step, without any warning or sign of distress..

Is this a thing with dementia? Or is it more likely that it's a blood clot or something?"
"His dad started losing his memory in his 70s. My dad is now 58. He does ask me to repeat things that have said already. But I don't know if that's because he just didn't listen to me the first time, or generally doesn't remember. I'm really scared. I don't know what to do and we live in Canada. I guess healthcare is okay. What are the right things I should ask him to check for at the doctors? Should I ask him to start taking b12 vitamins? Should I ask him to do a puzzle with me everyday? Please I really want him to remember me forever."
"What do you guys think about mixing protein powder in with coffee creamer ? My grandmother is still in early enough stages to have a routine , but unfortunately that means her coffee and sweet treats constitute breakfast and much of the day follows along those lines. Her side of the family must not have the strong diabetes genes because she's been all about the sweets for a long time. She will eat veggies with one meal so that's good , but still not a lot of protein . She does her instant coffee in the morning and gets her creamer out of the dish with help. I thought I could put some Orgain French vanilla in half the jar and mix it to see what happens . I also could bake with it I suppose.  Has this worked for anyone ?"
"My grandmother was diagnosed with dementia around the time I was born, I am not sure how old she was, I think Early to mid sixties, and remember being worried about my mom getting it when I was a kid. Me and my mom were very close and she was the only person I could talk to during some hard times. When I was in middle school she started showing signs and was diagnosed after a car accident with Early Onset Alzheimer's.

For context she was 38 when I was born so she was diagnosed around 53. I think for a while I was just so devastated by it that I wasn't able to process it, this was something that I had a extreme fear of as a child. It's been a little over four years since then and i'm 19 now. She's getting toward the later stages it seems and I care for her often but it gets more painful. Every time pick her up and help her in my car or try and get her to focus on chewing her food I feel like i'm closer to getting Alzheimer's myself. Since I think my grandmother was diagnosed with a different form of dementia than my mom I am not sure it's familial, but there's no denying that they both got the disease at a relatively young age. I'm terrified that I could develop it at an even younger age then them and that ill spend my 30's or 40's like them. Some of this may sound callused and I know it is somewhat selfish to think about me when they are both still going through this but this is killing me on the inside. From what I've read familial Alzheimer's  is very rare but my families situation seems like it could be a case of it.

I would like to hear some of your stories and if anybody can give some advice I'd appreciate it, many people I've talked to dont understand how hard taking care of someone with Alzheimer's is. It's not like when somebody dies and you can grieve and move on, this has been going on for years and I have no closure, I don't know what to do."
"So for starters, my dad is 79 and he was involved in a car wreck last month. He turned left in front of someone going through the yellow light. I was the passenger and sustained injuries from the airbags and he had similar injuries. The other party was not injured, but my dad's car was totaled. Now he has no car to use and is housebound, but I come over everyday to help him out. It was determined by my siblings and I that it would be best for him not to drive again. While he's been housebound, he only asks for the same meal every day and would have it for dinner if I allowed him. All he wants is a nacho bellgrande from Taco Bell. While it is true, he did like it prior to the wreck, so that's not new. He cites that ""its the only thing I know I can eat."" He will eat some other things but they also prove to sometimes be foods that he used to like, but pick at and barely eats a lot of it. 

He has not be formally diagnosed with cognitive decline, but it seems like he's showing unsettling symptoms just as recent as this weekend. He has a doctors appointment tomorrow (the 20th) and has it marked on his calendar. Well I needed to get him a few things at the store today and when I came back he was in bed and was mixed up about if it was time to leave for his appointment. I told him, no it was tomorrow. Clearly he was sundowning since it was about 5:30PM, I thought he was just hungry so i made him something, which he ate. Then after a few hours he said, ""Okay when do we need to leave for the appointment tomorrow?"" I said, ""at 9:30, I will come and pick you up and we can go around 10."" He nodded and said, ""Okay at 9:30."" Then I left and about 1 1/2 hours later, he called me and asked when do you need to leave for the appointment, to which I said ""at about 10."" He replied, ""So in thirty minutes why aren't you here now then?"" He was mixing up AM and PM. He said he had set his clock to get up, and was confused about if the appointment was 11 AM or PM. I have never seen him act like this. The appointment tomorrow isn't with his doctor but the nurse practitioner to check on his meds and see if his diabetes is still in check. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say to her if she asks. I find this behavior alarming and worrisome. Could it happen this fast? Or is it medication related? He was always good about taking his meds on time everyday. Not sure what's going on."

"My Father, 81, was diagnosed with Parkinson’s back in 2016. His disease slowly and progressively has gotten worse over time. He has the type of Parkinson’s that makes a person stiff and tense hardly has the shakes. He was fairly Lucid up until about 2 years ago. He was diagnosed with Lewy Body dementia which is under the spectrum of Parkinson’s it affects his nervous system pretty aggressively. 

Physically he has a hard time moving plus the dementia has become more frequent lately. A mix of both his physical limits and dementia had caused him to fall pretty bad at least 30 times last year. He has lucid moments, but they’re less frequent. He was doing physical therapy he got better for a short while then suddenly this week as of Saturday he can barely stand or get out of bed. He was walking fine last Monday. 

Is there anything I can do to help him? Are there vitamins he can take, or can a change to his diet help? How can I get in home assistance from the state of Florida? What kind of home will he end up in if I can’t care for him anymore? It’s so heartbreaking and stressful watching someone you love deteriorate like this. I don’t know what to do.

Edit: I wanted to thank all of you guys of doing me a favor by responding. I really do appreciate it. Thanks for the help."
Can assisted living with memory care handle patients with more severe dementia - or is a nursing home usually the ultimate destination? We have elderly relatives with mild dementia currently living in their home. They prefer to remain in their home but I have a feeling they will be better off elsewhere. I'm not sure if the typical assisted living facility with memory care is able to handle more severe dementia...or if AL is just a temporary stop before a nursing home.
"Hi! First time posting. My mother (70 F) has been diagnosed with moderate dementia based on her decline over the last 18 months and her score on the MoCA test. She declined 20% in the last 18 months. To compound this, my dad (70 M) passed 4 months ago, who was her sole caregiver, though he never saw it that way. He was the person who was with her all day, scheduling her appointments (which she is not capable of doing herself) and making sure she had all of her meds ordered and taken care of. 

We are looking for a way to tell her how impactful her memory loss is to us, her caregivers (my sister and I, 32 and 30 respectively, and her brother 76) and how we need her to accept some help. She has gotten lost while driving but had gotten better with using her phone’s GPS to help her get around. She forgets many scheduled things and repeats similar stories upwards of 5 times in a short time frame. We are in the process of hiring companion care to keep her company and help her around the house a few days a week. 

Along with being frustrated, we know this isn’t her fault but it does impact our lives by worrying about her daily. Any suggestions for gently bringing up and reiterating how impactful this is for her family and how we can work together to make this journey a little easier for all of us?  Thanks for your help!"
"They didn't ask for her social security number or credit/debit cards or anything. And what do I need to do about it? They apparently told her they were from Medicare and were sending her a benefit, and since she'd just been to the hospital a couple days ago she believed them."
"I'm here to vent. I already have solutions in place and in motion. 

My Mom was diagnosed with Dementia late 2019.  Her decline has been steady; however, the last six weeks her decline has been significant.

She's wet her pants two days in a row, she's wandered the house twice, she has stopped eating some  foods she liked two months ago because they don't look right (she often thinks green veggies are bugs) she will argue about taking her pills, I have to hide bread and tortillas  because if I don't she will eat four sandwiches a day, I have to hide her SlimFast ( she has one for breakfast) or she'll drink three or more a day, and she's forgetting more words.

My anxiety is through the roof and, honesty, I'm really scared.

If I can get through caring for her without completely losing it, it'll be a miracle."
"1st here is a little [back story](https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/s3sxy3/my_nan_has_dementia_really_bad_had_a_heart_attack/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Today i finally got up there. Not only to see her but to give my aunt a break. My dear sweet aunt hasn't left the hospital since Nan was admitted Thursday. When i got there i told her to go home, shower take a nap do whatever you need to do i got this. But she stay at the hospital and hung out in the lobby incase the Drs came. Now i know where I got my dedication, compassion, patients might as well throw being stubborn in the mix. I took care of my nan for about 6 hours. And i enjoyed every moment. Even when she was having aggression episodes. 

My nan is stage 7 of dementia so for her to communicate is nearly impossible. She can't tell where it hurts or why or what level of pain we (aunt and i) can only go by from her actions. 

She did have a heart attack but no blood clot! But she has compound fractures in 4 of her vertebrate. My aunt and i can't not figure out why or how. The home she was in hadn't reported a fall in months. 

I just so happy to be a help to her and my aunt. I brushed her hair helped with lunch and even bathroom moments. She laid in the bed for a good while happy playing with her doll folding hand towels while i sat next to her. She even reached out and held my hand for about 45 mins. 

I feel better now i got there talked to the Drs and my aunt. Don't get me wrong i love my dad and I love that he takes his time to call me with updates. But i get alot of ""i don't know"" when i ask that or this. 

To those who commented on my previous post, thank you for the kind words and support."
"This illness is so sad. I've (f39) just recently had to put my mum (74) into care. We lost my dad (72) back in February and didn't know mum had Dementia. Apparently, she was diagnosed back in 2018, but he kept her secret for her and took on her care. 

I've worked really hard to have a really fulfilling relationship with them both over the past 20 years. I grew up with their alcoholism and it really effected me, but I sought help and it changed my life and let me find acceptance for their drinking. When dad passed our relationship was wonderful and my heart was broken. My mum had lost her rock and the love of her life. 

The shock of realising my mum wasn't just drunk, but in fact had dementia as well was like a second blow. It was clear they had been struggling. I tried to take on the things my dad had been doing, brought in cares, set up a new poa and had my two brothers help with looking after her at night. 

She's prone to infection and sure enough this led to a bad fall even in strong antibiotics. After that I realised I couldn't keep her safe. The three of us were working during the day, had cameras installed, neighbors keeping and eye out, but she was still drinking, wandering and landed in the hospital. She always said she never wanted to got into a care home, but I really didn't have another choice. The decision was excruciating, but there was no way she would have made it to Christmas. 

I found her a beautiful care home after months of hell., Hospital, intermediate care and assessments. 

Today I went to see her and she was looking amazing. She's out on weight, doesn't drink and was having a very low day. Telling me she couldn't stay there and she wanted to come live with me. I live in a top floor flat and she would never make it up the stairs, but on top of that she would still be at home all day herself and we would be back to square one. 

It's so hard to not just bin my life and commit to looking after her. It's what my dad would have done. But I feel like it still wouldn't be enough. 

Having to tell her that I can't take her home is heartbreaking. The codependent in me wants to scoop her up and take her with me, but in my head I know it's not the answer. Some days this illness is just shit."
she thinks no one understands what she is going through. Ive vented on here a lot but my mother needs some support. She thinks no one can understand how hard it is to cope with everything she has to do for  my dad.He has vascular dementia got it after having a stroke.
"My mother has Frontotemporal Dementia and I feel like I’m slowly developing it myself!! Its very scary because I’m only 32 and I have a family. I occasionally lose my train of thought. This used to never happen to me and it’s happening more frequently. I’m also forgetting names mostly of people I haven’t seen in a long time but I used to be really good with names. What’s most concerning is that I keep having vision problems and weird fog-headed “headaches”. It comes and goes but it doesn’t feel right.  Ive always been physically active and my diet has never been horrible so it’s not some obese problem. I went to the doctor and I’m pending blood test results and she also scheduled me for a brain scan, or whatever is called. My sister and I are both so worried about getting it, that I am not ruling out paranoia, but they’re still a concerning symptoms.

Does anyone have any relatives that described their symptoms before they had full on dementia???

I apologize in advance if this is a question that’s asked frequently. Dementia was never in my radar and I knew nothing about it before my mom got it. From my understanding FTD is the least know type of “Dementia”. I honestly thing that when it is understood better, it will not even be classified as Dementia but a different neurological disease that affects the brain.

Thank you all in advance for the comments. 

PS- new to Reddit and I’m loving this community."
"My mother thinks people are taking her things. She has become violent and is verbally abusing everyone. 
I am not sure if they correlate."
"But he's not sure how to do it or what to do or where to do it. Are there any online tools that can show memory Care homes by region or by state that I could look up and give him some starting points. I had to find him his at home nurse care, he couldn't figure that out and I was happy to help."
"I really don’t know what to post here, I guess this is an “off my chest” moment. 

About four years ago she started having memory issues and she lost her job because of it. Fast forward today, she can barely have a conversation with me. It’s even worse because I live on the other side of the world so I barely get to talk to her. The only saving grace is that my step-father is a tremendous help, beyond patient, and caring for her. I owe him a lot. 

When I came back for the holidays, it just crushed me. She used to be this brilliant biologist who had a passion for monkeys and apes, and now she just sits there on her iPad most of the time watching daytime tv. Her and I are only children so most of our family is dead, and the family that is left has forgotten about us. She has friends that occasionally pop by to check in on her, but it’s not enough. I can see that in her eyes.

There’s so many questions and “what ifs” that swim in my head on a daily occurrence. “How much worse is it going to get?”, “Will she even recognise me when I come back for a visit?”, “Is there anything that I could do to make this better?”, “What is the likelihood that I will have the same fate?”. 

I’m just lost. Her and I are navigating through different fogs. It’s not fair. It’s not fucking fair. My want my Mom back. I miss her so so much.

EDIT: Wow, thank you all so much for your helpful advice and support. I’m so touched that so many of you reached out, I cannot thank you enough!!!!"
"This is a first for me because my grandmother, a woman who up until this year was so sharp and quick witted, is finally showing signs of....something. I highly suspect dementia. She's 82, will be 83 this year. 

It started last year a few months after my grandfather passed. My grandmother began seeing people in her house. She called my mother to tell her that there had been a family living in her house for 2 days before she finally pitched a fit and told them to leave. It was determined that she had a horrible, horrible UTI/bladder infection that the doctor said could cause delusions and hallucinations in elderly patients if left untreated for so long. 

Well, just a few nights ago she called 911 to report a break in. She said she saw 5 children in her house, all dressed in black, crouching with their faces to the wall as if to hide from her. As creepy as it is to me, she said she didn't feel afraid or like they were trying to harm her. Just more annoyed that one of these children sat in her flower pot.

She's had a hard time remembering current things and events, but can prattle off a memory from 50 years ago. 

This is all so New to me. I think my mother is in denial or is just having a hard time accepting what's coming. 

I just needed to get this off my chest. I guess I'm hoping for some advice or encouragement or insight. 

How do we approach these types of hallucinations? How do we preserve what could be the last few years of her life?"
"Warning: Long post ahead! My grandma(my closest person in my life) has been living with dementia for the last 6 months. It started in a severe way but thankfully I found a good nurse that brought her back to being stable. She was in good spirits for the past couple of months and it became like a normal life. Until this week, she started to show trouble with breathing and it degrated rapidly. She couldn't eat properly, her speech declined so I took her to the emergency. Yesterday she tested positive and I thought that was it. 

But today, her doctor told me that she had no signs of COVID, wasn't infected in her lungs and she was going to be okay. Strange I thought. So I took her back home and called her nurse to spend time with her so I could rest a bit and called another doctor to check on her for at least a week. My grandma is using a ventilator and the doctor is going to give her the proper medicine. Both of them are very motivated to help her and served my grandma in a optimistical approach.

My problem is that I don't buy it. I feel I'm being lied so I won't get hurt. The nurse talked on the phone with a relative of mine and I grew suspicious. My mom has been texting me kind words, which isn't unusual but still. The doctor proposed to me rent the ventilator for at least 10 days and after that my grandma would become better by then. As of now my grandma responds rarely to my calls and barely utters anything. Her vision is slowly fading on each hour and hasn't slept properly. Nonetheless her oxygen level and her heartbeats are normal(I'm checking them every once in 30 minutes).

I don't like searching the internet for a medical condition, because I fully trust the doctors, but this time I feel like I'm being lied. As far as I've known, dementia never only gets worse with time and can cause lung failure or other damages. Probably wanted to know if anyone has ever had any experience with elders catching a cold/trouble breathing and then recovering from it or it is just downhill on each time people with dementia get sick or catch the flu? I only wish that my grandma becomes like she was a week ago because she was happy and I really don't mind not getting my name remembered."
"Sorry so long, but dementia is just so complex as you guys probably know.

My dad is going to need to go to a nursing home soon, no question about that.  My mom's out of town and I'm by myself taking care of him which has become near impossible.  So I decide to finally go take a look at his financials to put together a budget for what inpatient care will cost if he ends up living another like, 10 years and also thinking about my mom's future.

My dad retired very wealthy but was a huge cheapskate.  He worked at the same company as a GM for forty years, and they matched his 401K from his first day there up to the day he retired.  I know this because the accountant from his company is my godmother.  So I went into the basement and got on his laptop to finally see just how much money he has (he kept it all on a spreadsheet that he never let any of us see.  He's always been paranoid about money being stolen from him.)  My mom pays all the bills with automatic pay i set up for her out of their checking account, (she doesn't know anything about finance above what's in this checking account where I have their social security direct deposited into).  The house was paid off long ago.

Went down to the basement, and I got into the spreadsheet by guessing the correct password for the laptop.  The only document on this mac was the ""secret"" spreadsheet.  I was so relieved, then immediately wasn't.   Apparently when he retired, he rolled his entire 401k into a single IRA, all of which was documented.  So far so good.  Then the bottom fell out.  

In 2014 he cashed out the entire IRA and his life savings and spread the entire amount into EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS IN TEN DIFFERENT CREDIT UNIONS.  He didn't list which credit unions, much less account numbers.  The credit unions were just numbered ""credit union 1-10"" and ""account 1-18"") with the amounts he deposited in each one.  And yes, he was loaded.   There are no paper statements anywhere, no receipts of deposit, no interest statements, and my mom says she's never seen any statements or even junk mail from any credit unions in the mail aside from their checking account.  He must have asked all of them to go paperless or something?   Not even a hint or locked document stating which banks he hid all his money in.   And make no mistake, he went out of his way to hide this money.   He has no memory of doing this, of course.  I went through every document in his file cabinet and the fireproof safe.  Nothing.

Him hiding his money, is that a dementia thing?  And finally, we are fucked, aren't we?"
"It never get easier to deal with someone who has dementia. Whether it's your loved one, a close friend, or your job it's never easy. 

A little back story: I use to work in a memory care unit for 10+ years. I love it. We were short staff or had crappy staff who wouldnt show up for the shift. So I would stay late or go in early. My normal shift was 9 hours long. I remember I went in 4 hours early to help out, worked my shift and then was asked to stay late. I had 20 hours in one day. I DIDNT MIND ONE BIT! I love my job. Everything about it but the toileting and death. Yes I was there alot when they were on the last moments. I was the one who was med trained to give low doses of morphine if it was needed. 

I quit once my grandma (nan) was diagnosed with it. Ever person I cared for I saw my nan and would break down crying.

Last night my father called (nan is his mom) and told me she is in the hospital right now because she had a heart attack and now the Drs suspect a blood clot somewhere in the chest. She is fighting nurses and drs. Pulling put ivs monitors etc. She is scared and doesn't understand. My 2 a I aunts ate there and My dad show be shortly.  My nan is 2 hours away and i can't get there because of a winter storm. (Ice snow and wind) 

I cry all night. Didn't sleep hardly at all because nan was on my mind. She needs me!!! She needs someone who can comfort her distract her from that chaos around her. Some one to be in her world and feel what she feels.  And I can't get to her. It's killing me. 

End of my venting session. Thank you for reading. I just want my nan."
"My dad was diagnosed with dementia 2-3 years ago and in those two years he has just gone down hill. He struggles to walk,  messes food when he eats, has problems with his bowels and incontinence. He is also EXTREMELY STUBBORN and refuses anything to make life easy for us. E.g wearing nappies...walking properly with his walker( he does not walk properly with it and just gets angry when we tell him he is walking wrong) refuses to admit he can see perfectly with his one eye..he has problems with his right eye and the doctor says he can see perfectly with his left eye...but he wont wear an eye patch to help him see better. HE NEVER LISTENS AND FALLS CONSTANTLY HE KNOWS HE CANNOT WALK PROPERLY.  HE NEVER LISTENS TO US. GETS FREAKED OUT ABOUT THE SMALLEST THINGS..KEEPS MY MOM AWAKE AT NIGHT BECAUSE HE STRUGGLES TO ROLL AND LIGHT A JOINT AND HE SMOKES MANY..he nearly lost it when his weed ran out. He is not senile...he is fully aware of who we are, who he is there is nothing wrong with his mind he just has trouble finding words sometimes and acts like he has no strength but when he is angry he can hurt us and grab our arms. He laughs when he falls and we get upset and shocked about it....he thinks its so funny."
"I don't know if this is a vent or what but I just need to get it out!

Mom wandered for the first time last night. Thankfully, she didn't leave the house.

My step-dad told me that when he woke up this morning that all the lights in the house were on.  He didn't know until morning because he sleeps with a blindfold, and I slept through it. 

I'll buy a chain lock and install it up high on the door so she can't leave the house, but I really hate this.  This disease doesn't allow caretakers to catch a breath, it's always something.  

I'm exhausted. :("
"I'm trying to place my husband in a nursing home. He got sick at 48 and it's been ten yrs. I'm going through so many feelings, I spent all my 40s taking care of him, I've missed out on job opportunities and properly raising two young boys. I'm stating over at 50 again, it's just hard accepting that this is where I'm at, I have to let go it hurts. Thanks for letting me vent again."
"After dealing with being confined in the house in fear of getting Covid, my grandma’s mental state has drastically declined. For as long as I can remember she has had issues with her memory i.e asking me the same question over and over in an hour, but she generally manages most everyday tasks on her own. She was living with my dad and stepmom who took care of her until they pleaded with her to go with them to the doctor for testing when things got really bad (to get a diagnosis and appropriate treatment/help) which made things worse causing her to reach out to her nephew for help, to where he intervened and took her to live with him. I often talk with her on the phone, she say’s they have been using her money for vacations and selling her things, trying to poison her food (that it was making her sick) and that she was generally living in fear with them. Today she told me she wants to put my Stepmom in jail and that she has contacted lawyers and is taking legal action to get her money back. She is telling everyone that they were abusing her. I know in my heart my Dad and step mom could never do something like that to their mother/MIL, and it is absolutely breaking my heart to see her do this to them."

"I care for my grandmother 3 nights /4 days a week. She lives next door. She has a day time caretaker the rest of the time and stays with my uncle those nights.  Sometimes she seems the same she's been from 80 to 90. Other times , we deal with the classic things. She's very proud and stubborn and has been always so she covers the extent of it well. Anyway , when I moved back here she had gotten really codependent on my uncle and he has ways he likes to do things. The family drama over her care was endless and I got my head bit off more times than I can count. I'm dealing with a severe pain condition so I'd retreat back home and let it be.

4 months ago I had a spine stimulator put in. She took a fall the next day and was in rehab for months after a TBI . It's kind of a miracle it reabsorbed.We brought her home after with the caveat of she isn't going to be alone at all now so that's when I started staying. It can be hard to be the granddaughter doing it but my uncle lets me do things without micromanaging now. She has her good days and bad days and I'm not sure if the sullen withdrawn moments or the manic typical nana moments where she belittles me out of the blue are harder. I've tried avoiding known triggers and set up things accordingly. It's hard when it's her house - a point of pride. 

Anyway - today I'm off and her caretaker texts saying the heat is stuck . I go check it out.  The ac is on 70 and the heat is on 75. She had pushed a bunch of buttons and locked it out. It wasn't until recently that I was trusted my uncle to even deal with it bc he's had to have the guy out a lot and doesn't believe that I know how to work w dual thermostat 😂 exhausting. Anyway. The damage was done when I got there. I pulled the panel and the battery but it's wired with no way to disconnect. I checked the breakers but they aren't labeled. That would cause chaos. So now he's going to come lecture her or me and any time I breathe near the thermostat she's going to lose it. She fixates that it has to be on 75 and punched the wall. I've come in there plenty of the times where they were on the same temp. Ironically, it was 71 and she's been hot plenty .She sleeps better at 70 . 

Tldr-  Anyone know if they make like a fake panel magnet to go over the screen that reflects a different temp than it is . The thermostat arguments usually happen in the morning when my pain is super high and I'd like to just avoid the my house 75 argument  all together."
"I just found this sub.  A backstory (sorry so long, but I intend to be posting a lot on here).  We were a happy family of 5.  Three years ago, the head of my family, my brilliant older sister passed away at 48 from Breast Cancer.  My dad didn't go to the funeral, she lived out in Cupertino (we live down south) and he can't leave the house, let alone fly.  He had no memory of her by the time she passed anyway.  We just found out my 40 year old younger sister in Pennsylvania has stage 4 pancreatic cancer.  My dad has no memory of her either.  

My family is falling apart.  My mom is his caregiver, they've lived in the same house for their entire lives and he will die here, no plans to move him anywhere.  He weighs about 75 pounds, but he still eats meals and can use the bathroom,  and he can walk very very slowly in a shuffling manner.  But he is rapidly declining.   My mom left last week to go up north helping my sis through her 4th chemo round.   I am taking care of my dad here by myself, I packed a bag and just moved in as soon as my mom left (he can't be left alone).  I live an hour away and by some miracle,  he definitely knows who I am and always tells me how much he loves me and loves my cooking when he sees me, so that is a relief.  He knows who my mom is.  He asks me 20 times a day where my mom is.  I just say out of town.  I lie to him about everything, I don't want to confuse him.  He wanders around when it gets dark and I just lead him back up to bed.  No major drama at all.

Well a few evenings ago (before he started sundowning this night), it finally happened.  He fell walking to the bathroom.  Hard.  On his arm.  He lost control of his bowels, and started vomiting, unable to move but conscious.  I immediately called 911 and explained the situation.  I got my dad dressed on the floor and calmly explained to him an ambulance was coming but there is nothing to worry about.  I remained calm and told him I would be there the entire time holding his hand.  I showed him old photos of us together and he was smiling.   The paramedics showed up and I pretended to my dad that he was going on a fun excursion on a stretcher and he was totally at ease, everything was going smoothly.  Until it wasn't.  They said I couldn't ride in the ambulance or even follow them to the hospital because I wasn't vaccinated.  They said stay home and wait for the nurse to call when he got into a room.  I understand, even though I had my mask on.

2 hours hours later, the nurse calls to inform me he is in a room and she is about to give him the Covid vaccine while he's waiting for the doctor to examine him.  What.  The.  Fuck.  He hasn't left the house in 4 years, he weighs 70 pounds and was brought in on a 911.  I told her absolutely fucking not.  And if I find out they gave it to him, we were going to have a BIG problem.  He would never survive the side effects.  His blood doesn't even clot.  An hour goes by and the doctor calls.  Said he didn't have a concussion but fractured his arm, which the doc bandaged up.  They said he's ready to go home and is being discharged.  It was 10pm.  I asked where do I park and, which room he was in.  They said pull up to hospital entrance and he is SITTING OUTSIDE IN A WHEELCHAIR WAITING FOR ME TO PICK HIM UP.  It was a 45 minute drive.  He sat out there alone at 11pm strapped down to a wheelchair in the freezing cold with nothing but a small blanket.  He was terrified and belligerent and said his arm hurt really bad. 

  
 I pulled up, got out of my car and banged on the door of the waiting room.  I demanded to see this doctor.   This douche doctor comes out with his discharge folder.  I said why is he alone in the parking lot, and where is the prescription for pain meds for his arm.  Doctor says they ""do not give out prescriptions for opiates due to the potential for addiction.""  Holy fucking shit.  I said ""he's 83 and has no memory of how he even got here.  Give him some damn pain relief!""  Dr. just said no and didn't even help me load my dad into my car.  

Is it normal to throw a dementia patient out of the hospital, alone, in the cold, strapped down to a wheelchair late at night, while sundowning, without so much as an advil?!!  They literally kicked him out of the hospital, alone at night in the cold.   He had soiled himself again when I found him.  He was terrified.  I cleaned him up when we got home.

Is this about the fucking vaccine or do hospitals just not give two shits about the elderly?  Everything is fine now, he has no memory of it, but his arm is purple, he keeps asking what happened to his arm.  I've just been giving him advil with his breakfast and dinner.  He says he's not in pain so I stopped giving him the medicine."
"Anyone have luck getting their loved one into one of these facilities? I’ve been calling it seems unless they are hospitalized they don’t want to take them in.

I was trying to ballpark costs since she has no assets, her only income is SSI and she is covered through both Medical and Medicare but they don’t seem to want to engage unless she’s ready to go in at this moment. 

Anyone have any guidance or luck with this? I’m in Los Angeles if that helps."
Hi! My mom has fairly severe memory loss and “possibly” very early stage Alzheimer’s. She’s still fairly functional but is definitely stumped by some unfamiliar/non routine tasks. Recently she’s been talking about how blue the daytime sky is - she brings it up frequently (as if it’s the first time she’s mentioned it) and the sky looks pretty much the same to me. She’s also fixated on the street lights as they are very orange (as opposed to white). Is this shift in her perception of color common?
"My mom's doctors have never directly told her she has dementia. They screen her regularly for it, and she knows she doesn't perform very well, but I don't think she knows she officially has dementia. I don't mention it either, because I don't want to upset her. But I'm also wondering if there's any benefit to knowing? Would it help her understand why she can't recall things etc? Or would it just be upsetting?"
"Guys, my mom is 70 and in state 5 of dementia. The health care agency just sent out a caretaker that is 74! What's wrong with this picture? The irony! T"
"i and my family think my mum (72) has some serious mental health issues, we think dementia is likely.
 
She is a lovely caring person; the sort of person you'd bring a friend home to and she would fuss over them and make sure everything is perfect.

In the last 2 years or so, she has changed, becoming fixated on odd topics (she watches hours of news everyday), become more moody and also very bitter. in the last week, she has been adamant it is the 28th of december, even tho my dad showed her a calender and tried to explain what day it was. she has had two arguements with people who were walking there dogs on the street past her house etc. it is so out of character. the problem is that she refuses to get help. my dad has asked her multiple times. i've mentioned it (in the guise of treating covid induced anxiety) and she told me my dad didn't want her seeing anyone. I’ve noticed these changes in the past couple of years, but it has swiftly accelerated in the past few months.

i guess my question is, what is the best way forward? how do we get her help? I have not yet sat her down for a ""serious"" conversation as my concern it
will antaganoise her. Any suggestions are much appreciated."
"I wasn't the right person when she was first diagnosed.  And 3 years later, even more so.
What is the next step? I've been fighting with San Bernadino IHSS for over a year and can't get her a caregiver without a new hop to jump through just when I think we are close.
I have to work to keep a roof over our heads. 
And when I am home, it is a constant barrage of her yelling FUCK YOU at me or telling me just how awful I am to her or her cats. I feed her and the cats...it is far easier  to feed the cats. She goes through my belongings believing that I am hiding her random item of the day.

I can't stand being near her. I can't relax at work because I am worried all day. The cameras I have to check on her well being through the day ar a constant source of stress. 
Care facilities cost more nearly twice as much as I make. I am at wits end. And crying at work must surely be worrisome for my co-workers.
 I just can't do this anymore. I am ignoring my own chest pains, in hopes of it being ""the big one""."
"So my father-in-law had a heart valve replaced about 4 years ago, then another heart procedure a year later. His mental acuity has been declining ever since. When his cardiovascular docs are asked about this, they essentially say he's lucky to be alive and it is what it is.

Without going into exhaustive detail, he's having a hard-time with short-term memory and generally how things work, where things are, what he walked into a room for, etc etc. But the main source of stress for him and his caregiver (his wife, my mother-in-law) is his daily insistence that he has to go to some kind of important event.

The details are always a bit vague. It used to be a wedding. He would wake up every day thinking there was a wedding to go to. MIL would tell him there was no wedding and he would accept it and move on with the day. Sometimes he was more skeptical of there being no wedding, but it was more or less manageable.

Lately it has progressed to more difficult scenarios. Last month it was a fight of some type involving men on horses, and he needed to go intervene. Lately it's been an important presentation he needs to make, but he can't come up with the location or topic. The long and short of it is that he's having extreme anxiety about the need to physically go somewhere and do something that doesn't exist.

His anxiety and insistence about these imaginary problems has been getting worse over the past month or so. He is able-bodied, meaning it may get to the point that he needs to be physically stopped from leaving the house. MIL is at a loss about what to do, and I'm looking for any ideas. It's getting to the point that it's an all-day every day issue where he's constantly on the verge of a panic attack, which also has implications for stress on his heart.

I suppose they could seek some kind of anxiety medication? Playing along seems out of the question, as he has no concrete details on where these important events are taking place. So he can either be anxious and frustrated at home, or anxious and frustrated in the car or at some random location where these imaginary events are supposed to take place.

What can they do? Are there techniques for handling these kinds of delusions, either medicinal or otherwise? Looking for something that can ease the burden on MIL as well as stress for FIL."
"Hey all,

I commented on another post about sleep and it got me curious. Does anybody else feel really guilty locking their bedroom door at night? I've had incidents where either my mom would come into my room and freak me out, or somebody else would need help handling her. I dunno, maybe I'm just paranoid because I've woken up to use the bathroom and ran into her standing in front of the TV just staring blankly...honestly it creeps me out every time. Like one of the Paranormal Activity movies. 

I just wake up periodically and check the cameras in the house from my phone to see if she's wandering, but her neurologist gave her a new medication that helps her sleep 10hrs through the night so the incidents have nearly stopped. I still lock my door though."
"Any advice for MIL getting up at night, waking up FIL, and both are exhausted the next day? It has been going on for a while. FIL is thinking of Nyquil or a Benadryl to try to break the cycle for MIL so they both can sleep."
"My father, 71, has vascular dementia as well as mini strokes. This is in addition to CKD Stage 4, end stage renal, hypertension, type 1. Just to name a few of the issues. 

Normally he’s good w feeding himself, but he’s not allowed to use the stove or oven as he once almost burnt the house down by leaving a grilled cheese on the stove for an hour… which cost us over $3500 to repair, clothing himself (although he hides dirty underwear which I don’t understand) and taking his meds as given to him. We used to leave them out in the little pill slots but he started taking them wrong and hiding them around the house so we have to physically watch him take them. 

My wife and I (only child) were allowing him to still have his financial independence because it wasn’t proving to be much of an issue. That was until last month where he cancelled all his credit cards (because someone stole them to pay for his meds, spoiler, they weren’t stolen and he made the payment from his phone) and he went almost $800 in the hole in his checking acct. leaving him w no money for almost 3 weeks. He then wrote bad checks to make payments which all bounced. Including the check he gave his grandson (my son) which bounced and fucked us over w our bank. 

This previous Monday, we were at his PCP office and I spoke privately w the doctor about what’s been happening and he advised me it was time to exercise my POA and take over. Oddly enough, later that evening he was admitted to the ER for pneumonia. 

So we took the time having him out of the house to remove everything. Cards, check books, everything. (He lives w my wife, our 1 yo son and myself.) 

So of course he came home last night and was upset. Saying that we’re his jailers and we’re working w his doctors to hold him hostage and not let him have a life. Now of course, w dementia, that’s not true at all. We sacrifice a lot for him, including me going from the breadwinner to being a SAHD so I can care for him full time. 

He says he pays his bills on time, but he doesn’t. We have this from his accounts and credit reports. So we took the necessary steps to exercise our POA and a letter of mental incapacity  provided by his PCP to take over all the accounts. 

Tonight, he was blowing up phones of my aunts (his sisters) continuously for hours to get them to tell me he doesn’t have dementia. Spoiler alert, they all know he does and are on our side. 

Then he called 911 and said we were holding him hostage. Thankfully I know many of the officers in my small rural town and they know the situation as he has wondered off before when I’ve been showering or ran to the store on a small trip (30-60 mins). They did come but told him there was nothing they could do unless he wanted to go back to the hospital. Of course he declined. 

So the next best thing we could do was turn off his phone through the provider and change the Wi-Fi passwords. Otherwise he will just keep calling my aunts all night and 911. 

Am I the asshole here? Cause I feel like I am. My wife reassures me I’m not as she has dealt w this before with her late grandmother. But I still feel guilty. I’m just trying to protect him from himself. He tells people I want to steal his money but he has none. He couldn’t even afford to buy himself a new bed so we paid for it for him. He has no savings. No 401k. Other than his pension and SS which are roughly 4K a month and cover his healthcare expenses, he has Jack shit. 

I just, feel like a POS. And she tells me all the time my dad is verbally and mentally abusing me yet I’m still here. I still want to care for him because no one else will.  And I don’t want to see him go into a home. 

I’m just so Fucking lost. 

I hate this shit."
"My grandma used to be an amazing cook and baker.  
She suffers from dementia and isn’t able to cook, or even make her own coffee anymore.  
Despite her condition, every time she sees me she asks what can she cook for me. When I tell her that I’m fine, she insists. Comically enough, when I sometimes accept her offer (just for laughs) she would say something along the lines of “just let me know how to make it, and I’ll do it for you!”.   

Before every birthday she would ask me which cake I would like, in addition to her usual gift.   
She always told me that I shared her sweet-tooth, and would in fact bake two cakes. One for the birthday party itself to be shared with all of the guests, and one just for me- so I could continue enjoying it for days.   
My favorite cake by far was her amazing banana cake. No one in the family is able to recreate her recipe, despite our best efforts.   

iPhones have this feature that every so often it would make a small montage of a few random pictures of videos. Today a six years old video popped up. The video showed my mom and grandma working in the kitchen, and when my grandma looked up at the camera she said “working on your birthday cakes!”.   

I just can’t believe how far she has changed in such a short time. She is still loving and funny, but honestly, it’s not the same person.  

This dieses is awful. I believe that we have the best of it because we were able to get her a full time caretaker, and have her live just next door. It’s still unbelievably difficult seeing her bewildered  and confused eyes every so often. I just miss my grandma."
"... that's all I wish for you, as someone taking care of or even just regularly visiting someone with dementia.

Been thinking about this a lot lately.

Infinite patience.  Not a lot to ask for, right?

* ... when they can only come up with 10-20% of what they're trying to say, and you have no idea where they're going so you can't help them, and they're getting frustrated and looking at you like you're the dummy for not knowing what they mean.

* ... for the many times you've had to tell them that no, so-and-so can't visit because they died ten years ago.

* ... for the many times (you've learned) that you've had to tell a ""little white lie"" that's easier for them and easier for you, so-and-so can't visit because they're ""traveling on business""... and you were brought up, by this very person, not to lie, but now you're  learning that it's much, much easier to lie in this case, while hoping you're not picking up a really bad habit.

* ... for the times you have to shut down the prejudice and racism and hatefulness that you certainly never ever heard from them when they were in their right mind, and sure they're not in their right mind any more but that nastiness had to come from SOMEwhere.

* ... for the many times you wish they'd just go away (to put it politely), and yes, we were always taught that it's not nice to wish that, and yes, we know it's not their ""fault"" at all that they're like this... but it's all so damned tiring.

* For the family and relatives who don't ""get it"", and think that they know better, and that you're exaggerating how far gone the person is, and why don't you take them out more often (not realizing how much of a D-Day-type expedition it is to go to the mall).

* For it just not ending.

* Until it does, and you wonder if you could have done more.

* And you vow, privately, that you'll never end up in that situation because you wouldn't want to do that to anyone else and, less pleasantly, you wouldn't want anyone thinking about you the way you're thinking about this person.

*Sorry, folks.  I didn't mean this to get quite as dark as it did.  I really do wish you all infinite patience, or the closest thing to it PLUS the recognition that there's no such thing and we all have limits.  Take care of yourself and be well/well-ish...*"
"Venting. My dad insists on renewing his subscription to the local newspaper, but it’s now $1100 a year. He won’t read their online version, but will read other news headlines on his phone. He primarily wants the paper to read the comics and cut out the crossword puzzle, despite have clipped about 100 of them, and having puzzle books. I’m all about supporting local businesses, but spending $1100 to read old news is infuriating to me."
"My father has gone downhill this week, and I'm preparing for his end of life care (he lives with us). I'm talking with his doctor today, who will give me a hospice referral. I know what hospice covers here, because I went through this with my stepmom almost 3 years ago. I'll take advantage of what they offer, but I'm also making sure I have everything I need to keep him comfortable. He's very close to bedbound now, is now completely incontinent, and is refusing food and isn't drinking as much water.

So far, here's what's on my list:

Hospital gowns for easy dressing and cleaning  
Lemon glycerin mouth swabs for dry mouth  
Warm hospital socks  
Adult diapers that open and close on the sides  
Disposable bed pads  
Extra sheets and pillows for turning and positioning  
Nature's Miracle Urine Destroyer (this is great stuff when dealing with soiled bedsheets and clothing)  
Rinse free bathing wipes  
Baby wipes

He has warm robes, and we have lots of extra blankets and a radiant space heater to keep him warm, plus a boombox to play his favorite music. I'll ask hospice for a hospital bed, mainly to protect my back.

Is there anything else that can help him or help us care for him during this time?

Edit to add: Oh my goodness, thank you so much for all your answers, and I'm so glad I asked! I've taken notes and added to my order. I'll discuss some of the suggestions with his doctor and hospice. I know I'm going to appreciate having all these things at hand when he or I need them!"
Can I just vent? So Mama is in stage 5 dementia. She can still use the bathroom and amble around and warm up stuff in the microwave and is under the impression that she no longer needs to take baths or change clothes. I asked her what she wanted me to bring her to eat and she told me she wanted a cheeseburger and some blueberries (she's always loved them). She inhales the burger and says that the berries are the devil and must be thrown away! She grabs the whole container and dumps them in the trash right then! She tells me she wanted strawberries instead! She scared off the newest nurse the Home Health Care agency sent. She fought the CNA who was helping wipe dirt off her face. This is my life now. I've used more PTO at work in the last few months than I've used in almost 20 years. How do you all keep yourselves together? I'm not married but I'm an only child so there is nobody to share the duties. I just needed to vent because I have nobody who understands. My mom is only 70yo. Most of my friends' moms still drive and remember great details of things. What happened to my poor mom? She deserved to enjoy her retirement years.
"I am not going to force my family/spouse to take care of me, I am not going to taint their happy memories of me with memories of me with dementia. I watched my grandpa go to dementia when I was 11 to 14 and no. I am not going to subject ANYONE to that. Dementia is a horrible fucking disease. 

I don't want to be alive if I can't remember who I am, or how to eat or take care of myself. I am just a lifeless husk at that point, and I want to be long gone before  then."
"Hello everyone. I am conducting a survey for a school project on memory cafes as a way to help improve support for individuals struggling with the effects of dementia. I would appreciate it if you could take a moment to answer the questions! Thank you so much.

"My dad has pretty severe dementia, pretty weak overall. Honestly, I don't think he has much time left, but whatever time he has, we'd like for him to be comfortable. He's having a lot of difficulty getting out of chairs, and I'm thinking about getting a lazy-boy recliner with a power-lift capability.

Did anyone get something like this for their loved one with dementia, and was it a good purchase? Any suggestions, things for us to keep in mind?"
"Dementia is such an odd, awful disease. I'm just struck today (not for the first time) by the spectrum of mental capability my Dad exhibits day to day. There is nothing linear about the decline (well, maybe from a very high level). At a low level -- currently serving as his caregiver until we get a professional -- I'm just struck by how different he is day to day. One day he'll do nothing but sit and watch television and really just stare vacantly. Another he'll be belligerent and angry about the situation (as he perceives it which can also vary from thinking he needs to move to his ""real"" home or thinking he's staying in a hotel).

Yesterday he was as close to being my Dad as he has been in 6-9 months. If I wasn't looking closely, I could imagine that we'd be just discussing golf or the football game or whatever we did 2 years ago. Took his pills by himself, prepared his own meals, did things he hasn't done in a year (worked out!) and got to bed at a reasonable time.

Today? My Dad is gone. He called me ""the electrician"" because apparently he needs some electrical work done in his bedroom (likely a burned out bulb LOL). And, he acts as though he's in a motel and I'm the manager. The electrical work is needed in the ""Men's Room"" which, I guess, is the bathroom connected to his bedroom.

Just sad today. I got a taste of how easy and nice things used to be around here when he was still around. But, it also has served as a reminder and I'm more convinced than ever that my time as a caregiver needs to end. He's only going downhill from here and his needs will only increase.

His physical health is quite good which means 3-5 more years (probably) of ... this. Then you have to ask yourself not only if you want to do this for 3-5 more years but more and more and more as his condition declines. I think I have to do what I've been avoiding and make 2022 the year of the professional caregiver or even a facility.

Sad times. But, time to get my life back."
"hey folks! 

I am looking for early adopters of free anxiety management game-based app. 

I am myself disabled and doing my best to design the app as accessible as possible. 

I am trying to make the app provide a great experience for folks with dementia this year. 

Please DM me if interested. My app is free and doesn't need any registration."
"My Dad was in my home for 4 months. Staying alone, used cameras to keep watch. He drove off twice in his truck before I put gps and retrieved him the third time after which we finally got a doctor who actually helped. Got meds that tamped down his manic states and now almost 9 months later we seem to have some stability he thinks he doesn’t have his license and hasn’t driven.  But recently his main caregiver is out for knee surgery and he seems to be attacking her for taking him all around. Claims she spent $600 of his on Xmas (impossible) and drove him all over. Wondering if this happens a lot? He was ( to me) getting along famously with this particular caregiver."
"Hello and thank you in advance for any assistance provided. I’ve read a couple of threads from people who use marijuana as a way to curb/alleviate certain moods/episodes/symptoms, but never any mention of actual dosing. My grandmother has been having periods (one day great, the next day spiraling with crying, depressive episodes (about things that happened decades ago) or just general apathy and they subside a few hours later and it appears that she has no recollection of them.) After hearing positive stories about the use of marijuana, we (her family) would like to explore this option for her in hopes of making her day to day more comfortable. Any insight would be appreciated."
"Hey Guys,
I know Lewy Body is high value and a relative passed away 2 hours ago. We’re struggling to find a place that would be interested. Does anyone have anyone that takes quick donations?
Thanks"
"My mom is mid-stage and is rapidly progressing. I'm staying with her in her one bedroom apartment while in town to help her with some stuff and get her ready for assisted living. 

She roams ENDLESSLY between 8pm & 11pm. It's so unnerving and has me on edge all the time. She stays mainly in her bedroom opening and closing drawers, bags, etc. Sometimes she shuffles around the living room where I'm sleeping. It's eerie and haunting. (I'm pretty sure when she's gone, I'll wake up to the sound of her shoes slowly shuffling across the floor.) 

When she's done roaming, she must just fall into bed because she barely moves the covers down and wakes in the morning fully clothed with makeup smeared all over her face. For someone whose vanity was always top routine, this is difficult to witness.

This evening I tried to suggest she get some night clothes out for bed and she got pissy and defensive with me. I took that's my cue to get out of her sight and left her to do her nightly roaming.

Are there any ways to help gently persuade someone with dementia to take better care of themselves in getting ready for bed and then getting into bed?"
"Worked and slaved and cooked and cleaned 7 days a week, just to have to listen to my dad screaming at us constantly:
""I'm being railroaded!""
""You kidnapped me!""
""No one around here knows anything!""
""No one around here ever does anything to help me!""
""I'm calling the police and going back home and you'll be in prison!""
""Stop calling me Dad.. I never had kids!""


My dad regularly tried to make phone calls with the TV remote, tried to shave with the phone, and tried to change TV channels with his electric razor. But he was still coherent enough to tell me that he hated me and my home, all the while asking for sexual favors from my wife, my daughter, my daughter in law, and his granddaughter. Had it been legal, Id have taken him out and shot him. He was never a father to me, he was always a guy who let me know I wasnt important in his life.

Then, when his last wife passed and non one else was there, he landed in my lap. I woke up every day to care for him. He'd look me in the face and call me ""ma'am"" and deny that I was his son. He absolutely hated me and wanted away from me every fucking day.

But.... Literally, the day we got him placed in a nursing home, the staffers were calljng me saying he wanted to speak with his son and named me by my full birth name.

I don't care anymore. I hope he dies soon so that I dont have to deal with his bank or his taxes or his pharmacy or his underwear, or any of my step-siblings that told me ""well, hes not my dad"" but still call me asking if they have an inheritance coming any time soon...

Fuck them all. Fuck him, fuck them, fuck it. I'd sooner put a slug through mt head than be a caregiver ever again.


Rant over."
"Last week Hospice said our grandmother is at the terminal restlessness stage and tonight our dad sent a message that our grandmother is refusing to eat and drink. From what we’ve read she could pass away soon. She seems to remember us when we call, but she is calling out to her deceased sister repeatedly. Has anyone in this group experienced this with a family member? She took a major decline in a matter of a month. My visits in November to December it was like a completely different person. Our dad is suggesting we not visit her anymore because he wants our last memories to not be how she is now. I want to see her but maybe he’s right? My sisters and I are torn."
"Mum told me that she thought people on her television couldn't see her, but now she's certain they can.  She was eating a sandwich while watching Al Jazeera.  She said the presenter told her off for eating in front of them while thousands were starving.  She said she didn't know whether to keep eating her sandwich or what to do...  She went on to tell me there is one news presenter who smiles at her, so she always smiles back.

 Bless her soul.  Sad and funny in the same moment."
"My dad was diagnosed with mild/moderate Alzheimer’s a month ago and my mum isn’t being patient. They’ve been married for 50 years. The diagnosis was not a shock, for the last 12 months we’ve noticed changes.

She’s 5 years younger and is super sharp. She’s not cutting him any slack, telling him he’s wrong about stuff, telling him to hurry up. Pointing out that his weird stories about the past aren’t true (he embellishes stories about his youth but I’d listen to them all day long if I could) but she can’t let it go. 

She’s constantly pointing out that he’s losing/hiding stuff or dressing odd (textbook, harmless stuff). She understands (or seems to) that he lives in a slightly different reality now (even tho he’s still very much himself, most of the time) but sometimes it’s like she behaves like she can nag him out of cognitive decline. Like she can nag him out of the new, unusual habits he’s forming, like her snapping at him for not following complex plots on TV will suddenly make him understand when in reality IT IS JUST MAKING HIM FEEL LIKE SHIT. 

I can’t get through to her that she is making herself the enemy which she cannot be if wants to be his caregiver in the future (which she insists she does). His perception of her will be that she is lying when she’s telling him he’s wrong which will erode trust. She doesn’t seem willing to adjust her behaviour, learn about how the disease will change his behaviour, learn about coping mechanisms and tiny little adjustments that she can make (even just laying out his clothes for him, instead of letting him pick his clothes which she then complains about.. if she feels so strongly about which clothes he should wear, why would she expect him to chose exactly what she thinks he should wear when she knows that decision making is something he will be struggling with now).

I cannot argue with her about it, I know she’s struggling to adjust but it’s almost like she’s increased the nagging since he got his diagnosis, speeding up the pace of her conversations (that she KNOWS he will not be able to keep up with). She and I have had some great, in depth conversations about how we as a family can make life easier for him and us but she is not putting any of it into practice. It’s almost like she lets him make the mistakes so that she can nag him about it afterwards. Why is she doing this?

I can feel myself getting angry with her for being so stubborn and I am biting my lip for fear of arguing with her but I am also terrified that if she doesn’t adjust soon, my dad will associate her with negativity as his condition progresses. I am very very close to her but I don’t know how to get through to her that her being like this is destructive. 

Has anyone else encountered this? I understand that she is in the early stages of losing the man she’s known since she was a teenager but what happens if she simply can’t adjust?"
"Hi! This project consists of 30% of mark so is very important to me. Please fill out this survey on memory cafés for people struggling with the effects of dementia!

"FIL is falling a lot now and it's only a matter of time until he breaks something (actually he broke his finger already). He's in memory care and has gone to the hospital twice for wound care (stitches the first time, the second time just needed cleaning up). He won't use a walker or wheelchair consistently and I was wondering if anyone here found a trick to get their LO to use something to help them move around. He's in the later stages of dementia at this point and struggles to understand most things. Sometimes he's not recognizing his son. So it will be hard to get anything across from a rational perspective."
"Good morning! I am my grandmothers live in caretaker and I looking for some advice. She has had dementia for years and after my grandfather died three years ago she has heavily declined. She does not brush her teeth and she does not clean herself, she also has accidents in her depends every day. She is physically capable of taking care of herself but I think she is really depressed so she doesn’t. My mother is going to do a zoom call with the doctor and my grandmother this week to see about getting hospice care and a prescription for depends. Is there any specific way I should ask my mom to phrase things so I get the help I need? My grandma is refusing the idea of a nurse but I am desperate for help. I also have my two kids under five. She used to be the kindest person on the planet but now she is a really angry and bossy person who doesn’t care if she runs me to the ground and said she would rather see me leave than have me bring a nurse in. The sad part is that she is penniless and I am the only relative left who will live with her as she has already burned out three other families. I live in the US and I’ve heard that insurance will cover someone coming in. Thank you so much for any insight!"
"Last 8 years, i have devoted myself to take care of my grandmother who was diagnose with dementia. During the hours of sleepless nights and tiresome days, i would only receive 2-3 hours of pay daily. i'm happy to state that she was finally confirmed full care, 40 hours weekly. I can finally get paid for the amount of work i actually put in. I honestly thought i would be forced to debt by taking care of my grandmother but now, im not to worried."
"Now that we FINALLY have an actual diagnosis showing vascular dementia, we have a few more options as far as help goes. A friend of mine went through the same things with her dad that we are with my grandmother, and she suggested calling hospice as they can help keep her comfortable as she slowly-but-progressively declines. While we have the meeting tomorrow, I’m still not completely sure what all to expect. Has anyone else gone this route as well? 

Her current condition is more bad days than good ones, she remembers me, my sister, my mom, my husband (all the people who are here regularly), but it’s hit or miss with most other people. She’s delusional to the point it can sometimes be detrimental (like waiting on her husband to come take her somewhere, even though shes not been married in 30+ years). Incontinent and is getting more and more unsteady every day. She’s also sleeping a LOT more when she finally falls asleep. But it could also take her nearly 48 hours to fall asleep. Luckily, that issue is getting less common, but we have to shake her awake to make sure she’s getting some food/fluids in her every so often.. 

It *almost* makes me miss the days where she wandered all over, getting into crap all over her house 😆"
"I’m interested to hear about some of the less obvious / subtle signs there was something wrong.

EDIT: thank you for your responses! I’m concerned about my mother showing early signs of dementia, which runs on her side of the family. 

For example: mixing up ingredients for recipes she makes regularly, using expired ingredients, questionable hygiene habits, misplaced aggression and skepticism, general personality changes, inability to keep up during conversations, needing things repeated multiple times, loss of social graces and saying inappropriate things during conversation, and most prominent (I think) of all… the constant ‘stream of consciousness’ chatter. It’s never ending and so difficult to follow her as she just flows from one unrelated topic to another."
"My Pop-Pop (mid-late 60s) is showing early signs of dementia. He is constantly loosing things, he’s snapping at people and getting angry and sad easily, he’s starting to forget many things, he acts way differently than he used to,  and he sometimes struggles to form sentences.

This is scaring me because I don’t know if I’m mentally ready to lose him (wow that sounds really selfish now that I think about it). Growing up without a father meant that he was one of the only male influences in my life. He taught me so much. Hearing him starting to lose that personality that he had when I was younger is just heart breaking. He’s even told me what to do when he does die and he said he wants me to have his Vietnam medals and my dad’s old trophies from High school when he dies. I have to hold back tears every time because I just hate hearing him ramble on about how it’s getting to be “his time”. 

It seems as if he’s accepted his fate and is ready to go. That makes it hurt even more seeing him so accepting of what’s happening to him

It’s heartbreaking seeing the man he’s turned into. He freaks out more often, he talks frequently about his own death, and he refuses no matter how much I beg him to go to the doctor.  

I’m scared man. I just hope he’s ok."
"I don’t know if my dad has dementia, but he’s survived several brain tumors that have caused memory issues and degrading cognitive functions over the past years. For instance I have to remind him to swallow his food, or sometimes he’ll take a sip of water and it sits in his mouth for several minutes until I remind him.  He loses track of time and sometimes stays awake until 6am and gets heavily disoriented if he takes a nap. He’s left the stove fire on once and forgot while watching TV. 

I work full time and have hired homecare to watch him during the week, but on the weekend I drive over to take care of him. In the beginning I was patient, but I feel myself becoming more and more frustrated and I feel like a horrible person because of it. 

My question that I need help with is that my dad does irregular things constantly that I keep reminding him over and over about, like not to use too much toilet paper (he has clogged the toilet several times and the landlord was super close to kicking him out). He’ll use 5 stacked paper plates to heat up a single muffin.

Do I stop reminding him not to do these things? I feel like I’ve become a nag and it doesn’t seem like he remembers any of it. Everytime I tell him not to do it, he just nods and says okay, then does it again an hour later. 

I don’t want to be a nag and I was hoping that repetition might help, but at this point do I just give up and let him do whatever he wants and clean up after him? Is letting him just do his thing better than constantly reminding him? 

Any insight would be much appreciated."
"They tried to do cardiac catheterization on my mother a week and a half ago but she didn’t cooperate, and I wasn’t allowed in the hospital to try to calm her down because our local hospital has outlawed visitors due to high covid rates in the area.

My mother needs a cardiac catheterization procedure. I would like her to have this for her quality of life. They want to try again in two months.

Had anyone here had the same issue?"
"So my stepdad has recently been progressing from mild dementia and has a difficult time reading and understanding labels. We share the tub/shower in my bathroom as the other 2 are just half baths, I use more products than my stepfather so I keep mine in a caddy in the shower. My mom will set up his towel and clean clothes in the bathroom for him prior to his shower and will show him where his shampoo and body wash is before he gets in the shower. About 3 weeks ago my stepfather had a shower and later told my mom he really liked the new body wash that was in the tub. My mom was a bit confused by that as he has been using the same container of body wash for a month and it is still half full. She asked him what kind of body wash it was and he said it was in a ""pretty"" purple bottle, I was in the room when he told her and I broke down laughing. The new body wash he was using is my feminine hygiene wash.

His body wash is now in a separate caddy with a big R on it (first initial of his name) lol"
My dad has dementia and he is bedridden. My mom is one of my father's caregivers. She works a full time job and takes care of him too. I work a full time job far from home so I only visited on weekends and holidays. I feel bad because I know my mom has a lot on her plate and I can't do anything to help. I feel guilty because I'm having fun and living life and she is at home in a prison.
"I’m editing this because I talk too much. 

Have you ever gone to appt for the person with dementia without them? They have all his permissions and I’ve been with him to appointments. He is agitated and is refusing to go on Monday, but wants me to go. Is this even possible?

Eta: dad has agreed to go with me if I do all the talking! It’s a start."

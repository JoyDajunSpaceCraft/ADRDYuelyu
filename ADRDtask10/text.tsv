My mother is rapidly declining and I’m extremely frustrated that despite all the recent evidence that FMT could be an incredibly effective treatment, it’s not being made available or being promoted. Does anyone have more information on this?

She gets freaked out and tells the people who work at her senior living place that she needs them to call me to come get her and starts crying because she thinks she doesn't live there. She's lived there for 4 years. After a while she'll settle into her apartment and everything will be ok. I'm just wondering at what point will she start wandering, because that's the day they say she has to go to memory care.	0
Hello! My girlfriends dad has Alzheimer's. It's a stage where he has just now been moved to a full time care taking facility. He got moved there last week, and she just visited him there for the first time. Some people in her family keeps telling her, that she isn't doing enough. Which is not okay in my eyes. Obviously she is very affected, and especially because he keeps asking to come home again, which breaks her heart and in turn mine. And so, i was just wondering if you guys have any advice for me, as to how i can really support her in this, because it's a little hard for me to really understand her feelings, since I've never been in that situation. And if you have advice i could bring her that might have helped some of you guys cope?  Thanks alot, and i wish you all the best of luck through your difficult times.	0
Is this normal?  At first we weren't allowed to because of covid and so she could get settled, but then it was because she wouldn't remember us and would upset her?  She's already passed, but this bothers me still.	0
"My grandfather was in the navy, he was known as onion for his tendency to make other men cry. I'm visiting my grandparents for the first time in years and he needed help finding the light switch in his own home to go upstairs to bed. I showed him where but he turned it on and then off so I told him ""you hit it twice"" and he replied ""just fix it""  I’ve known how bad it can be for a while but now it's really hitting me hard. I need to fly back in a couple weeks and leave my poor old grandma to help him all on her own. First I've cried in years, because sure I'd be sad if anything happened to my parents, the difference is that my grandparents are kind hearted pure people who took me in for a crucial couple of years that turned my life around. My mother was negligent and by grade 4 I couldn’t read or write, I didn’t even know left from right, literally.  My nan shouldn’t have to start nursing again at her age but she’s convinced pop wouldn’t be happy without her care. Caring for him is so demanding but she wouldn’t hear a bar of putting him into someone else’s care, even brought up the plot of The Leisure Seeker to me 😂 I guess she can relate to that movie but of course wouldn’t do that"	0
My dad was diagnosed with mild/moderate Alzheimers in December 2021 after memory clinic assessment and review of brain scans from Sept 2021. We informed the DVLA of this in December 2021 and have received a holding letter to apologise for the delay in their reaction to whether it’s okay for my father to continue driving. My mother and I do not feel he is safe to drive, he had an accident in August 2021 which was entirely his fault, his reactions are not what they were and the mobility in his legs is effected (he shuffles a lot and gets cramps in his leg muscles) and we of course we informed the memory clinic nurse of our worries discreetly. As I’m sure is the case with a lot of men in their mid/late seventies who have just received this diagnosis, he says he feels no different at all and gets very defensive when we try to discuss his diagnosis and we think he hasn’t got a full grasp on what his diagnosis means (due to the condition, no doubt). Today, he received a letter from the consultant at the same memory clinic to say that he will be having a telephone assessment (due to Covid) regarding his ability to continue driving. Has this been the case for other people, he is of course going to tell the consultant and the memory clinic that he feels that he is fine to drive?! Does anyone UK based know if this is normal? He was just starting to get used to my mother being the driver and we’re desperately worried that if the NHS/DVLA tell him that he’s okay to continue driving based upon a telephone assessment (HOW CAN THEY MAKE THIS ASSESSMENT ON THE PHONE?) it will become a huge source of conflict if we try to stop him. Any UK based experience similar to this with DVLA/NHS would be greatly appreciated.	0
It started all of a sudden. My mom passed away on 07.07.2020. Her departure had a great impact on my dad as they were together for 42 years. From 2nd half of 2021 (June or July may be) we started observing some abnormalities like some illogical statements and questions(which were very occasional and unnoticable). But from then we noticed his excessive fascination towards sweet foods including ice creams, cakes, chocolates, candies etc. He has diabetes but he started eating candies and ice creams whenever he went out alone. I talked to the local grocery shop who informed me that Dad on average takes 5 to 10 ice creams daily. I was very annoyed on him because of this childish behavior because till then I didn't realized that he developed something like dementia or Alzheimer's. Things kept going like this till this year. Last week my dad left home in the midnight and when he got back I asked him why he left home and he couldn't answer me and he was very confused. That time I realized something is wrong with him which needs medical attention. Next day I rushed to a neurologist who told me that he has developed dementia and prescribed few medications including Donepezil Hydrochloride INN 5 mg tab once in the night, Quetiapine Fumerate 25 mg 2 tabs in the night and Ginkgo Biloba 60 MG tab twice a day. Since we started The meds he started hallucinating throughout the day. After a couple of days I contracted with the with the doc and he told me to discontinue Donepezil and continue the rest. But till today there is no progress and his deteriorating each day. I'm really confused whether this is because of the meds prescribed or his progressing so fast. Is it really possible to deteriorate within a week?? I have done extensive research for lost couple of days and discovered Alzheimer's is also termed as type 3 diabetes which leads to excessive fascination towards sweet foods because of some chemical imbalance in the brain. My doctor didn't tell me anything like this. Later I came across some researches which shows nasal insulin helps  Alzheimer's patients to some extent. I really want to try that out. Anyone ever tried Nasal insulin for Alzheimer's  or dementia?? I know it is not conclusive or approved yet, but I cannot see my dad suffering without any medical care.	0
My 70yo father-in-law has late-stage Alzheimer’s. He is very fond of me, always asking where I am, when I am going to his house, etc. He’s bedridden for years. Completely lost the ability to take care of himself.   One day he suddenly told my husband he wanted to rape me (behind my back) and my husband just laughed it off and expected me to do the same, because he thinks he’s delirious and will soon die so we should be lenient.   While I know he isn’t a threat (not sure if he means what he said though), I still feel disgusted. I told my husband I wouldn’t see him anymore because I simply don’t know what to do or what to feel. Husband feels hurt and upset with me. He thinks it will be a blow to his family.   Any advice please? :( Really appreciate that!	0
My grandmother does not take her depression pills. We are not sure about the cause, could be both attention seeking and simple forgetfulness, but the issue is serious as she once already had a temporary psychotic episode (thinking there are people in her house, that someone locked her inside even though she just lost her keys), due  to taking the pills and then abruptly stopping.      Unfortunately, after that we had to get her to an old people's house as we live in a totally different city and the family that is there does not pay enough attention to her to keep her on her toes with her pills. However, she is a very assertive, and proud person so we think it is best that once she is comfortably back on her meds to let her live alone again, if she so desires.     To that end I am looking for some intelligent contraptions, perhaps with a camera, that will track whether my grandmother actually does take her meds, and notify us wirelessly. Did any of you have experience with similar machines? Do you have any to recommend?	0
"My grandmother was diagnosed when i was about 7-8 years old. I lived only with her and my mother, so i had to take care of her when she had her first stage of the disease while my mother was working. I was too young to realize how terrible this disease is, so at first it didn't make me feel wrong about it. I used to walk out my grandma, so in fact i was watching after her instead of her watching after me. Giving food, helping as much as i can, i did everything, and life still didn't seem to be bad or different from how it's supposed to be. Soon, maybe, at the age of 10, it started to get worse, grandma started to be way more agressive, and whem mom wasn't at home she could hit me or start yelling curses for no reason. I think that's the moment when i started to realize everything. I am 15 now, and i am exhausted. As it got worse, when grandma started to yell at night or at any other time, I can't stand it anymore. Of course i don't take care of her as i used to before, i am not physically able to do that, so everything lays on my mother's shoulders. I think it's obvious that it causes her to be an extremly nervous person, i know the reasons and can't blame her, but it feels so unsafe in this world when even her, the only person that is supposed to be for me the strongest one and ""protect"" me is not dealing with all these things. I could even say that i feel like the only adult in our apartment, as i always support my mother and be her psychologist. I lost my interest in many things, i don't see my future at all, like i am tied to a chain that doesn't let me live my life normally. Last two-three years seem to be the most difficult to me. I also started to have problems with my nevres too, seeing nightmares and feeling things that i don't want to feel at all. My health is also deteriorating in the face of this. It makes me estrange from my friends, i always feel like i am ""incomplete"" when i talk to them, knowing that they don't have to deal with the same things i do. I started to convince myself that i should be grateful for that: my situation made me question at lof ot things in my life earlier that i should have, and I always hear that i am a pretty mature person. But do i want all these things instead of a fun childhood and unforgettable youth? And it comes to anger, when they complain about anything in their lifes, which is a very wrong reaction, and since i can't talk about it with anyone, all this anger sits inside my head all the time. If i tell my friends, there is no way they understand or help me, so i want to at least make them think that i have a normal life. My mother seems to realize how it affects on me, but she doesn't want to admit it (in which i don't blame her at all), so despite how stupid it sounds, it makes me feel like there's no one in the world who can understand me. I am sure that there are people of my age who deal with that, but i never had a chance to meet them, and searching on internet didn't help too. About a half a year ago i visited one alzheimer forum that was on my language, and people on it didn't take me seriously and thought that i am a troll cause of my age and cause that i was writing without any mistakes on my native language. That was the last time i had any hopes to find some understanding from other people. All i want is to have a normal life, or at least go through it without damaging myself too much. I have thoughts that i don't want to have, i feel separeted from my friends that are living differenetly, and i feel how my grandma's disease dragging me to thevery bottom of excistens. I can't study in school normally, can't enjoy my interests and that's only because of my family problem that is not leaving my head even for a moment. We can't send grandma to a specified hospital, because it is very expensive for us, and mom doesn't want to let her be in a free hospital, beacuse it's patients are usually dying in a short period of time, and that's why it feels hopeless for me. I have two more years in school to study, and that's not even a fact that i will be able to leave my mother and grandma when i end school. I am not even sure if i am ready to leave my mother along with that problem. Two months ago i had my last hope - a psychologist. I finally was enough brave to visit a doctor, but the result wasn't pleasant at all. The only thing i got is ""finding the problem"" using ""metaphorical cards"", and i was told that i am coping my grandmother's behaivour, which didn't help the situation in any way so i pretended that it was helpful and stopped visiting her. She was a good person, but didn't seem to know how to help me. I started to be paranoic, feeling like my mother and me are going to get alzeimers too, since my second grandma that is living in other country has this disease too, and i am not going to get a normal life ever. I started to have questionable ideologies in my head. I feel like my mind is corrupted, i feel like i am dying. I find my peace in music, but for how many years is it going to help me going trought this? Asking ""what should i do"" is pointless, as i know that there's nothing can be done.   I just needed to share this with at least anyone, thank you for reading."	0
"I'd appreciate your opinions on this question. The situation is this: A couple in their late 70s, slowing down but still fully independent, have been in their current home for 10+ years, so it's very familiar, but also a bit too big for them. Wife was recently diagnosed with early onset, so anyone's guess as to how quickly things will progress.   With the market as it is, they were thinking of selling their house and getting a condo, but now with this diagnosis, the question is should they:   (a) stay in the house, as it's more familiar, but may not be as safe and will get more difficult to maintain,   (b) buy a condo as planned but potentially run into issues with familiarity if the Alzheimer's progresses quickly, or   (c) get a condo or apartment in a senior living building, with 24 hr available support on site, meals in a dining room, etc., but still risk the lack of familiarity plus the fear that being around others like this will ""age us faster"".   I appreciate any insight into the options, or maybe other options we haven't considered."	0
Mom is going to start looking at memory care facilities but is worried about dad being kicked out because he exhibits frustrated/aggressive behavior on occasion. So far it isn't anything violent but his dad, who also most likely had alzheimers, was kicked out of his assisted living facility because he was violent toward a nurse. I guess my question is, what behaviors will get dad ejected from a memory care facility or what type of facility should we be looking for that can handle patients with violent behavior?	0
my mum has alz close to 11 years, She is now admitted to hospice care and I was told the end is near...What helped you deal with this? Any tips ? I really don't know what to do	0
"Partly just to vent.  My dad is doing his best to care for my mom and us kids try to share some responsibility to help when we can.  I have not seen the exact diagnosis for what my mom has...I believe my dad that it's Alzheimers but it feels like it has manifested a little differently from most peoples' experiences.  She is not yet at the point of forgetting who people are, not at all.  However she does forget the events of the day or any plans, and will ask over and over what time such-and-such is happening, unless the events are pretty significant like someone's death.  For example, every time I have seen her for the past year, she brings up how hard it must be for the family of someone who died of Covid over a year ago now.  Her main issue is overwhelmingly strong compulsions to do the few things she is still able to do.  She cannot sew, knit, do puzzles, watch TV/movies, or play games of any kind, and generally refuses to read books or just sit still.  All of these things seem to be overwhelming to her and she can't even get started on them.  This is what she can do:  * Dishes and laundry (when she feels like it, and doesn't last long)  * Check her email, Facebook, and mass-collect free eBooks (all trashy, but she has no idea; this also does not last more than a few hours per day)  * Go on long walks up and down the road picking up trash (she has never gotten lost)  * Recently, overeating any snacks she can find  If allowed to, she would walk endlessly, to the point of physically harming herself, but pain apparently doesn't register as a reason to stop.  When it's in her head, every 2 minutes she will beg and plead and find any excuse, swear that she won't walk for the rest of the week if you only let her go for a little while.  If you do extract a promise that it will be a short walk, she will go right past where you say she can (GPS tracker is a godsend).  If it was someone fully in control of their faculties, I would call it manipulative or sneaky, but it's the compulsion talking.  She takes every tiny candy wrapper all the way outside to the trash can just to get the experience of walking briefly.  For mother's day we took her to a state park to walk a trail together and on the drive home when we were all exhausted she was hinting that she wanted to go walk as soon as we got home.  She can't be left alone anymore, sometimes even when you're home with her.  Hiding shoes doesn't help, she has gone out barefoot at least once.  Locks are not really a good solution in case of emergencies.  She will also wear clothing inappropriate to the weather and takes a long period of adjustment to stop wearing coats in the heat (now) and start wearing them in the winter.  Fortunately she does seem to not want to walk when it's clearly raining or snowing, and on those days doesn't even ask.  Easiest days we have.  She likes going to any store as well, whether you need to or not.  If she can't walk, she wants to go to Wal-Marts or local bakeries, and just does a circuit with you as you pick up the few things you need (due to constant visits on her behalf).  And asks constant questions about stopping anywhere else as well.  Recently we have had to hide food because she will sneak any snacks she can find.  If you tell her to stop, she just smiles like ""oh I'm being so naughty,"" but doesn't realize she's been doing it constantly.  Yesterday when all food was out of reach, she was caught eating dog treats. :(  She was over at my house with dad today working on some outdoor chores.  Because it's unfamiliar territory she couldn't walk, and because we weren't indoors she couldn't snack.  I think she short-circuited and asked to go to the bathroom 6 times in 30 minutes, because there just wasn't anything else to do.  She also found bits of trash on the sidewalk and put it in my garbage cans even though we asked her to stop.  She is on daily pills and a few times we have given her a Tylenol PM in the morning and that has helped a ton...but this isn't really something we should do long term.  I've been curious what affect something like Adderall might have on her, but doctors will not prescribe anything other than what she is on, and just say she requires constant care.  Dad is having a terrible time.  I want to be able to do more but my sisters and I all have jobs and other demands.  Is there anything we can do about these overwhelming compulsions?  Is there any activity we haven't thought of to try to have her do that might keep her attention?"	0
Sorry for the bad English, I'm not a native speaker.  I have been researching the combination of curcumin with piperine (to improve curcumin absorption and bioavailability) and research into its effects on alzheimer's, memory loss and cognitive decline in general, but found very few human studies despite there are studies with rats of curcumin and its effects, and although curcumin is safe, after all they are common spice substances, and there is a study that shows that piperine increases the bioavailability of curcumin by 2000%, is there any study that has done this test? have you tested the combination of these compounds combined for these causes?  At clinically relevant dosages?	0
It is undeniable that explaining Alzheimer’s to children is no simple task. Children may not understand why their grandparent, who once used to take care of them, picked them up from school or gave them a snack, can no longer do those things. Therefore, the first thing we should do is to **explain to the child what is happening to their grandparent in language that is suitable for the child’s age**.  “Your grandpa (or grandma) has Alzheimer’s, a disease that causes the brain to forget things.” But Alzheimer’s is not just memory loss, and the child needs to be able to understand all the other symptoms little by little.  Reassure your child with [simple, honest explanations of the disease.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/caregivers/in-depth/alzheimers/art-20043890)	0
My grandmother has got alzheimer's for about 1 year, I moved in with her 5months ago. I have always noticed the situation getting worse. I keep telling her something over and over until she gets it. I understand that what she say is not what she means and she'll say hurtful things and I have always not cared about her insults. But recently her situation worsened and all these methods are not working anymore. I found myself scolding her today, im so so sorry. I dont know what to do. She doesnt want to eat her meds but thats another shitshow too long to explain.	0
As the title states, my mother (70) was diagnosed in October and is going downhill rapidly, imo.  Just last month, she was able to remember what happened that day. She was able to remember appointments she had, maybe not the exact date, but she remembered. She, pretty much, remembered what I told her during our visits.  I visited her yesterday and she's so much worse. She asked the same questions over and over. She couldn't remember what she said just minutes before. I just answered her like she'd never asked those questions before. She kept saying she needed a haircut and I'd answer, for the 4th time, that she has an appointment for next month. She couldn't remember Dr appointments she just had. I'm so afraid that next month she won't remember me. I'm so worried for her and it breaks my heart. I guess I just wanted to vent.  Also, some of you may see this twice, as I accidentally posted in r/Alzheimersgroup. I feel badly, so I deleted. I didn't know it was specifically for people with Alzheimer's.	0
Hi all! My dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s about two years ago. My mom is his only caregiver and he’s declining pretty fast. He is still able to dress himself (though it’s usually dirty laundry because he can’t remember where the clean clothes are) and his memory is about 3 minutes now. He’s starting to get a little angrier than before when he can’t remember to do something and he gets really down on himself. They are both amazing people. They live about 1.5 hours away and I try to see them as often as possible. Does anyone have advice on what to do to support the other parent? I try to call my mom as often as possible but I cannot imagine how hard this must be for her as well. She isn’t able to go out or even really leave the house. I’ve contemplated moving down there to help out (I’m an only child and our closest family is about 8 hours away) so it could make her life a little easier and she would be able to get out of the house. He’s at the point where he can’t be left alone anymore. I’m nervous I’ll regret not moving down there and helping out before things take a turn for the worse. I’m not trying to make this about myself, just having a lot of mixed emotions. Has anyone been in this situation and can give some advice? Am I overthinking everything? Has anyone moved to help take care of their parent? Please help. Thank you all in advance.	0
Has anyone here come across an automatic medicine dispenser that is worth the $.   Ideally, it would be programmable and dispense the medicine for that date/time (my dad takes meds 2x daily).   Would be even more awesome if it had some sort of notification/alarm that lets the person know it’s time to take meds.   Wishful thinking perhaps, but thought I’d ask.   TIA!	0
my mom is in late stage and has some bruises from sitting too long in the wheelchair.  I don't mind shelling out 400 dollars for the Roho high profile seat cushion but the home health nurse today recommended the purple royal seat cushion (for car or office) at 99 dollars..Not sure why she recommended a cheap cushion but based on experience, is there a big difference between roho vs. cheaper seat cushion? Which would you go with?	0
I am from Bangladesh. I lost my mom due to coronavirus in July 2020. She was then 63 years old. After departure of my mom, I slowly started witnessing some behavioral change of my dad. He is now 75 years old. Since last year he started showing some behavioral changes and instances of memory loss. Sometimes it sounded like he lost his logics. He would remember memories of decades ago but forgets recent memories like every day tasks. For last few days he was having some hallucinations. Couple of days back. He left home at midnight and after a few hours he got back and I asked him where did you go. He was staring at me like clueless and he couldn't remember why he left home in the midnight. I got very nervous and perplexed. I rushed to a neurologist who told me that he is having dementia which is probably due to Alzheimer's disease. I immediately started medicines but I am very afraid and concerned about my dad's health. Can anyone tell me at which stage he is currently in by looking into the symptoms I mentioned? How long does it usually take to graduate to next step? Please help!	0
Hello, basically I just came home and my grandma didn’t know I was home, I heard her talking and assumed she was on the phone, but I look round and she’s talking to an empty chair, but the way she’s looking is as ifs someone is sitting in the chair. Is this a sign of Alzheimer’s? Or something else, sorry if this is the wrong place	0
"Hi - my dad has vascular dementia and my mum has Alzheimers.  They moved into a specialised dementia home about a month ago.  (Both are in their early 80s)  My mum  is trying hard to adjust and settle in, but dad just isn't even trying.  He says he feels perfectly fine and doesn't need to be in there ""with all the crazies"" and he wants to go home. When we try to explain to him that it's not safe at home for them, he argues and gets upset. When we try to explain why his behaviours are unsafe he says that ""he was just joking"" when he did/said [whatever it was].  He basically lacks any insight into his illness, and I just don't know how to deal with him - not to mention the intense guilt I feel about helping to move them both in (my sister and I have PoA and Guardianship) even though I know it's the right thing to do.  My mum does have some insight into her condition, which helps.  Does anyone have any suggestions or ideas on what to say when he gets upset and angry about his new situation?"	0
My 88 year old grandpa is an amazing person. Like seriously one of the most kind, hardworking, compassionate, intelligent, loving people I’ve ever known in my 27 years of life. But he is slipping more and more every day with this awful disease. He is also a Vietnam and Korean war vet. He and my grandma helped raise me; they were huge parts of my life. He has loved my grandma for 67 years, and loved her so incredibly well. He would go to the ends of the earth for her, do absolutely anything for her. He’s just as in love with her now as he was when they first fell in love, except now he doesn’t make much sense when he talks and I know eventually he’s going to forget us including her (if he doesn’t pass away first—he is 88 after all). I can’t stand it.  I can’t stand that they had to have my Aunts (their children) sell their house—the house that I frequently visited as a child and even temporarily lived in with them for a time—so they could move into a nursing home. And my grandma who is still of sound mind has to witness the love of her life decline every single day (they were placed in the same room). She’s one of the strongest people I’ve ever known.  At their old house (that now belongs to someone else), we’d drive down to the train station with Subway sandwiches and just watch the trains go by while chowing down. My grandpa was very knowledgeable about trains and locomotive history and it was fun to hear him tell me things while we sat there. The train station had a park attached to it and we’d go take walks there. I know those days are long gone and I’m an adult now, been an adult for a while, but it doesn’t make this process any easier. I’ve never lost a loved one before. This will be my first time and I know it’s going to be extremely difficult. Thank you for letting me vent, and I appreciate this subreddit; at least I know I’m not alone.	0
Two of my brothers were visiting my Mom who is in a memory care nursing facility, and they called me and put me on speaker phone so I could wish my Mom a Happy Mother’s Day. That thoughtfulness meant the world to me.  My Mom is in stage 7 and doesn’t have much time left on this earth. I’m wishing all of you out there with mothers with Alzheimer’s a Happy Mother’s Day with your mothers and hoping you remember the good times like I’m doing today. ❤️	0
My mom (65F) is looking into purchasing one in hopes that it will slow my step dads (68M) memory loss down. He was diagnosed in January.   Has anybody here had any luck with a hyperbaric chamber?	0
This is my throwaway, I have gone NC/very low contact with my mother.   She has hit him/shaken him up pretty bad. Today I was stopping by to pick up some mail that was sent to her house instead of mine and I heard screaming. “I hate you”, “I could kill you”, “you’re an idiot”, “you son of a bitch”. I intervened and she let up but he’s alone with her all day. He was holding his head so I think she hurt him but I didn’t see any obvious marks/bruising. He cannot live with me, our house is too small and I work 13 hours a day so I’m never home and he needs 24 hour care at this point. She locks him in the home, he hasn’t been outside in months. Only goes out for dr appts.   What can I do? She’s his POA. He has money but she makes him sign over the checks he gets sent in the mail (I believe retirement or social security?). She won’t let me look at anything, nothing from doctors, no paperwork so I’m very limited in what I know besides he doesn’t know who anyone is and can’t take care of himself at all. I’m at a loss. If I call the police on her my dad loses his main caregiver, and she WILL retaliate on my partner and I. She’s always been an awful mother to me, which is why NC happened in the first place. Now that her kids have left her she’s taking out all the anger she used to abuse us, she’s turned onto my Dad. I really am unsure how to approach this situation. Any help is appreciated and hope you all and your loved ones are well.	0
My dad has been fading from Alzheimer’s / dementia for about 10 years. This last year, he’s faded a lot faster. He had been living at home until toileting issues and agitation became too much for my mom to handle, so we moved him into memory care. His toileting issues got worse, coupled with dehydration from a stomach bug, had us take him to the ER two weeks ago. He was agitated by his roommate, the staff trying to give him medicine and food. I’ve never witnessed it, but I imagine it is more “I don’t know you or why you’re trying to put that in my mouth, step back” rather than more physical violence. He was there four days recovering, came back to memory care, and they called us 45 minutes late. They’d sent him to the local hospital, who then transferred him to mental care facility under a GA1013 involuntary commitment order as “danger to others.”  Do these medical professionals not understand that “my dad doesn’t know where he is or what’s going on” is not the same as “danger to others?”  My mom has only gotten a few updates. This facility does not allow any visitors at all (because it’s where they keep people that are a “danger to others”). He’s just as agitated, dehydrated again, toilet problems continue, not eating or drinking, not “compliant” with taking his medicine.  Until he calms his agitation, relearns the toilet, eats and drinks well, and takes his medicine without complaining, he won’t be cleared for release. The 1013 involuntary commitment expired after 48 hours, so it’s “hospital discharge,” which I suppose we could override if needed. Realistically, there’s no way he’s going to significantly improve in those areas unless they find an incredibly effective combination of medicines, or just heavily sedate him.  It’s worse because my mom’s process of grieving is “accept the things that I can’t change.” I don’t blame her for that, but when I ask her for updates, she’s very brief. On Monday, she even said, “just don’t call or text me for updates anymore, I’ll let you know if anything important happens.” I have the code to call the nurses, but even with the code, it took me nine phone calls to get to a “case worker,” who said that even though I have the code, they will only talk to one family member, which is mom. That was Wednesday morning. Mom said “oh, he’s doing just fine they say.” I had gotten a little information before they shut me down, and they told me about getting IV fluids because he wasn’t eating or drinking, which mom omitted. There’s no other information since Wednesday. She came over to visit my daughter and me today for Mother’s Day, and she didn’t say anything. Didn’t mention his name. She’s changed her phone background so it’s not a picture of her and Dad anymore. I didn’t want to confront her around my daughter or make a stink for Mother’s Day. She can grieve in her way, but I don’t think it’s too much for me to ask for the information and help in his care. I’m paying for all of it. Mom said that they couldn’t really afford the memory care before he even moved in. I said I could help, and so I guess I’ll be getting the bill for two weeks in the hospital, plus what’s to come.   My mom and dad cared for my grandmother before she died with Alzheimer’s. She never got as bad as Dad is now. He’d say, over and over, just to me, “son, don’t ever let me get like that. Just let me wander off in the woods. Buy me a one-way ticket to Vegas and $100 of chips. Shake my hand and say, ‘see you later, Dad.’”	0
my mom is choking a bit on food...Any tips? I would guess more soups, and congee for her to eat, instead of hard solids	0
Definitely a mixed bag of emotions. Thank you for all the insights I gleaned from reading posts here. They truly helped	0
"Hi all. I apologize if this is not the right subreddit to post this, but I'm looking for advice. My grandpa has a history of forgetting small things. It's worried my mom a bit, but nothing major has happened... until today.  I live with my grandparents while I go to school because they live much closer to my university than my parents do. I came home around 5:30 this evening (which is earlier than I normally get home) because I had to take an online test for school. When I walked in, my grandpa was sitting in the living room and my grandma was taking shower. My grandpa greeted me with, ""Well, you're home early!"" and I replied by saying, ""Yeah, I have to take a test."" I then just went to my room and took my test.  I can hear their conversations in the living room through the walls in my room. About halfway through my test, I hear my grandma say from the living room, ""It looks like she's almost home. I need to text her to get the mail."" My family uses Life360, so that's how she knew that. I expected my grandpa to tell her I had already come in, but he didn't say anything about me being home.   After I was finished with my test, I was getting ready to go meet my boyfriend for dinner. Before I rounded the corner to the living room, my grandma said, ""She must be eating dinner in her car or something,"" and my grandpa still didn't say anything about me being home. After I went around the corner, I announced to them that I was going to eat dinner, and they both looked shocked to see me. I understand my grandma, because she wasn't in the room when I came in, but my grandpa should have known I was here. My grandma said, ""Oh, I didn't even know you were home!"" and my grandpa said the same thing. When I said, ""Grandpa, you saw me come in. You talked to me when I walked in the door,"" he was very adamant that he never saw me and didn't know I was here.   My grandma quickly explained it away without giving me time to fully explain by saying he didn't feel good, but this really struck me as odd. He literally forgot I was home when I had a conversation with him when I walked in. He spoke to me and has no recollection of it. Is this something I should try to talk to my grandma about in private so she can look for further symptoms or am I just reading too much into this? I'm really concerned, as him forgetting I was in the house seems like quite a big deal. Thanks in advance."	0
my mom is in late stage ALZ at the memory care..So she's always sitting in a wheelchair..Other than rash cream, any other suggestions to reduce the raw, bruise and rash on her buttocks? The nurse recommended they put her on her side of her body on the bed.....as the only remedy, along with the rash cream...	0

"I've posted here before, but basically my grandma is getting pretty bad. All day has been a battle. It got to the point she was screaming at me that I was the devil himself and that I murdered her whole family and I was gonna go back to hell. Trying to hit me and push me down. We called 911, like we already have before, because we just don't know what to do. She kept going outside and yelling for ""help"" and getting into my grandpa's car and laying on the horn. Ambulance gets there and immediately says she needs to go to the hospital at least to ""get away from the devil"" and calm her down, i apologized for if we had wasted their time and the one I was talking to said he would've done the same. But, of course, a Social Worker shows up right when all this is happening and says she's very concerned about my grandmother's wellbeing and possibly being abused.  Needless to say I am absolutely terrified. The social worker said we aren't in trouble at all but it's still scary, I'm not sure what to do or if we can do anything. She's set up to be placed in a memory care unit on next Wednesday but... I can't even explain how horrifying this is. We have a caseworker for the placement stuff and she already 100% knows how she is as she's came to the house and saw her get like this. I'm just so scared. I've done everything I could to take care of her. And now apparently social services thinks we are abusive..."	0
Just off the phone with a member of staff from the home that my mum's in. She called to inform us of an incident that happened today involving a male resident trying to grab her crotch whilst she was walking down the corridor. This is the same male resident who was caught masturbating in front of her a couple of months ago, but not the same one who doggedly followed her around and was found several times alone with mum in her room last year, trying to kiss her whilst his penis was out (this gentleman was removed from the home soon after this series of events).   I'm so sick of this happening. Two different male residents have now taken advantage of her and I am so angry and sick to my stomach that she's had this happen to her. Luckily she hasn't noticed it or been phased by any of it but still, it shouldn't be happening. I don't care that the male residents also have dementia and may not be aware of what they're doing.  My mum's young but her Alzheimer's is very advanced. She's 64 and physically still very fit and mobile, but this makes her the most vulnerable person in the home because it's so easy for her to wander into a corridor or room out of eyesight of a member of staff.   I can't blame the staff. They're all lovely and they all do their best but these things just take a minute to happen, and they can't be expected to keep sight of every single resident every single minute of the day. There's nowhere near enough staff for that and even if there were, it still only takes that minute of being out of sight.   I hate that this is happening to the woman who used to be my mum. Every day is spent with anxiety, dreading another call from the home to say that something's happened to her again. She's supposed to be safe in there, for fuck sake.	0
My grandmother has been diagnosed and is unfortunately rapidly declining. The decision has been made for her to relocate to Texas close to my Aunt at assisted living.   She has never been tech savvy. Doesn’t have a smart phone. She had a laptop but now struggles very hard to use it and really only used it for bills prior.   I am wondering if anyone has had any advice on keeping contact?   I plan to send her small gifts on occasion but was thinking that writing her letters may do some good but don’t want to fluster her.	0
My mom closed her long standing bank account and opened a new bank. She neglected to have all the automated payments and deposits switched over.  My sister is the executor of her trust and has power of attorney.   We her children were put on her bank account and we all worked to fix the problem.  However my mom opened another account at the current bank and has a history of withdrawals of large amounts.  What can be done to prevent her from doing this?	0
So was power washing my back yard today and I almost felt him their hes only gone four weeks he fought his fight since 2014.   Was the youngest of three so even at 44 its still hard for me to process it still.	0
"I've written about my wife (70 F) diagnosed 3 years ago and it seems that within the last month or so her memory is failing faster then I'm used to.  I mentioned it to her Dr's but they didn't seem overly concerned.  Today she said ""check out the nice horse walking down the street"" it was a dog then about 20 minutes later she said ""there's a cute Penguin on the lawn"" and it was a bird!!!!  We both laughed at both of her mistakes knowing it was really kind of funny BUT she really is going downhill at a faster pace then she has been during the last 3 years.  I'm assuming it's not going to ever get better and praying it just slows down again."	0
My mother has early onset and has begun to hallucinate various elaborate scenarios and has wandered away from my parents home on two occasions so far.  She also periodically loses me in her mind, so she doesn’t realize she’s walking next to me in public.  This leads to her wandering away and if I’m busy watching my son or distracted in any way she can get away from us.    We are working very hard to prolong the time we care for her, but a care facility is a certainty.  Toward that end we are looking for ways to keep track of mom.  The best fit I’ve found so far is an Apple Watch with cell service on my dads account so he can see her location as long as she’s wearing it.  She’s pretty consistent about wearing her watch today. Hoping that having the grandkids on the face will be enough to keep her wearing it.  Are there better options for this? Has anyone tried this and been successful?	0
Can anyone share their experience with calling adult services on a parent with Alzheimer’s?   Right now, my parents are in failing health and  don’t have any savings to their name. My mother is mentally ill, a lifelong alcoholic, and now has an Alzheimer’s diagnosis.   I (30f) am completely overwhelmed and would like to hear from those who have any information on what services adult services can provide for memory care, etc.	0
My brother and I are totally on board with this.  It’s time.  Next Monday, I’m going to have to go to the place and move her in.  Then we have to get Dad out of there and get him home to an empty house.  Just wondering if anyone has experience with this.  When is it time to leave the facility?  When is it time to leave him at home?  What on earth do you say?	0
My dad was a verbally abusive person for as long as I can remember. He would use terrible slurs and yell at curse at us and anyone who disagreed with him. He was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s at 57. I know sometimes those symptoms manifest for years before a diagnosis. Something I’ve noticed is that while he has forgotten how to do most things and now lives in a nursing home, he always maintained being verbally aggressive. He still screamed and cursed at my mom and sister, and the caretakers who would come to our house before he was placed. No matter what mix of medication he was on, he still maintained those curse words and racism he always had. I know aggression can be part of the confusion but the doctors, caretaker and nurses where he is now say that he’s one of the most verbally abusive patients they’ve seen. Do you think as the disease progresses, you become a caveman instant type of personality you always were? I know of so many of those with Alzheimer’s who are quiet, kind and soft spoken and were good people beforehand. I was just wondering if you become more of a version of the type of person you always were.	0
Hi folks! I was born with my great grandmother having already lost who she was due to Alzheimer’s, so from an early age I knew about the disease. I have now watched my grandmother dissolve away, and now she doesn’t know she has children, let alone grandchildren. I am watching my aunt, her caretaker, suffering from burn out fatigue with a fear of her being next to succumb to the disease. The next step is to place my grandmother in a home just like her mother.   I turn 24 this month, and fuck, I feel like my whole world just said “it’s time to live your life before you potentially lose yourself.” It’s time to enjoy my time with my father before he potentially loses himself. I bought the book “The subtle art of not giving a f*ck” to help kickstart my campaign of living. I am moving across my state, I am starting a new job, and I am moving in with my loving boyfriend. Watching my loved ones be so confused is so heartbreaking, and yet, I feel so invigorated to LIVE. I understand that there is the potential I don’t have the disease, but I don’t want to take the chance.   Shout out to everyone who is taking care of their loved ones, you deserve the world.	0
im 17 and my dad was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s about a year ago. he'll sometimes have these emotional outbursts where he'll call my mom and me names (or homophobic slurs in my case). i know there's not really a way to get him to stop given his mental state and i know it's not really him saying it but does anyone have any advice for dealing with this on my end bc at this point i struggle to be around him at all.	0
I lost my Dad to EOAD when he was only 56. I was 22 when he passed. I’m now 26, married, and full of anxiety about whether I have any of the autosomal dominant APP/PSEN1/PSEN2 genes because I’d like to have children in a few years. My dad was the oldest of 5 siblings, who are all doing well so far. If you were me, would you get a genetic test before deciding to start a family?	0

I'm not sure if I really accomplished that well lol. Labeling the drawers with what's inside didn't really help. If he can't see it in front of him, he can forget where something is. But he's already cracked out one painting of a viking ship ahaha and I think he might attempt the leprechaun next  https://preview.redd.it/moeb3nkz0mw81.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa574fb7c93286b0c24e705b343f700bd8c9b2a1	0

"Just venting.  My mom has Alzheimer's and is only 67 years old. She lives alone in a different town a couple hours away. It is so tough to help her manage her house with all the things that need repairing. I don't get the full story from her, she goes and tries to solve these problems herself, doesn't remember that I've told her I'll deal with it. A month ago she bought a new tv cause her current bedroom tv ""wasn't working"" (I told her it was, she had just unhooked the cable box). Last week had a guy out to fix her roof shingles, and now she says she is looking at the back of the house and he didn't fix any. Did you tell him to fix shingles at the back of the house or only the front? Did you not look at the work before paying him (with support worker present).  I am trying to remind myself that I should be asking more questions and not assuming her abilities today are the same as last week. It's just exhausting and frustrating, and I feel bad that sometimes my initial reaction is wanting to just shout what the hell mom, this is so simple! :("	0
"Hi.  A long post for a first post.  About 5 years ago I became, accidentally, a caregiver for my grandfather.    I lived mostly with my grandparents as I was growing up.  They legally adopted me.  They were basically my parents though my mother is alive and I am close with her as well.  My grandmother died over 20 years ago.    Anyway, 6 years ago, I was living abroad and came home for Christmas to visit my family.  We were in the beginning stages of realizing my grandfather had Alzheimer's at that time.  While I was visiting, my grandfather fell on a patch of ice and shattered the bones in his lower leg.  He was living with his ""girlfriend"" at that time and they were a good pair, she was strong of mind and he was strong of body, and they made it work.  With his broken leg, they could no longer make it work.  My visit turned into me living with them and nursing my grandfather back to health.  After 5 or 6 long months, his leg was healed and I was ready to be on my way.  Just as I was making arrangements to leave my grandfather's girlfriend broke her hip and moved into an assisted living.   My grandfather, we were just figuring out, was not able to take care of himself any longer.   I stayed with him.  After a few months of that, we, the family, decided he would go stay in the assisted living where his girlfriend was.  He wasn't in favor of that, but we eventually got him to agree.  While those arrangements were being made, I was talking with him about it everyday trying to make sure he understood what was going to happen.  It became clear that that was not at all what he wanted.  I said that I would stay with him in his house.  As the disease goes, it's been getting harder and harder to take care of him.  It's only my mom and I that help him.  I haven't had a full day and night away from him in almost two years.    Just before the pandemic started I was going to move him into the assisted living with his girlfriend.  With COVID, that got put on hold.  Complicating the issue is that she lives in another state.    I'm again, trying to get him out to where she is.  Though they haven't lived together since 2017, they have talked on the phone nearly every night since.  She's been the one constant person in his life (other than me) throughout all of this.  His other grandchildren have basically nothing to do with him.  He has two grandchildren that live in the same city he does, they haven't acknowledged him since Christmas.  He has two other grandchildren that live in other states, they sent him a Christmas card and nothing more.  As mentioned, my mom sees him a few times a week so I can try to recharge, and he has a son who lives in another state who calls him sporadically.   I quit my job 5 years ago when he broke his leg.  I had a part time job for a while when he was able to be left alone for a few hours and mostly just needed help with meals.  I quit that job when he was no longer able to be left alone.  It was agreed that he would give me some money every month to replace some of the income I lost.    My plan for moving him in with his girlfriend involves me moving to the state where she is since he has no other family there (other than a sister who may also have some form of dementia). I'm planning on asking for him to take care of my moving expenses and living expenses for a maximum of 2-3 months after the move while I get myself situated.  Along with his expenses moving into the assisted living, it's going to be a bit of an outlay of cash for him.   He does have a house, some money in a retirement account and a long-term care policy that I, conservatively, estimate at over $500,000 all together.  He's not poor.  But, I know the expenses can add up quickly.    I think this situation is reasonable.  It's the only way he can be where his girlfriend is as no one else is willing to move so he'll be able to live with his girlfriend (again, other than myself and my mother, she's the only person he has regular contact with).  I've given up 5 years and 2 jobs already to provide care for him.  I'm asking for a couple months of rent money while he's also paying to stay in assisted living, along with enough for some simple furnishings for an apartment and a little cash to get by while I look for a job in a state that I'd never move to if not for this situation.    My aforementioned uncle will, I'm sure, see it differently.  I have no doubt that my uncle cares for and wants the best for my grandfather.  But he and I do not see eye to eye on anything.  And the whole situation has become quite acrimonious between us.  He has little to say about the situation with his father, except about finances.  I have no doubt when I propose this that it will cause problems.  So, I just want to make sure that I'm not out of line in what I'm asking.  &#x200B;  tl;dr: I quit my job 5 years ago to care for my grandfather.  He gives me some money for his care.  I want to ask the family to approve him paying for me to relocate with him to another state where he can live in an assisted living where his girlfriend lives.  Is this reasonable or am I taking advantage of him financially?    Edit  Just to clarify.  I don't think the current situation is taking advantage of my grandfather  It's the situation about moving out of state and him, potentially, paying my living expenses even though I won't be directly taking care of him since he will be in an assisted living.  But, my moving out of state is still an expense for me that I would be taking on for his benefit.  Thus, I feel it's fair that he pay it."	0
They got up at 10AM. Had breakfast, lunch and dinner at vaguely “normal” times. While they were having a nap in the afternoon I felt comfortable to go on a half hour walk. All food was eaten with no picking at bits. Told her about what the family are doing with no repeats. At bedtime she was tired and wanted to get to sleep. Some days are not just averagely nice, they’re actually really happy times.	0
Sitting here with my best friend as her husband and best friend of 36 years walks him home, finally. Our Robbie was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s in 2017- he was only 59. The doctors explained how aggressive this type of diagnosis is and how rapidly her life would change… it was not an understatement. The cruelty of this disease is that you lose your person twice. Once while they are physically in front of you, and then again when they are called home. He is 65 years old and tonight we are heading into night 2 of sitting by his side as he slowly leaves our lives in the physical form. This disease is so cruel and my heart goes out to all of you who are also living in this heavy reality. Love & light to you all - you are not alone. Big hugs to everyone 💜	0
So my grandmother has dementia in the worst stage now, it’s been getting worse over 4 years but now there is hardly anything left of her. It’s been a lot for my mother ( her daughter) but I’m afraid now that I see some symptoms with her now too. I’ve never been close to my grandmother, showing for example in how up until my mid to late teens she would still give me presents with clothes in the size  that I wore in 3rd grade.  I always put it with The fact that I hardly ever saw her but maybe those were the early stages for her.  Right now I’m visiting my mother and today just been a lot. She’s been asking me the same 4 questions about 5ish times in the span of an hour and again a few hours later. And she’s been telling me the same story of what happened to her about the same amount of times.  When I phoned her earlier today her voice sounded different, higher more head voice like. She basically sounded like her mother. Now when I arrived her voice sounded the same and only after a few hours shifted back to her regular tone.  I’m very sensitive when it comes to people constantly repeating themselves and me also having to tell the same thing over and over and over again so this stuck with me today. Over the past 2 years I’ve noticed this behaviour with her a lot more often. Of course she is afraid that she ends up just like her mother. We are a forgetful family as in constantly misplacing things we need, especially while we’re ovulating but it’s getting out of the ordinary now.  Can this be early indicators?	0
I am a 48y (F) married to my 51yo (M) spouse for 27y.  We have a 22yo (F) child who lives with her fiancé (23y M).  Right now I am classified mildly cognitive impaired but I also suffered a TBI last Autumn after being hit in the head accidentally by a piece of luggage in a plane while traveling alone.  That is how we found out about the EOA which is why I brought it up.   A couple of months (6) before the TBI, my husband retired. We sold our house, bought a big RV and decided to become nomads because the last 25 years of our lives had been difficult, struggling with serious illnesses (mine and our child’s mostly) that seriously impacted our ability to travel even 2 hours from our home.  Traveling had been something we always wanted to do and saw this as our chance to finally do it, so we did.   Now, I’m worried what my new impairments will mean to the life we have chosen.  I know that it could be a while before we see significant impairment but there are already things that are difficult like my not being able to lay down short term memory correctly.  He has to remind me on a daily basis about things that I would never have forgotten before.  Everything from prior to the last year is pretty solid, up until the head injury.  From there it is almost like a blank page on a lot of things.  I manage our finances, I always have, we hadn’t had a late payment in over 15 years… we’ve had 3 in the last 6 months.  I can’t just hand the finances off to him because he’s horrible at it, that’s why I took it over.  I got us straightened out financially and the thought of it going to hell causes a lot of stress.  A lot.  I’ve got a calendar on my phone now to remind me of due dates and I’ve put auto pay on everything I can to avoid late payments, are there other tools I should be using?   I’m taking my med cocktail to slow progression and while it has given me a bit more alertness it hasn’t changed anything significantly.  I have other health issues (I’ve lost half my abdominal organs in a massive surgery [total pancreatectomy] to save me from a serious illness about 14 years ago) and our daughter has significant mental health issues.  He has diabetes type 2, I am type 3 from my abdominal surgery so those are all things that we have to deal with on a daily basis.  We’ve lost a lot of family in the last couple of years, most CoVid related, and that has impacted how we have viewed our end of life plans.  What we didn’t plan for was for either of us losing who we are and I don’t know how to handle that.  He is my rock, he’s amazingly kind and patient but I know what dementia can look like and I don’t want him to have to deal with that on his own.  That’s where the guilt comes in HARD.   Suggestions?  I know it’s a lot of info to throw at you but I figured the more you know the better you understand what we’re dealing with.  TIA	0
I know a small amount of games can help reduce anxiety in anxious people. Also I would like to help support some light cognitive processing for my mother and bond whilst we are long distance.   My first thought “words with friends”, it’s like a scrabble game and i remember having lots of fun with it.   If anyone is familiar with that, is it a good choice? Do you have other app recommendations? My mother was diagnosed a year ago.   Also I just realized so many apps have ads all over them which are annoying but I accept them when I’m playing, however I know they may be overwhelming for mum. So maybe I have to look for a game that’s paid so there isn’t ads  Thanks for your thoughts anyone!!	0
"Hey all,  Anyone have any suggestions as to how to stop my father from using the bathroom sink?  He's either peeing in the sink, or shaking his pee off in the sink. This wouldnt be too big of a deal, but it emits quite an odor after awhile. The odor usually comes from the main drain or overflow drain.   I'm usually working in the basement, but I'll come up to check on him every couple of hours and be greeted by the horrible odor from the bathroom sink. It got so strong that I taped off the sink bowl to signal its 'off limits'. I also placed a make shift sign over the red tape stating ""do not use"". It works for awhile until he eventually rips the tape/sign off completely.  Any thoughts? Just deal with it?"	0

I know how hard it is for those older ones to stay hydrated, and how much my grandmas in particular loved candy :)"	0
Good day!  I have a mother-in-law that is currently living with my family. It was not out of financial necessity but preference as we enjoy staying close as my family travels a lot for work.  A recent doctor visit indicated some early onset conditions of Alzheimer’s.  Understanding that how long she lives with us under what condition is a complex question that needs to be answered, I would like to set that aside, and instead ask:  How can we create a comfortable living environment where her deteriorating memory and awareness are as least impactful as can be? I like to think a platonic 50 first dates.  - She will always have a portion of space that is just hers.  - We have some important personal objects that she associates strongly with that decorate her room.  - We are all planning on at least a few therapy sessions to establish positive behaviors. Especially for my young daughter that may not fully understand.  Thoughts?	0
My mom has extremely advanced, terminal Alzheimer’s. She was committed to hospice care on Friday after collapsing (she’s been living in a facility the past year). At the time the nurses apparently told my dad — I wasn’t there — she doesn’t have much longer and might die over the weekend. She hasn’t eaten solid foods (or really anything) in a week or more and weighs only about 80 pounds. She’s on methadone and a few other sedatives; yesterday when I visited her she didn’t wake up. She just sort of lays there like a cadaver, breathing in a raspy way.   My question for others on here is: how long did your loved one last at the very end? I can’t believe she’s still clinging to life because she seems so weak and broken, but could she stay like this for another week? Two? I know death comes on its own time and isn’t beholden to anyone, so I’m just looking to hear other people’s stories about the End. Thanks.	0
my mom hasn’t got the mammogram exam and blood test  since she was diagnoised with Alzheimer’s disease in 2017. My mom lost her medical insurance in 2018 because she had to quit her job due to her disease,  so my parents didn’t go to the doctors forawhile.. they had medical A and B since they qualified because of their age  , but due to financial reasons. They didn’t want to deal with copayments and I normally bought their medications through Walmart with the RX discount ..  &#x200B;  currently we’re financially better because my sister is helping me and I got a remote job, also doing side delivery gigs …my parents also got a senior advantage plan with their original hospital , so they are seeing their regular doctor normally…  &#x200B;  my Moms primary physicIan wanted her to get a breast exam and blood work , since she hasn’t done it for a few years, so I set the appointment for Friday .I take her to the appointment and I notify the nurse/staff she has Alzheimer’s disease…..I was in the waiting room but the nurse assistant came out in five minutes with my mom and told me it’s impossible to do this exam..while my mom was coming out in tears. I don’t know what happen but I know my mom doesn’t listen to anybody and she will get aggressive because of Alzheimer’s. The staff didn’t tell me what exactly happen but I guess they were frustrated.  &#x200B;  then I told my mom lets just do the blood test …once we have her seated. She keeps crying about wanting to go home and gets up ..Im already frustrated. I even have to raise my voice a bit in front of public ppl .. I just told myself. I just want to go home and I’m gonna reschedule the appointments again…	0
Hi guys. My partners mum was diagnosed a few weeks ago with early onset. He has been to see her and said ‘there’s nothing to her’ and that she is barely eating. There was food in the fridge that had gone past their sell by/best before dates because she’s not touching and, she does however have food such as pasta, in her cupboards, she just won’t eat it. My partner bought them a takeaway and made toast as well as a roast dinner and she demolished it, so it seems that she will eat when it is put in front of her but she won’t make it/cook it herself.   I have suggested pre-packaged sandwiches from a supermarket, so she doesn’t have to make them and they are there and ready to eat and a meal delivery service has also been suggested  as a possible option. Is there anything else we can do? Thanks!	0
My dad (58 with early on set) is finally in a nursing home because he needed to be given a feeding tube in his stomach and Medicare has been paying for it for 1 days. We are about halfway there and although my mom has had an elder care lawyer for about a year, the process for Medicare and now Medicaid has been horrible. Medicaid denied us so the process is going through again. So far she has spent thousands of dollars and has nothing left for herself besides her home.   Does anyone have experience making a parent/spouse a ward of the state? Would  my mom be financially responsible after that? Could we still visit him even if we give up rights?	0
"You didn't read that backwards. My dad legitimately forgets that he has eaten. Every day, every meal.   He's 67 and had a stroke in 2014, absolutely no working memory and his long term memories cut off at around 1979. I moved him into my house after my mom passed in October. Over all, we love having him around and bonding with his grandkids! But there's one issue: he is ALWAYS eating.  For example, I'll cook dinner. He'll have a serving and ask for a second. No worries there, I have two teenagers - there's always plenty of leftovers. But here's where it gets funky - he'll go put his plate up and grab a pb&j sandwich on his way back. Up to 3 times per meal. He also pops out for a sandwich.  His wait shocks me, too. He's maybe 5'6"" (about 1.7m),but weighs about 160lbs (about 80-ish kg, doing the math in my head). We've had tests run, but his docs have no clue what is making so utterly ravenous!  Anyone who has had a similar experience?"	0

How can my wife find out whether she is likely to get a diagnosis for early onset Alzheimer’s?   My mother-in-law (64) was officially diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in the last year, but we’ve all known for several years that she had it. My mother-in-law’s older sister was diagnosed about five years ago after several years of symptoms, and her mother was in a home for many years with it dementia-related issues, but not official diagnosed.   My wife (36) is interested in knowing what her chances are of getting it so we can make better-informed life decisions. What does she need from her mother while her mother is still alive? I’ve heard of genetic counselors. Is that something we should be exploring? We’ve lived overseas for the last eight years and will be returning to the United States this summer and can finally spend some time on this.   Any advice on how to proceed?	0
9AM,  make breakfast “I don’t want it”. Stays in bed Midday, make lunch “I don’t want it”. Stays in bed 3PM, snack time “I don’t want it”. Stays in bed 6PM, make dinner “it’s too much”. Stays in bed 9PM, snack time “I don’t like that”. Stays in bed Midnight, gets out of bed, “I’m hungry”.	0
I apologize if this post is just a ramble, my head isn't on right at all. I'll try to keep it short.  I had been helping my grandpa and dad take care of her for quite some time now, I've been doing all the physical stuff they can't do(both disabled). She's pretty far along now, she rarely knows who I am, cannot be left alone for literally any amount of time, beginning to lose a lot of cognitive function like her words running into eachother or sometimes it just makes zero sense. We were already considering putting her in a home soon- and then my grandpa suddenly passes. He was my rock, practically raised me and taught me so much more about life than any other adult ever has. He was completely fine a week ago and yesterday he passed while basically in a coma. Not only am I totally torn up right now over his death but now I have to take care of her by myself and I just can't. But we can't afford to place her anywhere. A social worker is supposed to come by Monday, but I'm not sure how that's supposed to help. I know nothing about any of this or what we can and can't do. All I know is if I try to take care of her for the rest of her life I am 100% going to lose my mind. I have no idea how anyone can bear to take care of a family member with Alzheimers any farther along than this.  Any advice at all is highly appreciated.	0
"I've been blessed to have a very close relationship with my grandparents my whole life.... but a few years ago my grandpa was diagnosed.      Within the past few months... he has declined rapidly. Everything about it is awful. People can say ""cherish the good days"" but it gets incredibly hard to do so when those become fewer and fewer. It's absolutely crushing to watch someone you look up to turn into a shell of their former self. I want him back. I want more time. I want my grandma to enjoy her remaining years, but instead she's watching the love of her life slowly slip away. She is the strongest person I have ever known but it wears on her so badly.   The worst part... is that there is nothing more that can be done. It doesn't matter how many times he goes to the doctor or the amount of medicine he's on. We've been told there isn't anything left to do. To know that it will only get worse is sickening. It's unfair.  I know we aren't the first family to ever be affected by this, but it still hurts, it still sucks."	0
Sorry for the long story. There is a summary of my question and a TLDR at the bottom.    I want to give some backstory. My mom got early onset Alzheimer's/dementia and over the course of 8years I watched her completely forget who she was, who I was. Near the end before we put her in a care home I was changing her diapers. She would talk to her reflection in the mirror like it was her friend. I'd come out in the middle of the night sometimes to find her just standing there staring into darkness or facing a corner. It was really unnerving. She started getting symptoms when I was about 16 or so and she died when I was 23, my younger brother only 18.  Her dad died of Alzheimer's but his didn't set in until he was around 80years old. Her symptoms started when she was about 40. She always said she wouldn't die of that disease and technically, she didn't. She progressed really rapidly in the care home and In her last few days she became violent, attacking other residents in their sleep. So she was sent to a psych and they prescribed her some medication. Well this medication made her really dizzy and a couple days later she fell and hit her head. She died of brain trauma/internal bleeding. So her statement did stand true in the end, she didn't let that horrible disease be the thing to take her out.. although i believe she died long before her physical body did anyways.. Now none of that is really the point of this post. Since she had early onset that means she carried a specific gene that caused it. This is hereditary so me and my younger brother have a 50/50 chance of carrying it. This gene can be found in a DNA/Gene test.  If I carry this specific early onset gene it is pretty much 100% that I will get early onset Alzheimer's. If i don't carry it there's still always the chance I can get it later in life but it's not a certain thing.  TLDR:  If I don't carry the early onset gene Id get some bit of peace of mind. But if I do carry it there are 2 cons and 2pros that come to mind.  Con #1- it will most certainly effect  health or life insurance right?  Con #2- I feel like I'd psych myself out and think about it all the time, worry if any small thing I forget is symptoms setting in etc.  Pro #1) I could likely start trying tests studies treatments & prevention methods early on and  Pro #2) I would try harder than I have been to live my life to the absolute fullest knowing that I could die in my 40s. I already live by this to an extent as i know every day isn't guaranteed but I'd definitely spend a lot more time doing the things I love in the next 10years or so.   I know in the end it comes down to what I want to do but my question for you is, would you want to know?	0
My grandmother has mid to late stage dementia and Alzheimer’s and we’re trying to place her in a facility that can provide the care she needs since we cannot. The only facility near us that can provide the level of care she needs is quoting us about $3000 more than we can afford. Does anyone have any resources that would help us financially? She doesn’t qualify for Medical. And board and care isn’t able to provide the level of care she needs. I’m desperate for any help because we’re running out of time	0
hello, i am 17. i am ftm (female to male, transgender) but not out to him or many people in my family (although he would almost 100% be supportive. i’m so much sure of the fact he’d be supportive i’m more certain he’d support me then my own mum would) and i am autistic.   due to my autism i am unsure how i can help, and i don’t think i can process this in the same way as most of my family. but i will figure that out so i am not worried about that.   i have not had any personal experience with alzheimer’s before. most of my grandad’s siblings had it before they passed away, and he’s 80 now so i guess it was expected for him to get alzheimer’s or something similar.   his wife, my nanny or nana, is 77. neither can drive and they rely on each other heavily.   they have been together since they were 15 and 17, turning 18, and celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary last december.   he’s been my only grandad as my other one passed away before i was born and i’ve never had to properly deal with the passing of a close relative.   what i am worried about is 2 things; my grandma had a heart attack the day after her husband’s funeral and almost died- and i’m worried that may nana might have the same happens when this horrible disease really makes his quality of life go downhill.  i am also worried because i don’t know what to expect and i have so many questions.   how long does the decline take to happen?  how do i help him?  how do i help my nana?  how painful is this for him?   what can i even do?  how much of this can be prevented or halted?  when does he get medical help?  how long will he have to suffer for?  is it a good idea to come out to him or will it confuse him further?   will he forget who i am?  what do i do?  will it hurt?  will he be okay until shortly before he passes or might he be in pain for a long time before?  are the questions which spring to me.  i don’t know whats going to happen or when and it scares me. i’m close to all 3 of my grandparents; probably more then i am to anyone else in my family, and i’ve never lost anyone as close to me as this, and i’m worried about when i’ll lose him. i’ve never even seen anyone seriously sick long term in my immediate family before. i’ve been the really sick person as i had cancer as a 12 year old and went through chemo for 2 and a half years. but i’ve never been on the other side of this so i have no clue what to expect when seeing him seriously i’ll.   i don’t know what i’m hoping to achieve from this post. i guess it’s a vent. i think i’m looking for support. mostly guidance and answers tho; though i’m not sure anyone can give them.  thank you for any and all help	0
In effort to make this as short as possible, I (30F) have a strained relationship with my alcoholic mother (65F)  who is mentally ill, and recently diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s.   My parents are low-income, and have no savings or no plan for the future. They live about 2 hours away from me. Father is negligent and does not care/ doesn’t think what’s happening is a concern. He will not communicate with me or update me about her condition, and is afraid of speaking to me on the phone because she typically walk in and accuse him of gossiping about her. I have one sibling who is estranged and out of the picture, so ultimately no family support at all. The only saving grace is that they do qualify for Medicaid, but I have no idea what benefits IF any will be available to them for assisted living, etc. and need to figure this out. Maybe speaking with a social worker would be a good next step?  I am barely able to take care of myself due to generalized anxiety (can’t drive on the interstate, for example) and it’s all I can do to function and work at my new and very stressful, demanding job.   There is a family friend who has recently started communicating with me, who is helping me parents by bringing them food, driving my mother to appointments, etc. I am VERY thankful and appreciative that she is willing to help out. She has expressed concern regarding their financial affairs, and is pressuring me to get POA, inform HR at my employer about my mothers condition in anticipation of me needing of take time off of work to take care of mother, etc.   With everything I have on my plate, I am not able to or consenting to jeopardize my situation at work to take care of my mother. Nor do I want the responsibilities that come with POA. Due to my stressful situation at work, I am unable to attend my OWN doctors appointments, and have had at least 3 appointments of my own come up that I’ve “no show” due to me actually forgetting to go, because of my demanding work schedule. I can’t even see a therapist regularly, which I need.   So how am I supposed to drop everything and risk jeopardizing my job, my livelihood, to drive to a different city that’s 2 hours away and keep up with my mothers appointments?   I guess I’m at a loss because I have no experience with any of this, or no family support. I grew up poor, so I have no family members who can help support me financially. My parents fucked up my childhood and I don’t want to be robbed of a decent adulthood. I don’t have the capacity to be a caretaker and don’t know what to do.    Has anyone been in this situation or can offer any advice?	0
I'm really struggling with how to help my parents.  My mom (70) clearly has some cognitive deficits, which have been getting worse for the past 5-6 years. It started with occasional word-finding problems, but now she is confused about lots of things (events that are recent and in the distant past). I know she is seeing a neurologist, but my parents do not communicate any of this with me (41) or my sibling (38). I don't understand if they are trying to protect us, or just have their heads in the sand and want to pretend that there are no problems. If there has been a formal diagnosis, nobody has shared that information with us.  My Dad (78) is completely sharp mentally, but really really stubborn.  He has made it very clear that he has no intention of ever leaving their house (which has 5 bedrooms, no proximity to any public transit, no bedrooms or bathrooms on the first floor, and has a large yard that they have to maintain). For now, this is going OK-ish, but if something ever happens to my Dad (even something temporary, like having a minor fall, or needing to recover in a rehab facility), I'm scared that my Mom won't be able to survive on her own. She still drives, but I'm scared to ride with her. Sometimes she will get lost, or simply forget where she's going after she leaves the house. I can also see her forgetting to turn off the stove and starting a fire.  Both my sibling and I live out of state (a plane ride away).  I don't know what to do. I think my Mom would actually enjoy being in a senior living community with graduated levels of care (she's a really sociable and generally happy / agreeable person, and she would really enjoy participating in planned group activities). We're still at the point where she could participate in the planning. There's a facility near where they live that is really nice (they have multiple friends who live there! they love the on-site restaurant!), and others that are closer to me or my sibling.  How do I address this?  Note: I actually have the ability to move closer (remote work option), but I don't want to become their full-time caretaker, nor do I want to take responsibility for maintaining their house.  I could conceivably use this as leverage to negotiate with my Dad (I'll move nearby, but only if you agree to downsize into senior living. Otherwise you are on your own!), but this sounds kind of awful.  Not sure what to do.	0
I’m here in US and my grandma is with my parents and grandpa back in my home country. She’s 78 and her dementia has deteriorated rapidly in past 2 years and I am just looking for advice to make her life a little more bearable.   She’s always anxious, never want to be left alone. 99% of the time she has company and even during that time she’s very anxious always trying to find other people in the house or assuming she’s in someone else’s house and wants to back to her home.  She has no interest in watching television, listening to music etc. So basically she has no way to kill time. I believe she’s mentally suffering every day and it also impacts my grandpa the most as it sometimes gets frustrating for him.   Is there any way we can relieve some of her anxiety and make her calm and find an activity that can actually keep her busy couple of hours a day. We have tried a couple of doctors and medicines and nothing really helps out :(	0
"It is starting. But as bad as this is going to sound, I am not overwhelmed with sadness at this particular thought.   This week has been unusually difficult. Not only has she had diarrhea every hour for days (anyone got a red bull??), but I also have some things in my life going haywire.   This morning during a bathroom run at 2am as I was picking her up out of bed, she stated ""who is you?""... She has long forgotten dates, locations, aquaintances, but It's the first time she hasn't recognized anyone that's family.   If someone had told me she was saying that before we (my 2 yo and I) started staying with her, I would have thought it was the saddest thing. But I'm so tired this week that in my head I'm thinking the same thing!   WHO IS YOU? Where is my sweet grandmother who never had a bad thing to say? Who is this person with this constant grimace that appears to be some permanent under bite? Why does it seem your goal is to burp loudly on purpose and then grunt afterward like it was a painful surprise? Where is the considerate person who thought of others too?   I know I'm cruel. I know it's not her fault and she is in there somewhere. But one of her main carers is starting cancer treatment soon. I know she won't be able to keep up her schedule forever. Sometimes when I think about doing this forever, I feel like I'm having an asthma attack. The kind where the panic sets in long before the end.   Anyway, this post is just a vent I guess. I am trying so very hard but I'm breaking a little too. But like many of you (I'm sure) I save my breakdowns for 2am reddit sessions so that no one else can tell just how much I can't breathe.   Kudos to all you who are the real angels. I read some of these posts last night during many wakeups and just think how amazing it is that people can love that hard."	0
Hello guys,  Back in 2016 my grandfather passed. He had a heart attack while cleaning the roof unfortunately. He was really stable and looked after his wife, my grandmother, really well.   At his funeral, I remember my grandma saying to my uncle that she was “losing her mind”. This was the first sign, and we quickly got her tested. A little after my grandfather passed we learned she had Alzheimer’s.   In an effort to cope, I turned to music. For those who are looking for a resource and don’t mind country music, I’d recommend Riley Green’s “Numbers on the Cars”. It tells the story of him and his grandfather. I’ve never been able to relate more to a song.   I like the song, and it still brings a tear to my eye even after she’s passed.   Hopefully it helps another who went through / is going through what i am.	0
"Hi everyone. My grandmother has been dx for over a year now, with memory issues/dementia onset for quite some time prior to that. She is now living with my mom with her , myself, and my brother as caregivers. My mom has POA.   Her whole life she's had unhealthy relationships with men and that hasn't settled down at all. Only now she doesn't have the judgement to not give out personal information or enter into relationships with sketchballs. For example she's currently ""engaged to marry"" 3 different men (fake profiles) that she has contacted through Facebook messenger. She's also chatting with strange men via texting, WhatsApp, kik, Google hangouts, Snapchat, etc. She's also previously downloaded tinder in recent history. Sometimes she's initiating the conversation and sometimes they are.   Our dilemma is that we aren't sure how to manage this---we can't keep letting her put herself at risk but we also don't want to take away her phone completely or prevent her from contacting friends/family that are out of state- most of which is done through Facebook.   She uses an iPhone and is about to get a new one under my mom's phone plan so it would be the right timing to get the controls setup on her phone via an app or whatever else. Ideally it would allow us to see what's going on & remotely block people or delete apps, but I'm not sure that's even possible. Something that could be ran on and Android device as well would be ideal 😬  Wondering if anyone has ran into anything similar/knows of an app that could handle this. Or if we are off base all together in how we are approaching it..."	0
Mom is physically active and appears healthy.  She's not old. She rambles a bit and loses her train of thought easily.  She has sticky notes all over the kitchen. And money (which she always handled) now confuses her. She can no longer differentiate between twelve hundred and twelve thousand.  &nbsp;  We visit her every day. We thought she was fine.  Last month she gave a stranger 87k.  She is NOT wealthy.  Thank God her bank takes 48 hours to process international bank wires.  She will get most of it back.   &nbsp;   It's like her red flags don't work anymore.  Does anyone have POA?  I want her to have her checking. But I don't want her to be able to touch her savings or retirement account.  I want to get an alert when her checking goes under 5k or when she takes out more than $500 cash.   &nbsp;  I'm so not ready for this.  But with my sister, we'll build a security bubble around Mom. Just wanted to ask if we are on the right track.  Lawyer says we can sign POA paperwork next week.  What are we forgetting?	0
First time poster. My dad is 68 and was diagnosed with Alzheimer/vascular dementia around 2012. Today my mom is is full time caregiver - help walking, feeding, etc. as far as his interactions - he is familiar with my voice not really names. Not really talkative but says some words here and there. Just curious if it was 6 or 7 and basically how long he has? Sorry just a bit overwhelmed	0
I’ve read a lot about the connection and it makes me so angry that these chemicals are legal to be sold without a warning. I feel I have noticed the connection big time. My grandma drinks diet soda like it’s water and always has and now she’s in the last phase of having Alzheimer’s. When I mentioned the connection to my mom, she told me the only other person she ever knew with it was her friends mom a while back that had it come on very early and she drank diet soda like it was water as well. My other grandmother always has refused to touch fake sugar. She is 90 and totally with it. Drives, lives alone, etc. I am pregnant and have stayed away from these diet drinks after reading about how bad they are for unborn babies. Anyone else seriously pissed that this poison exists?? I’m mad!!!!! Why is it approved for human consumption?? And available so readily??? Wtf	0
Can  these four medicine be taken at the same time?   *  Donepezil * Galantamine * Rivastigmine * Memantine  will there be any interaction among them?	0
For some background, I was raised by my moms side mainly. My mom and grandmother who I will call nanny here. A few months ago I visited my dads parents across the country to help watch my grandma because my grandpa was having a hip replacement. My nanny, mom and I last saw them when we all visited like 12 or so years ago.   My mom and nanny  have both asked multiple times about if she can do things, like read and I’ve told them she can’t. It’s like they don’t believe me. They’ll say things like “she can’t read a short letter from us?” Snd they push it like I’m going to realize they’re talking about something smaller but I tell them she can not ever read at any time. When I was there and upset at my grandma being angry at me, they kept pushing ways to help her remember who I am... she doesn’t even know my grandpa is her husband and she doesn’t know she had children.. they would push and push ways to help her remember.. and  say things like “say you’re Jeff’s daughter” “say you’re my grandma”. Just the other day, again when we sent Easter cards , my nanny sent a prayer book and asked and I told her she can not read it. She kept asking and saying “she can read the card though, right? If it’s short? She has to be able to read that” I had to tell her she won’t remember the word she read before even if she can understand the letters together. Alzheimer’s is some scary stuff.. and I get it’s hard to believe without seeing it. That this can happen to a persons brain so quickly, who was so quick in the mind just a decade ago. But I’m not lying or exaggerating and it’s annoying that they don’t believe it. I’m sick of being told to call her grandma to help her remember or them claiming she’ll know who a gift is from	0
I can't find any information online whatsoever about someone so young getting a diagnosis like this. The absolute youngest I can find information on was someone who was 31.  What can I even expect here? I'm terrified.	0
My mom is beginning to lose her short term memory. For the past couple of years, I would have to text her instructions or times/dates for things that I needed her to remember. Within the last 6 months, she will tell the same story 3 times within at hour if talking to a group of people. She doesn’t recall doing that. Her older sister passed away from AD in her 50’s. My mom is in her early 70’s.   My main concern right now is that she basically has a phobia of going to a doctor. She refuses to go. She hasn’t been examined by anyone in about 3 years. The only reason she went then is because she has asthma and needed a refill on her inhaler.   She is out of prescriptions and is now getting some kind of over the counter inhaler, that I’m sure it not nearly as effective. We live in the south, and pollen has been really bad. She was boiling water and breathing over it because she couldn’t breathe yesterday and it wasn’t time to use the inhaler again.  I was so aggravated that she wouldn’t go see a doctor and get a prescription that would help her! Several family members have begged her to go and she refuses.. says she will go when she really needs to..  I need to get her checked out in general now that I feel that she may have AD. Does anyone have any tips on how to get their loved one to a doctor? Or has anyone experienced this “phobia”? I honestly think she is scared to go. My dad says she won’t even let him take her blood pressure at home.	0

Hi, I’ve just joined this group as 2 days ago, my partners mum was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s following a brain scan. He is a neuro physiotherapist so he works with people with dementia so he has some experience of helping people in his mums situation. I however, am going in blind. How do we help her? We are 2.5 hours away from where she lives so I’m not sure what we can do. My partner works Monday-Friday and some weekends and we have 2 children and are therefore unable to pop up there all the time. How can we help from a distance?  Also, side note -  I lost my mum to cancer in February of this year and supporting my partner is bringing up a lot of emotion that I dealt with during my mums diagnosis. I’m struggling to help my partner when I’m going through grief myself? I’d be interested in hearing how you have been supported by partners/support your partners, thanks!	0
Hey guys!  I'm just looking for people to talk to about my family's situation and I don't know really know what resources to look out for.   About three weeks ago my grandpa passed away suddenly from covid and we recently have taken primary care of my grandmother. She has recently been diagnosed with stage one Alzheimers and my family is deteriorating because of her. She mentally and verbally abuses my mom, accuses my teenage brother of stealing, and calls my dad a murderer and a rapist. Recently she has become physical by pushing around my mom, throwing furniture and we've had to start hiding our knives. My family is struggling and we have to find other housing options for her, but everything is way too expensive, and she doesn't qualify for medicare. Do yall have any pointers and any advice for me so I can help my family? I'm currently away at college and come home every two weeks or so.	0
Hi all,  I bought my parents a Facebook Portal that they used for about a year. Now it sits unplugged on a dresser. I’d like to pass it on to a family that could use it. It’s in perfect condition and I assume it can be reset to factory settings.   It’s a pretty cool device and helps you connect with loved ones via video when you can’t be there physically all the time.   Please let me know if anyone would like me to ship this to them—just asking for shipping costs.	0

My grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimers two years ago. It is really sad seeing her slowly degrade mentally, even though she still recognize everyone in her family. This is a pretty new situation for me, can anyone give me some advice how to support her and my grandfather who is there for her. It’s a rough time for both of them no doubt. Just two years ago the three of us traveled to Germany and now she doesn’t remember the names of her neighbours and favorite authors. It’s such a strange feeling mourning the inevitable while she’s still here and I notice that I keep thinking of her at least once a day. Thanks.	0
I was trying to just understand how my wife (69 yrs old diagnosed with Dementia about 3 years ago) thinks, like her thought process.   I completely understand that her short term memory is horrible but was wondering if she is just living in the moment or she thinks things thru. If you met her you might think she is a little off center but still ok (I hope that makes sense).  I then ask her if she could explain to me how she thinks about doing tasks and I then go on to explain how my thought process works, an example being:  I’m going to play Pickleball so I:  Get Dressed, Grab my stuff, walk to car, start car, drive to court, play, etc……..  I then asked her what her thought process was like, and she already forgot what the question was!   At that point what is there to really say other then I guess I now have the answer.   I really just hate the my wife is going thru this and I’m losing my partner.	0
Hey guys, so I grandmother lost her smartphone and now she won't keep bothering everyone about where it is. Although, I know that if we give her a new phone she will not like it. How should I handle this?	0
I stumbled on this 1-hour documentary this weekend and wanted to  share with you all. It's a former CNN reporter who is now in her 80s and  has the APOE-e4 gene and wanted to know how likely she is to get  the disease. It's informative, busts some myths that I certainly held  about the genetics and avoidance of the disease, and funny at times as  she uses her love of 50s b-movie horror flicks to help tell the story!  Anyway, if you get a chance check it out on YouTube.   [Monster in the Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqdM5UzpvMQ)	0
"Father 83 years old I'm sole caretaker, doing it for 7 years now up's downs you know the gist im ""used"" to it. but for the past year or so like clockwork around 8pm he wants to go home and it takes around an hour or more to make him ""stop"" and be content and stay. man it's so taxing.   I mean he has incontinence bowel and urinary so I take care of that, and all the other stuff that comes with the territory no problem but this constant ""goin home"" gets me.."	0
FIL is in AL but not memory care, so he can come and go.  I’m not worried about him getting lost because he’s not that progressed and his AL is in a part of town where he’s lived for 40 years (long term memory is still good).  I am worried that he’ll over do it and not be able to make it back home and get stranded.  He wears a medical alert necklace 24/7 but it doesn’t have a GPS locate so I was thinking about adding an air tag with the kind of water resistant cover you use for dog tags.  Thoughts?	0
He'll take money out, then forget that he took money out and then take more out. (You shouldn't even be driving himself to the bank where the ATM. We do the best weekend to stop him but it's not easy to keep track of him 24/7)  He gets a state issue disability check every month. And our mortgage payments are set to automatically withdraw from his account.  But he's reckless with money. Always has been. Even before he lost his mind. He doesn't understand how money works. He just keeps taking and taking. Takes out 400 to 600 a month to buy pot. (We still can't even figure out when and how he's getting it.)  In the comments section of a different post someone suggested contacting social services about having his check split between him and someone else. Someone else to manage his money. They wouldn't do it. It was a confusing conversation. Something about how his bank has an overdraft thing. So he can take more money out than he has. Which puts him in the negative. Which means social services can't give him a certain amount of money knowing that it's only going to pay off the negative balance and then he won't have any left.  I hope I'm explaining this right. I hope I'm making sense. We were trying to ask them to put $400 into his account as an allowance. And then put the rest of it into my mother's account. But because his account's always in the negative, they wouldn't do it.  My parents have separate bank accounts. So no one else has access to his account.  Could we ask the bank to cancel the overdraft service? I know typically no one else can make changes to a bank account without the account holder there. But if we explain the medical situation, and we're not asking to take any money from him. Would they do it? Or if we had some kind of doctor's note explaining he's incompetent, could we then take that to the bank and put my mom's name on his account as well?  We've tried to just take his wallet or bank card from him for a few days. We've tried to just prevent him from taking cash out until the mortgage is withdrawn. But he flies into fits of rage when he thinks he's being handled and treated like a child.  Sorry if this is long and rambling. Any suggestions though?	0
I might have posted this company before because they're doing a lot of work for caregivers especially in Florida. Now they have an online group program with a therapist that takes Medicare and PPOs that's just for caregivers. It's starting in 2 weeks all online. I called them to enroll (I have Cigna), and I'm excited to start soon. I think they may take other states now I forgot to ask but I wanted to share it with you all to help you find some extra support if you need it.  The lady I spoke to was really nice.  Maybe I'll see you in the Zoom???  [www.totallife.com/caregivergroups](https://www.totallife.com/caregivergroups)	0
Short version (I can add info if needed), my FIL is stage 4 dementia.  He was living with a roommate with lots of family help (not doing well, but good enough) and then COVID happened.  Roommate almost died and is still recovering.  Family member who was helping lost her husband.  I am the legal guardian and I made arrangements for FIL to go into assisted living.  He can’t afford in home care and he doesn’t own his house (it’s in a trust, so he can use it until he dies but he doesn’t own it).  Even before Alzheimer’s, he was a negative and bitter person.  He has alienated most of his family.  I am stepping up as a humanitarian move.  He initially agreed with the move but now he’s changed his mind.  The problem is that his house is rented to help pay for his care and the help he needed to live alone is no longer available.  The reasons he gives for wanting to leave AL are not grounded in reality.  He thinks they’re stealing from him (items he hasn’t owned in years), they’re withholding eye drops (that are literally in his medicine cabinet) and they’ve intercepted his calls so he’s not getting the job offers that are coming in.  He’s not progressed enough for memory care, but AL is optional and so they won’t keep him there against his will.  I keep seeing advice not to try to correct someone with dementia, but if he walks out of there I don’t know what to do with him.	0
Is there any want to stop/help a grandparent from leaving the house especially at night? I think they’ve tried locks but she figures it out.	0
Hello,  I’m not sure if any one can help me or steer me in the right direction but just looking for some help. My grandfather has Alzheimer’s (or possibly dementia) and is in full care by my grandmother (who admittedly is not the best with pushing for better medical care or testing from doctors). This morning he had an episode where he was laying down in bed, seemingly awake (eyes open and moving) but unresponsive to her calling him, touching him, etc. She called the paramedics and when they entered the room he “woke up” or became responsive again and was understandably agitated with them for being in his space. They took vitals and said that he was all good in that are and my grandfather refused to go to the hospital so they didn’t push it and left.   My grandmother took him to his regular doctor today and said that it was just another stage of his decline. I am still concerned that it could be something else because I have never heard of it. I am the first point of contact for them but I am living out of state and trying to do my best from afar.   Does anyone have any experience with this? Or can provide any more insight on what I should be doing next time I am there?	0
My dad has been in memory care for a couple of months now. Recently he had backpain and wouldn't leave his chair. So they sent him to the hospital to be checked on. They didn't find a source of the backpain (which seemed to go away on its own) but they did find blood clots in the lungs (blood thinners prescribed) and he was dehydrated so they pumped him with liquid. He was in bed for 3 or so days.  When I came to pick him up from the hospital he couldn't walk. I was really annoyed that the hospital wasn't helpful in that regard, but I chalked it up to his feet being swollen from the fluids. With a LOT of effort we finally managed to get him in the car, and back to the home.   So I called today to see how he's doing and they said not great and that he's not walking on his own. Apparently they can get him upright with assistance but he can't walk. Sounds like he'll yell in pain when they manhandle him as well.   The memory care doctor will be seeing him tomorrow so I know I just need to sit tight and not Karen until then, but I'm just so frustrated. He could walk just fine before hand. Dr. Google is telling me older people lose that function a lot faster after bed rest, but it just blows my mind.	0
Hey guys. My father-in-law is under 60 years old and was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s about 10 years ago. My mother-in-law had always said that she would like to put him in a secure safe assisted-living facility if/when he starts to get violent or too difficult to deal with. Well, now it is “well he didn’t mean to hit me, he thought I was the dog” or “he isn’t going to hit me. He’s just making those motions with his fists.”  Let me preface this by saying she has “read all the books“ and she even leads an Alzheimer’s support group. I know she knows what she’s doing but I think her judgment is clouded because it is her husband.  She is not admitting to her kids the full extent of what she has to deal with on a daily basis. She’s not in denial about the fact of the disease is progressive, and that eventually he will be beyond her capacity to help, but I don’t think she is ready to admit that he is far beyond that point. She wants to have kids and grandkids over but also does not want her husband to be upset and stressed and angry.  Her kids legitimately had to have a meeting with her to convince her to get help just two times a week with an outside service that can come and give her a break.   The hardest part is that she has told me that she doesn’t want to put him in a home because it will make her feel guilty. I know it is hard for me to understand because it is not my husband, but it is so hard to watch her lose control of him and have to take care of him or take him for drives when she really wants to spend time with her children and grandchildren.   Are we being insensitive in thinking that he is more than ready to be in a secure facility? How do we navigate the conversation that she no longer has the capabilities as one woman to care for a 6 foot 200 pound relatively healthy otherwise man with early onset Alzheimer’s?  Side note: The facility has an excellent reputation and we have family that works there.  Any guidance or suggestions would be appreciated.	0
Hi all,  Sorry in advance for this rant but it’s half two in the morning and I realized I just need to get things off my chest in order to sleep. I’ve been caring for a 92 year old family friend with Alzheimer’s for the past couple years. I (M22) live in the upstairs of her SoCal home and have been doing so for just over 10 years. My dad had to move here for work, but SoCal is very expensive. Thankfully she allowed us to rent her upstairs at an incredible price. My dad passed away in 2017 so I’ve been here alone with her for almost 5 years. Her Alzheimer’s is getting to be quite advanced e.g. - wandering, auditory hallucinations, not remembering close friends or photographs, not knowing where she is or where her parents are. She’s practically family to me now and I’m trying the best I can while also dealing with college. However recently I’ve been battling with some feelings that I’m not liking and am seeking some advice. I keep getting this awful feeling like I’m catching Alzheimer’s just by caring for her, being around her, or touching things she’s touched. This all started when I noticed some personal forgetfulness past the point of normalcy a couple months ago. I’m usually quite sharp/quick and this change kind of caught me off guard. It’s gotten to the point where over the past month I have been constantly second guessing my own memory and testing myself on minute details of my day to day activity. I know you can’t catch Alzheimer’s and I know those suffering from Alzheimer’s need just as much love and attention as we all do, but It’s like a horrible phobia that I can’t shake! I’ve been distant with her, and her daughter only comes to visit for a week or so every couple months. All she really has is me and a few friends who visit for an hour here and there once or twice a week. I just want to do what is right for her and care properly, but it’s impossible with whatever this is I’m experiencing. Thanks for reading and any advice would be much appreciated.	0
Hey all. New member here.  I guess I’ll give a quick background story; my maternal grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s back when i was in late grade school/early middle school. I was relied upon heavily as her caregiver (assisting my mom and a daytime aid we had most weekdays) and it was traumatic, to say the least. She was my best friend and it was just unreal to me that something could ravage a person like that.  Now, my biggest fear is here. My mom was diagnosed officially last month, but i knew it had been coming for at least two years. The pandemic and some bad doctors really prolonged the diagnosis finally being on paper.  I guess i y need to talk to other people who get it. My boyfriend, whom i live with, isn’t as supportive as i need. He lost his father last November and he keeps giving me shit for me talking about certain things regarding my mom in the past tense. He doesn’t understand that I’m in a grieving process. I do not speak about her like she’s dead, but i can’t call my mom for advice. Or to gossip. Or to joke about our weird family anymore. We can’t go shopping and try on clothes together anymore. It’s simple things. I feel that (he is a bit abusive but I’m looking for a way out of this, i wish we hadn’t moved in together, it’s so complicated right now for various reasons…) he almost tries to minimize my issues because my mom “is still here”. Some days he’s very loving and consoling but most he’s cold and is very critical of her doctors. He’s never met them, but he always makes sure to tell me every negative assumption he’s made. I finally have her with an excellent geriatric neuropsych, and he’s insisting that more could be done medication wise. I feel diminished. Like, you don’t think I’ve discussed these things to death with medical professionals?!  Anyway, I’ve been in a dark depression for days now. It’s tough. I’m the only child and my dad is no spring chicken and i worry about how this will take a toll on him.  But more than anything… i miss my mom. And my partner is not comforting about it. He has a slew of his own family issues which he expects me to always help with, and i do, but him insisting I’m wrong because i use past tense for certain things regarding my mother is irritating.  He doesn’t get that I’m grieving the fact that i can see my mom, but I’ll never get a text from her again. I’ll never be able to go to a Broadway show with her again or bake together at Christmas like we did every single year. It’a all so painful and I’m sick of how alone he makes me feel.   Sorry for the rant. I’m just so deeply  drained physically mentally and emotionally and all i don’t know how much more of his crap i can take while i handle my mom’s needs.  Sorry for the rant. I hate Alzheimer’s and i hate the lack of empathy among people.  Thanks for reading, love and strength to you all 💜	0
Growing up I didn’t get to see my Dads side grandmother a lot. She lived a state over, and so I only got to see her maybe once a summer and over a holiday, unless she drove to see us, and those weeks always went by way too fast. But that was in elementary and middle school. She sold that house and moved to Florida when I was in middle school. I saw her physically 1 time In high school for Christmas and I am now 2 years into college and haven’t been able to see her since then due to COVID and just flights/school. Over my time in high school she developed Alzheimer’s, and we only ever talk when I call her, and it’s dependent on her being at the phone or not having lost her phone. And I loved the talks we had. It wasn’t too bad, just repeating some questions, but she knew most things and what I was up to and what was going on. It slowly got worse, but I cherished the time I had. But then for like a 4 month period she didn’t pick up,  and finally she picked up again. And it was not the same. She was depressed, and lost not knowing where she was. She was talking about her mother and grandfather coming to pick her up soon at the “motel she was at”, and thinking someone stole her car. It took her a minute to realize it was me,but when she reconnected those dots she cheered up, unlike any conversation she has had with my dad, mom, or sister the past year, and she started asking all kinds of questions about things I didn’t think she’d know about or remember. We were best friends, and I’m so afraid I’m on the edge of losing her. After we hung up the phone, I cried, it’s been two hours, and I’m unable to do anything else but think about the conversation we just had. I just want to see her, but I have no means to, and I just don’t know how when the time comes, I’ll function. 😭	0
If anyone can understand, it’s you guys.   I (33f) am my dads only caregiver. He doesn’t need full time care necessarily at this point but it’s coming. I teach 75 minutes away from my home so my dad can stay in the home he’s lived in for nearly 30 years and I fully financially take care of my dad except for his small SSI check.   My sister was going to visit from the other coast and take my dad for a few days while I was on spring break so I could live a few days of my adult life in my own home, getting things done around the house that I can’t get done otherwise.   Woke up to a text that she’s been covid exposed and is waiting on a test but most likely won’t be able to come out and visit. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t lay in bed sobbing at 6am because I’d gotten my hopes up at having a few days of freedom.   Tonight, went to check the mail and got the notice that the doctors office didn’t get the form in to IHSS for our initial assessment and so he’s been denied.   There’s no end in sight and once again I’m laying in bed sobbing. I hate this. I hate my life. I have no help, I can’t get help, and I don’t have hope. I’m beyond burnt out and I’m doing this alone. Entirely alone.   My friends can’t understand because they don’t live this life. I can’t get to a support group and so my entire therapy sessions are just me desperately crying to my therapist. I don’t need advice. I just need someone to understand what this is.	0
"Hello so trigger warning i guess is in order but a week ago we had to put our dog down as she was in pain from a tumor and that night my grandma stopped eating and the morning after she stopped drinking so it was obvious she was starting to decline and looking to be entering the death process on  Wednesday she seemed to get worse and worse by the day and by that morning her 02 sats were ""low 90s high 80s"" friday she calmed down enough to have her go to a nursing home because her care was overwhelming mom and she required almost 24/7 care so we had her transported there and we came to visit that night and they had a o2 tube in her nose which confused us so we asked and they told us her 02 during transport was 71 so they put a tube in and then they just kept it going at the home i get them doing it during a transport but not at the home they say its for her comfort and wont prolong death but i dont buy it to be honest it seems like a part of death and i feel some people with alzheimers die this way so it seems like eliminating a way of death which to me is prolonging death at a certain point her body just wont function on that low of a oxygen level so giving her oxygen seems like prolonging i get that it might be for comfort but to me death is uncomfortable the body doesnt like dying i can understand the morphine and haldol because those dont do anything other than help with pain and restlessness it doesnt help life but the oxygen seems like it would help her live longer she needs to pass soon and quickly she wouldve hated living like this and she would want it to be as quick as could happen also this nursing home is questionable i went to check on her today and the door was wide open which would be fine if i didnt walk in on her completely naked on the bottom edge of her bed just sprawled out and she had a few visitors earlier shes supposed to get morphine every hour an haldol every two hours both people said in the few hours they were there they never had a nurse come in and they had to get them to go give her her medicine which irritates me so im kinda questionable on their opinion so id like an outside opinion  TL;DR: My grandma is dying shes at a nursing home and they have her on O2 which confuses me since it seems like it would prolong life the home says its just for comfort but it seems as if it would prolong life im all for comfort but death is uncomfortable and it seems like they are preventing that way of death so does O2 prolong life"	0
Hi there, my dad lives in a memory care unit. He has become aggressive with staff which is so opposite his personality. I know it’s just the dementia progression. He got admitted to psych this evening and they called me to tell me they had to restrain him to his bed because he assaulted a nurse. I am devastated. I’m not used to this part of the disease and I’m just wondering what happens after this. How much worse does it get? I am the only one responsible for his decision making/care and I just want to know what to expect. This is so painful; I can’t even believe this is a real illness.	0
"My mother is a resident in a really nice memory care facility. Last week she had another resident (a male who is a wanderer) come into her room in the middle of the night and crawl into bed with her. She was understandably terrified and had a meltdown. Lots of ""I need to get out of here"" and ""I am going to stop eating"". We got her calmed down and got her out for lunch so they could clean her bedding and make everything ""clean"".  It seems like it isn't the first time this poor man has done this but it's usually not at night.   Mom is usually really focused on keeping her door locked to keep anyone from getting in her ""apartment"" (there are a few residents who wander in if the door is open during the day so she keeps it closed and locked whether she's in there or  not), but she must have not locked it. We talked to the staff (they're great) and they said that they'd check her door every half hour at night and also if they happened to be walking by. So all seemed to be under control.   Until it happened again two nights ago. There's definitely no malicious intent by this poor man - he's definitely unaware of just about everything around him. However - my mother needs to feel secure in her room.   Has anyone experienced this before as either the LO of a wanderer into other people's rooms or as a person who's LO has a wanderer show up in their room?  I am looking for ideas or thoughts on how to handle this so mom feels safe - without making a big deal and getting this man in hot water, if possible. TIA."	0
Regardless of people's thoughts about aducanumab, the Medicare decision will go down in history as seriously misguided.  So they feel that it doesn't work, that's fine, but that's also not their role.  That's the FDA's job, and they granted it accelerated approval.  For cancer drugs, the meds then get covered.  For AD, the [Medicare decision](https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/view/ncacal-decision-memo.aspx?proposed=N&ncaid=305&fromTracking=Y&ncacaldoctype=all&status=all&sortBy=status&bc=17) states it will not be covered outside a RCT.    Several problems I can think of off the top of my head:   1. This is a double standard unless cancer treatments are given the same non-coverage decision.  This increases the stigma of an already stigmatized disease.   2. This puts serious headwinds into AD innovation and drug development.  Why spend a billion dollars on a trial in AD when facing TWO hurdles: both FDA and Medicare?   3. This regulatory over-reach will cause chaos if applied to other divisions within government.  Imagine the CDC disapproving a vaccine that the FDA approves.   4. This harms individual patients who can't get into trials for a variety of reasons: access, language barriers, patchy social support, exclusionary meds or diseases.  They are basically told to F-off.	0

"Story I'd like to share. My grandpa has been slowly losing his memories as Alzheimer's takes its toll. He's recently been moved into the memory care unit of his nursing home, and myself and the rest of the family do what we can to visit and talk to him regularly. His ""conversational loops"" are becoming more and more frequent - asking questions multiple times in a single conversation that he's just asked. The thing is, Grandpa has been a wickedly funny man his whole life, and yesterday he commented on his memory loss and the loops himself.   ""I know my memory is slipping here, but the great news about that is that you can never run out of things to tell me. I'm incapable of being bored!""   I don't know who needs to hear this today, but growing older and losing one's memory is tragic and funny, all rolled up in a confusing yarn ball.   Its ok to be sad. Its ok to laugh. Its ok to do both at the same time."	0

My mom has been seeing a neurologist and a few months ago she took some kind of written test to see whether she has Alzheimer's or not. I'm not entirely sure what the test results were as my mom can be rather private about her health and down play things, but the doctor ordered a brain MRI for her. My mom sat me down yesterday and told me that the MRI does show Alzheimer's. She has not been back in to see the neurologist yet as the doctor is booked out pretty far, but my mom is on the wait list for an appointment so hopefully she gets in soon. I'm not sure how far along the Alzheimer's is or if they can tell that from the MRI, but my mom seems to think she only has 4-5 years left. She turns 57 this month.   I have suspected for a few months now that she may have Alzheimer's as she has been having memory problems for a while (started when I was in high school) but have noticeably gotten worse recently. Also, Alzheimer's does run in her family. She did have a brain MRI done 2-3 years ago (I'm not sure if it was related to her memory issues or not) and they said that everything was normal; I'm not sure if maybe they missed something or if there really were no signs on the MRI yet. These past few months I have been worried about her. She forgets things we have recently spoken about, sometimes as close as ten minutes ago. She cannot remember if she's taken her medication or eaten. She forgets what she was doing. She doesn't clean things up around the house (i.e her dog pooped indoors and she just left it there). She forgets to bathe. However, I do think things are worse than that. She told me yesterday that she's scared to drive as she thinks she will kill herself or someone else because she forgets to do things such as check both ways before pulling out of somewhere; I didn't know her driving had been affected. I'm sure there's more that she hasn't told me. She wasn't even going to tell me the results of the MRI and was going to pretend that everything was normal but my dad convinced her otherwise. She has not told my younger brother yet.  I feel very lost. I'm about to be 24, so I know that I'm an adult, but I'm still finding my footing in the adult world and trying to figure out my place. I don't want to lose my mom. I know I have to step up and help her, though I have no doubt that she will try to leave me out of everything and handle it herself, as she doesn't want to feel like a burden though I have assured her that she is not one. I'm sure my dad will help her with things but, while they are still friends, they have been divorced for over a decade and he works long, demanding hours. She has a lot of stuff that needs to get in order (i.e multiple properties, investments, a trust, etc.) I wouldn't mind moving in with her to help her but she will not let me. She says that she will stay in her house for now, and hire someone to come during the days to help her. And when that no longer works/helps, she will move into a care home.   I just wanted to confide in y'all and hopefully get some advice. My mom has told me not to tell any of my friends, which I understand and respect, but it means that I have no one outside my family to talk to about this.   For those who have a parent that has been affected by Alzheimer's, what was it like? What should I prepare myself for? What is something that you wish you had been told? How do I help someone who feels bad about asking for help? Any and all advice is helpful.	0
Personally I'd rather see the Alz association focus on getting long term care covered by Medicare, using the same force and energy they're using for this drug. Or they could do a better job of creating more local support groups. Or publishing more useful guides - it's interesting to me that many of the great guides or books like Teepa Snow never seem to be recommended by them.   But , for what it's worth: [Here's the article - it should be outside of the paywall.](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/health/aduhelm-alzheimers-medicare-patients.html?unlocked_article_code=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEIPuomT1JKd6J17Vw1cRCfTTMQmqxCdw_PIxftm3iWka3DJDm4ciOQYCoyc-wDEabdjat82mj2fVt9MMboiXuc3y-JTPkdkUQTtupKYmZkDPz5zqZ62Wil--aPxao0C0G2gaHileqA4zaejvhmCPX_pCvDU0nwrcxJip5YxaV2rjnwXla6TF_oi0tN-3q11Ucx-TDsQdWLd6amTfhZ4MN-GahDb7hBnGL0KHGGOwqPPru4IYw5QClnZTX5g4Gla6NhUOdIfPquXPAd3MYOlwu1XUjo0Wd_vU54hRIHUlKFotarPrnGPy8m0zvY3EcZErZveh6WjF9LwWltv-HRX7hA&smid=url-share)	0
Tl;dr: mom's sick and hostile towards me. How best can I help her, and keep us both safe, until the doctor sees her?  My mom gets incredibly agitated when she's sick and with a fever. She pushes me and grabs my arms and I've no idea how to help her in these situations to calm her down or how best to handle myself when she has me losing my balance.  I do my best to remain calm and try to tell her reassuring words but it seems like it falls on deaf ears. I can't redirect her or distract her like the resources I've been find online say as she only gets more worked up and tells me things like I'm faking being nice to her. I've also tried being in a different room than she is so she can calm down on her own, but she meanders and eventually finds me again and gets worked up. I've tried looking around for other tips but it's not for anything as drastic as her pushing me.  She's sick again and we're working on getting an appointment set up with her pcp ASAP. I don't mind so much that she's taking her frustrations out on me, granted I do get shaken up by it, but I just want her to be feeling better. Generally she's been very sweet since she got diagnosed with early onset three years ago so the sudden mood changes are quick to be noticed and the four of us, my dad, two sisters, and myself, work as fast as we can to give her care.	0
"This question was posed in 2017 and 2018 in this sub, but now that a bit more time has passed, I'm wondering if more people have read the book and tried the recommendations? I'm especially confused about how ""extreme"" of a diet do we need to follow? They advocate for a pretty extreme exclusion of all animal products, and then say ""but you don't have to be so extreme for it to work!"" Has anyone here tried these recommendations?   About me: my partner's father was recently diagnosed, so we're doing research to help. And since  damage starts occurring in the brain starting in 30's / 40's, my partner and I want to make sure we follow a brain healthy lifestyle, given his family history.   Thank you!!!"	0
I have a parent who tells me they've been diagnosed with Alzheimer's.  My relationship with the parent has been trying for my entire life due to their mental illness and, I believe, extreme narcissism.    Has anyone faced a similar quandary?  The issue I have is that I'm on my own and they're in one of the poorest states of the country, so, I'd be looking at some pretty limited options in terms of work and life, to say nothing of the fact that they've never really willingly been there since I graduated in terms of safety net or helping me in my career.  The parent has a partner but they're in their 80s so...	0
My dad is 50. I’m his primary caregiver, he has early onset Alzheimer’s and every day I see him get worse. He can’t remember what he’s doing, can’t remember names, he’s at a point where he’s asking the same questions every few minutes (‘where’s your mom and sister?’ At the dentist, rinse and repeat). Every day when I wake up I feel this gaping hole in my chest, and by the time I go to bed at night it’s so bad I can barely breathe from it.	0
"My father (M, 70) has been confined to a wheelchair for about 15 years, and is reliant on help for even getting out of bed and going out and about. My mother (F, 61) is there to assist him, and we are lucky to be able to afford carers who tend to him. Recently, over the last few years, he has become noticably forgetful - from both small things, such as what day it is, what he had for lunch, or what time someone is supposed to come over, to other more things such as my brother's birthday, his cousin's name, whether people are dead or alive, etc.  Sometimes he will ask the same question 2 or 3 times during lunch or dinner, not realising that we have spoken about it already barely 5-10 minutes earlier. It has reached the stage where it is noticable even to people who don't live with him, but are meeting him socially.  The problem is - he is refusing to acknowledge these things happening. He either tries to laugh it off, claiming he was fooling us (he wasn't), or gets verbally combative, saying we're trying to trick him into thinking he's going mad. In one instance, even when on text message he mentioned something unfathomable, and we tried to show it to him as 'proof', asking him what he was trying to say, he just shuts up and shuts everyone else out. In his opinion, everything is as it should be.  But it is clearly not. Looking at early symptoms of alzheimer's, he is displaying a number of them: forgeting about recent conversations or events; forgeting the names of places and objects; asking questions repetitively; becoming less flexible and more hesitant to try new things.  But he refuses to see a doctor. We have tried speaking kindly, politely, begging, cajoling, pleading, being harsh, being reasonable - to no avail. He is convinced that we ""want to make him think he is mad"".  I really am not sure how I even proceed with this - I do not live in the same city as my parents, and I know that my mother is quite anxious about what the future holds. In her opinion, even if we just know what is happening, either way, at least it makes it easier to deal with - if a diagnosis can be confirmed, wouldn't it be better to start treating with medicines as early as possible? And if he is being this stubborn now, and he does indeed have Alzheimer's, what is it going to be like as it progressively gets worse? In the last month itself I have felt it get worse.   Any advice is appreciated, both on how to approach my father and try to make him see a doctor, as well as how I can help my mother cope better with this. Thanks in advance!"	0
Hey there, I've been following this sub for a while and I really appreciate that it exists.  My grandma - who means the whole world to me - was diagnosed with PCA/Benson's Syndrome (a rare, visual variant of Alzheimer's) two years ago. But her health has drastically deteriorated in the past month. She’s been experiencing visual hallucinations and environmental unfamiliarity.  In addition to this being hard for her, it’s been really hard for me to witness it all. I’m not her primary caregiver but I check up on her every other day and make sure to cheer her up. But sometimes the situation gets to me and I feel very defeated.  We live in Armenia where resources/awareness are very limited, so I’m hoping to engage directly with people who understand what I’m going through. Ideally, I want to find or create a virtual support group for people who have a family member with PCA or dementia in general.  Any words of encouragement or advice will be highly appreciated. Thank you in advance.	0
“The Deep, Deep Snow” by Brian Freeman. A missing child and murder mystery fiction. About a small town middle aged sheriff with developing Alzheimer’s and his adopted deputy sheriff daughter. Great read and audiobook as well.  Thought some here might enjoy.  If you enjoy that, there is a great prequel title called “The Ursulina”	0
My dad received his diagnosis during COVID. He had a virtual 2-session “interview” with a neuro-psychologist from the neurologist’s office. Granted, the MRI/CT did show some atrophy as well, but the actual diagnosis came after this virtual meeting. My dad is 70, isn’t the most social person, and isn’t used to virtual appointments. The whole thing didn’t go well. Nonetheless, we toughed through.  Her findings were that he presents with Alzheimer’s and General Anxiety. And that was that.  Just curious how else someone gets formally diagnosed.	0

Had to go on a walk because grandma refuses to go to bed. But insists she will be up for church at 9AM (she will not, then blame me for not waking her). Had to cancel a 3pm remote piano lesson and a midday home haircut this week because she wouldn’t get out of bed. Anyone got ideas for readjusting sleep patterns, or should I just cancel everything?	0
Any ideas appreciated! This month I (clinical researcher and prior MRI training) have been helping my friend desperately look for help for his clearly demented (74 year old) mother (he has no other family).   It began over the summer when she had a dizzy episode, syncope, and bad lasting headache (undiagnosed TIA?). Since then, she’s been declining rapidly and now constantly perseverates and forgets after 5 min. PCP told her to follow up in a year! I told my friend to request scans/neuro tests, and then I read through all the reports: MRI shows significant atrophy, no tau, spinal tap shows cognitive recovery in following few hours and then return to dementia, neuropsych scores are severe in learning/memory/visual, and neurology eval says “Alzheimer’s”.    BUT she was ultimately diagnosed as “mild neurological disorder” and won’t get meds until she becomes severe. My friend said he was told there’s nothing else they can do (which is disgusting of our health care system), so I’ve been compiling lists of top neurologists and clinical trials. What else can be done for her that I’m missing?? Thank you!!	0
Need help please. My daughter is visiting for a long period with her dog. My mother keeps saying it’s ‘her’ dog and gets mad when my daughter takes her dog for a walk or feeds her. Mom keeping getting upset and telling everyone to leave ‘her’ dog along. Anyone else have this issue? Thanks so much.	0
So, it’s a bit of a mess of a story, but my paternal grandfather was recently admitted to a facility because of Dementia, and his kidneys have begun to fail so he doesn’t have much time left. I am currently 22, and I haven’t seen or heard from him since around 2010 due to my dad making the decision to cut contact with him due to other mental health problems of his to keep both of us safe.  In his final moments, I do really want to be there for him; and my father has successfully been able to do so himself. So far, I’ve only seen him once, and seeing how far gone he was, being nearly nonverbal at this point, absolutely crushed me. Last I remembered him he was healthy and full of life still, and I’m still shocked and tearing up over it.  I have mental health problems myself, and they of course have gotten a lot worse since these developments. I feel selfish because I know how much being visited means to him right now, but all I do is freeze and lose the ability to speak when in the room with him, and then begin drinking heavily for the rest of the day after that.  I’m hoping anyone out there has any suggestions or insight on the best course of action. Should I try harder to suck it up and be there for him, both so he’s less alone, and so that I won’t feel like I didn’t do enough after he’s gone? Or maybe I should stay away since it’s so high stress on my end and for the people around me worrying about my addiction problems coming back, and I’ll just have the pleasant memories of all the things we used to do together when I was really little. I don’t know him very well anymore but from how I used to know him, I believe he would want me to only remember him as he was when I was little.  Thank you for reading, I know how awful dementia is, and I’ve handled it before, but its completely different when it’s family.	0
One of my parents has been leaving salt and pepper shakers in the microwave a few times and (from what I can tell) not thinking it was them who did it. I only brought it up the first time but am afraid to again. My mom’s family has a strong history of dementia and her own mom (my grandma) now has it. It seems like all women on her side at some point get dementia. So I think it’s my mom who did this but I don’t know. Does anyone have advise on what to do? I need to be sensitive about it all.   Also my mom recently picked up smoking weird again for pain so I’m wondering if perhaps she’s just high, but given her close family history that seems unlikely.	0
Grandfather is on oxygen, doesn't leave the house at all, he doesn't want to deal with her, so he lets her drive and do whatever she wants, she crashed 2 hours away from us and we only found out that she crashed because someone helped her at the crash. (no one was hurt she crashed into a guardrail), we are furious at our Grandfather, and aunt because he acted like he cared at the time, but they got her a new car anyway, they don't listen to us they only listen to our aunt, what do we do at this point?	0
For those of you interested in the science of treating Alzheimer's, there was a multi-day conference over the past few days where a lot of companies laid out how they've been approaching these different neurodegenerative diseases.  [https://neurodegenerative-drug-development.com/](https://neurodegenerative-drug-development.com/)  So far, Biogen has a product that passed FDA trials for treatment of Alzheimer's called Aduhelm.  It was initially listed at $56,000 for a year's worth of medication which was a staggering amount of money.  This was a obviously a real downer because I was initially excited to hear Biogen get the nod from the FDA until I heard about the price.  If anyone has experience with it, I'd be interested to hear about it.  It was somewhat good to hear that there weren't many takers at that price so it sounds like they'll be reducing the price by 50%.  What's great though is that time is running out on them being the only treatment.  It turns out that there are actually a lot of other companies that want a chance to perform trials and get something to market which will likely reduce the price and the possibility that one of these companies will knock it out of the park and for a reasonable price.  Two other hopefuls:  Promis: [https://www.promisneurosciences.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/170/promis-neurosciences-presents-preclinical-results-of-its](https://www.promisneurosciences.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/170/promis-neurosciences-presents-preclinical-results-of-its)  Alzheon: [https://alzheon.com/alzheon-to-present-alz-801-at-ad-pd-and-ndds-scientific-conferences/](https://alzheon.com/alzheon-to-present-alz-801-at-ad-pd-and-ndds-scientific-conferences/)  Merck had one get to phase 3 trials, but wasn't able to pass.  I believe they're still working on it.  I think there are other big pharma projects as well.	0
My dad (78)is in the hospital as he has quickly advancing Alzheimer’s and he wasn’t eating or drinking enough. It is no longer a medical emergency ( it was)but he’s still not getting around like he was or taking in as much food as he should. Also he’s confused and Sun Downing. My mom can’t take care of him. Problem is a few months ago he was so healthy and active and still driving etc. It was a huge quick decline😔. They are recommending a home. When I visit he constantly says he’s doing better and eating, doing his physical therapy etc etc. He’s asking why he’s still there and wants to be discharged. I haven’t told him yet but keep saying “ just a bit longer” and “ once you get your strength back”. Or I play dumb like I don’t know either. At some point very soon the staff will tell him. How do I handle? Do I just hope he immediately forgets that conversation when it happens? Help! TIA	0
Johns Hopkins Center for  Psychedelic and Consciousness Research is currently running a study  looking at the effects of psilocybin on people with depressed mood and a  diagnosis of Early-Stage Alzheimer's or Mild Cognitive Impairment.  Here is a link to the study: [https://hopkinspsychedelic.org/alzheimers](https://hopkinspsychedelic.org/alzheimers)  This is a link to the rationale behind the study: [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/7854\_2021\_267](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/7854_2021_267)	0
"Has anyone dealt with moderate to severe incontinence in a parent with Alzheimer's? We've taken my dad to the urologist and he's on 3 different medications to tackle the incontinence from every direction but it doesn't seem to be working as well as we hoped. I'm beginning to suspect that he's just zoning out so hard that he doesn't recognize the urge and then just goes, only ""waking up"" once he has the wet sensation.    At this point, the incontinence issue is probably worse than the ALZ, since he is in fairly early stages of it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"	0
Mom (91) passed last night. It came on quick. I live out of state and wasn’t able to see her the last three years. she had vascular dementia and had gotten to the stage where I couldn’t talk on the phone with her. I  prayed she would pass easily one day. Still  it was unexpected. I didn’t know she was taken to the hospital until she was gone. I was hoping I would get to see her one more time . . And what really sucks , is my husband has Alzheimer’s and I can’t travel with him. He isn’t ready for a home yet. But he is  delusional  at times . Last time I drove  long distance with him he tried to  find something to cut the seatbelt and he opened the car door while I was driving on the interstate.  So going to moms funeral is out of the question. I don’t dare fly with him . We would probably kicked off the plane. I would love to have some closure. I’m not really asking for advice or sympathy. Just putting it out there because AD sucks. So I’ve been  talking to mom and letting her know how much she has meant to me and all the things I wish I could have talked to her about the last 8 years. Before she was afflicted. I hope she can hear me. I love you mom .  And fuck you dementia.  &#x200B;  I want to thank all of you for your kind remarks . my sympathies go out  for those who have also lost someone. WE are all dealing with this everyday and I hope you all have bright moments and find your own little space of calm and peace . 	0
My dad has dementia and is going to need full-time help soon enough. (Driving, shopping, etc.) My mother is a half-functioning alcoholic (half the time sober and amazing, half the time binge drinking/in bed.) I wouldn't say they are in denial but they are 100% wanting to kick the decision down the road and don't seem motivated to face it. How would you deal with this situation? I live several hours away.	0
I've never met anyone with Alzheimer's before, but am visiting my aunt who was diagnosed in 2014 next week. I haven't seen her since 2011. Although I will be with her daughter, whom she lives with, I am still nervous-- I know she won't know who I am, but what questions do I ask? How do I introduce myself? How do I converse with her while still treating her with respect and as a human?  Thanks in advance for the answers.	0
"I found out that to ""manage"" someone's Social Security benefits/payments, a Power of Attorney is not enough - you need to be the individual's Representative Payee.

"My dad has become increasingly forgetful. He frequently forgets how to get home, or he forgets a conversation that we just had 15 minutes ago. Once I remind him, then he remembers. For example, he needs surgery on his carotid artery. I'm arranging it for him. I was on the phone with him talking about it. I hung up, called and spoke to his doctor to set a pre surgery appointment. I called my dad back, literally 10 minutes or less later. I said ok dad we have to meet with the surgeon before they will schedule your surgery. He said ""What surgery?"".  I said, the one we just talked about. Your carotid is 80% blocked. We just talked about it. After a slight pause, he said oh oh ok yeah now I remember. Stuff like this happens a lot. Then suddenly he will be fine.   How do you tell the difference between normal aging, vascular dementia and alzheimers?"	0
Does anyone know how much can be deducted from taxes that is spent on a memory care nursing home? I would think it would be qualified care since it's memory care as opposed to regular care and my parent definitely can't take care of themself anymore? Anyone know? Thanks!	0
"Hi everyone,  I know both being stubborn and having trouble making decisions are symptoms of Alzheimer's but I wanted to know why this is, if anyone knows. As time goes on my grandma has been getting increasingly disinterested (?) In choosing things, like we will ask what she wants to eat or what shampoo she prefers or if she needs stuff and she'll just say ""whatever"". She was always kind of easygoing about that kind of thing but it's like she's incapable of making a choice, like she literally has no preferences.... Is this the case or can she maybe not express her thoughts right...?  The other problem recently is stubbornness. Like I said above usually she just goes with whatever people are saying but there's some things she's chosen as like her hill to die on. For example she saw something in our neighbor's yard and asked my mom if it was in neighbor #1s yard or neighbor #2s yard. My mom said ""its in neighbor #1s yard"" and my grandma said things like, ""maybe YOU think so"", ""they might think that but it's in neighbor #2s yard"", ""hmmm I don't believe you"". Another example is taking showers. My mom will ask her to take a shower and recently she even yelled and said ""no I don't want to!"" My mom asked her why not and she eventually said it was difficult...to open the shower door. This takes maybe 10 seconds and while it might be hard it's only 10 seconds and then it's over? We are lucky to get her to take a shower once a week at this point.  Does anyone know anything about these? Why this shows up in Alzheimer's, how it's a part of it and what we can do to address it? Thanks for any suggestions."	0
Hi guys,  I hope this post is fine. Basically today my mum has been diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disease, most likely alzheimers but we will find out more on a second round of tests in 3 months. It's heartbreaking for her because she has worked in the NHS in the UK on dementia wards for the last 15 or more years and has said it's her biggest fear to forget who her kids are.  I'm out drinking at the moment (just a disclaimer against typos) but I wanted to ask some advice. I am going to have some food and a chat with her shortly. Of course part of that will be emotional support but another part is practicality. I want to start a conversation about doing things to make her life easier because she is okay at the moment but things will be different in ten years time.  For example, she had recently talked about selling her house and mortgaging two to rent out to make passive income. I don't think this will be sustainable with everything in mind so I wanted to advise her to buy something outright that she can own and not have having over her if that makes sense? Similarly I would advise her to live close to myself and my brother so if she needs us we are close by. This isn't at all intended to be patronising or anything I'm honestly just trying to start a conversation around ways to make her life easier for the years that are ahead.  With all that preamble I wanted to ask if you had advice of things we could think about or start talking about in terms of preparing for the future to make sure she is comfortable, happy and independent for as long as she can be. I'm sorry if I am wrong or stupid with anything that I am saying; she is an amazing woman and my hero and has been a mum and a dad to me and I am just searching for anything I can that will make life better and give her less stress if that makes sense?	0
Firstly I want to apologise in case I use any terms or anything incorrectly, I don’t know a lot about Alzheimer’s so I’m going with what I’ve read.  I (18) have noticed my dad’s changing behaviour since around 2020. At the start of the pandemic specifically he became irritable and argumentative, we assumed it was just him being bored and angry about covid so he was taking it out by saying outrageous things and fighting with me and my siblings about them. Though me and my dad have a great relationship and have never fought about anything major, he always loves to be a contrarian so while it was annoying it wasn’t anything crazy out of the ordinary.   In fairness, a lot of his behaviours sound like symptoms of dementia although he has never really gotten “worse”, is always just the same eg he gets very stressed about things like making dinner, giving lifts or going on trips. Recently he forgets things like what I’m doing, eg a couple days ago I had to travel to a different city and told him I needed a lift to the bus, and on the day of he forgot and I had to jog his memory quite a bit before he remembered.  Basically, I can’t tell if this is just him getting old or if it’s signs of early-onset Alzheimer’s. Or if the term “getting old” actually stems from a misunderstanding of what Alzheimer’s is? The thought of it affecting my dad petrifies me and it weighs on my mind a lot. I’m scared to “lose” my dad since I am so close to him and my siblings and I are still pretty young. I don’t want to bring it up with my younger siblings or my mother who works 40+ hrs and is also pretty much full time studying, as I don’t want to scare any of them especially if I’m just overthinking. Thank you for taking your time to read :)	0
My mom's neighbour is getting worse and her half sister and friend are doing next to nothing to help her, instead, just leaving it all to my 81 year old mom to worry about. The neighbour, who I'll refer to as F, does not look after herself, wears the same clothes for days, repeatedly goes to the bank to withdraw money, which she then secretes somewhere, forgets where it is, then goes back for more, and is often lost, dazed and confused in the street, a mile or so down the road.  Meanwhile, despite my mom relaying all this back to her half sister and friend, all they say is that, because F is adamant she doesn't want strangers (carers) in the house, their hands are tied. They also just say 'she has safeguarding in place'. Uh, ok.  So, it's all on my mom.  Aaaaargh.	0
There are a lot of you on here that ask for resources to help you as a caregiver. I just wanted to plug that the Alzheimer’s Association has a free 24/7 helpline that can be translated into over 100 languages. The people answering the helpline calls are all social workers with a masters degree and can help with any question you have - ranging from “what is Alzheimer’s” all the way to you being in a crisis and need guidance on how to handle the situation. They can also help connect you to local support, like support groups, care consultants, education, etc. It’s an amazing resource that I highly recommend.	0

If you saw my last post, I was just exploring the possibility that it could happen, and now it’s official. I ended up having a talk the week before last with my mom’s (64 F) daycare about her general decline, they agree she has declined, and said they didn’t think it would be any trouble for her to be evaluated and qualify.  We had the hospice referral appointment with her PCP last Tuesday, and it hit me harder than I was anticipating. So much so, I ended up calling out sick for work the next day, and took a me day while mom was at daycare. The first hospice agency referred to us by the PCP was not a first choice of the woman who runs the support group that I’m in, and I trust her opinion. She sent me some recommendations, and we ended up signing with the second agency on her list. My mom really qualified without any second thought. They’ll provide a shower chair, a wheelchair and a hospital bed as soon as I have room for them to. I got her a rollator last week that has been helping at daycare. Other supplies will be provided as well. Of course I just did a pretty recent big restock of diapers and wipes…  I’m a little nervous that I’m not actually going to get the extra help and relief I need. A nurse will come out twice a week, and an aid can come out 5, but only for an hour to get her ready for the day. She can still go to daycare and be on hospice as long as she does not become completely hard to care for in their facility. She will be assigned a social worker who may be able to help me figure out more in home health services or short term respite care. I know I need to see how this even plays out to start. They can arrange a 5-7 day skilled nursing facility stay for respite otherwise.   My mom doesn’t understand much anymore. What do I tell her about this? Do I keep it simple and just say they’re new friends coming to help, or do I tell her that she’s on hospice? I have a feeling it’s the former, but want to get some input. She’s also interestingly started to increase the frequency in which she says things like “I’m going to die,” “just leave me to die,” or even “I don’t want to die,” when nothing of that topic has even come up around her. Is this a sign she knows it could be happening, or is it just the insecurities of the disease? I mean, she’ll say it at the most random times sometimes. I could be putting her socks on or getting her out of bed, and she’d say it.   I’ve been extra emotional this week. It’s so hard having so many emotions and not knowing what to do with them all. These past few weeks have been stressful as hell, and I’m starting to feel it in other ways too, which is scary. I probably need to have a physical scheduled as soon as possible.	0
I don’t know if ptsd is the right word I’m sorry if it’s not. In 2020 I lost my grandmother to Alzheimer’s and that was hard but just last month I lost my second grandmother to Alzheimer’s I was much closer with her and saw her decline first hand Since then I’ve been having panic attacks and freak out when my mom or other family members forget things. I’m laying in bed crying worried about having to go through that ever again does anyone else have this problem?	0
My grandmother was diagnosed about 2 1/2 years ago, but we knew long before she finally agreed to see the neurologist. Since the diagnosis it just feels like everything has now progressed so rapidly. Just last week things were bad, but after going away for the weekend I returned to the news from my mother that she had gotten substantially worse in the few days I had been gone.   A couple days ago my grandmother was barely capable of holding a conversation, but now she isn’t even able to string together a couple of words coherently. She can no longer walk on her own, though she was shaky before, to be fair. The scariest part is I’m sitting in the ER right now, and I can swear I hear the death rattle.  She has also been mumbling what sounds like my grandfather’s name. He has been dead for 15 years.  So far we have ruled out a stroke, and they don’t seem to think she has any sort of infection. I just can’t wrap my head around how quickly this is all happening. My own theory is that she has just given up and is ready to go. It is heartbreaking.   I’m sorry there is no real point to my post. I just sort of needed an outlet for my feelings with some people that understand. There is so much more going on with it, but the last couple days have been hell.	0
My grandmother is fiercely independent but lately has not been able to function the way she used to. I'm in a worrisome debate if it's regular aging or signs of something more serious.	0
My dad had a fall and his caregiver couldn’t pick him up. She called for a lift assist from the fire department and they wanted to take him in to the er just in case. When I got there, I asked them if they did a uti screen. The doctor said it’s not protocol. What? I knew a uti had to be the problem with his balance and increased confusion. (He wasn’t hurt from the fall at all. Fell on the carpet) I called his regular doctor and asked him to order a urine test. Of course it came back as a major bladder infection. He’s now on antibiotics. What would have happened if I hadn’t followed up and just let the infection rage?!? What could the hospital possible be thinking by not running such a simple test?!? Ugh, so frustrating!! So, insist on a urine test!	0
I’m 21 and my dad was diagnosed with alzheimer’s when i was 17/18. I lived with only him from ages 14-18 and feel I missed out on many of those years and potential experiences due to worrying about/caring for my father. He has narcissistic personality disorder so I was also dealing with that abuse at the time. I had decided not to go away to college because he would say things like “you’re the only reason i’m here” all the time and ask if i was going to stay with him. This obviously lead me to think if i left he would attempt suicide (which he has multiple times).   I’m having a really hard time knowing what to do right now because i want to go back to a new school across the country next spring. I feel like i’ve made so many decisions based on everyone else’s happiness instead of my own, it feels like it’s been such a battle to survive most of my life, and i’ve finally been figuring things out for myself and feeling better. Some things are going on right now with his potential guardianship which has been extremely difficult and is taking me back to those years when i was 14-18, feeling so stuck and helpless. It makes me feel terrible because obviously i want to do everything i can for my father, but i need to think about me. I want to have him in my life and have a good relationship, i want to be able to know what’s going on with him and help to make decisions. I’ve realized i guess all i can do is give the court my and my fathers truth and at a certain point it’s out of my hands what they choose. It’s hard for these things not to absorb my whole life, it becomes all i think and worry about and i begin to feel so hopeless.   I guess i’m wondering people’s thoughts on that, whether you’re my age or someone older. Am i being a bad person for wanting to go to school somewhere else? I’ve never left my childhood town long term, i’ve always wanted to. It’s so hard because i want to be true to myself and give myself these experiences, but i feel like i’m potentially betraying my father. Also if anyone has advice about experiencing a parent having alzheimer’s at a young age, or any life advice for someone in their 20s, i would greatly appreciate it.   I think if my dad wasn’t sick he would be proud of me and excited for me. He always wanted to make sure i had the ability to do what i wanted with school and careers and express my talents. Thinking about that makes me smile but it hurts.   - my parents are divorced, my mother greatly cares for my father and they have lunch once a week	0
Would like to hear about everyone's experiences good or bad with small residential assisted living or adult foster care based in a private house.   Better or worst than long term facilities?  Do smaller homes have better staff to resident ratio?  If you have worked in or own one I would love to hear from you. Would love details about your facility and why it's better in your opinion.  Thanks in advance for any help or information.	0
my father (68) has alzheimers and up until recently was being cared for exclusively by my grandmother (87).  over the past year, my father's condition has progressively gotten worse and he's started showing signs of anger, anxiety, and aggression.  anti-anxiety meds helped some, but it still got to a point where it was no longer safe for either of them to be in that house together and we made the decision to move him into memory care.    unfortunately, the transition to memory care did not go well.  within 4 days of moving him in he had assaulted another resident, cornered and threatened a staff member, and refused to eat or take his medications, until the facility finally asked for him to be transferred to a hospital because they couldn't handle him.    fast forward 6 weeks and in that time, he's been in 3 different hospitals and 2 different geriatric psychiatric facilities.  he was transferred back to memory care after the first psychiatric stay when they thought they had figured out his medication, but after 4 days he had assaulted another resident, was tearing pictures off the wall and throwing them, and had defecated on the floor of another resident's room.    he's currently on his second geriatric psychiatric stay as they once again try to tweak his meds but i' m not hopeful.  we are one week into what is supposed to be a 1-2 week stay so he's going to be discharged soon.  the memory care facility he was originally in won't take him back and so far we haven't found any others that will take him.  i don't see how he could come home, even with in-home nursing help.  i just can't see how it would be safe for anyone.    i've checked into some nursing homes but supposedly they are going to cost between 10-15k per month and that's not something we can afford.  i don't believe he will qualify for medicaid as he has a pension that would put him over the eligibility requirements.    making all this worse is i live on the west coast and am having to manage all of this remotely.  this last 2 months have been so draining and we seem to be out of options.  he can't stay where he is and he can't come home, but there is no place that will take him.  what are we supposed to do?    i'm posting in hopes that someone maybe has a solution or something i haven't thought of but it all seems so hopeless.	0
If the loss of sense of smell associated with Alzheimer’s would be studied towards restoring it first would memory return? What is the brain trying to stop by smothering with calcification? Does the pineal gland hold the answer? Peptides mimicking pineal gland secretions can elevate the symptoms of menopause- why not smell? Memory? Researchers that are thinking outside the box should be awarded the grants not labs researching the same research that’s been done in a loop since the beginning.	0
My Grandma is far down the rabbit hole and diagnosed with Alzheimers or dementia.  She can keep up a short conversation just fine but her memory is shot.  We are moving her to a care home tomorrow but one of her recurring issues is obsessively counting money.  In her own home we just had her constantly pay us money, put it in a cabinet and then give it back to her each visit.  Now that she's going to a home with outside people, we don't want her having real money just in case.  The Bank of Canada has a fake money printout for children but she can tell the texture difference between our plastic bills and complains.  Does anyone know of a more realistic fake Canadian bill that matches the texture/look of the real bills?	0
I’m worried about my mother. She can’t remember the most basic things. She asks me the middle names of my children, names of family members, birthdays, etc. This seems like the early stages of Alzheimer’s.   What is more alarming to me, though, is her obsession with things. I’m not sure if it’s related to Alzheimer’s and I want your opinions.   For context, if it’s relevant, She’s on Klonopin and has been for 20 years. She doesn’t take it at the same time each day and often skips some to “save money”.   She OBSESSES over stuff. For example, if an app she has resets and she loses her ability to login using Face ID, rather than a password, she will spend HOURS trying to fix it.   When she asks me a question and I’m speaking with someone else, if I don’t immediately answer she will say “SAY” or “HELLO?”  She needs IMMEDIATE answers to text messages or she will send 8-10 at a time.   She leaves hateful voicemails if I don’t answer the phone.   She is rude to the waiter / waitress and doesn’t “read The room” or follow social cues.   Are these all signs of Alzheimer’s or something else? Thank you for your help.	0

 My mom is well into the later stages of Alzheimer's and can no longer do  any self care. She is constantly anxious and fearful people she sees  will be bad and hurt her. Her restlessness and excitability is really  tiring, so we requested a medication to ease her anxiety. To my surprise  an anti-psychotic ( Aripiprazole ) was prescribed, and while she does  tell imaginary stories I do not see how this drug will address her fear  and anxiety. Anyone got any experience with the effect of this meds with  Alz patients, and any relevant advice? I thought something like  lorazepam would be prescribed.	0
Anyone else experiencing their alzheimers loved one clicking when he/she can't remember how to say a sentence?   Earlier dad wanted to ask me if it would bother me if he turned on the TV but I guess he couldn't find the words.  So he just walked over to the TV, pointed at it, and started making clicking noises at me like it was a recognized language.   Reminded me of that 80's old movie with the coke bottle. It's pretty funny in retrospect.	0
Okay, so my dad was diagnosed with dementia a few years ago. Because I gave birth to a child and didn't live super close to my parents I was never able to attend many of his doctor appointments. Now I have moved closer and my child is older, so I'm paying closer attention to his health and helping out my mom. One thing that was never made clear to me is what type of dementia he had. So at his last appointment with his neurologist, I asked her what type of dementia is he diagnosed with. And she said, based on his scans it's either Alzheimer's or vascular dementia. She explained that it's hard to tell and that's there's a lot of overlap. So is that a thing? I guess I was looking for something definitive. Not: maybe this, maybe that. I guess from her perspective it's all under the same umbrella, but from my prospective I'm just confused.	0
Cleaning grandmas bedroom today. I wanted to change her bed clothes. She didn’t get up through the vacuuming round her bed. When they did arise at 4PM, I was told I should’ve been louder :)	0
My dad has been really struggling with being my moms primary caregiver. He has a nurse that comes and financial stability and family in the area but I think he’s not really equipped emotionally for this. He never had to do much of the child raising and I can tell he’s cracking but am not sure how to help him emotionally. Has anyone had success finding a counselor for their parent? He looked for support groups once and then never followed up so I think I’ll need to find someone and give him the push. Why kind of counselor has training in this kind of thing. Would it be a grief counselor or family counselor? Any advice is appreciated	0
Do any of you in the pre-diagnosis stage worry that getting a diagnosis will cause your loved one to deteriorate faster? That’s what I’m struggling with. My family and I can tell something is wrong with my dad (and has been for sometime) but he’s already so sad I worry he will give up all hope if he finds out for sure something is wrong. We’ve already had a neuropsych consult and they want him to come in for further testing. I am pushing to get it done but the more adamant I am about it, the more I wonder if it’s even the right choice. I have been insistent that we need to know what we’re dealing with but honestly I don’t know what to think anymore. Thanks in advance for any advice.	0

   In December, my father P (M 78) who has Stage 6 Alzheimers got engaged to be married to his girlfriend of 18 months (F 72) N, who had managed to isolate P from his friends and family and gain control over his finances.   In early January, we learned that P & N were meeting P’s longtime accountant and another lawyer to rewrite his will to remove his children and grandchild and give everything he had to N. P had the original will written in 2019 shortly after receiving his diagnosis.  Although P had failed a capacity test in December and could no longer legally sign his new will or sign his Trust Fund over to her, he could still get married as the bar is very, very low. Despite his severe dementia, P still had many lucid moments and could seem totally fine for short periods.    If P signed a marriage certificate, N would have legal control over his health decisions. It would also give her the cover she needed to drain away his financial resources in secrecy, a process she began even before the big day by redirecting the pension payments he received into a bank account she controlled.   All N had to do is move him somewhere away from his meddling kids and take away his phone and he would be effectively incommunicado. We would never see him again and we wouldn’t even know when he died.   Something had to be done. We started by emailing P’s large group of friends and telling them about N and what she was doing to P. They all responded with support for us and with love and concern for their friend. Scammers preying on the elderly in their community was nothing new to them. We also reached out to P’s accountant and found that he was greatly suspicious of N but stayed silent out of respect to his friend.  P’s friends and fam began to plan an intervention over Zoom. The idea was that his younger son J (M 51) &  daughter in law S (F 52) would go over to P's house, surprise P with a meeting with all of his friends who would then confront him about their concerns about N and her diabolical plan.   After that, J would show P the evidence that they had learned from the background check that N was a Lonely Hearts romance scammer who had already been convicted of fraud years ago and had lied to him about her own financial situation, telling him she was “loaded” and did not need his money, despite having a huge tax lien on her house.   They would also show P a [checklist ](https://maggiesresource.com/are-you-in-an-abusive-relationship-c110.php)of abusive behaviors to try to get him to see how terribly she was treating him. Once he was convinced, they would call the locksmith to have the locks changed, help him pack up his stuff, and drive off to a prearranged Airbnb out of state.   Our worst fear was that N would somehow get wind of the plan and whisk him away for a quickie marriage. We also worried she may become physically abusive if he resisted her. Early on we had learned that N had quite a temper which worsened when she drank. What would she do if she learned her Golden Goose was going to break their engagement?  Timing was everything here. Thankfully, P's caregivers gave us a heads up that N was out of town that weekend and that she would not see him until she returned on Tuesday. J set the intervention for Monday.  When the day finally came, J arrived at P’s house to find that P had been primed by N to tell him that he no longer wanted his younger son in his life as he was interfering with his relationship with N.   During the zoom meeting, P seemed unmoved, his face emotionless. His friends warned him N had proven to all involved that she was up to no good and implored him to break the engagement.  He said he had no plans to marry N (N wanted this kept secret!) but he was an adult and knew what he was doing.   The zoom meeting ended in sadness and frustration.  It didn't seem like we had gotten through to him at all.   About an hour later I received a text from my sister-in-law reading: on our way to Arizona with P!!  Apparently, P thought that N was a “wicked woman” (his words) but that he did not know how to break up with her. It would be a difficult situation for any person to realize they wanted to break up with a partner and take the necessary actions to do this, but for someone with dementia they may well be helpless. You can’t drive away, you can’t explain your feelings to people, you can’t call for help, you cannot defend yourself if the other person refuses to let you go. And the caregivers he lived with (as wonderful as they are) could not interfere.   If J hadn’t persisted despite the emotional agony of having his Dad cut him off, this woman would have ruined him and his family.  The other thing we found was that P’s dementia was much much worse than we had known or suspected, despite the increasingly dire caregiver reports. Since our contact with him was increasingly limited to short visits and conversations after N arrived on the scene, we had not been able to grasp the severe decline in his memory and communication skills. N took advantage of P’s confusion over his own condition to convince him that he only had MCI (Moderate cognitive impairment - his initial diagnosis), which was vital in constructing a reality where she was simply marrying a man she loved and who loved her, instead of financially abusing someone dying of a neurodegenerative disorder.    On the drive to the airbnb, J reported P had become incoherent after nightfall and kept asking them who they were and where they were going. They learned they needed to keep him out of the kitchen as he would wander around and touch all the knives and even play with the oven burners. It became clear they needed to get him into a care facility as soon as possible before P could endanger himself. Thankfully, even at his worst behavior, he continued to be a very sweet and loving person towards J & S.   It would take about a month to get P examined by his doc and admitted into care.   Until then, they had to keep a very active senior safe and happy in a relatively small space, arrange for a high quality yet affordable memory care, reconstruct P’s finances after N put them under her control and then trashed them, clean out P’s condo and arrange for sale, and do a FT WFH job.  Then the calls started. First, a man claiming to be a local police officer called asking if P was with J and could they speak to him? When asked his badge number he mumbled something and then hung up.   P’s caregiver called: I know you told me not to tell N anything but she was so sad about P I had to tell her you were in AZ!   J: How could we trust you with P? You are fired.   Another call from LE in P’s county, this time the real thing. It seems that N reported P as a missing and endangered person, leading to them calling J and asking to speak to P. They asked if P was there under his own free will or being abused in any way.  P: Yes and no. Officer seemed satisfied.   Then 3 days later another call from law enforcement, this time from J’s home county. The sheriffs were standing in front of J's door (they not home) and wanted entrance and to speak with P to verify his condition. This time J refused to allow them to speak to P, as he had already been checked on by LE - here is her badge number. They leave and don’t return.   These LE calls were only the beginning of N’s harassment, and we now understand she won’t ever stop trying to get to her ex-fiance. But P is in a beautiful safe place now and seems very happy. He already has a bunch of new friends because he is still charming and handsome as ever.   I hope this story helps anyone who cares for  a person who may be vulnerable to this kind of vile predation. We appreciate the supportive comments.	0
My dad became unwell yesterday - very high temp, extremely confused, unresponsive at times, unable to walk.  I called the GP who triaged over the phone and advised we call an ambulance as dad was deteriorating and needed hospital care.   After 6 hours we called again and were told it would be several more hours. My parents live in a flat and we couldn't get dad up from the sofa, let alone down two flights of stairs in order to take him in ourselves.   This morning I called the GP back in tears. He came to do a home visit and has decided that dad is ok to stay home under the care of the community team as his condition is improving.   I'm relieved that dad seems to be better today but absolutely appalled. I work in the NHS but I've lost all faith that there's any support.	0
Yesterday was my Mom's 64th birthday, and the first that she had absolutely no understanding of or context for. This milestone, although obviously inevitable, has probably been the most difficult yet.  In past posts and comments here I've used some pretty foul language to try to express my feelings about this disease, but right now even all those words and phrases seem so inadequate -- and probably worst yet, futile.  I hate this. Although I was never particularly close with my Mom, my heart breaks for my Dad -- her primary caretaker -- who must endure this trajedy day in and day out, as he helplessly watches the mind of his wife of 38 years completely disintegrate.   I'm sorry, I have nothing constructive to add to the dialogue right now.  I just needed a cathartic vent.	0
Hi everyone! I hope you’re all doing well. We are HelpMate, a company run by PhD and Master's students with a mission to help caregivers and people living with dementia navigate their post-diagnosis journey.  **What are we doing?**   Currently we are gathering expressions of interest for our free pilot cohort-based program which aims to educate and upskill caregivers. The program will run for 4-weeks, comprising of a live session each week led by a specialist in the dementia space (GP, occupational therapist, nutritionist, nurse consultant, neuropsychologist) as well as hearing stories from people living with dementia and their caregivers. We are currently looking to start this inaugural cohort in late April/early May.  **Are you interested?**   If you are a caregiver and are interested in being part of a tight-knit community of caregivers and want to upskill yourself, please fill in the form below and we will be in touch!  [https://airtable.com/shrPPWzu0ODUh7GBx](https://airtable.com/shrPPWzu0ODUh7GBx)  **Why us?**   Our team has been navigating this space for months. We have spoken to over 50 different people including caregivers, people living with dementia, loved ones, clinicians, and academics and one thing was very clear to the team. We believe the dementia space lacks a medium for many new and existing families to learn about how to adapt to their new situation. It was also evident that for many families trying to find specific information for their situation, this can also be very difficult as dementia is different for every single person and family.  We hope to offer caregivers and their loved ones access to necessary information and surround them with a community of people who share their journey, with our cohort-based program.

My grandmother has been living alone for about 2 years and at that time more things have had happened that wad worrying as such.  AShe has gone away for 2 times already in which my father just bought an gps tracker for her so that she wont go again. Her hand got injured and got bloated because she fell down the stairs.  After this my dad was much more worried about my grandma, and made her stay here by lying to my grandma that she needs to wait for my uncle.  In the first few weeks it was fine and my uncle was able to come to our home again and again, but then in the fourth week or so my uncle left to go to america since he lives there nowadays.   This became a problem for her to get distracted and to make her not leave our house, and the weeks were pretty sufferable since we always needed to distract her so that she can't go to her home.  This time it was different, it was today where she went out of our house and tried to go to her home. Surprisingly she was near the place and she could've actually gone home.   Right now my grandma is arguing with my dad on trying to go home, she just wants to go home and me and my mom are very stressed about this situation because it is very irritating and since my mom is a baker, she always gets in the home. And my dad has had enough and had a mental breakdown about my grandma and surprisingly my grandma was fine about it and said sorry afterwards.  What do i do in this situation? I desperately need help because it is very stressing for my entire family and my mom wants to leave and rent an apartment somewhere so that she can work in a nice enviroment.  Please help.	0
My grandma has Alzheimer’s and she can barely see/hear so she “entertains herself” by scratching and fidgeting with her nails. Does anyone know of a fidget toy or ring or something that would be good for her? I googled fidget toys for adults but I’m wondering if anyone has experience with this and can recommend a product the person liked to use.	0
"My friend is in memory care. I don't even know why because I'm not family but was told by a staff member that it was alcohol that caused this, but I think it was inappropriate of her to say so. It seems more parkinsonian in that he can barely use his frame anymore and his foot hurts constantly even though there seems to be nothing wrong with it (now) He badly injured his foot about 7 years ago but it looks fine and wouldn't prevent ambulation. His voice comes out in short bursts. He has no memory of the past and I've met people with alcoholic dementia that certainly do up to a certain point. They would also constantly confabulate or retell the same story. His only story is ""going to get a car today"".   The last time I visited him before omicron lockdown I was sitting at the dining room table with him and on two occasions his face suddenly contorted into a look of astonishment (while looking at me). Both times his face went back to normal as soon as I started talking again. Any thoughts would be well appreciated.   PS I ran into him while visiting my MIL about 2 years ago. He just happened to be a resident in the same facility, so I visit both."	0
"It's been a rough couple of weeks with my mom (64 F). The week before last, she was stuck at home with me because she developed a skin infection on her butt from her nighttime fecal incontinence, and couldn't go to daycare because they wouldn't administer the medication she needed to treat it. On Thursday this past week, daycare called me to let me know that my mom was having a really difficult time and complaining of pain in her legs, crying more than usual and just not herself. ""Okay,"" I thought, I'll take her to urgent care when I pick her up. Well, when I picked her up that day, they came out with three bags of clothes saying that she peed through her clothes I sent her in, her spare clothes, and walked out wearing pants that were loaners. It was suggested they thought maybe she had a UTI and that might be why she wasn't seeming like herself. The problem there was, she had not been exhibiting any UTI symptoms at home. Urgent care ended up not being an option because they all need appointments, and the only clinic that takes walk ins is closed now for the foreseeable future after an electrical fire that happened the week we were there for her skin infection. So the only option was the ER.  They got her triaged and we waited in the waiting room for a couple of hours before she started sundowning and just would not stop crying over every little thing. The sundowning actually ended up saving us, because we were able to get her into a bed faster, and who knows how long we would have continued to wait if I didn't bring it up.  So we get her into the room, they cath her and say she has the cleanest sample they've seen in awhile, no UTI. No real explanation for her pain and exacerbated cognitive state. The pain is so difficult to help her with, because in the previous occasions I've had her seen for pain, it's really hard to pinpoint what's real and what's phantom, and then usually she's fine, but something does seem to be off. She screams as if I'm going to kill her when I try to swing her legs out to get her out of bed, or when I need to try and get her to sit up straight in bed, rather than hunched over to her right, or straining her neck, which will actually end up hurting her.  Anyway, the ER doctor was really sweet and talking to me about life with her as it is now, and suggested looking into getting a hospice referral from her PCP. Hospice had been suggested to me by a family friend, and that my mom doesn't actually have to be knocking on death's door, that we may be able to get the extra help just for comfort care. After the past two weeks, I feel like maybe these smaller conditions have just progressed her Alzheimer's further, and it might just be the disease pushing her into a new stage (she's already progressed so fast this past year, and has been settled in moderate to severe over mild since after she moved in with me last February).  I kept mom home with me on Friday just because we were up way later than she's used to while at the ER for hours, and I wanted to make sure she got some rest. Well, Friday morning after she woke up, she was really unsteady and unbalanced when trying to get her into the bathroom to change her, and she fell. I could not get her up. I could not get her to understand how I needed her to help me help her get up. She was too preoccupied with the fuzz on the carpet or with her shirt. When she was a caregiver for a man with Alzheimer's before she developed her own symptoms, the man she cared for fell all the time (not hard falls, usually he'd slip out of his recliner), and my mom could never get him up. The man's daughter told my mom she just had to call 911 each time he fell to have EMS come pick him back up. It got to the point that EMS told my mom that if she called one more time, she'd be reported for elder abuse and negligence. So imagine my immense dilemma when trying to decide if I needed to do the same. I did though, the guys who came were all great, and they were in and out in less than 10 minutes. But now I completely understand why my mom needed the extra help with the man she cared for.  I'm thinking hospice might definitely be something I want to look into, but I was hoping to get any perspective from those of you who may have had similar experiences with hospice. Any input, general information I might not know, suggestions or advice you may be able to offer would be really helpful! I'm also looking now into either a rollator or a wheelchair for her at this point, because the last thing I need is her falling at home, but also when we're not at home or she's at daycare. That's also kind of difficult to reconcile, because if she is at the point where she's not going to walk anymore, it's just going to make caring for her until I can get her into memory care, 10x more difficult, and it means that she is becoming further and further from who she used to be."	0
My grandmother is in her final stage of Alzheimer’s disease. She hardly moves and is bedridden. Her nurse sent a picture of her legs with mottling creeping up from her feet - said she would probably be with us for another two days.  My mom, my husband, and I went to go see her. My mom sees her frequently, but this is the first time I’ve seen her since January. She’s extremely frail, almost corpse-like.  After my husband and I got home, my mom calls saying she checked grandma’s legs and the colors has gone away. Has anyone experienced this with their loved one?	0
My dad has been in assisted living for a short while now, and that is going great.   The problem is everything else that remains.  My sister and I need to prepare his house and its contents for auction/sale. Of course, there are some things we both want in the house, and there are the feelings I have to wrangle with of “Should I keep this or not?” It’s like dealing with someone’s house after they have died.   I’m overwhelmed. I just want to get this task over with and move on, but it feels like there’s so much to do. I live three hours away and have my own family, so it feels like an impossible task.   I suppose I’m just venting. I truly hate all of this.	0
My great grandmother, recently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, was very fond of her two dogs, a pug and a corgi, however she couldn’t take care of them after the dead of my great grandfather, and has been living alone ever since. I was looking for robotic pets she doesn’t need to take care of, and saw two nice brands. Perfect petzzz and joy for all. Anyone know if there’s some hybrid with realistic breathing and sleeeping and the same functions as joy for that’s a pug or a corgi? Set aside 180 pounds for this, hoping I can give the dog to her before her birthday of April 28.	0
How do you handle this? My dad (alz, mid-way-ish through disease process) has diseased toenails that are difficult to manage. Should I have a medical professional assist in trimming every 2 weeks? It’s painful for him, but I’m always worried about possible infection.   Additionally, best shoes for alz. He has these no-tie sketchers but they’re getting harder for him to push on. Maybe crocs?   Edit: thank you everyone!!	0
I’ve gone through early-onset with family for decades. First my mom when I was pretty young 12/13 until 31) and now my sister from who knows when - past 20 years. My sister is now late stage. I don’t know how much longer she will hang in. I hate this. I hate it for them, and I hate it for me. Heartbreak my whole life. Trying to be positive, but some days are so bad.	0
My moms pretty bad off and believes that my dad who has heart issues ran off to die because he didn’t want her to find him. She also thinks the man taking care of her is her best friend MJ. My dad has never left her side and I know it’s killing inside. Is there anything we can do to help her kinda snap out of it or is it all just down hill from here?	0

My mom has been diagnosed and lived with alzheimer for 4 years. Her condition now is really bad and she doesnt have any common sense and manner at all, she can hardly be concious at things and even if I call her mutiple times she wont reply. But lately my brothers turned some sort of buddhism audio for her at night while she slept, I'm an atheist so I dont care about much but then he had to stop because my dad didn't want to involve in religious stuffs (yeah that's audio was kinda spooky for real). After  a few days, one night, it was like 1 am or something, I heard she was mumbling, normally when my mom sleeps, she has somniloquy so i just think that she is sleep talking but then I came closer I realised that she woke up and looked just like the first stage of alzheimer. She remembered me, remembered normal manners, remembered how to calculate and I asked her to sign her name-which she normally can't do, she did, of course sometimes she still mistook things but I surprised that she was concious and looked normal. But when she be able to read the clock and tell the time, she had to sleep and I was kinda afraid that if she sleep, things would be back to normal, and they sure were. But it was still strange how she turned from a person with barely any memories to one who acted normally and I was shocked. Have anyone met this situation before??????	0
This last year my father's mental condition has been deteriorating. He's in his early fifties and so young to be dealing with this. This week my father drove into another town, and was lost and confused as to why he was there. He was really scared. It's the first time something quite like this has happened. It's been really difficult watching such a capable person lose pieces of himself this way.   I don't know what to expect the process to look like, how to comfort him, and how to handle my own emotions during this. It's scary and feels like too much. Those who've been in my place for longer, how do you cope during the progression?	0
First I wanted to say this subreddit has been very supportive getting to hear everyone's stories/tips. I know many caregivers or loved ones can feel alone in the experience but this place helps.   My wife and I are finally moving forward this year to move my mother in law into a facility. Wife was adopted and hence why we are both pretty young (31) caretakers. MIL is turning 80 this Saturday and was diagnosed about 6 years ago. We have been the primary caretakers of her and have stayed with her this whole time. There have been so many ups and downs, but to see this amazing strong woman slowly degrade has been heartbreaking. She was a professional violinist who played for the Chicago Symphony/Chicago lyric opera. She is remarkably physically healthy for an 80 year. We have mentioned the change to her about moving to a assisted living place/memory care before. We described it as a place where she can make friends and do fun activities. She was always hostile towards the idea however and was adamant she would rather go live with family in Europe than go. There is no family in Europe that can take care of her but its one of those ideas that stuck with her. We are really all she has left. We have had visiting angels come and stay with her for a few hours during the day when me and my wife are working. That situation worked fine but was always temporary solution. We feel guilty moving forward with this decision but my wife and I would like to start a family of our own. Being a caretaker and raising a child would be immensely stressful. We have toured a great new place about 8 mins from us which has multiple levels of memory care offered. We have also have gotten an elder care attorney to try and maximize her money for her care. She has been in the middle stages for the last few years and is still able to do a lot of things on her own as long as long as its confined to her normal daily routine. We are not sure when this year it will happen but wanted to see how peoples experience it was moving your loved ones into a place. Any tips to make it easier or to prepare? I know it will be one of the hardest things we do.	0
Hi,  my grandmother (with Alzheimer's) has lost her sense of location and she tends to wander around (sometimes even outside the house to unexpected places). I'm worried that she might end up on the road (which is potentially dangerous) and sometimes it takes a few hours to find her. Since she doesn't know how to use a phone, is there some sort of technology that would help me pinpoint her location? Ideally, I'd buy something that can be worn all the time (doesn't need to be removed or charged) as her whereabouts can be during unexpected hours.	0
I talked to my dad. He moved into the assisted living facility last week, and he seems to be adjusting well.   I asked him if he was eating well. He said, “Yes, and you don’t even have to pay for the food here.”  I told him he was taken care of, and then I had a good chuckle.	0
I know that Alzheimer’s changes the way food tastes and can often make people forget to eat, but I’m at wit’s end with how to counter it.  For context: my mom is still relatively early stage (highly functional around her home, feeds and waters her cats like clockwork, keeps everything immaculate), but she’s extremely frail and losing rapidly. She’s 5’4” and has dropped from 120lbs in 2020 to 104lbs today — from 110 to 104 in just the last two months.  All her life, she’s been beautiful and slim, so eating very little is engrained in her identity and she’s convinced she’ll “get fat” if she eats more. She also complains that she “looks pregnant” and feels full when she eats even the smallest amount. To make matters worse, she hates the taste of EVERYTHING except biscuits, Kraft cheese, potato chips, potato salad, and sweet protein bars — all of which she eats very little of because she remembers that those foods are unhealthy.  Offer meat? She refuses, saying she hates the taste no matter how it’s cooked (even chicken fingers). Fish? She argues vehemently that she’s allergic (she used to love salmon but there’s no convincing her). Protein drinks? She finds them disgusting, saying they taste like “milk.” She no longer likes the taste of nuts. She doesn’t like beans or legumes. She’ll agree to eat vegetables and salads, but not enough to gain weight (and trust, they’re cooked in olive oil to get as much healthy fat as we can). As someone who tracks her own macros religiously (powerlifter), I’ve measured what mom eats and it fluctuates between a 400-800 calories/day.  On top of disliking nearly every food group, she frequently cites not feeling hungry. And yes, we’ve thoroughly investigated with the doctor to make sure there’s nothing else causing this (MRI, gastric emptying test, extensive bloodwork). He believes it’s because her abdomen is compressed due to the kyphosis (hunched over posture) caused by osteoporosis, driving her to feel full quickly and experience discomfort when eating more. And yes, we’ve tried getting her to eat small meals throughout the day, but that doesn’t make a difference. If anything, she eats less, thinking she’s had a bunch of meals already and thinking we’re “trying to make (her) fat.”  She’s already anemic due to B12 AND iron deficiency (we’re supplementing), but I’m so afraid that she’ll die of malnutrition long before the Alzheimer’s takes her.  Any advice is welcome. At this point, I’m ready to shove an appetite stimulant down her throat.	0

I had a horrible revelation today that I’d not thought of before.  (I’ve  lived with her 24/7 for 5 years. So no “I see them once a week and understand” nonsense replies). I’m going to have to send her to a home when she becomes even worse. Or I’m going to have to try and wake her up one morning and find she’s dead. Either way I’ve failed.	0
My (26m) dad is about 7 years into early onset Alzheimer’s. I recently put everything on hold and moved in with my mom and dad after finishing my undergrad degree to help out on a more permanent basis. We spend every moment of his waking life with him, just trying to keep him happy and safe and healthy. He needs help with nearly everything, even going to the bathroom. We are in the process for care home placement but my mom is careful because she had a very bad experience with care home mistreatment with her own mother.  My dad’s mood changes rapidly and sometimes he becomes violent. It is usually triggered by us reminding him to take off his boots or jacket, or anything else that threatens his autonomy. In this state he will punch the walls, throw things, and get in me and my mom’s face with a very crazed, unpredictable, frankly *feral* expression and body language. Today, about an hour ago, was the second time I had to get physical in order to protect my mom. I couldn’t be sure whether he wasn’t going to punch her in the face. I am terrified of head trauma because we think my dad’s condition is related to head trauma.  This time, he wouldn’t calm down. I kept my body between my mom and him. I would put my arms up to protect myself when he would raise his own fists. But he wouldn’t back down and he was breaking things. We called 911 (for the first time) expecting there to be an option for a mental health police dispatch, which (we found out too late) exists just outside our area, but not in our own municipality (Delta, BC, Canada). However, regular officers came. They tried to calm him down for a short time but when he continued to be violent they handcuffed him and took him away.  We are expecting a call back after he’s taken to the hospital. My mom is feeling very guilty and thinks he was mistreated by the officers and that he will be misunderstood at the hospital. I agree with the idea that the police did not deal with it in the most effective way, and that the hospital might also be a bad idea, but I’m not sure whether to feel guilty.  However, I want to believe we did the right thing given our options. I don’t think I can physically prevent myself from quickly intervening physically with anyone who raises a hand against my mom. In fact I think I would regret it for the rest of my life if my mom got seriously hurt when I could have prevented it.  thanks for reading. any comments welcome	0
We just moved my Dad to assisted living this week , on Monday, and today is the first day i haven't cried about it so far.   All of the hardships and emotions aside, I'm trying to find ways to make his life there easier.   I did order one of those TV remotes that has 4 buttons on it to make it simpler, but I was wondering if anyone has any ideas for having full access of the TV remotely.  &#x200B;  I read someone set up a raspberry pi and IR emitter or some other crazy setup, but I'm not really at the point of pursuing that if there's any other option.  I'd like to be able to turn the TV on and off and access all TV menus (changing input) as well as opening youtube and bringing up videos for him remotely.  Is there ANYthing even close to something like that in existence?  He does not follow instructions very well so 'push the volume button' would be a struggle.    Complicating things is the multiple remotes, so if i DO hook up a amazon fire stick, he's not going to know how to use the remote.    &#x200B;  Just curious what strategies others might have had for helping a loved one remotely with a TV.   He's definitely getting some more activities this week than he was at home, so it's not like i'm encouraging him to just sit in front of the TV for 12 hours,  but if he wants to watch the news or a sporting event or some educational videos, I'd like to be able to make that happen for him	0
We are moving MIL into a facility local to us after all. We toured a few places back in December, but after visiting with her and the rest of my spouses family (small family- his mom, his uncle, and his grandmother) we decided to move both MIL and GMIL into an assisted living facility in their state. MIL and GMIL live together, and it is not safe for them...at all.  I'm not entirely sure what happened, but we get a call this week saying that GMIL understands our reasonings for moving MIL to our area and that it needs to happen quickly. GMIL is getting scared of MIL's behaviors and their memory doctor said she needs 24 hour care immediately.     We made the call yesterday afternoon to our first choice facility that is specifically for Alzheimer's patients. Looks like this is happening soon. Very soon. Like within a week or so.      It's going to be hard. I know once we bring her down here and out of her familiar space things are likely to deteriorate quickly. I remember going through that with my grandfather. But I am so devastated knowing that deep down, GMIL knows this will very likely be the last time she sees her daughter. GMIL is in her 90's and can't travel easily. We are definitely going to have to get uncle up to date on technology so we can video chat.	0
My wife and I have been married for over 45 years.  The last couple of years I have seen a decline in her memory/cognitive abilities.  Our family primary care physician noticed this too.  A year or so back he tried to refer her for testing but she was in denial and would not go. But lately, in the last few weeks, there has been a significant change.  She has begun speaking to me about myself in the third person.  She is confused about who I am.  She told me that she wished that I had known her father (I was with him the night he died).  When I pointed this out to her she became afraid and we had a good conversation.  We agreed to go for testing, which we did a few days ago.  Spent 5 hours with a neuropsychologist, who gave a tentative diagnosis of mild dementia.  But she also wants to order a brain scan before she adds Alzheimer’s or some vascular issue in the brain to her diagnosis.  So we are waiting on the scan.  She is afraid.  I am wondering if this rather sudden change in her memory and cognition may be indicative of a rapidly developing case of dementia/Alzheimer’s.  Hopefully we will learn more after the scan. Any info or wisdom appreciated!	0
Hello :)   My mother has been showing cognitive decline for about 5 years now.   They mostly manifest as short-term memory problems, loss of concentration.    However lately, she has been showing signs of deeper agitation.   She calls her sons up and says she want to divorce her husband, that he's not a warm man, etc.   This is her sweetheart of 40 years.   Her caregiver in many ways.   She also has moved out of their shared bedroom.      The pandemic (and my divorce) has caused her circle to shrink.   She has been with her husband in their small bubble.   He is going deaf and is vain about getting a hearing aid.   I've been imploring him to get one.   My mom is so intuitive and sensitive.   When she calls him cold and too focused (only in the last few weeks), i have to connect that with his lack of hearing / awareness.       Anyway, I set up and appointment with her neurologist today.   The purpose is to get her into see a neuropsychiatrist and this is the first step.   Perhaps there is some medication that she can take to help her depression (i know the dangers of treating dementia patients for depression).     The problem is, that we've been mostly shielding her from our thoughts about her 'delusions'.  She does know she has a bit of memory problems...but that's it.   She always resists the medications (namenda) and visits to any doctor that is connected to cognitive decline.   It's as if her pride and indignation are coming to the surface with this condition.  She thinks she's a 20 year old superstar.   Do you guys think it makes any sense to bring up my concerns with her in the room?   Or does it makes sense just to observe her visits, and have a follow up call with the doctor.   I just know that if it was me who was the patient, I would want to have agency and awareness about it.     Thanks!	0
I have been taking the night shift with my non-mobile grandmother (93) 2 nights a week for the past month. I am in need of some advice on a few things.   1. My grandmother remembers me and all her family but does not remember that we are at her house, where the bathroom is, basically any short term memory (if she has eaten today, that she has asked the same question every 5 min for the night).... Is this a stage? Like what to expect in the next stage or will everything just go away all at once?  2. I have a toddler and must admit that my visits prior to helping out were short. I feel that my grandmother is getting worse during the time that I am here and she says things that make me know she feels lost without my aunt.... Do az patients get worse when something changes? I don't know that this really matters because my aunt was basically the sole caretaker and she has a lot of other things to handle so I can't stop. Just wondering if I'm pushing things faster than it should go.   3. When something terrible happens or she gets sad about something it returns like a broken record. For example, my uncle fell down the stairs one night (typically nothing is retained longer than a few minutes) but that night she awoke every 30 minutes in a panic because she was worried about him (he's fine.). Is there a way to help some other things stick? Like I considered putting a sign up that says bed time 8 pm with a clock near it so she would stop fighting me to go to bed at 6. (In all actuality, I don't think staying up later makes her get up less throughout the night but that was what I was told.)   4. My grandmother gets mad at my aunts (1 main care taker and 1 helps periodically) and will get aggressive and mean to them. With me she doesn't do that at all, but with her and my uncle needing help and feeling like I'm struggling with my toddler and work and life, I have snapped at her 2x. I never have gotten like actually mean but for instance when she keeps on saying she was going to turn off something I told her to go ahead, knowing she can't stand on her own. And when it dawned on her that she couldn't I felt terrible and cried a lot that day when I logged onto work. How do you keep from snapping when you are tired? You can't walk away, you can't explain like you can with a 2 yo because its gone a minute or two later. What do you do?	0
I'm a student of a biomedical illustration/communications program and am creating a patient/caretaker education piece for my Masters project. My grandma has Alzheimer's and my family has found it very difficult to find succinct resources for patient care. I'm wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences and what resources you'd find helpful.	0
I’ve gone for years like the dog in the meme in restaurant that is on fire and he’s saying “This is fine.”  It’s not. My mom is starting to go down hill. It’s become so painfully apparent. Her identity and memories are like sand in an hour glass and I feel like I’m doing whatever I can to slow the inevitable. Grasping and grains!   She’s misplacing things regularly. Having a harder time finding words. Getting more confused. She gets disoriented in the evening about her room being a different room. Her hygiene is declining and I have to remind her to bathe and brush her teeth. She does weird stuff like put her coffee in a Tupperware container or a Netipot  and drink from it. She once put Neosporin in her eye instead of eye drops. She rummages through our trash and pulls things out and hides it in her room. The list goes on.   Lately she has been stressed and sad and I see the pain in her eyes. I found a new neurologist that we really like who is active in the disease with books and studies. Compassionate too. He recently put her on a Rivastigmine patches at the lowest dose and I’ve noticed she has become more depressed and restless. She has been having episodes almost daily. Saying she is miserable and she wants to go home. To park her things and leave. She has lived with me for years.  It’s so disheartening and stressful.  I wanted this medication to work for her and slow down the disease. It’s not been easy.   I’m at a loss here. I want to help her.   I’m hoping that we can up her lexapro by another 5mg. She’s on the lowest dose at 5mg. She’s always had depression, anxiety, and mood swings. Always made threats. She has history of instability, and for once she found that with me because when she moved in with me I told her she needed to take her medication for her depressions.  Over time we found a balance with only an episode once or twice a month where she is upset and locking herself in her room for a few hours. Now that the rivastigmine is in her system for the last two weeks it has been almost daily. I don’t want to give up on it yet.   Any advice or insight is appreciated. Thank you for reading this far.  ADDING:   She recently became more disturbed with the introduction of Rivastigmine. Trying to find balance but I know this battle is not an easy one.	0
Today dad moves into assisted living. I can’t help but wonder how long he’ll be there. He’s entering stage seven, and he’s seen such a rapid decline over the last two years, I kind of hope he doesn’t have to stay long.   My childhood home will have to be sold. My dad will never live in his house he and mom paid off years ago. All he worked for has been reduced to a studio apartment, a small amount of possessions, and a failing mind.   Such a sad day.	0
My nan has Lewy Body dementia. She is prone to violent outbursts which include hitting, kicking, pushing, throwing things, etc. a couple of days ago she attempted to pick up a chair and throw it. No amount of reasoning, talking, or yelling gets through to her in these episodes. How do we intervene in these situations? If we can remove the object she’s using as a weapon we do but sometimes she’s after you herself hitting and kicking. How are we supposed to handle this? Does anyone have any advice?   Also, we are actively trying to get her in a home but none of the homes in our area will even return our call. We have tried showing up in person and still no is is available to help. It’s a frustrating situation, I just think they don’t want another Alzheimer’s patient in their care.	0
"I hate Alzheimer's . This diesease is heartbreaking. Currently we have my father in a licensed assisted living facility ... but his condition is worsening faster then anyone thought. Some of my family want to begin talks about him going into memory care... as he showed his first sign of Sundowners... obsessing over a document and refusing to eat and staying up for 24 hours because a ""document told him to do so."" What can be done? What is sundowners?"	0
Her mom has voiced her concerns with her dad's recent behavior - being forgetful, worsening reading comprehension, short fuse and saying things that are rude or hurtful then moments later wondering why he'd say those things. My fiance is wondering if she should contact his job to find out if he's been having any issues at work.   Would this be something that is okay to do? What are other steps she could take instead of the above? Any help is appreciated.	0
I wasn't there to see it, but my mom brought my nana a baby doll and acted like it was a real baby. My nana absolutely loved it. she was rocking the baby, singing to it, even stroked its cheek. I'm sad I wasn't there for it, but I'm so happy that she had a good day	0
"Hi all, I'm located in Nova Scotia, Canada.   My 78-year-old mum was finally formally diagnosed with Alzheimer's dementia in January. I say ""finally"" because her symptoms have been progressing rapidly for the last 18 months but  my father, nearly 86, her primary caregiver, kept dismissing everything - including delusions, confirmed by her family doctor - as age-related memory loss.  My sister and I were hopeful that once an expert told him it's something much more serious, he'd be more open to seeking supports like a meal service and home care. He's trying to care for mum and manage the house and just failing dismally; they developed a fruit-fly infestation before Christmas due to the state of the kitchen, couldn't stay on top of kitty litter boxes (the last cat has, mercifully, passed) and Mum is not bathing on a regular basis.   But...having gone through the MMSE with a score of 10/30, and despite a very clear and specific report from a geriatrician emphasizing the importance of home care, dad is still in denial. He says he'll look into home care ""when he feels it's appropriate,"" despite fully admitting that he will do anything to avoid conflict with mum, which results in her not bathing or eating regularly; and that he struggles to stay on top of laundry and basic housekeeping (hence fruit flies.) My sister and I spent most of last week cleaning the house, sorting and cleaning mum's clothes, and generally decluttering the house to make it more navigable; but she adamantly refused to bathe; we also had several very tense discussions with dad in which he repeated all of the above or just insisted he was managing and then stopped talking to us.   He grudgingly contacted the provincial Alzheimer's society last week at my/my sister's insistence (and I should mention that the society apparently reached out to him after receiving a referral from the geriatrician - but he didn't return the message and tried to claim he'd never heard from them, which we have verified as a lie.) The society could be his link to home care resources and other supports - but my concern is that he will continue to downplay/deny mum's condition and refuse any and all supports.   So...I have medical power of attorney for both of them and our province has a legal mechanism to revoke his guardianship but I'm in need of some help to determine when to exercise these nuclear options. He's running himself ragged and not caring for mum appropriately; they're bound and determined to stay in their home, but we don't have any confidence at all that that's a safe option unless he agrees to regular home care. Should I consult an attorney? Contact the province with concerns about his guardianship? Wait to see if he agrees to homecare? If so...how \*long\* do I wait?Many thanks for any insights, and my love to everyone else dealing with the many, many facets of this condition."	0
Hello all. My grandpa has Alzheimer's, and honestly it hasn't gotten to a very bad state yet. But heres the issue my family is facing. My grandpa always thinks he has already eaten. If you ask him, he says he already ate, so he ends up not eating unless we give him food. He will only drink tea and eat a piece of bread otherwise. Does anyone have any advice for calorie dense foods i can give him, just so he doesnt starve himself? Hes from Bolivia, and he goes there for a few months in a year, and this last time he came back so skinny, basically skin and bones. But at the same time, because hes from another country he thinks any american food will kill him. So we can't give him the average american meal thats is usually calorie dense.	0
My Nana has had Alzheimer’s for 14 years, (I’m 17) and I only really noticed how bad it was when she moved into memory care. She couldn’t come over for Holidays and has bad sundowning. I learned this week that she’s declining fast and has been getting angry with the staff (NOT like her at all) and now she can barely verbalize. She’s 83. Im terrified of the day she forgets who I am? Please, I need to know how to get through this.	0
My nana’s aging specialist recommended it for my papaw and I was wondering if it would be a helpful read or if anyone knows where you could find larger prints.	0
...but after we hung up the call, I burst out crying because I know where his disease is taking him. I put it on speaker and recorded the call on my laptop just so I can have it. life is unfair, it always seems to put us all in the worst possible situations. I hate this.	0
My dad (69) has been dealing with early onset Alzheimer’s for about 7 years(ish) now. His neurologist thinks it’s directly related to the massive scar tissue he has from a brain aneurysm he suffered when he was 29. His decline has been rapid in the last year, with his days mostly consisting of sleeping/resting for the last few months.   Yesterday he had a grand mal seizure. My mom called an ambulance and they took him to the local ER. He was released later that night on anti seizure meds . She’s set up appointments with his GP and neuro for the next few weeks. He thinks it’s 1992 and is very, very confused. His speech is all over the place and he’s far more regressed than he was two days ago. Has anyone else experienced this with a loved one? Did they “recover” back to where they were pre-seizure? Just trying to wrap my head around what to expect.	0
I realize this may be asking for a magic pill for those with Alzheimer's.  Has anyone heard of a method that can help them regain their taste (other than adding salt) and sense of smell? My family member has practically a complete loss of both. Ty	0
Hi /r/alzheimers - i'm not sure where to go to ask for help. Last month my mother moved her father into memorycare down in Florida. He had been living with my aunt and uncle at their house with my grandmother (his wife) in the West Palm Beach area, but it got to a breaking point of not being able to care for him. Today we were told he is being kicked out after physically assaulting a nurse for a 2nd time resulting in the nurse being sent to a hospital. My mother is scrambling to find a new facility that can care for him, as moving him back into my aunt's house is just out of the question. Does anyone have recommendations in Florida, specifically near the Palm Beach area for dementia/alzheimer patients that may get violent?	0
Anybody here have experience with their loved one with Alzheimer's being used, dumped and sued?     Why are some people such garbage humans?	0
My 80 year old five-year-old gets into everything... respects nobody's boundaries (constantly pulling things out of my dresser)... dumps his pills into his pill water... puts trash in the recycle bin... but wants to stay at home... keeps changing the settings on our TV (currently the language seems to be Dutch, note, we are not Dutch!).  The toll on my sense of agency is rather large.  Don't worry, guy, it will take some time to get you a memory care slot.  But I'll be so, so ready.	0
Hi all!  We are a group of graduate students at Stanford looking to better understand patients' experiences with clinical trials.  Specifically, we’re working on a project that aims to match people with trials more quickly and easily than many of the existing, cumbersome methods.  We’ve created a survey (below) that we hope gives you the chance to voice your own experiences finding therapies that work. We know that living with any disease or chronic condition is exhausting (never mind finding a trial), so we’re extremely grateful for the time you take to fill out this survey.  Of course, your privacy is extremely important, so all information is collected anonymously (unless you choose to provide your email for followup). Please let us know if you have any questions or suggestions.

"My mom will only eat thing that are warm, soft, and sweet. And more and more, if it's not sweet, she won't eat it. She always has room for ice cream, for example, but is just ""way too full"" to eat another bite of soup. We rely heavily on Ensure (which she's now starting to pour into everything she eats) and she's well past the point where we're worried about getting her a healthy or even balanced diet.  We need her to eat, period.   But... I'm wondering if adding stevia or something similar to her soup or potatoes would help her appreciate them more. Have you had any success with this? Appreciate any tips!"	0
My grandfather phoned the police twice reporting my grandmother missing. She died a couple nights ago… fuck Alzheimer’s	0
My grandma is progressing and speaking with her on the phone absolutely sucks. She was given a new phone that is a wall phone but since the buttons are on the phone, she accidentally pressed them just to confuse herself and hangs up thinking it’s someone else calling her.   I’m one of the few grandkids (she’s very luck and has 15) she still adores and remembers. I actively call her once a week and the conversations are getting increasingly harder to follow. I’m very patient and she can still form thoughts but it takes so much longer. She also really only talks about what is actually in front of her. She doesn’t remember what she’s eaten an hour before or who she spoke to today.   I know she loves the phone calls so of course I’ll continue especially since I know she won’t be able to talk or communicate at all. Im just so mad that the last of “easy” ways of communications are going to shit. It’s so sad.	0
my mother was codependent with my father before he passed away.  they both exhibited narcissistic behaviors as well.  she gained some friends before her dementia really increased, and then she effectively stopped all of those relationships because of paranoia.  So now she shadows me (i’ve lived with her since my father passed away) and is just continuing her codependent behavior with me.  this might seem a silly question if i read it myself, but when you’re in the situation sometimes you can’t see the forest for the trees.  is the only way for me to reduce her shadowing and codependent behavior (toward me anyway) by removing myself physically from her presence?  i want to ask for some companion care help to start coming by, with the idea that a) it’s another person and b) they might take her on outings to meet even more people.  but i have the feeling that while she still has me to concentrate on, she won’t give other people a chance.  she also already dismissed adult day care centers as “babysitting”.  i want to stay home and get things done.  but should i be looking into moving out instead?  it seems so drastic, but…?  TIA.  bless you all for hanging in there.	0
I’m on mobile so the formatting will be bad.  So I was driving back from a neighboring state today because my dad had to pick up his motorcycle from his parents and I drove back. We took my mom with us so she was in the car with me on the way back. I was doing really well until my dad had to get gas.  I parked in a good spot and was really proud of myself because it was kinda small between the rows of places. So when my dad was done, I began to back out. The car stopped and I thought “oh, I’m probably close to a car or something” (even though the beeper didn’t go off), so I put it in drive and slowly turned. Long story short, I ran over the curb on my front and back left tire. I was pissed because I was doing so well and fucked it up.  When I had to make upturn when we pulled out of the station, the 4 wheel drive turned on and the car was making a skidding sound and I couldn’t move faster. My knee is where the button is and my knee probably hit it. There was a car coming (not fast and in the left lane, I was in the right) so that just fueled my anger and I was obviously pissed. My mom then said to me, “you don’t need to get upset about it. You’re doing a great job.” She didn’t raise her voice, there wasn’t any anger or irritation in it at all. It was calm and reassuring. She didn’t say anything bad about the mess up and told me to focus on how good I was driving.  I haven’t heard her talk like that since she got sick. It was the clearest I hard her in years. Yeah some words were jumbled, but it was like she was normal again. It was like that the rest of the way back home. Before we pulled into the gas station, she was gasping when I would switch lanes and when we’d go by trucks, but for some reason the gas station is where she changed. Obviously when we got back she went back to how she has been, but holy shit it hit me hard. As we driver back, I kept it going because I wanted to experience her somewhat older self for as long as I could.	0
"Hi all,   My dad was dx with early onset Alzheimer's in 2013. By last April, he had stopped walking, eating/drinking and all the end stage business. He's not verbal.  He went into a memory care unit and has been under hospice since.   In hospice he ""recovered"" a bit, insofar as they feed him enough to keep him alive. But he's still nonverbal and in a wheelchair. I visit him 1-2x a week. I wish I could see him more, but I work, have a husband and 3 kids.   I'm just kind of struggling with this today. He was a great person. An incredible, intelligent, awesome dad and a good partner to my mom for nearly 40 years. He doesn't deserve to suffer as he does. And I feel selfish saying that I'm tired of being gutted watching him go through it.   Any advice?"	0
We have been fighting for a diagnosis for my MIL (67) for years and the doctors dismiss it. She also vehemently fights it insisting we are all conspiring against her.  Long story short, we all know her well enough and spend enough time with her to know she isn’t right and we don’t need a diagnosis to tell us what’s happening.  What advantage is there so continuing to pursue a diagnosis? It creates a lot of conflict and tension for my FIL to fight that battle. The only advantage i can think of is if the medications are effective but the reading I’ve done makes it seem like that’s questionable? I’m happy to be wrong about this though…	0
Old news, and don't expect any miracle cures, but thought some of you might find this interesting.    [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24156265/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24156265/)     From what I gather St Johns Wort is beneficial in relieving alzheimers.  I've been trying it with my mother on and off for years, though haven't noticed anything substantial.    Even if it does help someone else's family even slightly it was worth the post.	0
What can i do to help and support???	0
I spent years taking care of my pap and I couldn’t bear watching the disease take him anymore. He basically slept all day and couldn’t function much at all. Towards the end of last year I started to feel upset as I watched his skin start to break down, I tried my best to tend to his body. I was also fighting with my dad because nobody wanted to put pap on hospice, I did the brunt of the work and we all needed help.   On January 4th I sat down and wrote a post to this group. I was broken, sad, and feeling unheard. I could only be so grateful for the advice I received. I remember sitting in the bathroom in tears typing back to all of you, and then I prayed to God. That he would please take my pap so he could rest. He seemed miserable and I couldn’t do it anymore. Immediately after, he started declining very fast.   Early in the month he began shutting his eyes more and barely wanted to sit up. I’d have to hold him up while spoon feeding him, all with his eyes closed. The week of Jan 17th I noticed his chewing get slower, and slower, and slower. By Jan 24th he was just holding the food in his mouth, getting just 1-2 bites down each meal. By this time pap wasn’t talking for weeks, just mumbling. But when I laid him down that day I told him I loved him, and he said I love you back as clear as day. By Jan 26th he stopped swallowing liquids and food completely. I worked those two weeks straight and stayed by his side. After that, the doctor said all we had to do was lay him in bed and wait. By then he was very weak and stayed asleep all day. By Jan 30th, I admit I was scared. He was losing weight so fast and he looked worse by the hour. He was nothing but bone, I remember how light he felt. I was hoping he wouldn’t linger to long. I arrived the next day and found him resting peacefully for good.  Wherever you are pap, please stand by me. I’ll miss you terribly. For all of you out there, stay strong. Everything comes to an end eventually. Please wish me luck as I’m trying to find my next job. Help me out pap! Lol.	0
Hi, I was a domiciliary carer in 2019 for 12 months, so spent time with clients with alzheimers and dementia, the experience of which has been useful for my mom, because her neighbour has been diagnosed with alzheimers - and the poor woman is getting very little support. Mom, herself 81 years old, does what she can, which is admirable, considering her neighbour has been horrible to her well before the illness even began.  I know things can't carry on as they are, so I'm joining groups for support and advice, and in time, I may be able to help others.	0
My mother is 57 and I’m worried about her. She is her normal self, but over the past years she has been a little bit forgetful and she doesn’t care too much about cleaning as much anymore. Is there a way that she can be diagnosed early? If she is found to be in the early stages is there anyway to slow the process?	0
My Mom was very recently diagnosed in January—up until just the last month or so her issues have been mostly benign and memory related, but now she has come to believe I stole something from her house.  At first she wouldn’t even say what it was, just that “I knew what I took” but she was mad enough she nearly hit me. Eventually we got it out of her that it was a two pages she had taken out of a magazine—needless to say I hadn’t even seen them let alone took them.  I know this isn’t an uncommon sort of thing with Alzheimer’s… what I’m not sure about is how to get her to move on from it… it’s been many weeks now and she keeps sending me angry emails. Obviously she’d didn’t believe me when I told her I didn’t take it—any strategies for what to do now? Do I just wait it out until she forgets about it? Will she forget about it? Do I “admit” to taking the pages, tell her their destroyed and beg forgiveness? Is there some way I can give her a resolution to this?  It would be awesome if we had some idea of what they actually were or what magazine they came from, but there’s no hope of that—she’s become obsessed with cutting stuff out of magazines and putting them in binders and on display all over the house so there’s no chance we’d be able to track it down.	0
Her condition is getting worse, beyond what we're equipped to handle. I knew we'd get to this point, I just didn't think it would happen so soon. We haven't had nearly enough time to get our ducks in a row and it's come back to bite us in the form of a last-minute scramble.   My dad needs to call the lawyer about Medicaid so it's on me to look for potential long-term care facilities. Any suggestions on what to ask? I am in a daze. He said to ask about what care comes standard and what is extra, and I want to ask about how they handle meltdowns, but what else should I be looking for?	0
This is long. Thank you for taking time to read.  So my dad has always been a little neurotic, has had mild OCD and control issues, he has achieved great things throughout his life and his identity is tied with an immense knowledge of a million things. His mental functioning has declined noticeably from all his family members, he forgets most things like appointments (he has used a calender for years so that helps) but he says things now that aren't true, for example he says he talks on the phone to my brother frequently but not true, he said he was at Verizon for hours and his new wife said they came 30 minutes before closing, or he tells stories about his life that are way exaggerated, I don't even know if any of it is true) and recently doing anything with him has been like dealing with an insolent teenager (for example, his cell phone wasn't working right- there was a lag on the line where after he would finish speaking it would go quiet and if you talked it cut off the first 2 seconds of your reply. He blames Verizon who has excellent coverage but it was likely the phone, he did superglue a beeper tracker to the top. Who knows why but either way he wanted to switch carriers, so I take him to T-mobile and 6 hours later we leave empty handed because he complicated everything since it's his way or nothing at all, and he doesn't understand the way things work. He needed to set up a Myverizon account and he didn't remember anything about his account).  Whew that was a lot to say, but everything he needs to do is like pulling teeth, he will not listen or let me help him with simple things, and he is so confused, he doesn't remember or understand that when you get a new phone or install something for the first time you have to log in, he thought it was a scam when I went to the google play store and downloaded the mail app he uses.   He gets obsessive and fixated on little things that he doesn't even understand how it works and is overwhelmed because he gets behind on the important things like moving into his new house.  He just turned 75. He has has weird nerve pain, was diagnosed with polymyalgiarhematica from a rhumetologist and is on prednisone (and has been for about 8 months but after lessening dose it came back hard), and now is taking hydroxyquinoline.  Long story short, he was sent to a memory specialist or something like that to do testing a couple weeks ago, there were 3 sessions, and now he is going to a memory center (outpatient I assume) my sister says, she thinks it's because his new wife who is a very loving and supportive person (my sister doesn't know her very well but I have spent a lot of time with this lady, even just us, who was his gf for the past few years and I know her well) my sister thinks she is trying to deem him mentally unfit, he made her his power-of-attorney after they got married a few months ago.  My sister thinks basically it is fishy and the should have put him on a medicine to make it better, she is an RN, and thinks it is fishy he is being sent to a memory center for day rehabilitation.   Is this the normal process? He must have had a neurologist refer him there, right?   Sorry. This was long. Please give any advice you can, it's hard even getting any information from my dad and I want to compare it to what his wife says.  Thank you!	0
The reasons for grandma not going to bed are getting longer. Tonight she says - sat in her chair, in front of the TV, in the living room - that she’s already in bed.  Wonder if she’s going the same way as my other grandma and slipping into full on dementia.	0
"He is 87. My family has had suspicious based on his behavior in the past couple months, but now that it's official, I am devastated. He overheard the doctor tell my grandmother and when they got in the car, he told her that his ""life is basically over."" That shatters my fucking heart.  He finished cancer treatment in February of last year and was basically on the brink of death due to the huge toll it put on his body, he was put on hospice and we all had pretty much realized and accepted what was going to happen. But he miraculously pulled out of it and everything was going well again until now.  Has anyone had a family member diagnosed around this age? How quickly did their condition deteriorate? I'm terrified and don't know what to expect at this point.  Thank you all in advance"	0
My dad has early onset Alzheimer’s. I have toyed with the idea of getting tested for the genes linked to it. There are 3 genes linked to it and from what I’ve read, it is almost guaranteed that you will get early onset. I’m not sure if getting tested will give me relief or change my life and how I live it. Or maybe I’ll start taking medication for it at a younger age. Can anyone share their experience on whether or not they’ve decided to get tested for the EARLY ONSET genes?  *I wanted to stress that I’m talking about early onset because with the other genes related to late set Alzheimer’s, the chances of getting the disease, even if you have the genes, are significantly lower than in the case with early onset. Also, obviously, with early onset, at least for me, it seems more terrifying since it typically cuts your years more than late onset. I know nothing is guaranteed and that cures could come and yada yada.	0
My mother is slowly approaching her 50th birthday. However, I am scared that she will Alzheimer. She don’t show the symptoms but I am scare that she will get it and soon forget me. I want to her lessen the chance of getting Alzheimer. I know none of my family have dementia or Alzheimer but I am scare by the fact it could be there.  I know physical exercise and dieting can lessen the chances but what other stuff could help? Reading the sun has gotten more worried about my mother health, she very important for me! I don’t want my mom to forget me	0
Hi. This regards a man with Dementia but I thought it was close enough to hopefully relate to someone's experiences here.   Background: I am the caretaker of my friend C, a 78 year old man with Dementia. I am very close with and work alongside his bio son who is power of attorney and between us, we handle C's life for him.   About two years ago we went through all of C's credit cards and shut them down, or so we thought.  There were about two cards that we did not know existed and subsequently missed paying them off and shutting them down. The initial charges were small, about $100, but the late fees really piled on.  These cards over the past two years have substantially destroyed C's credit. We are worried that this destroyed credit will ruin his availability to get in to a nursing home of his choosing, which is a scenario that is approaching quickly. Do we have any availability to challenge these credit damages, on the grounds that C's Dementia has taken away his comprehension? How does this work? Do we have any options to get back his previously stellar credit score?	0
My mother is 69 and lives a sedentary lifestyle. She decided to divorce my father at 57 and move to Vegas way far away from anyone else. I now struggle at the age of 24 to balance my mental health between work, relationships, and so on and so forth. I am the only child and have been given the godly position to watch after her. Shes been driving erratically for a couple years now, asks me the same exact question later on in the day, and generally is declining in tactful social skills and any initiative. I don't think I'm ready to be her sole caregiver at 24 and just want to live my life now. What can I do? Should I change my attitude? My location and just get outta there? I have this pension to be just free and live but I also care about my mother's well being. Why must this seem like a rock and a hard place?	0
Hello all! For those of you caring for or attending appointments with an Alzheimer’s patient, do you know how often they have CT Scans or MRI’s done of their brains? Yearly? Do doctors track progression this way?	0
Hi all, my (34F) mother-in-law (89F) got diagnosed with Alzheimer’s just after I met her, about 5 years ago. She’s been living in her home with my boyfriend and I, and while the whole experience has been frustrating (feeding the dog 6x per day until she throws up, feeding the dog human food, throwing away food we just bought, buying tons of batteries/cottage cheese/cabbage, anything left on a surface “put away” never to be seen again, shadowing and sun downing, etc) we’ve been rolling with the punches.  Last December she had hip surgery and had to sleep in the study on the ground floor. We thought maybe this would turn into a permanent stage, but beginning with the first night she was home it was catastrophic. The exit alarm we put under her mattress seemed to go off twice an hour. We had blocked the stairs to the second floor with chairs and signs, but she fought us to get to the chairs, bit her son, called us a bitch and bastard and that she would never, ever forgive us for this. Every morning she was back to her sweet self.  Fast forward to two weeks ago and she was exercising in the kitchen with her home health worker (they are in the house while we have to work from roughly 11am-3pm) when we think she stood up too quickly and fainted. She fell and hit her head and broke her humerus just below the shoulder joint. Spent 3 days in the trauma center of the local hospital before being discharged to a rehab center. She’s doing better with the pain (not sure if healing or they’re just doing a good job staying on top of it with the meds) but mentally and emotionally it’s been horrific. We tried to visit as much as possible during the first two weeks, but she is fixated on the thought that we are doing this to her and we want her out of our lives. She doesn’t even know her arm is broken and it’s impossible to have any kind of rationale discussion with her because facts are only valid for a few fleeting moments at a time.  All of this is complicated by the fact that when she was younger, she uprooted her own mother (who had dementia but no Alzheimer’s) from her home and brought her to live with them, but then had her children drug her ice cream and drop her off at a senior living center when it became too much. She keeps saying “I would never do this to my own parent, I would never do this to someone I love.” I can’t tell if she’s feeling guilty or honestly believes that.  She has a doctor’s appointment this afternoon and I’m kind of dreading either outcome— staying at the rehab center or being discharged home. I know I will have some more specific questions depending on what happens, but for now I think I just needed to vent.	0
My dad was ‘misdiagnosed’ with AD in Feb 2019 at age 57.  He started showing symptoms in his 40s. Summer of 2020 he was then diagnosed with CBD which is a progressive disease that affects movement, speech, and memory. For him, its short term memory. he could tell you everything about his childhood, college years, anything up until maybe 5 years ago but doesnt remember falling last weekend. Hes losing his ability to talk and think of words. When hes trying to think of a word, he’ll explain it but then forget the original story. God it hurts. I cannot think of anything more painful than seeing your smart, funny, intelligent, and hardworking dad become a different person.   I suppose im just wondering if any redditors out there are familiar with it!	0
I need to ask here because my sister and I have exhausted all other options. My father passed away 2 years ago (63 aneurisms) My mother 73 has moved from her home (Africa) to split living with me and my family (Europe) and my sister in the UK.  She had been saying her memory was bad and my dad had been saying it for a few years before he died. Now she is living with us it is clear how bad her memory is. She is in very good physical health does not drink or smoke.   Her memory of anything recent is non-existent. She claims it was brought on by trauma from my fathers passing, but it's not that. She is very educated and use to read about 3 books a week. Now she doesn't. She cant remember anything she forgets to eat lunch and brush her teeth.   We have had her seen by a phycologist who put her on a mild antidepressant - no change   She had an MRI scan - All Clear   She had her blood tested - All clear   She was asked questions by a specialist but she answered them fine. She knows things like who the Priminister is and how to spell words backwards.   What do we do now? It comes to a point where she is not able to be left on her own as she can't remember which garbage goes in which recycle bin etc.   I realise Reddit is not the place for medical answers but I just don't know what more to do. I don't want her to have Alzheimers but I can't understand what is happening to her.	0
My dad has been having memory problems for 2+ years and slowly declining. I've been assuming it's alzheimers and mentally preparing but he lives in a different state than me and I can only do so much between visits. He recently stopped attending our weekly video/phone chats (a month ago) and I've been trying to call/text/email/any contact him for a week now with no response from him.   Some context:  The only person in his town he has any contact with is his ex-wife, who tells me she still drops by or at least hears from him at least once a week. He's doing 'okay' (i.e. no safety concerns but lots of other concerns). He often doesn't pick up the phone because he doesn't hear it or thinks he's 'busy' and doesn't want to be bothered. He used to consider me his 'favorite' and would only talk to me if he wouldn't pick up for others, but now no contact at all from him.  My brother and I are both on a durable POA for him. We both live several states away. No other family to help besides ex-wife. He's more and more paranoid and is quite distrustful of strangers these days.  He kinda hoards and doesn't clean his house and has ferrets he takes care of. I'm starting to get worried about the animals if he is not talking to me anymore; clearly something about his routine changed.  Before he stopped talking to me he had been telling me stories about seeing people in his house (which he couldn't describe), thinking they could take care of his pets and then realizing they weren't real, thinking they were kicking him out of his house so he got locked out one night and couldn't remember how he got back in, etc. He has gotten lost more often on his walks (he has basically chosen to stop driving due to eyesight, thank god). He misplaces items all the time and buys new versions so his house has massive quantities of basically everything. So it seems he was getting bad and now he's probably worse.  I just found out THIS WEEKEND from his doctor that he missed his last neurology appointment a month ago and that LAST APRIL the doctor has diagnosed him with 'probable alzheimers.' This whole last year we had no diagnosis to try to do anything with; now it feels we are suuuuper running out of time. His ex-wife has offered to go to an appt with him but if he won't pick up the phone (and he often doesn't answer the door for her even when expecting her) how do we even get him there?  He lives in Albuquerque, NM--a city with limited resources and a police force known to abuse citizens, especially those with mental health problems. So I refuse to call the police for a wellness check. However, he has a gun in his house (no idea if he even remembers he has one) so all concerned are not willing to be forceful when they try to drop by or check on him and he's not answering the door.  He has always been ridiculously stubborn nothing is wrong. He has said before, when he was a bit more lucid and we were talking, that if something was wrong with him he wouldn't want to know about it anyway. I think he realizes he's getting worse and trying to distance himself from people, but I feel soooo responsible because I have POA and he's my freaking dad.  I'm feeling very stuck and helpless and I don't have a lot of time/resources to be traveling back and forth between multiples states (especially when he won't pick up or even answer his door). I either need somebody to give me ideas on what I can try to do or somebody to tell me what a reasonable mental limit is on the responsibility I place on myself. This whole thing is the worst.	0
FIL 72 seems to be starting with this. His mother suffered from it, so it wouldnt be a surprise. My wife might be the one who will need to deal with everything because MIL is almost blind. But he is not willing to do anything now, not about the things he own or his health, I am just wondering whats gonna happen when.  Any help is welcome, personal experiences as well.  Thank you	0
Hi everyone! I hope you’re all doing well. We’re a group of PhD and Master's students from Melbourne and we’re conducting research on people living with dementia and their caregivers to develop valuable resources and tools.  Specifically, if there are any early caregivers whose loved one has received a diagnosis in the last 1-2 years, we think our personalised action plan may help you navigate the journey.  The action plan is free (and will remain so), thus we are not looking to sell it. Our priority is getting feedback from caregivers to improve the action plan and make it as useful as possible for as many caregivers as possible, and we hope that your valuable feedback can help us  If you’re interested, please visit [https://www.helpmate.life/post-diagnosis-dementia-action...](https://www.helpmate.life/post-diagnosis-dementia-action-plan?fbclid=IwAR20685ijfXWFTWyh84GGJJwKhpYGWwy_EezXGML2OldBNkF_r1Pn3Povoc) All you have to do is fill out our 2-min questionnaire and the action plan will be emailed to you.  Or, if you’re willing to give some of your time, we would love to talk with you, just comment below.  Thank you for your time!   \[Admin, please feel free to take this post down\]	0
Just got done with the blood draw. My neurologist ordered a genetic test done for all the known alz and dementia variants since my late grandfather had alz hit early, my father is worried he has it, and there’s concern for it to potentially be the fun and rare familiar kind of alz. Doc was glad to do it, especially since I’m only in my 30s and the earlier we know, the more we can try as meds as research improve.  I’d rather know the risk than not, it’ll make planning for the future while both alive and dead easier, and I view it as a higher quality of life since I wouldn’t miss any of the moments I want to experience before anything should happen, but damn. The weight of it all hit after the blood left my body.   I don’t know really what I’m looking for by posting, if I’m honest. I’ve done the research, my doc is great, I’ve got genetic counseling, I’ve experienced the decline and fall of alz in my own family, and I know nothing is guaranteed even if I do light up the dementia panel like a redneck christmas tree. I guess it just feels like y’all would understand more than others and sounding off into that kind of ether felt right.  Anyway. Now I just wait. And probably worry, despite all the reasons not to.	0
Hi, there I am looking for places to find recommendations for beneficial products and services for caregivers or LO's of those living with dementia or Alzheimer's? Thoughts	0
My Mom has had Alzheimer’s for the past eight years. She will pass with the help of Hospice in the next few days. Even though I knew this day was coming, I feel so unprepared and hurt so much. I don’t want her to suffer anymore, though. She is in another state. I am trying to decide whether to fly and be with her or say goodbye on the phone because she won’t be aware with the drugs she will be on. I kind of want to remember her as she was our last visit. Is this disloyal to not want to be there. She has my three brothers. I don’t know what the right thing to do is. Please give me advice.	0
Ghoulish anniversaries have been haunting my days.   [https://www.stumpedtowndementia.com/post/there-s-a-whole-lot-of-her-missing](https://www.stumpedtowndementia.com/post/there-s-a-whole-lot-of-her-missing)	0
Everyone I’ve met with Alzheimer’s was kind of a sour puss before they were diagnosed.  With my grandpa he saw his father die as a young child and never talked about it. He still knows it happened but doesn’t want to talk about it ever. With my uncle who has passed he always acted smarter than everyone in his life and almost looked down on a lot of his family for never leaving their small town. So a theory I have about Alzheimer’s is that it forms from not being honest with yourself and keeping feelings trapped inside for so long the materialize as the brain disease we know as Alzheimer’s. I am starting to notice little things with my mom now (who was touched as a child and hates to talk about it). I am wondering if any of you have had problems with someone who has had a “good” life because everyone I know with it has been blocking things from their consciousness for a long time which leads me to believe that has something to do with it forming. I’m going to start going to therapy so this doesn’t happen to me.	0
My mother is 64. My family is increasingly concerned about dementia. She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 30+ years ago which was fairly well controlled with lithium for decades until the lithium damaged her kidneys (she was taken off at the end of 2017). She now takes seroquel, topomax, and clonazepam, as well as blood pressure medication.  We have noticed more memory and cognitive issues in the last year or so. For example: - difficulty following storylines in shows and movies - frequently misplacing items and believing unknown others are taking them or messing with her - repeatedly asking the same questions or telling the same information - when filling out a medical form, she stared blankly for a while before finally leaning over and asking me what the year is - difficulty grasping sequences of events or multistep processes - difficulty using her iPhone - multiple, repeated small car accidents that culminated in an accident that totaled her car in October 2021 (fortunately she is no longer driving and no one was hurt)  These cognitive issues seem to wax and wane and sometimes are more apparent than others. But generally she does not seem to be where she was a year or two ago.   More debilitating is the nightly terror and paranoia that really sets in in the evening. She is unable to stay alone. Her first episode with paranoia that required mental health hospitalization was in September 2020. That paranoia waned a bit but since the spring of 2021 it has been plaguing her almost every night. She has done much better during the day, but she does get anxiety in anticipation of the evening. We have home health aides coming in to stay with her at night but we are pursing assisted living.   She can dress herself, shower, go to the bathroom, and even cooks sometimes but seems to be incapable of “running her life.” She is not eating well. Her house gets dirty. She is currently in the hospital for the second time in three weeks. She took Ubers there both times concerned about herself having a stroke but both times they ran tests and determined that she did not have a stroke. They weighed her and she weighed just 105 lbs and she is 5’9” tall. (They have had her there since Wednesday this time and after explaining to the physical therapist all that is going on, they are recommending skilled nursing for a couple of weeks while we figure out next steps… we are awaiting insurance approval).   It’s hard to tell if these are mental health issues or cognitive decline (or both). We are interested in having her evaluated for dementia or at least a new psychiatrist who has a fresh perspective on her mental health. Her current psychiatrist does not seem to be helping and just sort of shrugs his shoulders. She is open to seeing a new psychiatrist. We are not sure, if she does in fact have dementia, whether the medications she is prescribed are appropriate or exacerbating things.   Does this sound like your loved ones’ progression and symptoms?	0
Definitely needing some advice, my uncle was recently found wandering off, doctor says he has dementia, very middle stage. He is currently living with my parents and they have found a wonderful memory care facility for him. He refuses to go, and the facility says “they don’t have people for those that refuse”My Mom has a full power of attorney, what can they do?  He’s very argumentative, and verbally aggressive. My Mom has a heart condition and the emotional toll is already ruining my parents, but they don’t know what to do now.	0
Hello,  My dad has pretty advanced Alzheimer's. He can remember our names and who we are but he is not the same person...you all know how it is. I recently got engaged and my partner and I are wrestling with the decision of whether to have a smaller ceremony sooner or go with our original plan next year September. Has anyone had any experience dealing with this? I just don't really know what to do...how will I feel if he progresses and isn't aware of who I am? Do I care about my wedding that much - it's just a day? But he wants to see us get married so...? So many questions.   TLDR - dad has Alzheimer's, worried if I wait to get married he will forget who I am and miss it.	0
Hi,  Just wondering what the sleep cycles are of your loving other with alzheimers?  Do they wake up when the sun rises or shortly after, and stay awake for the majority of the day?    Reason being I have just read this post that the clearance of amyloid-beta plaques are linked to a healthy circadian rhythm sleep cycle.  In general my mother sleeps in quite a bit, and if we don't wake her up for breakfast or a shower she would naturally sleep until around 2pm in the afternoon.  On the odd occasion where she has to wake up very early for a doctors appointment, we would expect her to be overly tired, but she actually seems more alert.  I'm going to try to force early waking up with extra light, vitamin d, music, coffee etc in the hope to regain a normal sleep pattern and see what the effects on her alzheimers.  So just wondering what the sleep cycles are of everyone elses, parent, grandparent, spouse etc.    [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/02/220210154215.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/02/220210154215.htm)	0
"I am looking at something to manage Mom's medication routine better. She's done well with us sorting them into a standard daily sorter, and her taking them throughout the day. It's become obvious that she's struggling with the routine. I've been looking into devices and have found the MedReady MR-357 ([https://www.medreadyinc.net/products/medication-dispensers/monitored-medication-dispensers/medready-mr-357/](https://www.medreadyinc.net/products/medication-dispensers/monitored-medication-dispensers/medready-mr-357/)). I was wondering if anyone here has experience with this device (or a different model).  I primarily picked this one because for a few reasons. It offers the ability to plug it in, meaning that she will have to leave it where we put it and not take it to her chair, bed, or wherever the current sorter keeps appearing. It doesn't have to be tipped to remove pills; she drops the pills while dumping them now a lot, and she doesn't have finger mobility issues to have problems pulling them out instead. It has the option to sign up for a monitoring/emergency notification service now or down the road. The alarm will encourage her to keep a better medication schedule than she currently does (which is ""whenever""). The monthly fee is more reasonable that other options I've seen.  What I'm hoping is that it will also have a phone app or web site where we can see her activities. This may only be available if paying for the monitoring service, but I can't tell for sure. I would appreciate any and all input from this awesome group, including suggestions if you are using something with your person that might work as well or better. Thanks!"	0
"It was a bit of a fight but my fathers condition declined and he experienced a increasingly frequent difficulty with eating and swallowing (especially with thick liquids) over the last year.     I best describe it as his having a ""tip of the tongue"" issue with  **initiating the coordination** that is involved in swallowing.  He wanted too swallow (whatever was being fed to him) but a combination of a fear of aspiration and inability to get past some hurdle involved in starting the swallow caused him to not be able to eat or drink.     He was hungry and thirsty and would hold something easily swallowable like apple sauce in his mouth until he all finally leaked out (he got tired of holding it).      Now once he got past that hurdle (on a good day) he would eat hungrily and swallow everything just fine but those became less frequent and he started a slow decline in his maintain weight and staying hydrated.      Knowing my father, his wishes and how he would have handled this for other family members in the same condition I went ahead and advocated for his having [a feeding tube (PEG Tube](https://www.asge.org/home/for-patients/patient-information/understanding-peg)) put in place.    I was not offered by his (former) primary care physician and when I mentioned it's installation she replied that a ""PEG tube did not extend their life"".  Which reeked of a blatant lie she use her nursing staff to inform me of.  My retort was ""How can proper feeding, hydration and  the giving of medication NOT extend the *quality of life?""    I even went so far as to state that the denial of food and nourishment is something the Nazi's did to people.*   Despite this, the argument of *""quality of life""*  was one that they couldn't get around.   That it was about the quality of life and how my father wanted to eat... but was in fear of choking.   We had to change doctors within the hospital system and eventually got multiple referrals from everyone from the speech therapist on up to his new primary physician.      Then I had deal with multiple refusals and roadblocks from the gastro dept.     It was the same counter argument from the surgeons in the gastro dept.    *""It doesn't prolong their life""*   To which I not only replied that the family is unanimous in it's desire but it's entirely in the keeping of my fathers wishes to have a PEG tube installed so as to     ***""Prevent hunger and to provide proper care and comfort, that it is a matter of good medicine in the alleviation of pain and suffering from hunger""***     The PEG tube surgery was approved and successfully accomplished as a same day procedure and has been used ever since.      I'm happy to report that my fathers overall condition has **noticeably improved.**   He's  alert, his meds and food is given on a regular schedule, he's well hydrated and gaining good weight on his body.  His pressure sores have all healed and he's doing very well (all considering).     He's  had recovery in his presence of mind and ability to communicate his wishes.  He's also **regained his ability to eat on his own and swallow without difficulty.**    So he now eats for pleasure and I give him what he asks for...     (we play 20 questions with a list of foods until I say one that he likes)    He loves oranges and other fruits, little snacks like [beef jerk](https://www.amazon.com/Kirkland-Signature-Steak-Strips-Ounces/dp/B01K30Z326/ref=asc_df_B01K30Z326/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=241869531501&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=5218741398513562805&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9061183&hvtargid=pla-668855256888&psc=1)y and has no problem with things like slices of Pizza.  He does this without the risk of choking and the swallowing is perfect.   This is all on top of his liquid meals that are easy to serve along the meds [I crush in a mortar.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H7DRSM6?ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details&th=1)     \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_     I feel that the doctors in the system often opt for *giving the families an out* and to offer this excuse for not going this route and allowing people to starve as they would in a hospice situation.   It's also possible that the for profit hospitals have a policy to cut costs in care as my father who was in danger of being starved to death is now out of the requests for placement into hospice (meaning that he's no expected to die within 6months time), he's back into the care of his (new) primary physician.     *One might wonder why I had to fight over 3 months to get this feeding tube installed?*  IF someone starts to experience a difficulty with swallowing due to the progression of the disease I strongly urge you (the family/caregivers) to keep this in mind, that IME, the HMO's will put up roadblocks against a PEG tube as a excuse to withdraw proper care and for the HMO's to save money by lessening the time caring for a patient (legally speeding their demise)     It's system wide IME, I've seen people in a memory care facility where they lose the ability to feed themselves (the family gets charged through the roof for the extra time and ""feeding"") The client/victim's get starved over time and when they become weakened, they'll be shuttled off into hospice where they are gone within a month - because they won't try to feed them there.     Sorry if this hard for some people to read, it's not my intentions.    I love my father and it hurt me knowing that he was hungry and unable to eat.   How he felt was clear in his gaze and angry frown as well as his expressions of frustrations at repeatedly trying to initiate a swallow..  and not being able to do it.     That is torture.     Now my father is much better off  than he was 2 months ago, he's well fed and comfortable with improved health."	0
My loved one is in final stages, no longer eating or taking meds. She had a stroke and lost ability to speak coherently. Her pupils do not respond to light. Yet she does not seem to be in distress -she mostly sleeps. One thing she responds to is music especially when someone sings familiar songs. She tries to sing along.  I found out she likes Tupelo Honey by Van Morrison. I hope the rest of her transition can continue peacefully.	0
Hi lovely people. I am new to this community and could really use some clarity/some help in how to deal with some sundowning.   My grandmother is 91 and has dementia. The Dr. now suspects she also has Sundowning. She's not at the point where she can't remember her family etc. It's mostly little things. But the biggest struggle is the sundowning. And it's not the typical sundowning I've been reading. She's not forgetful, but she becomes unconsolable in some way or another. Our typical symptom is 'i feel weak' and that she's going to die. Her head starts to hurt to the point of uncontrollable moaning and then she gets so cold. For about 3 hours she's hysterical crying that she's not feeling good and screams over and over that she's cold. Her ears start to ring and she's almost going mad. She never forgets who we are or where she is. She paces the house moaning and screaming and crying and using saying 'why is this happening' 'whats happening' It's terribly unsettling and really taking a toll on everyone. She's usually ok by 7:30/8pm and will go to sleep. The next day she does wake up drained from last nights episode and will cry and be depressed most of the day. By like 12pm-3pm she's pretty good.   Has anyone else dealt with this type of sundowning before? What are some ways to help her? Calm her down? Is there anything we can do before hand to make it less severe? Since we know the time it's usually going to happen I feel we can try and chase it. Some days she's perfectly fine. My mom is her caregiver and tries to keep her as busy as possible during the day. Giving her little tasks she can handle. Last night the dog jumped on her lap during a very bad episode and that helped a lot. However, I don't live with my parents and her full time and the dog is mine, so thats not always a solution.   Cheers and love to everyone going through this.	0
"My MIL is in a bad spell lately. My husband has for the past year been visiting her regularly for 2 week stints, working from home there and giving his sister a break from checking on her... During his current trip, she has asked why he's staying so long, why we aren't with him, are he and I getting a divorce, we must not even miss him, etc. She doesn't seem to remember that he's been doing these trips regularly for a year. I'm tired of seeing my husband's siblings not try to help and him afraid of upsetting the apple cart, so started looking up resources in her state. (We live 2 states and 9 hrs away.) I did find a care program that may be of help? To be eligible, a person has to meet 3 of the following:   (some she is questionable on, other I think a case can be made for)  1. Basic communication skills – such as using a regular phone, mobile phone, email, or the internet.  Well-- she can use the phone. But often dials a number thinking she is calling person A, and in reality it's person B. And she will forget she has called people, to the point of calling daily and not realizing it's not the first time. She uses NO other technology. Computers are for spying and are evil. We've heard from family members that they call her and she doesn't know who they are.  2. Transportation – either by driving oneself, arranging rides, or the ability to use public transportation.  She lives in a rural area. Doesn't recognize many locations even though she's lived there over 50 years. Talks about several times she's gotten lost. Has even told us about going on a ""Sunday drive"" to see Alaska -- one state west. (No, that is Colorado)   3. Meal preparation – meal planning, cooking, clean up, storage, and the ability to safely use kitchen equipment and utensils.  She only really uses a microwave. Occasionally uses an electric skillet. Doesn't seem to know how to read packages for cooking info or how to follow a recipe. Will purchase 2lbs of hamburger to make herself a burger and leave the rest to rot in the fridge. If she doesn't later make a meal from spoiled meat. Will go through the trash to pull things out if we clean out her fridge. Has told my husband things like she's never seen pork chops before & doesn't know what they are. Her diet is mostly chicken nuggets, corn dogs, toast, coffee and tea. And driving to town for tacos or burgers.  4. Shopping – the ability to make appropriate food and clothing purchase decisions.  Has little concept of appropriate amounts of food to buy, and it's like shopping with a 5 yr old. She can buy clothes when needed. But suspect she is with her daughter when she does so.  5. Housework – doing laundry, washing dishes, dusting, vacuuming, and maintaining a clean place of residence.   Mostly ok, til you consider the pipe delusion -- she had a cracked sewer pipe last year. SIL had it repaired. She still swears it's broken and dumping raw sewage under the house. Tells us she needs to crawl under it and clean up, and will pee in a cup, and poop in a bin with a sack in it and throw it in the trash. (Though this delusion hasn't been brought up during husband's current stay) Aside from that, housecleaning is something that she is fanatic about & seems to be muscle memory.  6. Managing medications – taking the correct amount of medication at the correct time. Managing re-fills, and avoiding conflicts.  She has been on blood pressure meds for decades, but if she had to add something new? She cancels Dr appts if they call to confirm with her, so her daughter has told Drs to confirm through her instead of her mom. She doesn't really know why she is seeing any particular Dr.   7. Managing personal finances – operating within a budget, writing checks, paying bills, and avoiding scams  My husband says she can still do this. Til I point out his sister actually does a lot of the bill paying and management of her bank account. She can't really avoid scams; she thinks phone company reps are trying to scam her, yet has almost fallen for several scam calls til my husband or his sister step in. She only uses checks, but now that many places don't take them, she gets frustrated easily. As when getting groceries.  So! If you've had experience with assistance programs, does all this sound like enough to qualify her? It's really hard on my husband, and I am hoping to find an answer that doesn't mean declaring her incompetent but that eases some of the burden from him."	0
Hello everyone, new to the sub. Just looking for some advice from more experienced caregivers and maybe some encouragement that we didn’t make a horrible choice.   My MIL is 66. Alzheimer’s ran strong in her family- her mother and sister both passed away from it before age 75. I believe her sister only lived for 2-3 years after her diagnosis. My FIL passed away in November 2019 (she was 64 at the time) and she was exhibiting pronounced odd behaviors and executive functioning/memory issues during the aftermath of his death. At the time her kids attributed it to grief and stress. We now suspect that her symptoms started much earlier and that they both (FIL and MIL) took steps to minimize or hide them. So it’s possible that she would have been an early onset diagnosis but we don’t know for sure.   She sold their home without any plans for her living situation. She moved in with her daughter but they have never had a great relationship and it caused her significant stress and depression. So she moved in with us. It became apparent to us very quickly that she should not be living alone without assistance. We are a young family, our first child is 19 months and we do plan to have more. She has now been living with us for a year. During the year she’s been here we have managed to confront the deficits in her functioning. She went to primary care first, where she scored an 11/30 (I believe) on the memory screener. She went back 6 months later and did just as poorly. She was referred to the senior health and memory center. Her initial appointment was with a social worker, they gave her the test again and she did worse. Her next appointment was with the geriatrician 2 months later and she took it again and scored a 7/30. They were very concerned as she was a teacher with a master’s degree, although she also wasn’t trying very hard and she gets very angry and distressed during those tests. They asked for a CT scan to rule out stroke or tumors and it was normal. They then asked for a paper and pencil memory test. The accumulation of appointments (Gyno, primary care, routine screenings, etc.) really got to her and she refused the test and any more appointments. She began saying that she cared for her mother with Alz, that the memory tests are demeaning and degrading, that there is nothing they can do for her, and that she will not spend her remaining time going to endless appointments. They closed her referral and to my knowledge never officially diagnosed her.  When all of this was happening, we decided as a family that she could live with us permanently. She is fine money-wise, so she contributed half the cost and we are building a new home where she has a bedroom and bath on the entry level. We move in July. She is able to pay privately for some in-home assistance if/when we need it. We have set up her PoA for medical and financial, set up a trust for her kids. Right now she is doing okay. Her physical health is great. She can still handle her hygiene needs, her appetite is okay, she doesn’t wander or hallucinate. I work from home so I am with her at all times. She does drink wine every night (1-2 glasses) after we go upstairs to bed and she gets extremely defensive and depressed when we suggest she should reduce her intake. We are trying to walk the line of giving her autonomy and when to step in and control things.   I am just so worried about keeping our children, and her, safe and happy as this progresses. She wants so badly to spend her last years around family and her grandkids. She loves playing with my son. I just don’t want her to put anyone’s safety at risk, I don’t want to cause my kids unnecessary distress, and I want her to feel comfortable. But I don’t know what the next steps are. Am I overthinking this too soon?	0
My grandmother who’s 87 was been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s many years ago, I never actually knew my grandma. I never felt the connection that grandmother and granddaughters would normally share, I never knew what she was like before her Alzheimer’s set it. All I knew is that she was a very distant woman with her family and never contacted them unless she needed money. I never learned to love my grandma. Fast forward to todays timeline, my grandmas Alzheimer’s has gotten worse. I have many uncles and aunts, out of my 4 aunts only 1 has been able to take care of my grandma for about a year until she got fed up and now my grandma bounces houses between my uncle and dad. This of course confuses my grandma even more. The neurologist tells them it’s unhealthy for her to change houses every 2 weeks but my uncle and dad are very stubborn. But what hurts me the most is to see my mom struggle with grandmother. My dad hardly if ever lends a helping hand, I try to help to my best of abilities but I can only do so much. My dad pokes at my grandma to make her upset sometimes because he finds it amusing and the one who has to deal with it is my mom. My moms mental health has declined so much. This morning I woke up to find her with red eyes, I knew she was crying at night. I know my mom doesn’t want to take care of my grandmother. My dad obviously doesn’t care enough to notice. He tells my mom that he’s fed up with her for not wanting to take care of her mother-in-law. My dad can’t comprehend that my mom isn’t cut out to take care of someone with such a disease. My grandmother isn’t friendly either the other day she was claiming to everyone that she hasn’t eaten and proceeded to hit my mom once she was told she had just ate. And my dad? No where to be seen to put the situation at ease, the only one that can really calm her is my dad. And when my dad gets fed up with her he yells and throws a tantrum, but my mom? God forbid if my dad ever sees my mom frustrated with my grandma. My mom was diagnosed with depression not a few weeks ago and I don’t know what to do or say or how to help. I just don’t know anymore. Everyday it’s the same my grandma would pee on the floor overnight only for my mom to find it and clean it up in the morning, bickering between my grandma over whether or not she ate, she’s constantly checking everything to find something, everyday something goes missing because my grandma will hide it, we can’t take my grandma anywhere because she has a habit of stealing or calling people mean things. I hate all of this	0
She’s finally at her apartment as we reference it. It’s brand new but the company has a great reputation. It couldn’t have happened at a better time too. Due to the stress and progression, she has started to hallucinate. Her speech has gotten significantly worse and she’s forgetting the people she sees daily.   I love her so much and I hope that this week she has a few good moments. It’s going to be a hard transition for sure but I’m grateful for the place she found.   What I’m even more grateful for her is that since she is one of the first people to move to that unit, they exempted her from the “move in” fee. I found out that that’s normal but at her place it would’ve been $6,000.   Looking forward to seeing her at the end of the month. Even with all the drama and family issues, I’m taking today to be proud of her from afar and hope she sleeps well.	0
Hi All --   New here as it only occurred to me to look for a community on Reddit now. I'm in that place (that I've been for a long time) where it's all feeling so heavy, too heavy, and I'm alone.   My mom had early onset FTD in her mid-40s and died at 59 (my age 10 onward). I'm the youngest of 3 and my 2 older sisters (both mid 40s) have early onset Alzheimers. One much worse than the other.  I live on the other side of the country from them all but my entire life is now thinking about this disease, either about my sisters or about my own potential to be next (yes, I know there are tests. I haven't decided what I'm going to do about that yet).   I'm exhausted, I'm angry, I'm sad, and I wish I had support + people who understood the heaviness.   Thank you for letting me have this moment to share and I promise to read your many posts before mine and give thoughts and encouragement.	0
I'm scared that I'm going to get it. I don't want to forget my life. How do I prevent myself from getting this?	0
My MIL was diagnosed over 6 years ago. It's been a slow progression, buthas now reached a place where she can no longer be taken care of in a safe way 24/7. My wife and SIL decided that memory-care was the best option.  Does anybody have any advice on how to manage the transition? She's on the waiting list and realistically that could be months before she moves in. Based on past experiences, is there anything we can do to help prepare for the move? Any way to make that transition easier?  Thank you!	0
i found out today that my grandpa has Alzheimer’s and its really shocking and i dont know how to react my dad is not taking it that well and i don’t blame him. the only thing that keeps coming in my head is that he’s going to forget me and everyone else and i just dont know how to feel right now is there any advice that you guys can give me on how to deal with this and be there for my family	0
My moms case has been fairly slow in progression for the previous 5 years but has started to ramp up since 2020. I haven’t yet decided if that’s a blessing or a curse.  She is 84 so hopefully old age takes her faster than the disease. My 85yo dad is her caretaker or should I say gatekeeper.  He needs support to continue to manage her but ultimately he lets her make the decisions. She needs reassessment but …. “I don’t want to push her” “She said no” “She changed her mind.”  She wanders the house all day rearranging things: “I’m downsizing” She hoardes food in her room, makes grocery lists - and yet there are 8 containers {48in total} of Costco muffins in the freezer. Why? Because she insists on sending my dad - who will do anything to please her- out into the world. I’m certain he enjoys getting away to some extent.  Who wouldn’t, but often returns to petulance…. “I was dressed and waiting at the door, calling, why didn’t you wait?” (never true.) Did I mention he has End Stage COPD and a pacemaker?  In a pandemic.   She’s hidden all of the family’s generational jewelry, gawd knows where. 7 days ago she soiled her pants and tho she still had the presence of mind to change, she has hidden them in her room. To that end, I’ve never seen her wash her own clothes (they smell of course) but washes dad’s compulsively.    She is incredibly possessive of her role as a (barely capable) homemaker. She mistreats anyone (me) who tries to help after watching her struggle for 3 hours in making grilled cheese sandwiches.  She has taken to drying linen tea towels in the oven as it ‘cools 😮 I made dad buy a fire extinguisher but it’s still in its original packaging… in the car… 3 months later… in no danger of being useful if needed. Why? Because “mom won’t like it.” With his COPD he couldn’t get to it in time or he’d collapse trying. Can I have a ‘WTF’ here?   She is incredibly possessive of my father and has jealously threatened him that it’s either her or the cat. She doesn’t care if we (herself included) starve until dinner but if I prep a breakfast or lunch for dad and I, she petulantly exclaims that she was going to surprise him with xyz meal (not so)  What I didn’t anticipate was the way I’d resent this angry, mean, manipulative, paranoid woman who has snatched my mom’s body and taken the family hostage.  I feel terrible for complaining but I’m basically her punching bag & it hurts.   Vent over   Edited for spelling.	0

"I've lived with my grandma my whole life (33 years). She always gave me food, shelter, and even helped pay for college. We are a poor family and I'm the first to get a bachelors in my family thanks to her. We've lived in this trailer since I was 1 year old. These days she acts like she's in another world, she cries frequently, she can't form sentences, she obsessively picks at the carpet, she's forgotten her husband (died 1996) and parents and me, and she requires assistance with everything.  Today when I finished feeding her, I asked if she remembers all the times she said ""I had the best grandma"". She said ""yes"". I told her that ""I think I have the best grandma"". I told her how much I appreciate everything she's done for me in her lifetime and that I love her, and I already miss her so much. Her response was half of an incoherent sentence before she took a bite using her invisible spoon. I told her I would go get her some ice-cream.  I went to the kitchen and bawled my eyes out and still as I type this. I was a robotic, monotone, and mildly autistic person my whole life so being vulnerable is difficult for me. I don't even know why I'm typing this, I guess I just want to hear what everyone has to say and maybe hear some relevant experiences."	0
Hello all, I’m sorry if this is the wrong place to post. Would appreciate a redirection if so.   I’m a bit concerned for my mother, 57, but I’m not sure if if my concern is misplaced. I don’t live near her, I’ve come to town for a visit. I’ve only spent a couple hours with her so far.    1. I asked if she could take me to a dental appointment (I know, weird because I’m visiting, long story). I asked her this over text, she understood, she used the phrase dental appointment. She picked me up, but when she arrived she was shocked to be driving to the dentist, she genuinely thought I was heading to an interview.   2. I asked her to remind me of my sisters street address, she couldn’t remember the street name. She was absolutely distraught that she couldn’t remember. She seemed like she was about to cry.   3. She said, spontaneously, sometimes she tries to think and it’s like there’s some block. She can’t remember things or understand things. And again, seemed distraught.   4. She misremembered a conversation we had, but at the time she did not seem confused. She asked if I had my own car insurance, I told her I did. Two days later, she tells me she’s concerned because, she found out I’m not on their insurance, when I had, according to her, told her I was.   Now, she’s been sending rambling scatterbrained texts for some time. But I assumed that was just a ‘boomer using technology’ thing (sorry if this offends). But after these 4 events that, again, occurred just in the past couple days over a few hours, I’m deeply suspicious there’s something going on. Is this enough to insist on a trip to a neurologist? I’m not sure I trust her to remember to bring it up with family doctor.	0
My grandmother has Alzheimer’s and I live with her and my mother. In the begging I though it would be the sad story we know regarding the disease. She would forget everything and everyone and it would be really painful. But thank god she didn’t forget everybody, but she forgets everything and asks the same thing over and over again and it is driving me crazy! She doesn’t like to do anything! We try so hard to make her do any activity so she at least exercise her brain. Activities like painting, reading, playing games, watching tv but she does it for some minutes and stop and choose to look at the wall and DO NOTHING! And she asks the same thing more than 10 times in less than 3 minutes. I don’t know what to do. I love her so much but every time she starts to ask the same thing repeatedly I get really annoyed and I feel bad for that. I don’t want to be mad at her or be rude to her. I know it’s not her fault she can’t remember things but it is in fact extremely annoying. Do you have any advices on how to not get annoyed by it and what can I do to make her do something, like what activities do you guys recommend?	0
"Today marks one whole year since I quietly moved my mom in with me, a literal blink of an eye decision after her third doctor’s appointment as we were starting to explore her cognitive decline at the end of 2020. An appointment where I had been given the response to a decision that I had been needing to make, but knew that no one but myself would actually be able to make that decision; the response given by her new doctor to me with nothing more than a firm, but sympathetic look in the eye. It was truly unspoken. My life has changed dramatically fast this past year, and I’m honestly still spinning in a daze of surreality and grief. Some things I’d like to share that I was in no way prepared for when starting on the last journey that I ever expected, nor would I have ever wanted to be on:   The way she has become fixated with things like constantly pulling her socks up to her knees or pulling her shirt down over her knees while she’s sitting. Or when she’s not pulling her socks up as high as she can, she’s taking them off and wearing them on her hands like a sock puppet. Or how she constantly has to hold the shirt or jacket she's wearing from the bottom like she's carrying a security blanket when we're out and about.   The way she started sucking on her fingers and how that turned into full on thumb sucking for comfort just in the past couple of months and weeks. Or just how talking to her in general sounds and feels like dealing with a child. Coming from someone who loves and is really good with children, having to treat your mother like a child, and being in a ""child has become the parent"" scenario is brutal beyond belief. I have no one to take care of me the way a mother should anymore, and I supremely envy those who still have perfectly self sufficient and capable parents.   The way I have to take things away from her, like the cap to a drinkable yogurt bottle, so that she doesn’t put things that don't belong in her mouth.   The way she has become so possessive. If I pick up or move anything, even if it’s so simple as taking her clothes out of her dresser to get her dressed for the day, “that’s mine!”   The way I have to plan my entire day around her, and the fact that she now has a strict 8:30 pm bedtime that I enforce religiously just so I can have some time to myself before I need to go to sleep. Or the way I truly feel like there aren’t enough hours in the day for things she needs, I need, or someone else needs. Or the way she showers once a week now, because I do not have the energy to do more than that, and she doesn't want to. I’m lucky if I can shower every other day. Or the way I have had to decline opportunities to do fun things with friends because I have to be mindful of her needs or the fact I don’t have anyone who can watch her for me, and she can't be left alone.    The way I’ve made decisions on her behalf in general, like her bedtime, not being able to drive or work anymore, taking her phone away from her, selling her car, donating things we have no room for that she's had forever but doesn't need, and the way she resented me for every bit of it at the beginning as if I had completely betrayed her.    The way I basically have to carry a diaper bag and a change of clothes for us to go somewhere for the day.   The way I constantly have to repeat myself for something as simple as directing her take off her shoes when we get home, or telling her to put her shoes on, but she’s got one on her foot and her hand in the other. Or how when I’m getting her dressed and say “put your leg in,” I’m constantly having to try to get her to understand that usually the leg I need her to put in, is not the one she has already put in. Or the way when I’m trying to get her to take off her pants to change her, it’s a good two or three or more attempts of her pulling them back up after I’ve pulled them down before I can actually get them off of her. Or how she’ll say “okay” in the most annoyed tone as if she’s already doing what I’m asking her to do, but hasn’t budged an inch.   The way I have had to put my hand in places and clean things I'd rather not.   The way that she will act as if something right in front of her is completely lost and out of sight. “Get in bed, please” or ""put your shoes on"" (that I have set right in front of her) becomes “I don’t know where it is.”   The way she will wander around the room moving things around for no reason, or does things like taking her clothes out of the dresser, or the drawers out of her nightstand, pictures out of frames, or pull the blankets up from the bottom of the bed while she's laying in it, for reasons completely unknown to her.   The way she blames everything she does (that she shouldn't be doing) on the unnamed figures she hallucinates in our home, because “they did it,” or “they told me to,” or the way she blames not having done something that she used to do with ease claiming that “no one ever told me.”   The way she’ll ask me where her parents are, and they’ve been dead for decades, or the way she calls me “mom” as if she genuinely means it.    The way she throws a tantrum and can’t find her words like an exasperated two year old who hasn’t even learned all of their words yet. Or the anguish in her voice when she says things like ""I'd rather die,"" ""I'm going to die,"" etc., when I've asked her to stop doing something or when she is just genuinely upset for reasons unknown to both of us.   The way I read emails from daycare as if I were reading a progress report about a child. “She has a new friend named Sharon, who she is very compatible with.” Or, ""we need more diapers for her locker.""   The way that I have had to keep things in the kitchen out of reach to avoid things like cookies having bites taken out of them and being put back into the container, or a whole bunch of bananas bought the night before meant to last the week, demolished and consumed (or in that one case, half under her bed and the other half on top of the toilet tank) within 30 minutes like she’s never seen them before.   The way I had to childproof my deadbolt locks and door knobs to keep her inside and safe.   The way I got so emotional on the phone with the phone company representative and afterwards, over canceling her cell phone plan and losing the number she's had for 20 years because there's no point in keeping it if she doesn't know how to use her phone anymore, and she gets more spam calls and texts than anything else.   The way I thought friends of hers we would be able to count on, who said they would be around for her or at least call to check on and keep in touch with her, very quickly faded into oblivion as if they never existed and without a word, but occasionally will send the thoughts and well wishes that I have no use for. The unofficial goodbyes that she never got to have and were taken away from her while she still had the chance to have somewhat clear and concise conversations. She was and is so lonely. I hear ""no one likes me,"" ""no one wants me,"" ""I have no one,"" more often than I want to.   The way I miss my mommy, who is right in front of me nearly 24/7, but is a completely different person. The one person who I never wanted to imagine life without, and thought I'd have around as we both got older, but who I now pray for relief for and from, so that we are both at peace in different ways.   The way hugs became an act that make me cry instantly, because they’re not hugs from who I want them to be from. They’re lifeless, like I can truly feel the energy and bond we shared for so long between us is gone.   The way she tells me she likes me instead of she loves me. I was prepared for her to eventually forget me, but I was not prepared for it to happen as fast as it did, within 6 months of her moving in. Or the way she doesn’t associate me as being the little girl in our old family photos, that little girl is *her* shady-pines-ma. Or especially the way she knows who my cousin and her young children are, but not her own child. I know I was loved so much, I know how much the real her loves me, but it doesn't hurt any less.   The way I became someone who takes hours or days to respond to messages like it truly is the bare minimum I actually can do.   The way I came to understand the type of depression where you just don’t want to get out of bed for the day, where things that used to bring joy brought stress and felt like a chore, like decorating for holidays and seasons. Last year was the first year that I didn’t decorate for anything, and it made me so sad, but I couldn't do it. Or how I have no desire to do anything related to my less than two year old small business that I was so proud of and put so much work into, launching at the start of the pandemic no less. Or the way things that are actually chores that I had no trouble with maintaining a fairly regular schedule for became unbearably overwhelming; like dishes and laundry or mopping the kitchen floor.   The way that I have felt the anger and grief that quickly started to fill my mind, body, heart and soul faster than I could release it; like being trapped in falling sand in an hourglass, become something that makes me fear for my own physical health. Or the way that I have let words spit off of my tongue like hot venom with the intention to maim because I can’t hold them in, knowing full well it’s her Alzheimer’s I truly hate with a passion, not her, and the guilt I’ll forever carry that comes afterwards for not holding them in.   The way I have started to dread people asking me how I’m doing because I usually have nothing good, positive, or worthwhile to share. It’s always just a big pile of sadness. Or the way some people will ask how she’s doing, and not ask how I’m doing. It’s very contradictory, and I hate it.   The way I internally reject compliments or words of encouragement for taking care of her as if I really had a choice. I know I had a choice, but I also know that I don’t think I could have lived with myself if I chose to abandon her. And believe me, I contemplated it in the beginning. I feel like an indentured servant, and according to filial law, I kind of am.   The way that I feel like I haven't and will not have done my best at making the last memories my mom could retain, good ones, after everything she has ever done for me.   I wasn’t prepared for the long goodbye and I wasn't prepared for the different goodbyes to happen so soon.   If you read all of this, thanks. If you’re going through this or have gone through this, my heart goes out to you. If you’ve never gone through this, I truly, from the bottom of my heart hope you never have to. This is the cruelest existence I never thought I’d be living in, and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone."	0
"Apologies if this ends up being a huge wall of text, but I've recently been facing the reality that something serious is going on with my mom.. and I just need to vent and get this off my chest. She's 70 years old and in decent health and I can't say for certain what exactly is wrong with her, but I'm fearing the worst.  I was at dinner with my parents the other night, and she mentioned that she was having trouble sleeping because there's man in the next door apartment that's been yelling and screaming. My mom has always been sensitive/annoyed to sound disturbances (some very valid, others perhaps a bit exaggerated) - so initially nothing seemed too out of the norm. But then my dad said he wasn't hearing these things (to which my mom offhandedly commented that my dad was just ""deaf""). He said they used a phone to try and record the sound - I listened to the recording and couldn't hear anything. She then went on to talk about how it was actually a man that was arguing with/abusing a woman. Apparently, she went down to the front desk and spoke with the super to complain, and they told her that he lived alone. She's now saying that the man is ""making up a woman's voice"" because he's crazy. When I ask her why we can't hear anything in the phone recording, she says ""well the sound isn't coming through the walls"" - and then when we counter with ""well if the sound isn't coming through the walls, how can you hear it?"".. she just, sort of avoids the question? Just repeats that ""this guy is totally psycho."" It's like logic isn't working at all on her. I spoke with my dad the next day to honestly ask what he thinks (he is a very logical, smart guy with a good head on his shoulders), and he confirmed she is experiencing auditory hallucinations.  My dad also told me she has started double locking the door to the apartment because she's afraid he might break in. It's horrible to know she actually is in fear.  She completely believes these hallucinations are real (which I understand), and at even the slight suggestion they might not be, she completely shuts us down. I asked her ""when was the last time you spoke with a therapist?"" (she has a history of depression) and she said ""don't even go there"" - as she knew what I was implying.  Before continuing, I do want to say we have reached out to her doctor. The doctor is planning to give her a call which my mom surprisingly seems receptive to. I suppose what happens after that conversation remains to be seen.  What concerns me beyond this is other little cognitive/personality changes I've noticed creeping up the past few years. My dad also mentioned a few things he's been noticing as well.  The big thing I've noticed, is having a conversation with her is sometimes a bit odd and difficult. She changes the subject frequently, interrupts us in the middle of talking (to yet again change the subject) - and sometimes we have to ask her a question multiple times before she answers (she'll respond to the question by sort of repeating things she recently said, but EVENTUALLY will answer). For example - my dad said he asked her when her doctor's appointment was. He had to repeat himself a few times because initially she wasn't giving him a direct response. But after a few times of my dad asking very directly, she was able to tell him. She didn't *forget* the date, but it's as though we had to get her to *really* focus on what we were asking, as though she wasn't paying attention. It's almost as though she just can't hold her focus on a single train of thought for long. Or she's talking and not really paying attention to us sometimes. It's almost like you can sense some sort of agitation and restlessness from her. She constantly has to get up to do things like she can't sit still. She's never been a particularly patient person, and has always been a big talker, but this lack of ability to focus during conversations is definitely out of the norm.  She's always been a light sleeper but my dad says it seems like she's waking up a lot during the night. He says when he gets up to use the bathroom he'll see her glued to her phone. She recently sent me a text at 3am to confirm dinner plans.  She seems to have lost a bit of her social filter. Like she doesn't grasp certain social tact and norms. My mom has always been eccentric, a big personality, chatty brooklyn gal that people sometimes find abrasive - but my dad said when they go on her walks she goes up to strangers multiple times to make small talk. She's always very nice (she's never rude or weird), but it's odd and not really in line with NYC social etiquette. We went out to dinner once and she decided to strike up a conversation with the people at the table next to us. These are things she used to not do because she understood that isn't really appropriate.  My dad said she's becoming very aggressive in her driving, to the point he refuses to ride as a passenger with her anymore. Again, she's a brooklyn gal and has always been one to honk, sometimes flip the bird or mutter profanities. But my dad said recently a guy cut her off, and she followed him for a bit just to pull up next to him so she could roll down the window and scream at him. That's very extreme for her.  My dad says that when they watch TV together she's often on her phone and will ask him to explain what's going on in the plot. I don't think it's because she can't *comprehend* what's happening, but she's on her phone because she just cannot concentrate for long periods of time, so she misses what's happening in the TV show.  Nothing really stands out in terms of dramatic memory loss, but she does like to have the same topics of conversation when I see her (which is about every 2 weeks), and will repeat things she's told me before. Not within the same evening, but she'll say things like ""You know your uncle is coming for passover"" (and she's told me this the last few times I saw her). Maybe she feels like she needs to remind me. Or she'll tell me stories she's told me before, show me things I've already seen. And I can't tell if it's because she's *actually* forgotten she's done these things, or if it's just things she likes talking about and is excited when she shares them with me. She's been really fixated on her father's death (he passed away decades ago) and the circumstances surrounding it (he didn't want to see her as he was dying) and it's almost like she's processing this grief all over again. I got a random text from her out of the blue that said ""your grandfather took his own life because he couldn't stand the pain."" (Which she has told me multiple times).  But she's still capable and independent. She recently read a book I got her. She uses photoshop on her computer. She drives to her studio each day to make art. She still posts on social media, uses her e-mail, her phone and can have conversations about complex topics (even if she can't stay on the subject for long). She still has passion and hobbies and things she enjoys doing. She can whip up a good cheese plate. She seems in good spirits when I see her, although sometimes she can get easily agitated.  All of these little things have had me suspicious and unsure for awhile (like, is she just getting old?), but the auditory hallucinations feel like the final nail in the coffin. Her mother had vascular dementia and I've read conflicting information if there's a genetic link. One of my biggest fears has been my mom getting alzheimer's or dementia, and I'm in shock that it actually might be happening.  I'm worried I just won't be able to keep it together around her. That eventually I might break down in front of her and upset her. The idea of having to stay strong for someone who forgets who you are seems impossible. I'm afraid one day maybe she'll get so angry she'll say horrible things to me. I worry that she might eventually understand what's happening to her and become terrified. I worry maybe she'll refuse to accept what's happening, will refuse to accept my help and refuse to accept the care she needs.  I know I'm probably getting ahead of myself and need to wait on what the doctor says, but I can't help feeling like I need to start preparing myself emotionally. Sorry - this definitely turned out to be a bit of a novel."	0
How important is diet in mid-stage dementia/Alzheimers?  My uncle, 78, is firmly in the mid-stage of dementia/Alzheimers. My mom, 75, is his primary caretaker. Her biggest concern: that he’s not eating properly. Though he gets (and eats) meals on wheels usually twice a day, he also buys packages of cookies and chocolate. He’ll eat a whole package in a day or two.  I understand how important a good diet is when you’re young and healthy, but does eating this much sugar at this stage/condition in life have a huge negative effect?	0
Does anyone have a getting lost plan? It happened to a loved one recently and never want to experience that again.  So far considering a laniard badge and an airtag tracker.	0
My wife has been diagnosed with early onset (PCA) and can no longer drive. Her symptoms are still fairly mild, I think, but the problem is she’s stuck at home while I work and basically sits on the couch listening to NPR and dwells on not being able to do anything. She does laundry and dishes but has nothing to stimulate her mind once those are done. She’s never been an artist so she doesn’t want to draw or anything like that. Does anyone have any suggestions for us that may be helpful?  Update: I really appreciate all the responses. We will probably explore volunteering at the senior center or animal shelter. I also plan to get her an Apple Watch so she can walk around the neighborhood and I can see where she is.	0
Hi all,  Not sure if can I post it here, if not please delete. I found this really amazing place that helped my dad a lot (still helping!) and It wasn't easy to find. You can find so many assisted living around the area but he really loves this place. If you are interested, you can check their page: [https://www.theashford.com/our-communities/the-ashford-of-mt-washington](https://www.theashford.com/our-communities/the-ashford-of-mt-washington)	0

"I'm just wondering (as the title suggests) how everyone else deals with their anger over this illness and the ongoing process of grieving a loved one who is still alive?  My mum's in a care home now and doesn't recognise any of her loved ones, even just as people she knows. She's not herself anymore. She's not my mum anymore.   Even though I don't have the stress and responsibility of caring for her anymore, I'm finding that my mental health is quite probably the lowest it's ever been. Visiting her is taking a toll on me. I used to try weekly but after a succession of bad visits, I don't think I can keep that up any longer so I'm going to aim for visiting every 2 weeks. I feel awful about that, even though I know I shouldn't because it's important to keep myself mentally healthy, I can't help but feel guilty.   Anyway, I've been feeling so much anger building up inside me, just at the unfairness of the whole damn thing (I know, I know, the world's not a fair place). My mum's so young, she's only 64, and I feel like I've missed out on getting to know her as an adult. She was diagnosed when I was in my early twenties and I feel like I've missed out on that crucial part of a parent/child relationship where you start getting to know them as an equal, as a fellow adult, rather than just ""mum"" or ""dad"".  I'm so, so angry and sad all the time, and I have no idea how to get on with normal, every day life whilst feeling like this. How does everyone else manage these feelings?"	0
i’ve had a neighbor who lives in my building who has never been friendly, when i first introduced myself she purposefully ignored me. i continue to say hi and leave it at that when i see her, but she never says anything. the other day my partner and i discovered she has alzheimer’s or dementia, after an episode where we ended up having to contact our old neighbor, who is her daughter. obviously i don’t want to see this lady get hurt, or put herself in a dangerous situation, so if i notice anything i will continue to contact her daughter. however i’m curious if i just shouldn’t continue to say hello to her? i don’t want to scare her or confuse her further, but prior to this incident i just assumed she was rude or didn’t like me and i was just trying to be kind and approachable.	0
Dad has been terrible with sleeping for the last year, my mom and sister are at their wits end because no one is sleeping anymore.  He is so restless and wants to go to the bathroom all night (he also wears a diaper constantly). He was diagnosed 6 years ago in his late 60s.  My sister was wondering if CBD oil made for sleep assistance would help.  Anyone try this?  We are trying to get him into hospice, but he is getting the run around from the VA.  They have tried melatonin gummies.  Any advice would be great!	0
I have APOE2/4 genotype (https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Gs270) and I'm having trouble finding information on the risk of this genotype because APOE2 is rare and known to be very protective, but APOE4 is well known to increase risk of Alzheimer's. So what is the relative risk of the 2/4 genotype? Does one or the other dominate in this scenario? Is it unknown? I'd love to hear any research anyone has to share.  I know APOE genotype is just one risk factor. I am fit, healthy, don't drink or smoke, eat a relatively low sugar/low carb diet and get a lot of exercise. I'm not sure if any of my family would have gotten Alzheimer's because most of them died earlier in life from other factors (smoking, dangerous life, whatever). This is more of a question out of curiosity.	0
Has anyone had the experience of having a parent with Dementia/Alzheimer's become completely bedridden where they can no longer move their limbs? My mother started showing signs of dementia way back in 2006, and by late 2016 she was obviously at stage 7 (stage 6 about 3 years earlier). By 2018, I moved back home and quit my job, and lived on my savings and traded stocks on the side to care for her. Trying to preserve her estate while I'm the sole heir made more sense financially while I cared for her compared to paying outright for a memory are facility. Medicare and plan D supplemental insurance already covered the in home visits and care from nurses and her doctor. At this point she was wandering around the house in circles mumbling and completely oblivious to her own surrounding not even realizing she was in her own house.  At the end of that year she forgot who I was being her only son (44 years old at that point). Sometimes asking where I was when I was still at a baby age. She also asked for her own mom (my grandma) who passed away 40 years earlier. The following year was the worst, where she would have what seemed like schizophrenic episodes where she would get violently angry and scream at us, a housekeeper we had, and curse at furniture, throw stuff across the room or turn a room into a complete mess with old mail, house decor, magazines, etc., sometimes after 2-4am when everyone was long asleep.  This carried on for about 18 months until the end of October 2020 when she suddenly lost her balance and could no longer walk. She would swing around the bed and changing her diaper was painstakingly hard. After the summer of last year her limbs became almost completely paralyzed and her body has been mostly motionless ever since. Diaper changes obviously became much easier at that point. We got a hospital bed after bed sores became an issue, and they did heal with help from the nurse. She mostly mumbles and calls out for my dad and ginger ale (her favorite drink). She is fed with sippy cups, baby food squeeze packs, and Ensure blended with protein powder and meds. She is very frail at this point and bedridden for 15 months now at age 87. She gets swelling in her arms and her face is developing nasty sores.  We never thought she would make it to 2022 including her own doctor, yet here we are (she was put on hospice in early 2020 and recently taken off for outliving the time limit). Has anyone else dealt with a case this extreme? I can't imagine how much longer she can live like this, it's absolutely awful and I wish this on no one, but here I am watching my mom rot away ever so slowly. I did some online research and it seems 2 1/2 years is longest it goes on like this but that usually includes stage 7 dementia which for her started well over 5 years ago. The doctor and nurse both told me in early November last year she only has about 2-3 months to live. Now they won't even say. Can anyone else out there relate to this? My mom told me decades ago she never wanted to live like this, but now it's not her choice anymore.	0
My grandmother is 93 and was diagnosed many years ago. She's the strongest and kindest woman I ever knew, she was kicked from her home country in the 1948 war in Palestine and thrown into a refugee camp where her only option to survive as a woman was to marry my late grandfather who was an absolute dictator. She lovingly raised 11 bright children despite enduring so much horrible bullshit from my late grandfather. She's my idol and a symbol of strength and hope.   It's been well over 10 years since she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, and has been suffering from late stage symptoms for a few years now. Nowadays she sleeps once every three days and medications only make it worse and cause more problems and she can't communicate her pains. When I think about it my heart breaks, it must be a pain worse than death to be in that state, and she fell and broke her hip a few months ago.  Despite her age and her condition, she's blessed with a curse which is good health, all her tests are good and she has no problems with her heart, liver, kidneys etc. The emotions I feel are extremely complex, I feel really guilty, even though I'm not her caregiver and now I barely see her because I study abroad, it has been a very long journey and I secretly wish she would just pass and be relieved, she endured so much bullshit while sane and now this! I don't know what to think or do anymore and I just want it to end. Is there something wrong with me?	0
My sister-in-law has early onset Alzheimer's. It runs in my wife's family, but only affects the women. Her grandmother, mother, and oldest sister died of the the disease and her next older sister is pretty far along. She is at the stage where she doesn't recognize her own home or her son but can still form thoughts about those things and wonder where they are.  She's staying with us for a week while her son is away for work. They live pretty far out in rural Canada and it's expensive for her son to hire in help while he's away (he's a geologist and frequently travels for  surveying) so we figured we'd have her with us while he does a job here in the States. (BTW, getting folks into a govt-subsidized facility in Canada involves years-long waiting lists) Plus, she's been having him call my wife frequently over the last months and saying how she wants to come visit.  My wife is doing her best to keep her engaged and keep her from becoming anxious but it is getting stressful. What is the best way to interact with someone who is repeatedly asking about the same things over and over? (who brought me here? how am I getting home? Is someone stealing my house? Can I drive home?)  Any help would be appreciated.  Edit: Thank you to those who are trying to help. It's been a stressful day. Probably for her as well because she's not in familiar surroundings. Her son has, unfortunately, had to cut his work trip short so that he can get her back home. We would take her but the documentation explaining her condition only references him so we can't get her across the border to get her back home.  We still have another two days with her so I will keep everyone's tips in mind. Thank you to all of you!     Second edit: Well, she's with us for the full week now. The good thing is that, thanks to all of you, we've learned how to communicate to her in a way that keeps her from getting too anxious. We agree with her for a lot of stuff but redirect when it comes to her car, going home, or leaving. It has reduced the tension in the house but I can see where it would get extremely tiring to have to do long-term. Her son is due to return on Friday but have to wonder if that will actually happen as we are due for another winter storm Thursday that will definitely affect air travel.     Again, thanks to everyone for their tips and stories. It has helped more than you know!	0
"I take care of an alzheimer patient in her home. I work long LONG shifts(12-20hrs) of no sleep (cant trust her). Shes not a good person and was abusive to everyone her whole life. I only got hired on to help take care of her 3 years ago.   Anyway, im going to be vague (in case anyone i know is reading)   Its very normal for her to be combative,  physically and verbally. Sometimes everyday a week, sometimes once a week. Usually its for something silly like changing clothes or taking meds, in which we can just say ""okay!"" And try again in a few minutes/hours.   Last night there was a fire alarm in the building. We're 6 stories up. The fire alarm was LOUD and when it goes off, 3 alarms are sounding off in each apartment while flashing lights, and about 10 in the hallways of each floor. It was late so i knew it wasnt just ""testing the alarms"".   Things got CHAOTIC. she was so weak she couldnt walk with her walker, i had to run to get the wheelchair, even the 2.5 seconds i ran to get it, she fell against the wall. She was clawing me, kicking me, cussing me out, hitting me, refusing to get in the wheelchair yet she could hardly stand and definitely couldnt walk. I had to think fast and grab her a coat as its about 0° out(again, gone for mere seconds and she was getting up trying to run away), when i went to open the door she kicked it shut and held her feet against the door so i couldnt open it. The elevators were obviously shut down, so we had to go to the stairwell, the whole time she is putting all her might shoving her feet against the floor so i could barely push the wheelchair, all the while trying to claw my arms. She wasnt acting like an ""out of her mind batshit crazy person just rambling nonsense"" but just straight up fighting against me while telling me to ""get the fuck away, fuck off!"".  When we get to the stairwell, she is trying to escape (but again, was too weak to walk) so i had to hold her as firmly yet gently as i could to stay seated in the wheelchair, otherwise all it would take is her to fall foward and tumble down the stairs.   The stairwell smelled like burning so i definitely knew then it wasnt a drill.   It took around FIVE MINUTES to get her out of her apartment. From where she was sitting to the door was about 15 feet, and it took 5 minutes!!! All the while getting beat up on. This isnt inckuding the time it took to go down the hallway to the stairwell.   Luckily the fire was contained but my whole body was shaking out of stress and out of anger. If the building had actually been in more serious danger of a bigger fire, i am 100% confident we would have DIED because of her. I have a small child who needs his mom,  i dont deserve this shit. Even getting her from the stairway back to her apartment once it was deemed safe and the alarm was off (20 mins later of combating me in the stairwell) it took forever and more abuse getting her back and into bed. She was yelling obscenities at me telling me to ""get the fuck away"" while kicking me and dragging her feet.    All we did was evacuate to the stairwell and stayed on the flat part that was connected to our floor. In NO WAY would i have been able to get her down the 6 flights of stairs had it been necessary for survival, as i am petite and she is so combative and too weak to walk.   Next time, i will not die for you. Im sorry i wont."	0
My dad now needs round the clock care and has progressed drastically since having kidney issues. He’s running out of money and applying for Medicaid has been a bit of a nightmare because I didn’t control his finances until a bit after he was diagnosed. The things he was doing financially before that has been a nightmare to figure out. On top of dealing with that, I’m so stressed about actually finding a nursing home and putting him in there. He was in a rehab not long ago and it was absolutely awful. He lost over 20 pounds in three weeks and was getting sores from them not changing him properly. I’m so worried I’m going to choose a nursing home like this again. I live on the other side of the country and am his only family willing to look after him so I wouldn’t be able to go there all that often.  How do I deal with this? Is there any way to ensure I’m making the best decision?	0
Several scientific data show that psychedelics help increase cognitive performance. Two recent reviews strongly suggest that psychedelics would benefit Alzheimer's patients. In summary, microdosing would increase synaptic plasticity, generate new neurons and decrease the amount of beta-amyloid after microdosing. These structural changes would help to alleviate the deficiencies that this disease produces. The microdoses for psilocybin would be 15mg per 70kg. This would be about 1g of psychedelic mushroom, if 1% of its weight is the psilocybin compound. I hope it helps those who wish to have an alternative option to the conventional one. The links to the amaba reviews are here:  https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00034/full  https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34734390/	0
Hey guys I think I'm gonna make a video about my dad who has early onset and just wanted some inspiration on some good questions to ask him so I can treasure his responses and have something to remember him by before its too late for him to remember any stories or be true to the answers he would typically give! So what would you ask your loved one?	0
For background, I just moved to a new city for college. I have babysitting experience and was looking for something along those lines. I found this woman who was desperate for any type of help with her husband. At first the Alzheimer’s didn’t seem like a big deal to me, he was so sweet and had the basic needs of any old man. I thought things were getting better when I reintroduced music to his life, by trying to re-teach him ukulele, and seeing his world light up when I found songs he used to love that’d we’d sing together. He even remembered my name for the first time recently. Then the other week his wife told me that he had an “episode” and is now on another medication. And now, I just got a message from her saying he’s very sick… and not the kind that’s contagious. She would always tell me that he doesn’t have much longer and now I’m afraid it’s coming true. I just wish there was something I could do to help both of them.	0
 My grandfather in his 70s is now facing the problem of properly using a washroom its not that he cant use his reflexes its just that he does NOT want to enter toilet he wants to do wherever he wants . Its has become harder to force him and we dont hit him we try not even raise our voice ofc have a force with hand but to some extent we try our best to talk to him sweetly but we dont have our best days either we have life of our own too . He used to sit on toilet at first but these few months we are trying to make him atleast go to the washroom and pee while squatting (that's how he does no matter what) on floor and he does but now he's doesn't want to go in there at all we have to change his clothes two times a day lets not even talk about when he has to poop. There's is sudden rapid decline in his intrest to go to bathroom at all and we are not prepared for it at all he wants to do whatever he wants and he gets annoyed when we tell him what to do in best case ,in worse case he will hit. We cant use diapers too because he has a habit of taking off his trousers first ,we did try and as expected he it off.Anyone knows how to deal with this situation? any smaller suggestion helps alot . Also mind that this whole thing starts happening in few months	0
my grandmother has it, and every time my mother forgets something I get worried out of my mind she is developing it. Hell, sometimes when I forget something myself I get scared and I'm young. Does this happen to others a lot?	0
I have been wondering if my mother is developing Alzheimer's, the problem is that some of the symptoms are part of how she's always operated so I can't really tell the difference. Also, her increasingly severe memory loss has strongly contributed to behavior that fit symptoms.  One thing that has stood out to me recently is repetitive questions. Now the difference to what I've read as the typical presentation of this symptom, being repetitive in the moment, is that her repetition is with every new interaction. Almost like a script of questions she asks every time we speak, but she doesn't seem to realize or remember that her questions have been repeating or that she has gotten those answers. Historically my mother has a tendency to not pay strong attention to conversations and so often forget what people say (unless it's gossip), this is why it's hard to tell for me if this is a progression of a normal habit of hers or a symptom of something else. I just wondered if anyone can share if this type of repetition fits with the symptom or an expanded definition of it?	0
Hi guys, this is a long read so please bear with me.   Tl;Dr: my moms showing progressive signs of memory loss and I’m looking for ways to help her.   So for quite a while (5-ish years) I’ve (F28) noticed my moms (46 at the time) memory getting weak. It started innocently. She’d forget something I told her a week or two ago. Or forget something from her docs appointment. I’d point this out to her and she brush it off with a joke. If I persisted she’d get defensive and say it’s no big deal. I didn’t live with her at the time so I figured that we weren’t talking every day so it’s normal for her to not remember everything in my life.  She also has hearing loss, requiring hearing aids, so I chalked it up to her not hearing properly.   But then my father (54) who lives with her started noticing it. And became not just things we’d say but things through text. Arguments would ensue, her insisting we didn’t tell her only for us to pull up the text she acknowledged. And then she’d get defensive. But it was always non-important things. Like telling her when I’d becoming for a visit and such.   It’s slowly been getting worse, and now I’m noticing that she’s forgetting more recent things (I also live at home now, and she’s now 51) For instance yesterday she was trying to tell me something she saw on the news 1hr earlier and forgot most of the story. She now acknowledges that she does have a memory problem, but doesn’t know what to do. She doesn’t feel that her doctor takes this stuff seriously, and there are some days where her memory is great.   There appears to be no long term memory loss. It’s just short term memory or creating new memories. She has recently started a new job in an office where she has a lot to learn, so I’m not sure if that’s affecting her.   She’s constantly doing things to “exercise” her brain, like crosswords, wheel of fortune and jeopardy.   Is there anything I can do for her to stop this getting worse, other than trying to convince her to talk to a doctor? She’s open to supplements (like neuriva) but I’m not sure if that placebo or if it does help. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, with my line of work (health care) I’ve seen the bitter end of Alzheimer’s and dementia and is like to avoid or delay this as much as possible.	0
This is what evil looks like.   Last summer, with pressure from the Alzheimer's Association and against the recommendation of their advisory committee, the FDA approved Biogen's new Alzheimer's drug, Aduhelm. Besides not being effective (the drug has failed to significantly reduce AD symptoms in clinical trials), it is also accompanied by some very unpleasant side effects, and a price tag around $28,000/year.   This has prompted a tremendous backlash from the scientific community, and earlier this month, CMS decided that it would not cover the cost of Aduhelm unless the patient is part of an ongoing clinical trial to test the drug.   Well, Biogen (who is one of the Alzheimer's Association's biggest donors) stands to lose a LOT of profit on this decision, and the Alzheimer's Association is now pushing back against CMS. They claim that CMS's decision discriminates against all people with Alzheimer's disease, and especially against women, Black, and Hispanic people who are disproportionately affected by AD.   I disagree. I think pushing a wildly expensive, ineffective drug on a vulnerable population that is desperate for ANYTHING that can help them is nothing short of predatory. Claiming that this CMS decision is discriminatory is absolutely shameful.

Hi all.  I’m looking for a good neurologist / memory specialist / dementia specialist for my mom (76) in the Sarasota, FL area.  All my siblings and I live in the Midwest, so we need a doctor who could evaluate my mom and also one that is willing to do remote appointments so that we can “Zoom” into any appointments.  My mom is just having minor memory issues, but we have a history of Alzheimer’s in our family so we would like to get a baseline eval of where she is at.  Thanks for any recommendations!	0
My father has developed a behavior that is equal parts amusing, baffling, and frustrating.  It is the clothes he decides to wear.  Our whole life, our family has always gifted him clothes that will work together because fashion has never been his strong suit.  However, as his symptoms get worse, he doesn't wear things that fit or are even his.  He's taken to wearing my mom's clothes quite regularly.  Not anything obviously feminine (he's not living out his dream of cross dressing) but rather her jeans.  They're 4 inches too short and her shirts are way too tight, but he wears them as well.  The family finds this part amusing.  The other day he put on his grand daughter's yoga pants that were left at his house.  She's 11 years old.  I'd call this part baffling and is an image no one wants in their head.  Then recently he found a bag of clothes left in the woods by, presumably, a homeless person.  He acted as if he found treasure.  He washed and cleaned these clothes (they were way way too big) then tied them on with rope and shoe string so they'd stay up and wouldn't fall off.  He only wore these for a few days, until we disappeared them.  They were just too out there for anyone encountering to treat him with dignity and we felt the need to protect his dignity.  On Wednesday, we had a speaker at our church's men's group.  The speaker had a hat that he put on a table.  My father picked up the hat and wore it home.  Fortunately my father left his coat at church so he and the speaker were able to make a swap (coat for hat) and my dad felt like he got a great deal out of the event.  Anyway, this is just so strange that I can't wrap my brain around it.  I try to hard to laugh and have fun with the things that are harmless, but as this behavior amplifies it is just sadder and sadder.  Anyone else's loved one have a favorite outfit that they found in the woods?	0
My mom (72/F, divorced) is approaching the stage at which we’ll need to consider memory care within the next few years. And while I’m aware of spending down for Medicaid, I have no idea how this would be possible given that her federal retirement income is nearly $6,000/month (increasing 2-5% every year for cost of living) and she has nearly $400k in assets (two homes and many acres of land) that she planned for me to inherit after her death (“bye, bye” to that). That said, because she’s coasted on her high retirement income, she has nothing in savings, and the homes/land aren’t exactly liquid.  Given these considerations, would we be better off getting her into private memory care and using whatever money we get from selling her homes/property to cover any costs over $6k/month? Or should we just try to somehow spend down so she can qualify for Medicaid?  My husband and I do pretty well combined, but between my $100k student debt and nonprofit salary, we don’t make enough to meaningfully supplement her care without eventually going bankrupt.	0
The burn out has become greater. Grandma's volity was gotten worse.   Her mood swings have gotten worse, a few months ago we had to wean her off of trazodone which she had been one for 4 decades. Bc she was taking PM pills in the AM then sleeping all day, in the dark house so her body clock was completely warped. She picks out the Low dose Effexor from her case, bc thats not the right pill, and she thinks if she doesn't take it then she will met grandpa at the pearly gates faster.   My mom stopped by to get her trash, she was still in the clothes she had on 4 days before hadn't bathed since. Ran out of pajamas and didn't bother to do her laundry which was piled in front of the washer. So she had been sleeping in those clothes too. Her excuse was well I wasn't going anywhere so I didn't see the point. *sigh* but you literally left 4 times to get something to eat.   She refuses to allow us to have a home aid come in and do the cleaning she refuses to do. She gets super agitated if anyone remotely tries to clean.. Im a single parent working 2 jobs, my mom has 2 jobs. One uncle is pretty hands off, the other does what he can as the golden child. So the burnout is definitely affecting us mentally bc its like a 3rd job.   We are inquiring to see if med management is possible for someone that's is living in the independent cottages on the nursing home property. Unfortunately she isn't to the level of needing the dicated dementia wing, and she would put up one hell of a fight if we got her a placement into the assisted living wing. Even though she would have weekly house keeping and a kitchenette.   I'm about to tell my mom book her for the next available appt with her neurologist, and we are having a come to Jesus meeting. Bc something isn't working.	0
I’m 36 and my dad is 77, he just started having memory issues.  His life partner broke up with him and this is the first time he has lived alone.  He has never been alone, he has always had someone to take care of him from his mother, to my mother, to me, to girlfriend to girlfriend to his ex.  He still drives, he knows how to do basic living like showering and dressing himself but he struggles with cooking. He set the fire alarm off 3 times in his apartment so he isn’t allowed to use the stove anymore. He does not get technology or new things, he literally leaves his TV on because he is afraid he won’t be able to turn it back on. I bought him a tablet and he cannot figure it out. I have to fix his phone constantly. I’m almost certain he may have a learning disability too with the way he struggles with learning new things but I’m not sure. He also went way too long without being able to hear properly, he has hearing aids now but I swear it’s like he still doesn’t pay attention.  I get calls from people in town periodically stating that they saw my dad and he looked confused. I check on him and he denies this.  I feel awful because I know he is too independent to want to accept a higher level of care and he wants to continue living his life like there are no issues such as going to Florida alone. He used to always go with his partner who would do the driving and I just am not comfortable having him go alone. He just recently had me take over his finances because of his memory issues. He said he just forgets names and sometimes when things are happening. Like he misses doctors appointments so I have to have them tell me when it is. He still goes to them alone but I’m afraid he isn’t retaining what they are saying due to hearing and memory issues.  I’m feeling stressed and worried all the time. I’m in the prime of my career and I cannot afford to not work and stay with him and I also don’t want to make him feel like I’m taking away his independence   Today when I told him I wasn’t comfortable with him going to Florida alone he got very upset and said he will do what he wants.  I have no siblings to help me and I hate to burden my husband.  I feel selfish and guilty all the time  I’m hoping someone else understands this and maybe we can lean on each other?	0
How on earth do people pay for this?  My mom has Alzheimers and she has 2 pensions and SS and still can't afford it.  Me and my sister aren't really in a position to help her either.  We both have kids and and households of our own.  This is so stressful!	0
My dad will leave an empty pan burning on the stove top and walk away from it.  Lately it's been happening almost every day. Sometimes several times a day. We won't know until the smoke alarm goes off.  I already put child safety caps over three of the four stove top knobs. Just to prevent him from bumping into them and turning the gas on that way. Which was a problem. But we couldn't stop him from being able to cook for himself completely because he would throw a fit whenever we try to control him like that.  So how can we let him use the stove without killing us?	0
Hi guys,  I was wondering what medication or supplements someone you know with Alzheimers is taking, and have there been any noticeable improvements? I was looking at spermidine as a supplement to take for my father who's been diagnosed, but I'm wondering if anyone has used anything different that's made them better?   Thanks in advance	0
Hello hello,  I am 29 from NYC. Writing at an ungodly hour as I cannot sleep, and thought this would be a good opportunity for my first Reddit post.   My mom was recently diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's at 60. Needless to say, it was one of the saddest doctor's appointments I had ever been to - I was gutted.   To make matters worse, two years ago I had done the 23andMe Health+, unwittingly opening pandora's box of genetic predispositions. Turns out I have 1 variant of the APOE4 Gene.   My questions are below:  How did you cope with a parent's diagnosis at a young age?  How seriously do I need to take this APOE4 carrier status?  &#x200B;  <3	0
I've made a post already on another sub going into detail. I'm just wondering how young you can get alzheiners, dementia or any other memory problems. Any advice is appreciated, thank you.	0
The father of a really good friend of mine [23F] has Alzheimers, I don’t have any experience of family members with it or having it myself but I’d like to get her something that represents her father while he is still functioning well. It’s been really hard on her and I want to get something for her that might help. I’m sorry if this isn’t the place for this, please remove the post if it is disrespectful. Thank you in advance.	0
I’m 20 and my mom (55) was diagnosed almost a year ago, but she’s been dealing with symptoms for 4 years now. I’ve become a mom to my mom, she comes to me for all her needs and wants or for a chat. I want to move out and have my own life though, I’m only 20. But I’m staying at home because I feel guilty, and I worry I would feel worse if I move.. what should I do?	0
If anyone is interested in potentially exciting new discoveries re AZ symptom mitigation please read on: I lost my mom to AZ a few years back and in the process I turned the internet upside down looking for solutions. It is too late for my mom but a lot of exciting stuff is going on right now focused on probiotics and the microbiome in Europe and Asia. We can see lots of converging evidence correlating consumption of B. Breve 03 or A1 with decrease in Mild Cognitive Disorder and mitigation of AZ symptoms. I am presently getting it sent from the UK by a friend, and the only thing I can say is that it definitely increases my energy and creativity.  Why is nobody selling this in the US? Oh, of course, it would drive the manufacturers of those scammy AZ pharmaceuticals out of business. You know, the ones that shift the MMSE by 2 to 3 points out of 30.  Anyway, these are the most relevant studies including wide ranging systematic reviews. They do not yet provide 100% proof of effectiveness but probiotics have very few serious side effects so what do we lose?  1.

"How do you all deal with the mood swings and the guilt? I have days where I feel nothing at all, days where I almost forget the horror of this disease and feel normal, and days where I'm wracked with guilt about whether I could have done/be doing more, guilt from just wishing it was over? It feels like I can't talk to anyone about it, mom is dealing with it from a spouses pov, my brother chooses to just not think about it, my sister gets a ""pass"" for some reason. I'm always the one my mom calls, and I have my own family to deal with. What do you do to get through the days where it seems like anything makes you break down and want to give up?"	0
I realize this is all part of the disease,  but my mother exhibits anger towards my father on a daily basis. He has less and less time to himself.   I’m a young father who tries to balance everything and help both of my parents as much as possible. When I am not there, I am always thinking about their situation.   She’s not in a position yet where she needs full time care, but it’s nearing the horizon. I feel horrible wishing that it would come sooner so that my dad can get a break. Can anyone relate to this experience? Does the pain ever go away?	0
I can't shake this gut feeling I have that my dad is at the end of his fight with Alzheimer's. He was diagnosed 8 years ago at 70 years old. Medications had worked for years to keep it low progressing.   The past 3 years have been hospital stays and increasing falls. 3 of which have put him in the hospital/rehab. (Rehab took a toll and actually caused a broken hip requiring surgery)   He is now barely there he has maybe 2 good days a week at best.   My mom brought him back north to see his new grandson, his brothers, myself and siblings and basically our whole family saw him this year. They stayed with my husband and I. I haven't been able to shake this feeling that I'm going to get a call any day now saying he's passed away. Even though just yesterday my mom said he had a good day and hes in the background talking to me through the phone.  I literally can't shake it, I cry every day because I just feel it. I'm not sure how to handle this. Has anyone dealt with this feeling?	0
My dad has moderate to severe AZ, and this week has been rough.   He’s been staying with my sister, but she and her husband work. I live hours away and can stay for the weekend, but I’ll need to return home on Sunday.   Dad spent the evening in the ER. He need some assistance now. How are we supposed to pull this off so quickly? He went from bad to worse so quickly.   What a mess all this is.	0
My dad was just diagnosed with Alzheimer's.  My mom also has a lot of health issues going on.  My sister and I are working with them the best we can.  I'm 2 hours away and my sister is 10hours away.  Has anyone found an app that is easy to use(technology is getting harder for both of them) that could be used to track what their meds and dosages are as well as all scheduled appointments?  I've thought about setting up a Google calendar that can be shared amongst us but not sure they will get it.	0
My 82-year-old father was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and will be losing his licence in about a month. Him and I have a very difficult relationship. I have mental/cognitive / chronic pain /disability problems myself and I’m having trouble thinking and organizing this stage of his life. It’s on me and there isn’t much help from the state here in Canada. He doesn’t offer much input, either, except the myriad of supports he says he doesn’t want. He lives in an isolated community about ten hrs away and he can’t live with me. I have power of attorney and am currently sorting his bills and taxes out so we can apply for care homes.   If there’s anything you could suggest as far as what we need to do to help him prepare or things to watch for with his property or finances or applications I really appreciate it.	0
My 62 yo mom has been exhibiting symptoms of Alzheimer’s for several years now but she’s extremely reluctant to get professional help. Her dad recently passed away and his estate planning has been a real mess for his children. Because my mom now sees the value in having a plan in place early, I’d like to start the conversation about her own preferences when it comes to aging, death, etc.   Question: does someone out there have a list of questions we can use as a guide for talking about hard-to-talk-about stuff? For example:   1. If needed, do you have a preference for who you’d like to manage your finances/medical care/etc. (ie, who do want to manage your money and stuff?)  2. If needed, do you have a preference for the type of care you’d prefer if you ever get to the point where you cannot care for yourself? (Ie, is there a nursing home you have in mind or do you want to stay home no matter what if possible?)  3. When the time comes, do you have any preferences for when it comes to your funeral, burial, etc?   There’s a lot missing here, but hopefully you get the gist of what I’m looking for.   Lastly, any tips for having this conversation with loved ones? I know this isn’t dinner small talk but is it better to have a sit down discussion and hit as many questions as possible in one go? Or spread it out over time? I live in a different country so I plan wait til I’m with her in person but open to hearing others experience here.	0
I recently moved in with my grandparents so they wouldn’t have to go into a nursing home. My grandpa has severe Alzheimer’s and dementia to the point where he can barely watch TV or do anything that requires more than 5 min worth of attention. I basically just play cards with him, do word searches and watch westerns and WW2 docs with him all day. Thing is he gets very antsy around 3 or 4pm everyday thinking he needs to go somewhere or do something. When I ask him what we need to do he just says “I don’t know” and gets angry. He loves to work. He unfortunately worked everyday for like 45 years and I believe his brain thinks he needs to go just out of habit. I am wondering if there are any jobs I could give him? What’s like a manly job he might enjoy doing?  Any suggestions are appreciated!	0
"My Dad was diagnosed with vascular dementia about 6 years ago, and 4 years ago had the 'full blown' Alzheimers diagnosis. He was 62 at the time.     Of course - this upended his life. He was a 767 pilot - and now he wasn't allowed to drive a car.   As a result, he's medically signed off permanently. He claims benefits (he had no money, but we'll get onto that).     He has a support team - they are excellent and I can't praise them highly enough.     For various reasons he had to declare bankruptcy - again the support team were fantastic about that.     Me and my younger brother are registered as Power of Attorney for him - something he was keen on. The majority of his stresses are financial, and we wanted to take that stress away from him.     Bankruptcy - sorted. Benefit payments - sorted.     Now, the spanner in the works - he forgot he had pensions. A letter comes through the door telling him he was a £38k pension waiting for him. I panic. If the benefits office find out about this, then they will stop his benefits.     A helpful family friend helps my Dad by connecting him to his tax attorney - Dad now figures ""Hooray, I have £38k coming, I can start looking at a holiday, or buying some shiny new tech"" (he loves his tech).     Meanwhile my brother and I are... concerned. He spends all sorts of money in some sort of black hole - we have no idea where it goes (though we're looking to rectify that now we have the LPA). The benefits aren't great, but we don't understand where his money is going. He's always short every month by ""a few hundred... can you loan me?"" and I always do, accepting it's not a loan.     Also - yon family friend hasn't ACTUALLY ""sorted it"" like Dad seems to believe - he's expecting thousands of pounds to just end up in his account.     I now have to be the ""bad guy"". It's his money and I'm not taking it away from him but I have to try and explain he's not suddenly going to ""rich"" - I'm going to try and ask him what he needs it for, how it potentially has to last for a few years yet.     He's expecting to just have a load of money in his bank, and I'm going to have to be the one who says ""Look mate, that isn't happening like you think it's going to happen"".     He's going to be upset with me - which is fine I can take it. But does anyone have some good advice around how I soften the blow a little bit?"	0
Hi,   My grandmother has had Alzheimer’s for around 2-3 years now. She’s my literal role model and the strongest person I’ve ever know in my life. She has gotten quite severe and im not sure how to communicate or conversate with her anymore because I don’t want to aggravate or annoy her. I was wondering if anyone has any tips and advice. Thank you all, and God bless you. Thanks	0
Hey guys,  I was just wondering if covid 19 makes Alzheimer's worse even after covid recovery? I was wondering if anyone has had any experience of a loved one with Alzheimer's, catching covid 19 and what the outcome was?   Thanks guys,	0
After a living with Alzheimer’s for 3.5 years my 74 year old dad passed away peacefully on January 15th, 2022. I’m struggling with waves of sadness.. trying to stay busy but then having to lay down for an hour because I’m crying non stop. My Dad was my best friend and I thought I had more time with him, and it doesn’t feel real that I will never see him again. I am 24 and have no relationship with my mom and I’m just feeling so alone and sad.	0
Hello, sadly my mom’s memory is going quickly. We are awaiting official diagnosis but early onset Alzheimer’s is here. He’s trapped in her head, he goes to store, she freaks cause he’s gone and she can’t remember where. Was thinking of one of those google home things. My thought is she could ask… “Where’s Bob?” And it would say he’s at appointment etc. is this possible with google calendar? Thanks	0
My girlfriend’s grandma has had alzheimers for 10 years with the last five plus years having no mobility or speach. Everyday she is cared for in such an incredible way that she manages to continue to survive. Her grandma can still manage to kinda swallow enough to eat and she still opens her eyes and makes completley incoherent mumbles but can sometimes make eye contact. She is now about 50lbs and she was 76lbs a year ago. Her circulation has been really bad lately and her feet were swollen, after medication the swelling is down but her toes are starting to turn black. My question is how do you know when the time is over? How and can you make the call to end suffering? Is she suffering? Are people with alzheimers understanding of their condition in regards to pain? Seems like a tough questions but everywhere on google says that she probably should have passed 8 years ago, but due to the immense ammount of care she recieves that hasnt been the case.	0

Next weekend I’m going on holiday for three nights. First time being away from grandma since she was diagnosed 3/4 years ago. I seem to be writing overly extensive notes to the person who’s standing in for me. (Do “A” if she says this but “B” if she doesn’t unless “C” happens etc)… Gran seems to perk up a bit when someone else is around. You can tell she tries harder to be “normal”. So my question is. Should I give the person who is standing in all the notes and stick to the structure? Or do you think that tearing them them up and making grandma work a little harder for a few days with a different routine be better?  Edit: grammar.	0
"Hi, currently I have a grandma that is suffering from Alzheimer.  The progression has luckily been very slow, but it's starting to get to a serious point of day to day memory loss, no short term memory, confusing and mixing facts together.  We have a full time carer and mom has sometimes to go at night and help her out. Grandpa just broke his femur so he can't help much.  I was wondering if there is a professional figure I could pay to go to her and soothe her / improve her mental state, anything that can help in that sense. What would this be called?     Also any books you would recommend that I could give my mom / grandpa on ""how to live with someone that has alzheimer""? I just realised no one in the family is really informed on anything and we're just going with the motions. Surely some knowledge wouldn't hurt."	0
Sorry if this is all over the place but I just wanted to seek some help from the community. Will try to give as much context and background as i can.  My Dad (73) probably has Alzheimers. My Grandma had it and passed away from it, he is displaying symptoms for the past year as I understand. At this stage, he remembers the larger things like who I am, who my mom is etc but he forgets everyday events like what he ate, any plans we discuss for the day and he will repeat the same story that he has already told us. He is also angry most of the day. He will shout at my mom over the most trivial things and asks her to kill him so she can get rid of him. He doesn’t want to go and meet anyone outside the house (refused to go to another city to meet his daughters and grand kids and his own sisters and brothers). He still wants to drive even though he really can’t. He handles all his finances and makes poor investment decisions and doesn’t tell us until after. If we ask him to stop driving or stop handling his own finances he gets furious. He has a very specific daily routine and he does not stray from it.   I live in another country, along with my wife, and at home it’s just my mom (68) and my Dad plus one of my sisters (29) who works full time and lives with our parents.   I know that the first step should be to have him diagnosed so we know which stage he is at and how to care for him but he refuses to see a doctor and have any tests done. I’m currently visiting my parents and took a career break for the past 2 months to be close to him and get him help and help out mom. Tried taking him to the doctor but he fought with me and it got ugly. Without an official diagnosis I suspect everything else will be difficult ie treatment but he’s stubborn and I can’t get him medical help without his consent.  My parents live in a country which is not very developed, is conservative and they are very religious. I mention this because talking about this type of a disease is taboo here. I was too young at the time but as far as I recall no one talked about my grandma’s condition and she got limited medical help. My mom was her caretaker and I don’t want her to go through that experience again with my Dad. My sister also cannot be the caretaker as she is likely to be married in the next year and will move out. There is no concept of nursing homes in my country so my dad will live at home. I want to care for him but that means both me and my wife give up our life and move back home. I’m not sure I can ask her to do that. I can afford to hire help at home but worry that Dad will get angry at them and make them leave.   My mom has experience with this from my grandma’s time but she doesn’t want to talk about a structured way of helping Dad. She does not want to treat him like a patient (probably scared and hence in denial).  What do I do and where do I start? How will his disease progress and what can I expect? How do I make him happy and care for him?	0
"We're not there yet, but I wanna be ahead of the curve. I feel like if she asks, responding with ""I'm your grandson"" would make her feel really crappy for forgetting such a thing, but I can't imagine lying would be the right response either. She hates being patronized in general so I don't know how to best navigate that transitional period where she's starting to get bad, but not yet bad enough that she can't recognize her own decline."	0
This is Dr. Simoni, I am a sociologist at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. My research study is conducting interviews about the lived experiences of family members caregiving for those with Alzheimer’s disease. To be eligible, participants should be between the ages of 30 and 65 and have a family member diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Your time for the short (30 minute) interview will be compensated via a $20 debit card redeemable at any debit location.  If interested, please message me through Reddit at u/SimoniSoc__UTC or send an email to [zsimoni@utc.edu](mailto:zsimoni@utc.edu).  This study has received approval from the institutional review board at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga.  Thanks!	0
My mother was diagnosed ans she is in stage 4-5.  She’s taking her medecins and I hired a caretaker to stay at home with her, while I am at work. I’d like to get resources recommendatios for mental exercises. She used to love craftmanship, crochet, embroidery, sewing, reading and movies. However, her attention span is quite reduced now. She can made small repairs in clothes or prepare her own sandwich, but it’s hard for her to follow a movie or read. Could you recommend some resources for mental exercises, please?	0
My MIL is now under hospice care as of Wednesday. I was told by my FIL and SIL that she was jaundiced, which can be a natural progression as she nears the end, but actually seeing her with deeply yellow skin and yellow eyes made me very sad. We’ve been told she has about a week left at most.   It helps me to share so thank you for the outlet.	0
I can’t hide how jarring it is when dad says something indicative of him slipping away. It might come out of the blue when he’s had a good day or week. How do I keep it together when he says something that shows he’s losing his grasp on things? He’s also becoming fixated on my visits and asking my mother when he’ll see me again. Despite speaking 5 or 6 times every day and frequently for an hour every evening (either on FaceTime or on the Portal TV) I still have a sickening feeling that I should be with him all of the time when I know that even if lived locally, I would need to work and couldn’t be with him, all of the time. I see him for 5 days at a time every three weeks or so, is that enough? He doesn’t need caring for as such right now and my mother is more than capable to help him out with the small stuff he does need a hand with, it’s more the behavioural changes that are so brutally painful to stomach right now.	0
Certain drugs are known to be bad for elderly patients or patients with dementia.

You cannot rely on general practice doctors, pharmacists, anesthetists, and so on, to be familiar with this list, and you may want to consult it before accepting any new medication for your loved one or elder.	0
"I'm not really asking for advice this time. I'm just venting.  Woke us up around 3am shouting about coffee. Time has no meaning to him anymore. The day starts when he wakes up, ends when he goes to bed, regardless of what time it actually is. And he expects everyone else to be up with him.  He was out of coffee. Yelling at my mom about how he's ""constantly getting the short end of the stick"" because he's convinced he's the victim. He's convinced that she's depriving him of things on purpose. He's out of coffee because he drinks too much.   3am to about 430am.   Eventually he stopped shouting. He's angry anymore. At least no worse than usual. But he keeps waking her up. Going into her room (they've had separate bedrooms for years) and keeps bothering her about stupid petty shit.   My poor mother is sleep deprived. Depressed and anxious from being yelled at all the time. And anytime she tries to leave the house, even for just a few hours, he'll call her over 20 times. Making up reasons to yell at her or leave angry messages when she doesn't pick up. Or, he'll get in a car and drive around trying to find her.   We can't stop him from driving. Tried.   This type of thing has become the new normal. Practically a daily thing.  I feel so bad for her. He was an asshole long before the disease took over. It's hard to feel sorry for him or to have any sympathy when he's always been a loud, selfish, raging asshole. But the disease amplified the worst of him then times over. And now he's this abusive burden we're stuck with.   Can't afford to put him in a home. He's not far enough along to qualify for it anyway. Plus they'd prob kick him out for being an asshole. And we can't afford to move out and just abandon him. (my mom's guilt would never let her go through with that though)  If things keep going the way that they are, I'm convinced she'll kill herself just to get away from him."	0
Tl;dr my father (87) diagnosed with dementia Alzheimer’s currently lives at home, I am his caretaker. I have durable PoA, medical PoA, and so on. He wants to move to VA with me, where I live full time. My brother is now taking me to court for guardianship though he rarely visited my parents before they got Covid and I came to help. Can I fight this in court?  My mom and dad both came down with Covid in November of last year. They ended up so bad that my mom fell onto the floor and since my dad is so deaf when he takes out his hearing aids he didn’t find her until the next morning. He was so weak he could not get her up, so he called my brother to come help. He had to break in to do so, and mom ended up in icu in the end and passing away. Dad ended up that same week in the hospital for a week as well. He fortunately made it through.   Now, at the time I lived in Virginia and had called my brother and told him that mom and dad were very sick, sicker than they had ever been in their lives and he needed to go check on them. He never checked once. He lives 11 minutes away from their house! My eldest son was getting married that week but I would have missed the wedding if I knew how serious it was.  He called them every day, left messages every day, but I would think that the fact that they never answered the phone, knowing they were sick, he would have come over to see what was up. But yet, not once.  Fast forward to when I got here, mom and dad were in the hospital and mom told me to go to the bank and get paperwork done so I could pay the bills as they had not done that in November, being sick . So I did that and they both signed it, after I explained to both of them what it was. Them being sick I just wanted to make sure they understood. I had to have dad talk to the bank associate so he could acknowledge what was going on.  Moving forward dad is home, mom has passed away and with dad’s diagnosis, according to moms will I am her executrix, so I have a durable Power of Attorney, and Medical Power of Attorney made up as well. I have Notary come over to the house so he doesn’t have to go out and it is signed by witnesses and the notary, depending on what is needed for each form.  Moving forward again, I’m going through the house my folks lived in for 50 years, getting rid of ancient paperwork, old childhood stuff, just crap that is not necessary or needed. My nephew comes over and his kids start grabbing stuff of my moms and wanting to take it home some without asking. Now my mom was very organized, and had taken me on “ death walks” through the house for years, telling me who got what when they were gone, she labeled stuff on the  bottom so I would know who get it. And here comes a 15, 12, and 10 year old just grabbing shit. I was upset.   So, I’m having to take my dad to the doctor for a checkup after getting out of the hospital, my brother comes along, ok whatever, I could have called you with the results. A month later dad seems to be having an UTI so I make an appointment and I go, my brother tags along again. At my request, they do some tests for dementia as my brother has stated that he has doubts dad has it, he never heard mom talk about it and he feels dad just has Covid fog.  He has also stated since mom died that since she is gone her words have no weight anymore. So they do the test and the doc states he does have dementia just like his file already shows, it doesn’t get better or go away. That he cannot live alone.  Somebody in the family has now filed a DHS report on me stating I was under medicating him (did not pick up a prescription of prednisone at the pharmacy, shock and awe, I have the receipt, the bottle and so forth), that I am over medicating him ( he has a tree nut allergy, and he got into something with tree nuts, so I asked the pharmacist what was the best thing for him, he told me Benadryl. Now know this might not be true, and am calling my allergist!), and that I was using his money  myself (please, that is ridicules, my dad has so little money, and when I mentioned I found cash in a lockbox, my brother kept hammering me how much was it. I told him it didn’t matter as I put it back in his savings.  Today I was served with papers that said I need to be in court in Feb as my brother is filing for guardianship over dad. He wants to put dad in a nursing home, whereas I can provide him a home with family, an entire home, his own room, 3 porches, home cooked food, and so forth. He can save his money for later when he needs memory care.  On top of that, with guardianship comes finical responsibility of dad. My brother and his wife have not filed taxes in three years. Their home cannot pass inspection to get insurance and they refuse to fix it to get insurance. His wife is on the state child abuse and adult dependent registries, for child abuse against my niece. My brother smokes weed at home, at work, and in his vehicles. I don’t normally have an issue with weed, but don’t smoke it at your place of employment unless your boss is super chill lol and yea I’m going to use it against him when it comes to protecting my dad from him.  Present times: my dad is upset that my brother never talked to him, made false allegations and so forth. Dad was appointed some random lawyer from a different town, he has a lawyer just down the street he has used for years.  What can I legally? Can I file the same paperwork or just present my facts in court that day? Can he be made to do a drug test?  If you read all of this, thank you, if you have advice, thank you!	0
I live about a 3 hour flight from my grandparents, so I only see them a few times a year, but I call every 2-3 days. The calls have gotten harder recently. She’s always pleasant and upbeat, but she can’t answer any questions or tell me much of anything. She repeatedly asks me when is the next time I’m visiting. Usually I say I’ll be there very soon and I can’t wait to see her. Then she asks again when it’ll be, I’ll give an exact date and tell her I’m excited to cook with her, take her to the library, or something new. Then she’ll just keep asking. I’m not sure if there’s an answer that would satisfy her. When I call even the day after a visit, she’ll say it’s been a long time since she’s seen me. I just apologize and say I can’t wait for the next time. And the cycle continues.  Sometimes she tells me she was just reading a book so I’ll ask her about the book and she can’t tell me anything else, so we talk about how wonderful reading is. She likes music and dancing, but these don’t translate over the phone as well. In person, I can get her to tell stories about her childhood but I have trouble engaging her over the phone. Sometimes I’ll just ramble about my day or my life and if I laugh, she laughs too. Eventually she gets tired of talking or listening and I can hear her trying to pass the phone to my grandpa. Every time, I hear him respond “say goodbye first”. Then I tell her I love her and she says it back. I’m not sure she even knows who I am during these calls.   tldr- I have a phone routine with my grandma and I’m not sure what I can do to make it better. Alzheimer’s sucks	0
My family has hired an additional person to watch him full time, one on one, at the care facility. Despite that, when he’s alone, he falls.	0
"My (31 F) mom, 64 with early onset Alzheimer's was officially diagnosed July 2021, and by August, had already started to forget me (we'd been wading through her symptoms until official diagnosis for a over a year at that point). I knew that we were going to get to the point where she'll start to forget me and others eventually, but I did not expect it so soon.  Every day, I'm either ""mom,"" ""what's your name,"" ""why don't you tell me your name,"" or ""you're nice, I like you."" Very rarely anymore am I her daughter or my name.   I know 100% it is the disease and not her, but these past couple of weeks, it has really been hitting me hard, and it sucks. How did the woman who loved me so much forget me? How did the woman who had an endearing nickname for me since childhood, and who signed everything with ""I love you to infinity and beyond,"" and verbally told me she loved me any chance she got, forget me? How does she remember who my cousin and my cousin's children are, but not her own? It just makes me so sad I can't stand it.  I'm still really struggling to even accept our reality at this point. I understand it, but it is still so surreal. What happened to that woman I loved so much and could never fathom life without? Why did she leave me so soon? The woman that is taking up space in my house and my life is not someone I can really even stand to be around, and I don't like myself for it. I have no one. I am both of our parent at this point, and I cannot wait until the day this is no longer my burden. But the thought of carrying this grief with me for the rest of my life is heavy, and I feel like a piece of me already has died with her and who she used to be, and I will never get that back. I miss both of who we used to be terribly.  Also, for anyone who had a loved one who seemingly progressed (and I mean truly progressed this fast within a few months or a year; my mom doesn't really know how to eat without using her hands/being messy, is completely incontinent, speech is dwindling, no longer based in reality at all, does nothing with reason or logic, has lewy body characteristics and hallucinates people and conversations that aren't there/didn't happen) this fast and has already passed, how long did it take from diagnosis until the end? I know it varies, and I know there's no way of truly knowing, but I can't stop thinking about how much I'm already ready for her to go. This is no way for either of us to live. The fact that we don't have many options but to suffer without paying an exorbitant price is cruel."	0
"My dad (70) hasa diagnosis of cognitive brain impairment and symptoms that appear like Alzheimer's. My mom (68) has been caring for him and is accepting some of his mental changes, but she needs help. She can't do it all.   He doesn't need to be ""babysat"" all the time, but he is getting to where he should be. He isn't wandering but he sometimes makes weird decisions and shouldn't drive.   I'm happy to help my parents and I love hanging out with my dad. But my mom needs more help. How do we find an adult daycare for my dad that he might like? He is still fairly self aware and I believe would be defensive to being left to be babysat. He would understand what that means, when he would rather be doing other things. Thank you."	0
"On the 2nd, my grandma (74f) fell out of bed and was showing stroke symptoms. She's had Todd's paresis in the past but I still figured I'm better off to call 911. Unfortunately, due to covid restrictions my mom and I were kicked out. I'll call this hospital E, this has been our main hospital.  Hospital E has been pretty good with updates. However, they are very much a ""money first"" hospital.  She ended up having her test for a stroke come back negative along with her CT. An MRI was never done because even with her on meds she wouldn't stay still long enough.  We decided to just make her comfortable and being hospice. This is when problems start happening. Hospital E wants her out ASAP claiming they don't have a hospice program. We're given a social worker and told our only option was a nursing home nearby costing $9000 a month. We knew there other options because we live in a very senior heavy town. I've known that Hospital E receives money for referrals there.  Eventually, we find a good long term care and hospice facility I'll call BG. My grandma gets transferred after 5 days at Hospital E to BG. She really likes it at BG, they play music and have snack time (her words). She's there about 2 days when I get the call there is two COVID cases at BG. No big deal, they isolate her and the other patients. Day 3 she begins to act up and refuses to leave another patients room. BG wants to send her to get a psych eval so she can be on the right medication. I agree with it and she's sent to Hospital G, a hospital with a good psych ward as known from personal experience.  Hospital G receives her and immediately tests her for COVID as a precaution. She's positive. This means she either caught it at Hospital E or before hand. Not at BG, as she wasn't there long enough for her to test positive for it.  This makes my mom and I go through all of her charts to see if she was tested and when. Hospital E marks her oxygen was low and her lungs trashed. Only 1 rapid test was ever done, an Abbott test that has been more likely for false negatives. My mom and I test for covid, I'm negative my mom is positive. She has had covid since she ended up in Hospital E, now 8 days ago.  Hospital G has no more COVID beds and needs to transfer again. BG's sister location, BW, has a covid isolation area as it's much bigger. She's sent to it and  finally I can relax. She's in a good place, I trust them.  Tonight I get a call at 3:50am. My grandma is hitting and scratching everyone she can at BW. They need to transfer her as they are not capable for psych patients. She's being transferred to Hospital S. Immediately, I'm worried. My grandpa had gone to Hospital S after a stroke where he was mistreated horribly. That was 23 years ago, hopefully things have improved.  After looking into her charts from Hospital E, I'm glad she's not there. Since June, my grandma has been to Hospital E five times. Only once did they do a urine test. One of the most common tests for seniors. As well, she was brought in on the 17th for extreme aggression. Not a single test was done. In June and two other visits (can't remember exactly when) I brought her in for rectal bleeding. Once again, no tests were done as her very quick exams showed she wasn't bleeding anymore. In August, I finally got them to do a more thorough exam and she's diagnosed with cancer. Hospital E looks like such a nice caring hospital but they are some of the most incompetent doctors I've ever met.  I'm so frustrated because most of this could have been avoid if Hospital E actually ran the tests she needed. This isn't the first time I've had issues with them but I sure hope this the last.  TL;DR grandma went to the hospital and nobody ran any tests and she keeps getting transferred"	0
"My dad is 66 and was diagnosed with FTD two years ago and a different doctor decided Alzheimers a couple years ago instead of FTD. Either way my father had been getting worse and worse recently. My mom is his primary care taker and I help out along with one of my in laws. Currently my dad is having more and more bowel issues. He is currently wearing a depends 100% of the time because is loosing control more and more, he will often make it to the toilet but not always.   One of my hardest struggles with helping him with his battle is also helping my mother keep her sanity and also getting my mom to keep my father at home for as long as he can be. There was a 6 month stint a little more than year ago where my dad went to the hospital and then to a nursing home to help them figure out meds correctly. This was extremely hard to deal with because it was covid time and nobody was allowed to see him. My mom was also more than happy to take a break from my dad at this time mainly due to the disease and my dads hallucinations at the time. I felt really bad because he was completely pulled from the world he knew and put into a place he completely hates. He also hates a nursing home and the time that he was in there he was so young compared to everyone else in there :( I also feel bad for my mom because this is a lot to handle and deal with. After the 3 months of being in the hospital and then 3 months in a nursing home he came back home and has been there since. Him and my mom have traveled often and I will go with them at times to help with my dad as well. So he has been doing ""decent"" but is getting worse and worse.  Fast forward to today he is having issues making it to the bathroom all the time and isn't always getting cleaned up after going and not always getting cleaned up in the shower either. Mom said today that he was very sore down there so I feel like he's probably not ever getting fully cleaned up. Mom was talking to me about getting him into a nursing home again and was going to call up a local place that we had previously talked about to see what it entails to get him in there. I will always push for him to stay at his home because this is where he is comfortable and wants to be but I think my mom is getting to a point that it is beyond her level of care ability.   My question is, what are the options that we can look at for in home care/assistance vs placing my dad into a nursing home again? Thanks for any help :)"	0
My dad is 59 years old and he's been really forgetful lately. Its not as serious, he isn't confused, disorianted nor does he have any symptoms i found online, but he forgets stuff like something we talked about recently or things i told him. Sometimes hes on his phone while i tell him my work shifts or simmilar and at first i thought he wasnt really listening and that might be the reason, but at the same time he did carry the conversation normally at the time. Yesterday he went to turn off the heating in the house and i dont know what he did but aparently he forgot in the meantime to do it, he wasnt absent for unusual time either. He used to have troubles remembering what grade i am in school or some stuff about my life but i guess that he just didnt care about it, dont get me wrong hes a great guy and i never held it against him. Im just trying to say he always had great memory just not about stuff he didnt find interesting i guess.  When i point it out he just jokes that he got old, but hes not that old. Hes super stubborn and he wont go to the doctor about anything yet alone for this to get checked out. My grandma got senile around age 82 and i had memory issues from an early age, simmilar to my dad i just couldnt remember things i didnt care about no matter how recently they happened, like homework and much more. I dont know if that matters.	0
   Despite our best efforts, our father P (77 M) continues to be completely enmeshed with his new girlfriend N ( 72 F) , who he first became involved with last summer.  From speaking to him, he believes he has MCI (Moderate Cognitive Impairment), instead of stage 5 Alzheimer's, which he was diagnosed with in 2019. I understand lack of insight into their own condition is a common feature of those who suffer from Alzheimer's.   Unlike last holiday, P did not get his once beloved grandchild anything despite sending my aunt a card with all of our names signed (except his grandchild) and proudly centering the name of “his Girlfriend N.”  He also had his caregiver drive him to the jewelry store and purchase an engagement ring. P proposed to N on December 22.   Around the same time, my aunt D (70 F) and brother J (51 M) worked with a family law attorney to arrange for his doctor to give P a capacity test. J got P to the doctor’s office but P would not go along with this test until he saw it was being given by a beautiful blond woman. Now he was really into taking the test and impressing this woman. He also volunteered to her that he didn't have a girlfriend. Needless to say, he failed the test. J then went back to lawyer with test results and got his name back on the trust, which P had removed back in October when N told him to cut us off.   P also had a visit from Adult Protective Services, who reported that he seemed confused during questioning about his relationship with N and told the social services worker he was not planning to marry N or anyone. As far as we know, P did not report either the test or SS visit to N as he seems a little scared of her reaction. (we found that if the person is competent, SS will not take the report. P was found not competent).  After a break for the New Year, we have learned that P & N are now working with an attorney to create a new will and trust for P, who did his will in 2019 after the death of his 2nd wife (named N also) in 2013. Once P tries to move the money to N, he will learn what J has done and P & N will not be happy.    We do not know how she will react, but the lawyers are standing by with an injunction in case she moves on P’s trust, which she will as she is utterly relentless. We also plan to air this person out to P's whole community, including friends who could have a positive influence. We hope.	0
I’m am just having a lot of trouble dealing mentally with my father’s Alzheimer’s right now and could really use some advice/support. As the title mentions he’s always been stubborn but ALZ has made it ten times worse to the point of creating animosity amongst his loved ones. He makes up entire stories in his head where he told someone this or this is how an event happened and it’s not at all. The arguing takes a toll. It could even be as simple as us watching a show and him claiming he saw it and knows how it ends (like a cooking competition) but that’s clearly impossible because all episodes haven’t aired. He’ll insist of rewatching every episode available and gets mad when there are no more proving he was incorrect but never admits it. While this is annoying it’s something one can learn to live with. But the stealing assertions are just wild. He’ll misplace his debit card, forget his password or don’t know how to use cash app and turn around and accuse mainly me (his daughter) of stealing his money. He’ll call and I can be out in public listening to him rant about how he’ll send me to jail and he doesn’t care who I am. I’ll get long drawn out text messages saying the same thing. Then when he finds it there’s no apology or anything. My thing is and maybe this is where I falter in understanding is I can’t process the behavior because in my mind he should know right from wrong. Admittedly, from my perspective I really only think of Alzheimer’s as a memory disease. What am I missing here? I remember my mom telling me about how my grandma treated her. She said that others told her that patients usually treat the person who does the most/closest to them the worse	0
Hi I am relatively new to this community and this is my first encounter (I was very young with other encounters) with altzheimers. My grandmother is living in a 80% care facility, the other 20% is up to the family. This works quite well for now except that she struggles with going to the toilet. She does not recognize the toilet as usable, this leads to some accidents. Previously in her old home and when she visited mine this was not an issue. Does anyone have any advise to help her. Already tried a paper sign with toilet written on to it. These accidents create insecurity that stick by her like a bad feeling, so I hope I can help her out.	0
"Hi everyone,  First off, sorry for the super long post!  My grandma (78) was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in the past month. She is in early-middle stages according to the doctor. In general she is really forgetful and will ask the same things over and over again, forgets that conversations already happened, forgets how to fix a problem with her phone after I've told her many times how to, tries to tell my mom directions while driving even though she already knows the way and has said so, etc.   She had needed a bit more help because she had some major surgery and became less independent because of it, but then when covid happened you could really notice a difference where she became super forgetful and kind of confused. Like for example she saw a reflection of lights in the window and thought there was a car driving towards the house.   She also gets worried when things don't go according to her ""routine"" like if someone leaves the lights on, if my uncle doesn't close the door behind him in his room, etc. She fixates on that kind of stuff especially the lights and the door to the point where she will tell everyone in the house multiple times a day to watch out for the lights & door.  Finally a big problem she has is getting dressed and showering. I'm not sure how much of that is Alzheimer's, because she has pretty bad mobility in general and arthritis so I think it is more difficult for her to put on clothes but she refuses on principle instead of saying she can't move or whatever. She says ""I'm old and I'm not going anywhere"" or ""I don't want to take a shower it's too hard"". My mom has asked her questions to get her to elaborate like, is it hard to step in the shower? Is it too hot or cold? Do you need a shower chair to sit in? Is it too difficult or painful to reach your body? Etc and my grandma just says it's too hard. We currently have her showering once a week ideally but it can go up to a month before she will do anything, and usually does not change her clothes more than once or twice a week in addition. She is super stubborn about it. I've read that is a common thing in Alzheimer's but I'm not really sure why or what we should do about it.  What I wanted to know was is there anything we can do to help her/make her less confused? We have a schedule of the days events written on a big board next to her bed with all the things she has to do. She also frequently texts us what are our plans and we go over what everyone will be doing that day. We already take care of all her food, laundry, and cleaning. I thought maybe it would help if she had a hobby to help keep track of time or make days different from each other but she is very ambivalent towards everything and says she has no preferences. Currently she mostly watches TV, but she sometimes does crossword puzzles. Although she said she's having more difficulty with them recently. I figured something like crossword puzzles would be good for your brain so we encourage her to do them.   Is there anything else I should know that would be helpful???  Any advice, suggestions, experiences welcome! My mom doesn't really like to talk about it so I want to see if there's something I can do myself or we can do as a family without putting too much burden on my mom."	0
My father has early-stage Alz. He is mostly with it, but there are fixations that he just can’t let go of. In this case, I have his .22 rifle. He has asked 20-30 times over the past couple of years that I bring his rifle. I have ‘forgotten’ it every time. My sister and I don’t think it’s a good idea for him to have a weapon. He not only has alz, but also a pretty severe tremor. Having a weapon with the amount he shakes would not be good.  It feels like it’s time to be honest with him. His building does not allow weapons and he has a bad tremor. Bringing up the ALZ is a non-starter because he can’t see that he has it.  I’m going to emphasize listening to him. Acknowledging his feelings on the whole thing. Telling him I love him. But no, I’m not bringing his rifle.  It’s going to be a hard day.  We took a trip in November for 5 days together for the first time in a long time. He was very with it. We bonded better than he have in a long time. I’m worried this is going to damage the closeness we have gained.    I guess I’m conflicted. All the advice about alz is to lie to avoid conflict. Use this verbal judo to redirect the person. But that isn’t working either because he isn’t that far gone. He knows I’m lying to him, so that’s damaging our relationship too.   Alz and parents getting older just sucks.	0
I've gotten back in touch with longtime friends I'd drifted from, and the husband is probably [stage 5-6 by this scale](https://www.healthline.com/health/stages-progression-alzheimers#stage-5) at the age of 59. I've been able to spend some time with him so she can go to appointments and such. He is still an absolute sweetheart and remembers me most visits, if not necessarily immediately, but his short-term memory is super-limited and he can't follow the complex narrative of a joke or a reminiscence and he doesn't respond well to new visuals. Mostly we sit and talk about the pretty view or their nice cats or how great we both are (like I said, absolute sweetheart), and occasionally we have a snack, which he loves. While I do think that this is a fairly soothing interlude for him, which is no bad thing, I'm wondering if there's anything people have found somebody at that level of Alzheimer's might enjoy that I'm not thinking of. Winter weather is foul here and he's afraid of the cold, so going outside isn't a possibility at the moment. Or maybe I should just stick to our hours of affectionate Zen?	0
Hi everyone,  First time poster who has benefited a great deal from all the advice and support over the years reading through various posts and comments.  MIL has advanced Alzheimer's. We are having trouble with her bowel movements. She gets very constipated for a couple of days, during which time we give her Senekot, fiber gummies, milk of magnesia etc. Then she will void herself but the problem is that the timing of this is uncontrollable. We try to sit her on the toilet throughout the day but she does not understand the concept of pushing.  On a few occasions she has voided herself in her diaper at night and then reaches in and pulls it out. Needless to say it is a big mess.  Last night was a really rough night for my FIL and we rushed over to try to help with the cleanup. Clean up involves trying to avoid her touching anything, disinfecting the entire bed area, while also getting her into the bath which as you know is another big challenge for ALZ patients. We do notice that she is constantly reaching into her pants at night. Any suggestions for how we could solve this problem? We are going to play around with the times of day when we give her the laxative but it seems as if she is not on the schedule at all with her bowel movements.Thanks in advance for any suggestions you might have.	0
My mom turned 60 today and she is suffering from early onset Alzheimers. She had her diagnoses at 54 so we are in this hell for 6 years now. We all didn't expect her to make it to this birthday. But now she has and I feel really terrible. Every time she has a birthday or I have mine I miss her. The woman she was before the illness. How do you celebrate a birthday with this kind of situation. Because of covid there are only 4 people who can visit her today. So 2 of my aunts and my oldest brother and my stepdad are going there today and I feel like I should go to her but I'm also scared. She's not the woman I want to remember when she passes away. Is that selfish from me? I don't know what to do	0
I'm wondering what options, if any, an elderly US military veteran has as their Alzheimer's progresses, and they get worse. Does the government pay or partly pay for assisted living, or veteran's home stay depending on the state? If not, what other options do they have for care and assisted living?  The VA of the current state I'm in told me they do not allow Alzheimer's patients to stay in a veteran's nursing home, and they only offer caregiving services for a few measly hours a week once the patient is no longer able to dress or bathe themselves, which my loved one is fortunately still able to do, but who knows when that will end? Thank you all.	0
"My grandmother is 88 years old and lives in a separate house on our property. She's been diagnosed with ""moderate"" alzheimers and the doctor said she should really go to a nursing home but she refuses and we're ok with her living at home as long as it's possible, although we'd wish she would go to a nursing home for everyone's sake.  She doesn't take care of herself (hasn't washed her hair in god knows how long), doesn't take her meds cause she's suspicious of what they are (we bring her the medication twice a day but she cheeks them and spits it out), feeds her cat random things and doesn't clean the litter box so now we do these things for her as we don't want to take away her companion, she either refuses/forgets to eat or eats more than 1 loaf of bread a day and even cat food and shes incredibly stubborn, verbally aggressive, thinks we steal from her all the time, etc.  She doesn't want any help with cleaning, bathing, cooking, anything. She even gets mad that we help with her cat cause it makes it seem like she's old for goodness sake. She won't go see our family doctor for her prescriptions unless we force her to and we've tried having him come to the house but she just locks the doors and leaves the key on the door so we can't get in. It's miserable.  Another thing is that she's costing us a lot of money atm. She keeps breaking her tv by messing with the cables, unplugging them and then trying to plug them in incorrectly resulting in having to get it fixed cause she messes up the ports. She also messed something up on her toilet causing the water to keep running for 14 days resulting in a €1000 water bill. Besides that she always turns off all the lights and sits in the dark 24/7 to save money. Literally whenever we go check on her she's sitting on a chair in her kitchen -lights out- curtains closed - pitch black.   Any advice??"	0
Has anyone donated their loved ones brains after they passed away. I honestly don’t know how much longer my husband has and have been thinking about this as an option. I would hope that just maybe we could contribute to getting rid of this awful disease.	0

My dad is almost completely dependent on my mom for dressing. This isn’t a huge issue, but when using the bathroom, my dad is having a hard time pulling pants and underwear down/up. He can otherwise toilet independently and values doing so. Any advice/has anyone found any tricks for this? It seems like he forgets to pull up his underwear with his pants or loses his underwear in his pant legs.	0
"I find it is easier to ""manage"" my spouse with Alzheimer's if I can keep him in a good mood.  To this end, I will do things I know he gets enjoyment from.  Such as:  * A good steak dinner * His favorite cookies * An ice cream sundae * Eating out, or in Covid times, just eating at a drive-in (I call it ""going for a burger with my honey"") * Any kind of gift - even though we are downsizing, got him some new gloves at Christmas which pleased him * Grooming the cats * Watching an interesting drama on TV * Reruns of the Carol Burnett show (he likes her, I don't, but I'll survive) * A pedicure * A drive in the country  Etc.  Now I know we all feel run down and depleted, so not telling you that you should do MORE.  It's just that things run better if we can keep the mood positive.  What rays of sunshine have you given your difficult loved one?"	0
Mum got diagnosed around May last year. We think she's had it since late 2016 though. I just can't deal with her anymore. I love her because she's my mum but by god I just can't stand her anymore. Walking around the house muttering to herself how we're all assholes.   Her dog (lab) I love her to bits, but she likes to get in my daughter's face when she has food or is upset or has just woken up and when I tell her to back up my mum loses her ever loving mind. Like I have some kind of vendetta against this dog? I love this dog. She's great. But she's a puppy and doesn't understand boundaries. Still working on it though and my daughter is 19 months old.   I guess all the shit I do for her doesn't matter at all. I have no clue why I'm the bad guy constantly in her eyes but I can't take it anymore. I'm a single mum and I'm struggling to keep my head above water for my daughter. Nothing is ever enough. I'm working on moving out and in the meantime I have to work out how to keep walking on eggshells and not snap at her. Because then I'll definitely be the world's worst person because mum has Alzheimer's and she can't defend herself according to everyone around her.  I'm not posting for advice. Just to vent.	0
Preface: My grandmother was diagnosed about 4 years ago and has slowly progressed.  I have not physically seen her in a year. We took her to the hospital for a fall and she has been in assisted living since. I've attempted to visit her only one time and was turned away due to the worlds current events.   My family has been nearly begging me to go see her. My brother recently went and called in tears telling me I HAD to go see her and that she wasn't getting any better. But mentally I have not felt able to make that move as I was always the closest to her. In a way safe guarding my younger self and memories. Due to my family's pleas I know I will need to see her soon. I began writing a eulogy today for her. And I can't tell my family, husband or friends because quite frankly it is so extremely morbid. But I wrote and got all of the thoughts and memories that I know when the time comes I want people to know. I think this is my brain's way of memorializing or cementing the person she was and is to me so that when I go to see her it's as if maybe she's a different person and doesn't cloud the previous memories.	0
Living with grandma for 4 years. After she fell, the paramedics came out to clean her head injury.  They sent out someone who stitched her up in bed so she wouldn’t get freaked out having to go to hospital.  They put us onto a therapist who came out for 6 weeks and did specific exercises with her to improve her balance.   They put us in contact with a social worker who would ring me every so often to see if I had any problems.  They’ve been talking to the district nurses on my behalf. I didn’t know about this until Christmas Eve.  They’re going to send someone out one morning for the next 6 weeks. Will wake, wash, dress and feed her so I can have some time off.

Hello, looking for some advice.  I have been trying to work with my siblings in terms of support our parent who has Alzheimer’s.  The road leading up to the diagnosis revealed how poorly we do work together, but I’ve tried my best ignore the crap and snark and support my parent as best as I can.  However, the control and gaslighting from the siblings has become too much for me, it has affected my mental health.  I pulled out of group texts with them and said I will communicate via email to support our parent, but will no longer deal with them in other ways.  All the time I strongly reiterated that in NO WAY was I stopping helping our parent.  Now the email communication has also become borderline abusive - especially if I am not in agreement with something.  For example, I think a place different levels of care is what should be considered so we don’t have to move our parent when the Alzheimer’s progresses more care is required. Part of me wants to go no contact with the siblings and help my parent when they need it, not in consultation with the siblings.  Thoughts? This puts my parent in the middle so to speak, but trying to work with the siblings and maintain a decent level of mental health is almost unattainable. Thanks	0
"First it was he was going downstairs to look for something.  We live in a one-level condo built on a concrete slab - there IS no downstairs.  I finally figured out he was thinking he was still in his other house he had before we got married.  After a few days, I think I had him convinced that there was no downstairs here.  Then a couple days ago, I asked him to put something on the bed.  ""Which bed?  The bed upstairs?"" he asked.  (We only have one bed.)  Once again, we live in a single-story flat, no basement or cellar, no upper story.  I told him we have no upstairs.  He seemed stubbornly surprised.  ""I think you're confusing this place with that other house again,"" I said.  He agreed he probably was.  But then he has referred to upstairs another time.  Now I'm just rolling my eyes and going with it.  ""Yes, the upstairs bedroom.""  He can wander around looking for nonexistent stairs, it gives him something to do.    And on the subject of something to do - he has been unable to get the telephone, the automated cat feeder, the lift recliner, and the dishwasher to work (they were not broken) so he took them apart.  Which, you know, sure didn't make them work any better, since he can't put them together again.  So now I have decided his habit of taking clean clothes out of the closet or dresser and putting them in the living room is small potatoes - makes more work for me, but at least it doesn't break anything.  I feel like I have descended into the pit of madness with him.  Why fight it.  Trying to see the funny side."	0
My mother was a chef her whole life and is now showing symptoms of Alzheimer’s, could her career have exacerbated this disease?	0
My grandmother lives with my mom, and this morning she texted me to tell me that she woke up to her bathroom flooded after my grandmother had attempted to flush something down. It was a total mess, and she used all of my mom's good towels to try to clean the mess. My grandmother does not remember what she tried to flush or for how long the toilet had been overflowing. Thankfully, it is just effecting the one toilet and doesn't seem to be causing an issue with the septic tank!  My mom already has childproof locks on the toilets in the home \[because of my niece and nephew that also live there\], but my grandmother knows how to operate them. The ones she has right now are the swing-arm ones with a button to release the arm so that you can lift the seat. Are there any better options? I tried looking on Amazon, but I'm not seeing much beyond what is already in place.  Any help is very much appreciated. Thank you.	0
So my 75 year old engineer father has progressive supranuclear palsy.  Original brain injury was a brain tumor 15 years ago. We moved him into assisted living last week. Up until now he has loved his iPad to play simple games with and on. But now it's an unsecured device in his assisted living facility.   Has anyone gone through this and figured out how to protect an iPad device but also allow him to keep using it?  Thanks in advance.	0
"Had my (36M) parents (60M, 63F) over for dinner tonight and the night ended promptly after the meal finished and my Mom started talking about trying to kill my Dad and blaming my wife (34F) for hitting on my Dad during dinner.  This fucking sucks.  Over the past couple months, I've come to realize that I don't really have a Mom anymore and my kids don't have their ""Nana"" anymore -- she's just a patient now.  She still mostly knows who we are, but she doesn't seem to remember anymore who she is to us, and she's been going through these real nasty waves of just being downright miserable to my Dad. I don't know... sorry for the hostile rant, it's just been a lot to try reconciling with lately and I don't really feel like I have anyone I can open up to about this stuff."	0
Magnesium Glycenate is suggested to be good for sleep quality. We have been trying the supplement before bed with my mom, who has advanced Alzheimer’s. She typically will keep her eyes closed on the morning. Since starting the supplement she opens her eyes in the morning and seems more alert in general.	0
He's become unbearable to live with.   My mother's left literally shaking and crying from being yelled at on a daily basis.  But we can't kick him out. He would never leave. We can't afford to leave. Don't have any money in savings. I can't pull them at home, can't afford it. Even if we could they would kick him out for being too abusive to the staff.  It's heartbreaking to see so many posts on here talking about how they're losing a loved one. Where as I'm just stuck with this fucking asshole I can't get rid of. Some kind of unbearable burden.  I'm at a point where I'm expecting it's going to get bad enough that we'll have to call the cops on him. If we're lucky, the cops will take him down or take him away.  Update: his temper got so bad today that I actually called the cops on him. And while I was waiting for the cops, his defibrillator went off. So called an ambulance.   Now he's in a hospital and I don't know what to do next.	0
We suspect that her mom(60s) has AD, just now she had been losing short term memory, small things which can be easily remembered, but what's alarming is she forgot that her husband does not sleep with her but sleeps on their new house alone(her husband lived in the new house 3years ago until present).   Can we please have tips or things to do to slowdown or reverse it? And know what we are dealing with?  Happened around 8pm , im not sure but i think i heard somewhere that AD gets worse during the evening?	0
Hi everyone! I’ve been lurking for a while on this sub while procrastinating forcing my mom to go to a doctor for what I believe is Alzheimer’s or dementia. Each time I bring up going to the doctor, she becomes extremely defensive but that is a story for another day. I’m posting because I’m at a loss for how to search for a doctor that can evaluate her. I took her to PCP and he wasn’t very helpful in recommending a doctor for this.  Does anyone know if there is a resource online, or better, recommend someone? We live in NJ. Thanks!	0
"Hello Reddit,  My grandfather (75) was diagnosed with Alzheimer's a few years ago. As with this awful disease, he has been slowly declining since then and we have now run into a problem that my family and I are struggling to solve.      My grandfather lives with my grandmother (73). This past year has been harder than most with his decline. My grandmother has begun to worry about what would happen if something serious happened with her and my grandfather needed to contact either a family member or emergency services. The issue we run into is that my grandfather has a difficult time using a phone. He cannot dial 911, search contacts (or find contacts), or remember to use Bixby voice (he has an android phone). As a family we do work with him on these things, but unfortunately it is really hard for him. He can get frustrated/flustered very easily. Here are certain things we have tried/thought of:   * Adding an emergency contact number to his lock screen on his phone, all he has to do is hit a ""phone"" icon and it will dial directly from the screen to the emergency contact listed. Unfortunately my grandfather didn't understand how to press the ""phone"" icon.  * Setting up Bixby voice. All he needed to do was say ""Hello, Bixby"" and then ""Call (whomever)"". He really struggles to remember the name ""Bixby"". * Getting him a life alert. We haven't done this yet because he is unsure he will remember that he has it in a high-stress situation, even if it was on his person at all times.   We are concerned that if a situation did arise involving my grandmother and she WAS NOT able to call for help herself, that my grandfather would be too flustered to remember some of the things we have been working on. Does anyone have some advice or possibly a solution they have found themselves?"	0
Hi Everyone,  Thanks so much in advance for anyone has the time to comment. Dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in May. He had an MRI which showed a moderate level of shrinkage, mild micro vascular ischaemic as well as two small haemorrhages. With COVID, I didn't see Dad until November and noticed a change but it wasn't major. Fast forward to December and he seems to be declining really rapidly. The doctors said that his Alzheimer's could be moderate- advanced based on the fact that he would have been extremely high-performing to begin with. I really don't understand what's happening. Last week, he was able to have solid conversations; this week, he can't seem to sustain a thought. He still has a very impressive vocabulary but it just seems to be going down hill quite quickly. Had anyone seen this? What's happening? x	0
Hi guys,  My father (66) has been recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's, he hasn't forgotten much so to say, can talk perfectly fine, although sometimes gets hiccups in what words to choose. When he forgets something, usually an event in the past decade, I gently remind him of something related to it and he remembers the event completely and can describe specific details, anyways I've been reading up a lot about it, what caught me was that early onset Alzheimer's has a rapid progression compared to late stage. However as I was reading it says people with early onset are usually under the age of 65, sometimes in their 40s, and 50s. Does this mean first symptoms? Or does this mean like if you were diagnosed at 66, it means it's been affecting them way before hand and therefore is considered early onset?   Thanks in advance for the info guys, really appreciate it and want to get my head around this and what to expect, I know it's not going to get easier.	0
My future FIL is in the pretty late stages of Alzheimer's. It is important for my SO to have his father at our wedding, so we are trying to finally get married in a few months. We had plans in 2020, but then COVID as we all know. 2021 involved a lot of moving and job changes.  We are planning an intimate ceremony and reception of only 22 people, just siblings and parents and my best friend and her husband.    For the ceremony, I am planning on soft, classical music and I also plan on speaking to siblings with young kids to have a caretaker on the day of wedding as I am trying to maintain a quiet environment for FIL.   I don't really care much about music or dancing, a quiet dinner with maybe the first dance with my dad and then husband would be enough for me. I also want cupcakes or mini pies, so there won't be any cake cutting ceremony.   I just want some advice on if my ideas I have so far are solid, and asking for any additional advice or ideas that may help the day be as comfortable as possible for FIL. I figured if the younger people wanted to continue the celebration later on, we could all do so at the hotel bar. (Our parents and siblings live all over the US, so there will be a fair amount of traveling. We will also be traveling to future stepMIL and FIL for the wedding so stepMIL doesn't have to deal with the stress of traveling with FIL.)  I don't want my SO's stepmom to feel left out of the fun of the wedding, but I also don't want to agitate FIL. Please help.	0
Hi!  1st reddit post here,  please be kind.  My husband's grandfather was diagnosed with Alzheimers at approx 75 y/o. We had noticed during the most recent visit that he was repeating questions, but in a conversational sort of way. The last 2 times my 65 y/o MIL has visited,  we've noticed her repeating questions in a rapid-fire way, where we can't even finish our sentences.  It doesn't seem forgetful so much as really overbearing.  However, so also was struggling with children's games (understanding the skip symbol in Uno, the wild 2 in Dos, drawing a new card after every turn in the kids version of Cards Against Humanity). She's much younger than her dad was,  and didn't seem to be having any issues functioning.  Could this be the beginning?  Should we be concerned?  Any tips for starting a conversation?  I don't think she'll hear it very well.  Thanks	0
I realized one of the very few gifts that my grandma appreciates immensely  was a photo of her dad. Why was it special? The original photo was extremely tattered and ruined with scratches and a few rips. I’m a designer and photo retouching/restoration is something I really enjoy. I surprised her with the photo cleaned up and she cried. Since it was digitally I made her a few copies so she could have it in different places too.   I wanted to open my services to everyone here in this community! If you have an image that you’d like to be restored please DM and I can give you a timeframe when I can get the image done. Typically getting an image restored can cost $100s but I’m offering it freely since I saw how much joy it brought my grandma.  I am able to: remove scratches/rips, burns, potentially enhance some of the colors, and provide you with a jpeg of that image after being restored. Timelines will vary pending on the image and I’ll confirm that I’ll be able to bring the photo back to life. If you have any questions feel free to DM me directly!	0
When is the right time to have someone with dementia living with someone? My grandmother lives alone, everyday one of us visits her. We buy groceries, meds, take her to the doctor, etc. but for most of the time she is alone. She does the laundry by herself, she prepares her food and pretty much can take care of herself. She communicates okay, only she sometimes repeats herself. One time she went a bit far from home and she felt lost. The police called us and we picked her up from the station. Right now she doesn’t go out on her behalf but I wonder when will it be when she will need a person with her all the time before it’s too late (before she hurts herself or she gets lost).	0
Hi, my grandmother has recently started to wander off during the night ( while people she lives with are asleep) and may be while they are gone. Is there some sort of permanent bracelet that can track her or have her information. What childproofing things could help?  ( locks have been changed and she figured those out).  Other things are she hides stuff and calls people at random times.	0
After Christmas, grandma will happily munch on the leftover nibbles in small amounts in the fridge all through the day. She’s recently been refusing what she says are meals too large to eat. (A jacket potato for dinner is “so big” she won’t even try to eat any of it). Today she had 2 pork pies, half a quiche and 3 jam tarts over the afternoon.  Should I get back to making her meals that are good for her, or continue to buy the ready made nibbles she currently likes?	0
"My mother has a living will and I don't understand how that works when she stops feeding herself. It says not to give her artificial nourishment if she has a terminal illness.   I have a friend who said her mom just said ""I'm not eating any more"" and died a week later.  Has anybody else been in this situation? I'm want to be mentally prepared for it because I'm her medical POA and I have a combative sibling who I will have to be dealing with."	0
Recently I became aware that my grandpa is having some memory issues. I’m not sure if he’s been diagnosed yet, but he definitely knows that something is wrong most of the time. He has some mobility issues and basically just watches tv all day. I was thinking of things I could get for him to occupy his time, and I remembered that he used to play old NES and Sega games when I was a kid. I am thinking that playing games might stimulate his brain and help him regain some focus.  After some searching online, I found some studies that support this theory. Furthermore, 3D games are potentially more helpful, because they require spatial navigation and result in more learning. I want to get/make some way for him to play games, but it needs to be super accessible for him (both the system and the specific games). Any issues or frustrations getting the system to work will likely cause him to give up on it.  Does anyone have any suggestions for games? I was thinking about certain “walking simulator” games, because they are not action-oriented but still have the player navigating a 3D space while also telling an engaging story.  I don’t know of any game system that exists that would be accessible enough for him, so I would probably have to build something custom. My first thought was a retropie, but I don’t think they would be able to play the more recent 3D titles. Any suggestions here would be appreciated. I really want to do something productive to help him and potentially others. Thanks!	0
So my mother is fast losing her short term memory. Nothing has been diagnosed but I think soon it will need it. I don't know if it's Alzheimer's or dementia but I'm finding her company is exhausting constantly repeating things I said a couple minutes ago and her having zero recollection of things we have been doing. The exhaustion I feel is coming from the digging deep for my patience. I am and have always been a person who doesn't talk for the sake of talking so repeating myself is hard.   I understand how hard/frustrating this may be for her but when myself and my father try to give her strategies to help she refuses to listen and then also of course she forgets.  I guess I'm looking for a vent but I'd love to hear about people's coping mechanisms...this is so hard to deal with and it's really bringing my mental health to a very low level. Any advice, tips would be highly appreciated!	0
I have noticed cognitive decline in my nan for a few years after my grandads passing. She struggles to uphold a conversation, particularly because she is hard of hearing but mostly because she doesn’t understand some things she used to understand.  As anyone who has little knowledge on neurodegenerative diseases would do I asked her to draw a clock.  Her clock was a circle with the number 4 in the middle.   I asked her again a little later and her clock was a circle with a U shape in the middle.   I have told my dad to get her to the doctors but he won’t listen to me, she is also afraid of being put in a mental health hospital again so she would refuse to go.   Please can someone advise what to do	0
My mom went out this morning like she does every day. Usually my father is alert but this time he fell asleep. When he woke up my mom wasn't home yet so he checked her location with an app and she was far from home. He called her and explained how to come back. She came back with no issues but she had pooped herself. My theory is that she found every store closed because it's Christmas so she got confused and kept walking.  Anyway this is the first time this happens and it breaks my heart. Fortunately she likes taking her phone everywhere. I think she feels safe with it and my father always checks her location.   Some extreme measures are coming :(  Merry Christmas everyone!	0
I’ll try to keep this brief…. Basically one of my parents is genetically prone to Alzheimer’s, has had some stressful triggers in their life and has shown a few other symptoms like forgetfulness, spacing out, repeating themselves etc.   However one thing they tend to do is this really intense, but glassy stare. Growing up I had a bad relationship with them… but have restored it a bit. I want to be warm to them… but they just stare at me so intensely that I feel uncomfortable or even terrified… it’s like their eyes pierce my skin, I’m about to get in trouble, or it’s not my parent… like it’s almost as if I’m viewing a stranger when they give me this look. Their eyes scare me now basically…  Is this common to anyone? Any tips on how to get over it?	0
I grew up with my grandparents and love them very much. Since they live at the countryside I can only visit them when I'm on vacation. My grandfather's Alzheimers and Parkinson have worsened this year. My grandmother takes care of him but it's getting really difficult because he's also getting very snappy.   Because of his Alzheimers he keeps forgetting where he put his stuff so since beginning of the year he's convinced that there's an imaginary neighbor's kid who's camping inside of his house and waiting for him to let his guard down so he can steal things like his glasses, tv remote and snacks. My grandmother keeps telling him that there's no robber but he won't listen. It's very painful to me because he's mentally not doing well since nobody in our family believes him.   It has come to the point where he refuses to sleep and live his life. He just sits in a room waiting to catch the robber. Now he wants to install cameras and i don't know how to talk to him or handle the situation because I don't want him to think that he's crazy but also don't want to encourage him. I'm one of the only few people he trusts since I have a lot of patience with him and don't want to ruin that.	0
Mom lives in a skilled nursing facility. Over the last few months she has been having behavioral issues (not my term) like going into other residents rooms and taking their things, being verbally abusive, making threats of violence, and on several occasions hitting staff and other residents. They put her on depakote which turned her into a zombie. After 3 weeks she adjusted to the dose and we had a few visits where she was much more present with me, even called me by my name. I could see that she was still agitated, standing up like she was going to go somewhere then laying back down repeatedly. This week her verbal abuse began again and she took a swipe at one nurse. So again the are upping her dose. Does anyone here have experience with this drug? Are there alternatives? For the first time in 10 years I feel like I can’t find a solution to a problem. Thanks	0
"Mom is mid-stage (Good days, Stage 4, bad days, exhibits some Stage 6) and this month, she used up all of her checks.  We have FPOA & manage her finances. We let her keep the checkbook to ease the losing independence transition as she's not pleased about how much we've ""taken over her life."" It was no big deal for a long time, she mostly just sends birthday checks to grandkids, but over the last year as her condition progressed, she was writing checks to shady charities (looking at you, Fund to ""Save"" Social Security) and ordering supplements toting miracle cures. Last year's tally was about $2500 in bad faith charity donations & about $6k in supplements.  Since she ran out of checks a couple of weeks ago, we'd stalled, hoping she'd forget about it. But she's getting more insistent. We don't want to order more for her because $7-10k a year to con artists is hard to stomach, both financially & emotionally.  Has anyone else come up with a good solution for this?  We talked about ordering some generic checks online that aren't linked to her bank account & tell family to let us know when they get one & we'll venmo them. And while I am personally totally fine with sending fake checks to the supplement & charity scams, I'm worried it could be construed as fraud unless we figure out a way to make it clear the checks aren't legal tender, which she might notice if we print that on the checks.  Holding her mail isn't an option, unfortunately. She puts her mail in a postal box on her walking route."	0
Not physically of course.   I work as a cleaner and I clean at an elderly womans house who has the disease. While I'm there workers come to make sure she has lunch and takes her pills.  &#x200B;   Anyway today the person came and helped her fix the plate but she kept saying she wasn't hungry. The woman was not having it. She didn't yell or anything and I get she only has so much time there but she was like 'no you are going to sit down and eat'. Really treating her like a 4 year old. Do they not know when they are hungry or something?   I clean for around 3 hours and I can see that the woman is not completely out of it or anything like that. Is it normal to not let her decide things? I mean shes a grown woman not a child. I noticed her daughter does the same thing.	0
 Edit: my father passed away at 3:13 am holding my mother’s hand while my brother, sister and I were laying down five feet away. Collectively, we spent three days camped out in this room. Thank you for all your kind words and comments.   Original post:  Alzheimer's/dementia runs in my father's side of the family. My grandfather died from it, albeit, gradually over 20 years. He was docile and kind the entire span of his life. So when my father, then 71, was diagnosed with mild cognitive decline 3 years ago, we very much expected him to take a similar course. That is absolutely not what has happened.  He declined so rapidly we could barely keep up. 5 months ago we finally chose (after touring dozens) a specialty Alzheimer's care center for him to go and live. He moved in and his memory and behavioral issues advanced. He began to become aggressive when his diaper was being changed or he needed to be washed, or put in new clothes. Soon after this began, his aggression became more and more frequent, until he had an incident in which he struck out at a nurse.  The care center put him in an ambulance and sent him to the hospital, who called us to inform us that my dad was in the ER. They submitted him to the Psychiatrics ward in order to try and balance his meds and find a proper combination of antipsychotics that would allow him to continue living life in a comfortable manner. I should note, he was physically healthy. Big guy, just slightly overweight, had worked outside his entire life. The doctors said he might be there for a week, and due to Covid, no visitors were allowed.  A week passed and the doctors were very transparent about informing us of all the different drug cocktails they were trying. None were working. He was still aggressive while nurses were performing CARES and it often took 3-4 people to restrain him. One week turned into two, and eventually five. At the end of the 5th week, they suddenly permitted my mom and older sister to visit him for one hour. We were puzzled. The next day they asked for a meeting and explained to us that there was nothing they had tried that worked, and no care center would take him back in this state. They explained that over the last five weeks he had fallen very deep into the dementia, and insisted that the best option was to begin heavy sedation, rendering the body unable to eat or drink until it shuts down. My mother, as power of attorney, agreed to this. They gave us each one hour to visit and say goodbye while he was still alert and began the sedation the next day. This was one week ago.  He has not eaten or drank for at least six whole days and we have been by his bedside for almost 48 hours. There have been so many moments where we just question, over and over again, how this is legal, and this is the only solution. Aren't we literally killing him by sedating him to death? Has anyone else had this experience? Please shed some light on this for me.	0
Hi, so long story short, my grandma currently has Alzheimer's, and my mom and I have also lost a dear family friend who was also like a grandma to her to Alzheimer's a few years back. I'd wanted to donate to the Alzheimer's Foundation for a while and in November, I was able to raise a lot of money that I will be donating.   Here's where I need advice: My mom has had a harder time with this than I have and has been more directly affected, so I want to make this donation special to honor everything my mom has done to support the two women in our lives who have had it and to honor my grandma and our family friend.   I'm not sure of the etiquette of this and I don't want it to be interpreted wrong. When I first ran the idea by my brother, his immediate reaction was 'Well Gram isn't dead. Don't you do this stuff after they die?' and now I'm unsure of the best way to go about anything. I know 'In Honor of' is different than 'In Memory of' but if both names are on it then will that be interpreted wrong?   I'm probably overthinking it all, as I do with most things, but I've never done anything like this and I don't want to mess something up.	0
My mom called today and said there was a man in the house she did not recognize.  I asked if it was my Dad and she responded by saying her Dad has been dead for years. I asked if the man in the house was ****, my Dads name, and she had no idea how I knew him.    My heart sank and I’m finally having to face how bad her memory has become.  This is brand new to me and I have no idea how to deal with this.  Please provide any and all advice you can; I would really appreciate it	0
I’m caring for my grandmother this winter and while doctors have not given her a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s she has some pretty serious memory problems.   Her husband died this summer and it took her a very long while to be able to remember that for more than a few minutes at a time. They were married for 50 years and became very codependent so his passing has been extremely hard for her to deal with.   I am not able to live with her during most of the year meaning that she is often alone for most of the day. I have begun to monitor her when she uses the computer because she routinely enters google searches like “find *husband’s name*” and ends up on very risky “background check” websites. I am fairly lost concerning what to do because I don’t want her to be taken advantage of but I also don’t want to put up a sticky note reminding her because every time she is told about his passing she shuts down for hours at a time. She also would remove any sort of note in order to “tidy up.” I am also unable to place parental controls on the internet browser as she still uses the AOL desktop application which removed parental controls in 2017.  I am very worried about her because, as mentioned I will not be able to be with her all day starting in the spring and the rest of my family works during the day. My father (the power of attorney) has also been highly resistant to getting some form of home healthcare because he greatly underestimates the amount of care needed (because he has never had to care for her).  I really don’t know what to do so any advice is much appreciated. Thank you and have a great day!  Edit: Thank you all for your suggestions and encouragement. My mom is planning to bring the family together and talk about how we can improve my grandmother’s care. Wish us luck that the meeting goes well!	0
My mom has Alzheimer's and in early November was placed in assisted living.    The issue: in October my brother had his attorney draw up a POA, which she signed and this was witnessed by 2 people.  His attorney claims this was legal to do.  Mom can't remember things past a 15 minute timespan.  The POA she signed gives him complete control, that is, he is not a conservator for her estate.    He now is acting like the house and all her items are his to dispose of as he pleases.   For example, after eating dinner at the local diner, he offered her items to the waitress.    As her money pays for her nursing home care, these items should be sold, not given away.  When I pointed this out, he got super angry at me, told me to get out, then called the police on me when I didn't (and yes,  the cops came and told me to leave, which I did).  I don't think he's acting in her behalf as she would wish.    Shouldn't someone with POA work in the interests of the trust?   Does an absolute POA grant the power to change her will/trust?  Ugh, he has all the money so I'm unsure if I could even afford to contest his POA.     Thank you in advance for any advice and *thank you*.	0
Any advice on dishwashers? My dad loves to putter in the kitchen loading or unloading the dishwasher, cleaning counters, and hand washing large items. It's been his job since I was a kid. Mom would cook and dad would clean.  Recently, I noticed him putting dirty items into the clean dishwasher. And mom caught him trying to put dirty items back in the cupboard.   I would hate to take this activity away from it because it seems to give him purpose and he seems to enjoy puttering for hours over a 10 minute cleanup. :)  I bought one of those clean/dirty signs but I'm pretty sure he isnt capable of reading/comprehending it. Should my mom or myself stand in the kitchen with him like a drill Sargeant inspecting his work? Should we tell him we will be doing it from now on? Find him another activity every time he tries to do dishes? Switch to paper plates? Is there such a thing as a dishwasher lock?	0
Hi Everyone,  I'm sure I'm not the only one finding the lead up to Christmas especially hard, does anyone have any suggestions with how to cope?   My husband and I live in a different state to my parents and now that we're staying with them I'm finding it really upsetting to see how much Dad has declined over the last year.  Dad always asks where I see myself in 10 years' time and usually I give really elaborate answers. Today I responded by asking where he saw himself in 10 years and he said that he didn't think he'd be around. I got so upset that I burst into tears and asked him not to say that. He patted me on the shoulder and said that it would be okay but he'd had a nice life and we all had our time.  He has a few other conditions and I had this horrible moment of realisation that he probably won't be here for too much longer.   Even though I'm in my thirties, I don't feel ready to live without my father. What strategies do people have to avoid getting so upset?   x	0
I mean no disrespect by asking this question, I tried googling it at length but found nothing. I know someone who was diagnosed recently at only 60 following a stroke after years of alcohol abuse and well I am wondering what the future holds for him. This is someone I’ve been interested in for a long time and now I fear it may never happen for us. Thank you	0
My paternal grandmother had Alzheimer’s disease.   My dad has Alzheimer’s disease.  My basic readings suggest that this terrible disease can have a large genetic factor.  What are some concrete steps to prevent its onset in children of a parent with Alzheimer’s.	0

"TL/DR - I'm very nervous on how the actual drop off is going to go down and I would appreciate any stories or advice you may have.  &#x200B;  Hello all,  Mom has been deteriorating pretty rapidly and can't be left alone anymore. She has become more confused and irate than in my last post and I don't think I'm able to provide the care she needs anymore. I've made a couple visits to facilities and will keep researching until I find the right fit (slightly overwhelmed in the different ways they provide care). However, while I'm searching I have also been feeling out how her reaction will be - and it does not bode well. Two weeks ago I took her to a doctor appointment and she asked ""You're not going to leave me here, are you?"" Which of course just crushed me knowing I will be leaving her somewhere soon. We had a great conversation last week where she was initially sad about the idea of moving to a care facility, but then came around. She became slightly optimistic and was at least interested in learning more. Unfortunately, that conversation did not stick. She has since mentioned that she will refuse to go anywhere else and once threatened to kill herself first. She's been experiencing a lot of emotional outbursts lately and I really have to be careful how I speak with her to avoid any issues. I really wanted this to be a mutual decision, or at least with her understanding slightly what was happening but at this point I think I'm going to have to surprise her. Which really sucks.   So with all that - how did it go with you? Did you pretend the facility was something else? Did they read the sign in the parking lot and flip out? Did you stay for a while or leave immediately? I've heard that it's recommended to not visit for a couple of weeks so that they can get adjusted to the change.   Thank you in advance!"	0
I’m looking for some advice or personal experience maybe? My mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s two years ago and moved into a memory care home three months ago. She has had a hard time adjusting - says her life is over, she can’t believe her kids did this to her, everyone steals from her there. It’s actually a very nice place and we all visit often (there are three of us within an hours drive and we all go weekly).  I’m the youngest, I am married with a 7 year old daughter and very apprehensive about bringing mom home for Christmas. I know how awful that sounds. We brought her home for a weekend and it was a disaster by the second day. We brought her to my home again for Thanksgiving and she just ends up spiraling and crying and saying her life is over and she wants to die. The thought of my mom waking up alone on Christmas morning makes me ill, but the thought of having our first Christmas in our house be so chaotic and upsetting also makes me ill. I don’t even know if she would care that it’s Christmas. Am I making this more than it is because of my own guilt? It’s very upsetting for my daughter when my mom gets so upset and says the things she says. It’s a long story but my other siblings aren’t really willing to bring her “home” so it always falls on me. I feel so conflicted and just plain sad.	0
I posted a comment here recently in which I mentioned my mother's upcoming neurology visit and MRI. I'm a nine-hour car ride away, so I couldn't be there for the appointments, but my stepfather tells me the doctor enrolled her in a clinical trial. He couldn't give me many specifics other than that it involved an IV medication taken monthly. According to information available on her neurologist's website, the study is for Donanemab.  Is that typical for early stage Alzheimer's? I mean, I love science, but I also want to stave this off as long as possible. I have concerns that this is because Mom and has junk insurance until she's eligible for Medicare at age 65 (July), and her plan won't cover anything else right now. I'll save my rant about US healthcare for another time.  Thank you. :)	0
Dad has a mild case of Alzheimers and is considered to be a candidate for Aduhelm.  I know there is some controversy around the FDA's approval of this drug and side effects.  Can anyone advise if they know of anyone who has had a positive experience with Aduhelm?	0
My grandmother passed away about a week ago from her long fight with Alzheimer’s. Her and my grandfather were married for 62 years. Before her passing he would have slight hiccups in his mind (usually at night time but nothing serious). But he cannot retain the information that she has passed away. Is he subconsciously blocking it out? Every day multiple times a day he asks where she is. As his family, it becomes overwhelming and heartbreaking having to keep reminding him and see him react as if it’s his first time hearing of it. Has anyone else experienced this? Is the grief of her loss effecting his memory?	0
Almost a year ago, my grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. She’s young, only 72. We drew up some durable financial POA papers, making my mother her POA and listing me as a secondary if my mother fails to perform her duties.  Around the time she was diagnosed my uncle started asking her to give him one of her twelve acres to put a mobile home on. We did a little research, realized how much she could end up losing and said no. He had a pretty big fit. My mom told him to please not ask for anything from my grandmother because with her Alzheimer’s it isn’t right.   Over the last six months, my uncle has poisoned my grandmothers thoughts. He has convinced her that she doesn’t really have Alzheimer’s and that my mother is tricking her. He says my mother, who works in healthcare, got her “cronies” at the hospital to lie. My grandmothers Alzheimer’s has progressed so rapidly and she believes him. She’s very angry with my mother and has even created more paranoid ideas about her.   Friday night, my mother went to visit my grandmother and check on things. She does this every Friday and arranges her medicine. My grandmother told her that my uncle took her to the mobile home place and she signed the papers. Mom blew up and my granny told her to get out. She told her she knows she’s tricking her, she doesn’t have Alzheimer’s and she doesn’t want anything to do with her. She said my uncle took her to see “a man” who changed it so that he will get everything when she is gone, and mom will get nothing.   My mother says she is done. She is very stressed out and doesn’t want to be responsible for her anymore. I wish that was not the case, but I also understand that she is overwhelmed. I told her that I will take over now.   So here is my plan. Please tell me if I am doing the right thing. And if you have any wisdom please share it.   Tomorrow morning I am reporting my uncle for elder abuse. I am calling the mobile home business as well to notify them that she has Alzheimer’s and they cannot move forward. I will also call and make an appointment with an elder law attorney. I need the attorney to either remove my mother and make me the primary POA, or ask a judge to choose a conservator for my grandmother.   Is there anything I am missing? Does that all sound correct to you? I just want to make sure she is taken care of. She is so young and I’m afraid we could have a very long road ahead. I live 2 hours away and just had a baby 3 months ago (who despises car rides) so I can’t be with her right now. I’m hoping that when the time comes for her to need full time care (which seems to be drawing near) maybe I can get her into a nice assisted living facility where I live so I can look after her and be with her. I’m scared for her.   Also, I know that reporting my uncle has to be the right thing to do, but I’m worried that she will not be allowed to talk to him anymore. That would be devastating for her. He is an absolute monster for doing this, but she loves him and I’m afraid she won’t understand.  Any advice or encouragement would be so appreciated.	0
My grandpa has been getting worse recently and calls me all hours of the day. It has gotten worse recently and my schedule is pretty packed with my masters program, internship, and work. He calls me any hour of the day or night and it disrupts my sleep as well. I feel bad for not being able to talk but I’ve explained my schedule multiple times and he has my schedule next to his calendar. Is there any way to help this?  Thanks in advance.	0
My aunt has had a dramatic personality change in the last 5 years. She’s 59, no medical history besides depression (on an SSRI), college-educated, works in consulting, and lived an upper middle class lifestyle while raising 3 kids with her husband. About 5 years ago, she divorced my uncle stating she wasn’t in love with him anymore. Their family has lived several states away my entire life but about a year ago, she impulsively decided to move back to her home state (where I live as well as the rest of our extended family). As such, I’ve been spending much more time with her. Here are some weird things I’ve noticed:   - horrible with finances, bought a nice home here that she cannot afford payments on, can’t afford car payments, talks about waiting for payday very often. She is still working as a consultant - two separate car accidents within a year. Both single-vehicle incidents and involved crashing into the median. Couldn’t provide her location to a family member after the first accident but she was on a common highway and should’ve known where she was. First crash totaled her car, second resulted in needing all new tires  - doesn’t remember the names of two cats she adopted a year ago. Each time they’re brought up she gives different names. It is not an act and she is not concerned about this  - obsessed with dating. On every dating website and spends an excessive amount of time on them. Romanticizes every interaction she has with men (including mailman, security system repair man) - doesn’t speak much when in a group. Almost seems like she’s having trouble following the conversation  - her home is very messy, her dog is always so dirty and smelly  - overall aloof and has expressed no concern about any of these situations, talking with her always just seems off   All of these examples are out of character for her. I’m in med school so have brought up my concerns to my parents. Her paternal grandma had typical Alzheimer’s but mom is healthy at 81, dad was killed at age 42. She also has a 24 y/o son with Bipolar II. I’m particularly worried about her lack of awareness of the issues. It seems like early-onset Alzheimer’s to me but looking for outside input. Does this behavior remind you of your experience? Any other signs I should look for? Would love to hear anyone’s thoughts.	0
Hello All...  Maybe some of you can help me. My mother in law was diagnosed with Alzheimers about two years ago. She lives a couple states away from us (about a two hour plane ride), and we are her closest family geographically. She has insisted on staying in that state, and now she is enrolled in a state funded program that covers the costs of her memory care facility/all other medical expenses. At this point it would be very difficult to relocate her to our state, as she is very fragile, and would become ineligible for the program covering her costs.  She recently began to decline and went to the hospital. She had very low blood pressure, had lost a lot of weight, and doctor's think she had a stroke. She is not eating much at all, is refusing food, and is rapidly losing weight/strength. The doctor's will not put it a feeding tube as they say she is still of sound mind and can make her own choices. My husband panicked and flew to see her in the hospital and has been successful getting her to eat some bites of things. He is afraid that if he leaves, she will stop eating again. At this point, he is willing to fly to her every few days to feed her, but this is not sustainable for us. Flying is very expensive, and we have young kids, and no help nearby. I know he wants to make sure he does everything in his power to help his mom survive as long as possible, but I'm not sure what to do about this. Anyone have thoughts/suggestions?	0
My mom just moved to memory care from assisted living a week ago. We set up her room, tried to make it homey. For the last 5 nights, my mom has had falls trying to get out of bed in the middle of the night. EMS has been called. We went to the ER one night. All labs were normal and the CT scans showed no trauma. The problem is it keeps happening and I’m worried she’s going to break something. She goes to bed way too early, like 5 pm. I’ve asked the staff to try to keep her up, but they said they can’t stop her from going to bed early? They recommended a hospital bed. Does that help? I got no slip socks but she won’t keep them on. Got her a no slip fall mat too. Her primary care doctor has not been helpful. Still waiting to hear back from her memory care doctor. Has anyone else had this issue? Any recommendations or ideas?	0
Hi there.  I'm wanting to get opinions on a gift idea for my MIL who has been diagnosed with Alzheimers. She currently lives about a thousand miles away from my family and my spouse is her only child. Her birthday is a few days before christmas, so I was considering making a special album for her with pictures and descriptions of everyone. It will include current pictures of our family (with her two grandkids) as well as some other pictures that my spouse has from childhood.   Would this make a good gift, or do you think it could possibly upset her? She has good days where she knows us all, and other days where she doesn't remember her mom or my spouse.  Thanks for your help and advice!	0
Is it just me. I’ve figured out all the mirrors, windows and glass fronted pictures in the house. So I can stand in a lot of places and check on grandma through reflections in the building. E.g. I can see what they’re watching on TV from my bedroom. I can see they’re asleep when on the bog. And can see them in the kitchen when doing the laundry. Am I being over protective?	0
My father in law has a tendency to take off as soon as my mother in law leaves the room.  He's 80, alzheimer's diagnosis was 8 years ago.  Is the a way to keep him in his chair when she needs to use the bathroom?  Something like a seat belt for a recliner.	0

Viagra is the brand name of sildenafil.  Researchers then used a database of claims from more than 7 million people in the US to examine the relationship between sildenafil and Alzheimer’s disease outcomes by comparing sildenafil users to non-users.  They found sildenafil users were 69% less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease than non-sildenafil users after six years of follow-up.""  and later they caution:   “Importantly, this research doesn’t prove that sildenafil is responsible for reducing dementia risk, or that it slows or stops the disease. The only way to test this would be in a large-scale clinical trial measuring sildenafil effect against the usual standard of care.”   Other articles today say that getting cataract surgery was associated with a 30% reduced risk of alzheimer's   [https://www.upi.com/Health\_News/2021/12/06/alzheimers-disease-viagra-sildenafil-cataract-surgery-study/8981638800935/](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2021/12/06/alzheimers-disease-viagra-sildenafil-cataract-surgery-study/8981638800935/)  From the article:     In more than 3,000 participants 65 years old and older, 853 developed dementia, with 709 cases of Alzheimer's disease, the data showed.  Approximately half of the participants had cataract surgery, and those who had the procedure in either eye were about 30% less likely to develop any form of dementia over at least the next 10 years, the researchers said.  Vision loss has been associated with an increased risk for all forms of dementia, due at least in part to its effect on independence and quality of life, so surgery to correct it may help keep older adults active and mentally engaged, according to the researchers."	0

I just wanted to rant because I’m so frustrated and angry at my grandfather. He is 91 years old and has bragged (after a few drinks) that he has managed to acquire a million dollars through saving and investments. My grandmother is mid-late stage at 88 years old. They still live alone. My parents and aunt worked to get a part time caretaker and he didn’t give her any tasks to do and refused to bring in another caretaker.   We found assisted living and memory care facilities they could go together. My grandmother fell about a month ago and had to be in the hospital for 6 days. She is becoming incontinent, and she cannot walk without a lot of help. She rarely remembers anything that happened five minutes before. They only eat okay because the rest of the family brings prepared meals they can reheat. They sit and watch movies all day in a dark room. A healthy young person is incapable of providing all the care she needs, let alone a 91 year old man. He CAN AFFORD BETTER and chooses not to so he can pass on an inheritance to his children who have been getting by without his money for years just fine. I am horrified watching him mistreat his wife of over 60 years when he could easily afford the care she needs to live out her remaining years with some semblance of dignity.   I’ve talked to him about it repeatedly, sent other resources, got other opinions, and he just says he’ll take it into consideration and does nothing. I call them both to chat multiple times a week but I live halfway across the country and it feels so hopeless knowing there is nothing else I can do to help my grandma.	0
Just wondering- anyone have a parent diagnosed when they were a young child? And had to live with them during the progression of their Illness?  My dad was diagnosed when I was in the 5th grade. Rapidly declined while I was in 6-8 grade and lived at home. Put in nursing home 9th grade. Died in 10th grade. I am 33 years old now and just now learning how this trauma has affected me in to adulthood. Living with a parent that was sick in the way he was was horrible. Wondering if anyone else experienced this? Most stuff I see is young kids with a grandparent with alz.	0
My mom has Alzheimer’s and it’s reached the point of delusions and hygiene issues. Getting her to bathe or put on new under wear is difficult because she is uncomfortable undressing, especially in front of my dad who is her primary caretaker and he’s at a loss. She seems to think men are coming into the house and stealing her underwear and laughing at her her but she keeps hiding it or throwing it away. She can’t be convinced otherwise and trying to reassure her doesn’t work either. So beyond buying new underwear every couple of weeks I don’t know what to do. I wash her hair in the sink and use wipes for her underarms. I can convince her to get in the tub maybe twice a week but she won’t wash her hair or clean herself just sit there.   I’ve considered the disposable adult underwear because she does have some incontinence issues but won’t use her pads anymore cause she thinks “the guys will laugh at her.”   Any hygiene or delusions tips would be great this is a new stage I’m struggling with   Sorry if this isn’t the right space for this question, I just love my mom and want to maintain her dignity and cleanliness for as long as possible.  Edit: also going to talk to her doctors about antipsychotics or I’ve read good things about Nuplazid/Pimavanserin for the the delusions, studies are promising there. I’ll comment back if any progress there	0
Hi all. My dad’s mother is currently battling Alzheimer’s. It’s definitely been a challenge but we’re managing. We’re able to keep her laughing, which helps.   My fear comes from the fact that my mother’s great grandmother had the disease, as well. With  it running on both sides of the family, I worry for my parents and their future. I also am worried about my own.   Coping with losing the woman my grandma used to be is very difficult. It’s harder to think this could be passed on to either (or both) of my parents. This may be a very selfish way of thinking. I just really want to know if anyone has experienced these fears or has any information on the genetic side of it all?	0
I received some very bad news today, that made me extremely sad. My mother, who it’s hard to even call her that anymore, seemed to have a moment of being able to relate on some level, and tried to comfort me. Which was nice and much needed.  The problem is, she’s not my mother anymore. All her worst characteristics have become so enormously magnified, to the point where sometimes, I feel as if I’m being gaslighted in my own home. It’s so bad, that I wonder if she is feigning frailty and a bad memory. I know how bad this sounds, trust me.  This news was confidential from a family member. I told her it was not to be discussed or repeated (I also know how stupid THAT sounds, telling someone with Swiss cheese for brains that you must or must not do anything…). If I hadn’t been so distraught, I would have never had this interaction with her. Anyone whose parent lives with them knows how hard it is to remember that this Alzheimer’s person isn’t the person that you used to know as your parent.  In the short time I had left to go to an appointment, she had called the family member to talk about this thing, breaking my trust with this family member. I do not know how to fix this. I just now know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the mother I once knew is gone forever. No more confidante, friend, or source of comfort. Just a shell with some automatic nerves firing that make her do things that make everyone a tiny bit more crazy than they would be otherwise. I apologize if I sound a little over the top. I have no other outlet for venting the pain and emotion that come from daily living this nightmare.	0
After many good conversations with family and friends, I've come to the point where condolences and a willing ear are enough for me to work through what's happening.  **Can anyone recommend how they were able to work through and process an immediate family member's decline?**  I'm 34 and I've been dealing with her decline for a few years now (which is relatively young to be watching your mom slip away).  I've realized there are some things I haven't quite worked through or gotten over regarding the situation and they're taking their toll on my life (escapism, avoidance, substance abuse, depression, guilt, resentment, indecision, etc.)  I'm willing to try whatever it takes (books, therapy, groups, whatever).  Thank you.	0

she’s recently diagnosed. we didn’t even know she was diagnosed because she wouldn’t tell us. i was the first family member she forgot about.  for context, i live with my grandma. i went downstairs to get breakfast and my entire family was there. my grandma asked who i was and i immediately knew she wasn’t joking.   i think it might’ve been an episode because later i asked if she knew who i was (which upon reading this subreddit i now know i shouldn’t do i think?) and she said my name and that i’m her granddaughter. i haven’t stopped crying though. it’s getting bad.  i don’t even know if she actually remembers me or if she feels bad and is pretending.  i feel so much pain just from this one instance. i don’t know how you all can manage.   do you guys know any resources or places that can educate me more on alzheimer’s? thank you all so much for your help.	0
Hi everyone,   I have been working hard over the past two or three weeks to arrange residential aged care for my mother, who at first  was dead set against it. She has been in hospital for two months due to a huge delirium eposide followed by the diagnosis of her Alzheimers and other health issues and the doctors would not let her go home, saying she now needs 24/7 nursing care She has severe COPD, a movement disorder which makes her fall, incontinence and now Alzheimers.  She got accepted today to a really great place  - perfect for her. She even agreed on this choice (from the brochures) and was looking forward to getting out of hospital. She was due to go on Monday.  Then today the hospital called and said she has a COPD exacerbation, which is being treated with antibiotics and they are hoping it will improve by Monday.....but they are not sure if it will ever get better - it could turn into pneumonia or they just might not be able to get on top of it. They gave me the 'talk' about how much we think they should treat her and all that goes with it. We hope it doesn't come to that. This doctor was hopeful that because her oxygen levels haven't changed that she will rally, but oh boy, she sure knows how to throw a curve ball!  Thanks for reading. Not sure what I am feeling right now.	0
My grandma has moderate Alzheimer’s and recently she has been telling everyone she can’t breathe. After 7+ visits to the doctor and the emergency room this past week, she was given a machine for oxygen. However, she still states she can’t seem to catch her breathe and she insists that the machine isn’t working correctly. She was without oxygen for a few hours yesterday but had no idea that the temporary tank they gave her ran out.  (She was fine during this time and didn’t complain) she keeps insisting on going back to emergency to which the we doctors tell me that she is fine and that her oxygen levels are fine. I could really use some advice as we are all out of ideas. TIA	0
it's constant. she cannot walk on her own, and they've put her on Ativan 2x day and a sleeping med at night, but every waking moment she is trying to get up and (if I help her stand) immediately sitting down again. I don't know how to help her feel more comfortable. I'm just at a loss and she's so agitated. she can't remember why she wants to get up but she wants to get up literally every waking second. has anyone else had a similar experience?	0
"My grandma was crying again just before because of general confusion and I gave her a long hug, and just kept saying ""You're okay, it's okay. It's going to be okay."" So I put on The Wizard of Oz, which always seems to cheer her up. She saw it in theaters in 1939, when she was seven years old. She became a lifelong fan of Judy Garland. Just last year, around this time, she watched it and loved it. The next day, she was sad and said ""I want to watch The Wizard of Oz again.""   2021 has been a devastating year for her. Around April, it was becoming more and more obvious to all of us that she was hitting a new stage. Now, I'm just feeling so awful. I was saying at the beginning ""Look grandma. It's The Wizard of Oz. Your favorite movie."" No reaction. One good thing was when Judy Garland was singing Somewhere Over the Rainbow, I said ""It's Judy Garland."" She smiled and said ""Yes! You like her?"" I said yes. But for most of it during the first 20 minutes, she wasn't into it. In fact she just said ""This on the picture, it's cute. But it's enough."" Then she wanted to go back upstairs. This has got to be the cruelest disease in the world."	0

Our mom has Alzheimer's. It seems to be progressing pretty fast. She pretty much needs 24 hour assistance. She currently lives in a small town with a friend of many years. This friend has become her default caretaker. We have arranged someone else to come in 3 days per week to help with showering and housework as well as to give the other lady a break now and then. Both my mom and her friend are in their late 70s to early 80s. It has become evident that her friend is no longer able to provide the supervision necessary for my mom, and living in a small town there are no good options to get her competent 24 hour care.   We are currently starting the process of fixing up the house next to my brother's house. He bought it a while back and was planning on renting it out. Our plans were to move her in there which is closer to a big city and we should be able to get competent help as well as having her close to my brother and his wife, me and my wife, and my brother's daughter and her husband and child. She also loves animals and would be able to spend time with my brother's dogs and I would take mine over to visit on weekends.   We just recently found that she has been trying to roam at night. I had to put up door chimes because she went outside naked at 4 am. I then found out today that when her and her friend were at the hair salon she went to the bathroom and walked back out naked. She should not have been going to the bathroom alone anyway, but it happened.   I am starting to question whether 24 hour home care would be better than moving her into a memory clinic. They are set up for people with dementia and I am hoping would be able to work better with her doctor to treat symptoms and recognize symptomatic behavior than a non medical home care giver. They also have a routine and she would be around people in a similar situation, so she might not feel so embarrassed all of the time.   She recently inherited enough money to pay for any care that we decide to go with assuming she is not some anomaly that lives to be well past 100.  I would prefer to move her into the house and be able to visit whenever we want and feel like she had some independence, but I am concerned that this inclination, much like letting her stay in her house with her friend caring for her is what is easier and will make me feel less guilty, not that it is what is best for her.   I also worry that making the decision to put her in the clinic is more or less because it would be cheaper than 24 hour at home care and once it was done, would be less work and decision making on our part.   We need some unbiased input. I am looking for a doctor that specializes in memory care in our area and hope to see if they will give any input, but for now thought I would ask here.  Thank you if you read all the way through, and doubly so if you have any input.	0
I am her POA. I was allowing her to keep her physical credit card but she keeps losing it and her drivers license. They are somewhere in her apartment but I can't find either and neither can she. I hate to do it but I think I will report her credit card lost, and then keep the new one and only order her groceries online. She also keeps losing her cash, her wallet, etc.  How have you guys gone about this without making the person with AD hate you? I already feel like her AD has ruined my relationship with her. I took away her car, I made her move into senior living like her doctor suggested, etc.  I'm so sick of being the bad guy.	0
My mom cared for my grandma who passed away from Alzheimers a number of years ago and now I have the honor of caring for my mom as she navigates her own bout.   Oddly, the techniques I use to help my mom, I learned from her as she cared for my grandma.   A thought I have, that always makes my eyes well up is that if she was totally aware of what was happening now, she'd be super proud of how I'm caring for her and would probably laugh at all the goofy stuff she says and does because of this disease.   For those of us that are caring for our parents, I hope you know they're proud of you too.	0
Hi all - my name is Lisa and I'm reaching out to share a giveaway that's currently open for entries by Nations Photo Lab for 50 free Custom Memory Books.  The books are intended to be given to a loved one with Alzheimer's, with the idea that photos can help stimulate memories.  As someone who watched three of four grandparents suffer from Alzheimer's, I hope these books can help spark a little joy to whoever needs it most.

Having suffered watching family members be destroyed by this disease. How do you deal with the fear of or plan for what may happen to you.	0
Some days can be really, brilliantly, good. Today grandma was really talkative, even asking for her hearing aids (that she normally refuses). Did all the exercises without complaints.  Learned how to use the new TV remote. Ate at relatively sensible times, even made herself a snack when I was distracted on the phone. She remembered a friend is coming tomorrow so has to go to bed at a sensible time. When I made dinner, she gave me a big smile, said she knows she is awkward sometimes and thanked me for looking after her. I had to run off and have a happy cry…	0
My dad passed suddenly today. Yesterday we were told he wasn't eating much and today the same. Not an hour after I spoke to the hospice nurse, they called back to say my dad had passed. He was 71 and had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2018. We had just moved him to a new facility a little over two weeks ago after a tumultuous experience with his old facility. The hospice nurses were with my dad when he passed. Unfortunately I nor my mom were there as I am waiting to pick her up at the airport. I don't know how I'll tell her. She'll never forgive herself. Thank you for all the support. You all are lifesavers.	0
My father-in-law is starting to show signs of Alzheimer's. He keeps accusing my dog of peeing on the floor but my dog isn't. We tell him that the floor is dry and my dog didn't pee and my father-in-law yells at us and says we're accusing him of lieing. He gets really mad at us. How do I handle that? It's not the only thing he does that with.	0
Little bit of background: In early September of this year I became the primary caretaker for my uncle. I'd only met this man six times in my entire life, so it's been a whirlwind of change for everyone involved. He's been very independent in his life and despite being diagnosed with Alzheimers and moderate cognitive decline, he is living in his own studio apartment in a retirement community. As he progresses, I'm hoping he'll have enough money to move to their assisted living and then to their memory care. Well just have to see. Anyway, having had little contact with him over the years has presented a bit of a challenge as I don't know his routines, likes, etc. And his decline is much more readily apparent since he's been under my care because before he was living alone on a 20 acre property in a rural community and worked hard to keep himself together.   I recently put an Amazon Echo Dot in his apartment. It allows him to play music he likes, find out the weather, simple things like that. I've also been able to find out that he often asks if I'm safe and where I am, so I set up routines so when he asks those questions he gets answers that give him comfort. I also set up a calendar to include activities offered in his community, with reminders and information about the location of the activity. This has been helpful to remind him when he needs to meet my mom (his sister) for a ride to the doctor, when his beloved Cowboys play and on what channel, etc. Just a note that I changed the default wake word from Alexa to Ziggy because he can remember Ziggy much easier.   Yesterday I set things up so he can use the Echo to control his Christmas tree lights and his lamps by his couch. Next is the light in his ceiling fan and for Christmas I'll be setting up his television.  We still have issues with the product, but are finding this helps him maintain some independence, so I wonder if anyone else uses it and how it's used. Thanks!	0

When I was little I wept at the end of Mary Poppins, when she floated away. My mother found me and asked why I was so distraught, and I didn’t really know, until now. I have been watching my mother get smaller and smaller over the past 2 years. Today she could barely open her eyes and squeezed my hand. I think we are close to the end, she was Mary Poppins to me I loved her. The sky some how seems more empty without her.	0
Thanks everyone for your replies… my dad did apologize and I’m working on dealing with my sadness…  My parents and I have had a difficult relationship since I was a teenager due to my mother’s rage fits, which my father enabled. For many years they weren’t a part of my life and it was very hard. In the last ten years, I have reconnected with my dad and during the pandemic we became close, talking multiple times a week. More recently I am working on building a relationship with my mom. It is hard because I do get triggered around her, but things are getting better.   For the past few months, I’ve been going through a conflict with my parents where my feelings got very hurt. My father has been crappy to me and has hardly called. The conflict was about me trying to come and spend more time with them and how to pay for that. My mom and I worked it out.   Just now I was talking with my dad and explaining to him that my feelings were hurt by how he’s treated me. He said “well I was upset because you said some disturbing things about your mother.” What did I say? “You said you wished she was dead.”  I never have, and never would, say such a thing, particularly to my father. It killed me that he invented this memory about me (and no one else in the family) because I have been trying so hard to be there for him and be with him. I was also always the scapegoat for problems in our family. He has never said anything like this before or had an untrue memory before. Ithurts that I’m the first one. Looking for some support	0
Hey everyone, my dad has early onset alzheimers and we were looking for certain activities that help him with memory or basically just hobbies. Sudoku and puzzles didnt work well, so any ideas would be appreciated. Also, whoever is reading this who has a loved one with Alzheimers, or knows anyone who has it, you are not alone and focus on your loved one, not how awful the disease is, and you are not alone.  Edit- Wow, I was not expecting all of these helpful tips. Thanks to everyone!	0
My dad got his official Alzheimer’s diagnosis a few months ago after years of “generic” dementia. He lives with me in my home where I take care of him financially and also am his only caregiver. He can shower and feed himself right now but not much beyond that.   I’ve been given no POA, no medical proxy, nothing. He’s too sick/stubborn to see he needs help and yet I am entirely responsible for him. Currently I commute an 75 minutes each way so he can stay in this town but I want to move and I don’t want to be responsible for him anymore. My therapist is shocked I’ve done as much as I have when it’s causing me crippling depression and anxiety.   How do I get social services in? They’ve said I can’t call and request any services because I don’t have POA. I can’t get POA. I’ve spoken with the doctor and he said he can’t do much either. Sometimes, especially recently, I am tempted to leave him in the side of the road so a silver alert can be filed and he can get put in social services radar.   Right now I’m hemorrhaging money and time. I’ve given up jobs, relationships, and financial freedom to care for him and I can’t kick him out. He had zero retirement, savings, or assets.   At what point can I just say it’s too much for me and social services step in because I’m there. What would happen if he hadn’t already lived in my house I inherited when this all went down? I’m 100% alone and it’s beyond caregiver burn out. He needs to be someone else’s problem because he’s just mad at me for trying to take care of him.	0
My mother has early onset Alzheimer’s, she was diagnosed maybe 3ish years ago but has been exhibiting symptoms for maybe 5 years prior to her diagnosis. In the last 6 months she has had significant cognitive decline. I can see it really affecting my family, especially my father who at this stage is her main carer but still works a full time job.  Me and my sisters take turns and going over and spending time with her. Today I came over and she seems especially bad. She won’t get out of bed, she seems to have increased confusion and isn’t eating. She told me she threw up this morning and all she wants to do is sleep. I’m so worried about her and I’m also worried about my own mental health. Her decline has had a serious effect on my own person struggles with this terrible disease.  Can anyone lend any insight, advice or kind words to support and help me and my family?	0
I posted earlier about suggestions for a new tv remote for Dad & thanks to some great advice I got him a Flipper from the alzheimer's store.   Problem now is he thinks the remote is a toy & only gives him pre-programmed tv shows & not what is actually on tv at the moment. Is there any way to solve these kinds of problems when they come up.	0

"Mom has moderate Alzheimers and has some days where she's far more confused than others. Today was a bad day; she was difficult, sometimes angry, demanding food after forgetting having just eaten. At the end of the night though she unknowingly lightened the mood by announcing to the family that she thinks she might be pregnant. Sometimes you have to laugh to cope.    Edit: Apparently this is called ""Delusion of pregnancy"" and is an unusual symptom of dementia."	0
So I'm looking into memory care for my dad. He has difficulty speaking (was weirdly the first thing to go) needs help dressing, keeping on top of his hygiene, and obviously making sure to eat. He's still very mobile but obvious can get confused easily. He doesn't wander but who knows if that would change in a new place.  Money shouldn't be a problem as I'm currently paying out the ass for home care and it will end up cheaper to move him.  My questions are, what have been your experiences with the more standard nursing home vs the more residential based care homes? Also how much one on one time can be expected? Will someone make sure he gets his meals and does activities? Do they limit how many personal items a person can have? How do you tell when a place is giving you an honest set of expectations vs bullshit?  I know it's different for every place but I'm interested to hear personal experiences.	0
"Due to our past, I just can't even deal with her stubbornness. She digs her heals in on anything. I'm here to help, but I can't force her to take a cognitive test, though there are some signs of very weird behavior and confusion.  The first thing she brought up was that they ""take you away to a nursing home."" I tried to assure her, if that even happens, it would be for people who wander in the middle of the night and you find them across town. Nowhere near where she's at.   I tried pushing the line of any just being ""elderly"", it's a good idea to get a baseline test. Reassuring that she's totally fine. Met with resistance, ""I don't need to do that.""   She filed a police report about neighbors for, it's confusing, but I think using her youtube account to watch movies? She's focused on these neighbors a couple other times.  Not sure what to do really. Mostly she's all there, but I suspect something. But she's really resistant to getting any kind of cognitive test. My father has also noted concern about her, and himself too. I was hoping it could be a low-key ""everyone get a cognitive test because of age"" thing, but I was met with a lot of resistance. I tried presenting it as a ""You're fine, nobody's taking you to a nursing home, let's just get a baseline"" but it was met with a lot of resistance and shut down immediately.  Not really sure what to do."	0
I'm 27 y/o and my dad, who is 58 y/o, was formally diagnosed with early onset back in February. It's probably been about 3 years since he started having issues, and at first he was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment. It's been hard.   I really don't think my mum is coping well, she's always been one to take things out on other people and doesn't have a ton of patience. She's dealing with her elderly parents as well. That's not to say she isn't a wonderful and caring person, I just think a situation like this tends to exacerbate a person's less than great traits.   My dad still drives, he's still self-sufficient, but he's been getting more and more confused lately. He's been a musician all my life and was in a duo when I was younger and has recorded two albums. He's always played with friends and has had jam nights, obviously less now due to COVID. The other night he was at a jam session at a friend's house, and he told me he just couldn't keep up and was really down about it.   I guess I'm just looking for any advice, or even to talk to someone who is in a similar situation. Most support groups I've found are for caregivers or teens with a grandparent who has it. I guess I'm just trying to get a handle on what to expect, and if there's even any sort of rough timeline for this. I've just been thinking a lot lately about whether my dad will be around for my wedding or if he will get to meet my kids one day (I'm single, so it isn't like any of that is on the horizon). I like to have an idea of the process and next steps and what I can expect (I'm a lawyer, hazard of the trade). I just feel lost.  If you've made it this far, thank you, I really appreciate it. Just felt like I needed to get this off my chest.	0
My father has early onset Alzheimer’s. For the most part, other than irritability and forgetfulness, he’s still functioning very well right now.   He was on a horse today and the saddle wasn’t on correctly and he fell off. Some facial numbness, short term blurry vision and not remembering the fall came right after. He’s on the way to the hospital to get checked out now for a concussion and everything.   My question is will this affect his Alzheimer’s or make it worse in any way?	0

My dad (58) has been progressively getting worse. He's always been verbally abusive to me, my mom and my sister. I know for anyone who has a loved one with Alzheimer's, it often makes the person irritable, verbally abusive and even aggressive to a point where they don't recognize their loved one anymore. For us, it seems to just amplify what was already there, with the addition of having conservations with himself, wandering, and unable to toilet himself. My mom has a caretaker while she's at work and she's paying out of pocket for that. We are in NJ. She has been trying for a place since August/September. The first 2 homes turned him down because he needs a nursing home and NOT assisted living, which they were. TO be honest, I didn't know there was a difference at first. My dad is becoming more verbally aggressive and was screaming and cursing all day. He was never physical before but now we are super concerned it will get worse. He also randomly starts dancing in between the screaming, it looks almost manic.  &#x200B;  Is there a way to get an emergency check in at a nursing home that can handle him? We can't officially apply for Medicaid until a place takes him and some places wont take him while it is pending. Are there any other emergency options?	0
This is a difficult question, and may not fit with the group/might offend someone and I apologize in advance, it’s not intentional.  I need an opinion on something and I’m not sure the right group of people to ask, I thought someone here might have an opinion/advice to offer. Sorry for the length. TLDR at the end   So my mum was diagnosed a few years ago, she has early onset and is now 66. She’s pretty much a toddler at this point, has little short term memory etc. My dad is her primary and she’s on the list for LTC, she was actually accepted to one faster than he was expecting, so turned it down, he wasn’t ready and she’s not at the point where she needs to be in a home just yet. We’re thinking she will be there in a year or so.  The last few years of not having my mum in my life, specifically because of COVID, but also because she’s not calling me or being super involved in family things like she used to, because obviously she can’t, has made it incredibly clear how much of a negative impact my mother was on my life and mental health. As I’ve worked to improve many aspects of my life, get myself medicated properly for my depression and anxiety as well as being recently diagnosed with ADHD (making so much of my life and childhood make sense finally) I’ve looked back on my childhood and the memories I have of my mother are truly awful. I’ve come to the realization that she was a massive narcissist, and unfortunately, I was her target. My older sister was her favourite and I realized that all the abuse I received from my sister was learned and groomed from my mother. My saving grace in all this is that my sister grew out of it and she and I are best friends now. She has addressed her behaviour from when we were kids many times over and I have forgiven and we have grown so much closer together. She received some of my mothers narcissism when she had her own kids (mostly because I was older and she could no longer get to me) and that pulled us together, because I could help and support her. I told my sister stories from when I was younger, things that she did to me that either she was unaware of or that she remembers, but having it put in perspective from an adult looking back, has horrified her.  So my issue is this. I’m having a very difficult time feeling any empathy towards my mother, to the point that I want little to do with her. I’m very supportive of my dad and want to help him where I can, but I’m struggling even looking at it trying to talk to my mum. All I feel is anger and resentment when I look at her. My question, should I sit down and talk to my dad about this? My sister and I have a really good relationship with him. I feel like I need to let him know where I’m at and why. But I don’t want to offload more stress on him. I know that he feels bad about the missed ADHD diagnosis, as I struggled my whole life not knowing what was wrong with me and if they had actually been hands on parents they may have caught it when I was a kid.  As caregivers, what would you think is a good direction to go? Is this too much to put on someone’s plate who already has a lot?  TLDR: my mother screwed me up and I’m having issues feeling empathy for her/wanting to help her. Don’t know if I should let my dad know what’s going on.	0
My dad (69) was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s about a year ago. He was a psychiatrist before he retired, so he’s very hard on himself and knows what’s coming better than any of us. To me, he still appears fine. He’s very well spoken and smart, just slightly mixed up about unimportant things. He’s always been forgetful. Recently, however, he’s given up reading and driving and said he feels like he has no life. He’s struggling with audio books and word games. I’d like to get him something, either now or for Xmas, that he can enjoy. The only thing he really does is watch TV (though his wife says it’s hard for him to follow sometimes) and gardening, but it’s getting to be cold and less enjoyable. Anything I can get him that he can do long term to fill up the day, and won’t have to give up for a long time? Especially something that makes him feel “proactive” with the illness? I live far away, but I’d be willing to start a similar hobby or activity from where I am so he has someone to talk to about it. I’ve thought about learning a language with him, but he wants to learn Polish and that’s just too hard for me at the moment. He also seems to start and stop hobbies out of frustration. But maybe something like that, to build his confidence?  Thanks!!!	0
My parents have long term care insurance, and my dad has Alzheimers.  In order to trigger the long term care insurance, we need certification that he needs substantial assistance from another individual in 2 or more ADLs (Activities of Daily Living).  If you asked him, he doesn't think he does, but if you ask Mom she says otherwise.  But we are talking about the more borderline things... like cooking.    He can still shower and all that kind of stuff on his own.  But can't remember where he is often.  Anyone have any experience triggering long term care insurance?  Can you say how hard or easy it was?  Thanks	0
Hi! I am currently working in a recreation department at a nursing home. I entertain and play with a group of people with dementia and/or alzheimer, ranging from around 75 to 98 years old. We're usually 12 to 15, all of them sitting on couches in the shape of half a circle. They never get up during the activities.  I'd like new ideas for activities I could do with them. Drawing/writing doesn't work, and they don't really like it. They want to move, think, have fun.  I'm not a fan of singing songs or reading stories, but at moments there are guests that do so. I almost always put music in the background of my activities too	0
"Obviously I hope that everyone in the home who has it is ok but other than that, I don't know how to feel.  Mum doesn't have it and she's been double vaccinated, and other than her Alzheimer's she's in pretty good health (she's only 64). Part of me hopes, well, I don't know if ""hopes"" is the word I'm looking for... part of me feels like it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if she got it and passed from it, because she's confused and anxious and stressed all the time and this would be a much kinder way to go than however many months or years she has left with the Alzheimer's.   But it feels so awful and selfish to think like that about your own mother whom you love and miss dearly and are actively grieving for.  I'm really struggling with how I'm feeling to the point where I just feel numb because I can't figure it out."	0
I’m staying with my grandparents to help care for my grandmother while my grandfather recovers from a hip replacement. Her nurse mentioned that soda is linked to Alzheimer’s and I did some research and see it clearly is. My grandmother drinks almost nothing but soda all day. And always has. I want to tell my grandfather that I want her drinking other things because it’s known to cause and make Alzheimer’s worse. Should I not say this to him though? I don’t want to upset him and have him thinking they’ve been messing up all this time. But he is the type that would prefer to know truth and not be Sheilds to protect feelings. Is it okay to say “grandpa, I think we should have grandma not drink as much soda, as it is known to cause and worsen Alzheimer’s.” None of my other grandparents were soda drinkers and they’re all sharp as a tack and close to 90. The only other person I’ve known with Alzheimer’s was a woman who got it at 65 and obsessively drank soda. Is it worth telling him? I worry it might not be worth it since she’s so far gone already and it might make him feel like they did it to themselves	0
"Watching the repeat of the ceremony at the cenotaph from earlier today with grandma. She's having trouble contemplating that it's a repeat of something she missed earlier.

Partner (senior) having difficulty completing tasks. They tried to explain it to me and they said, they will be doing a task but the other part of their brain tells them to go on to a different task. So they don’t finish the current task and move on to the next. Sometimes it feels like they’re going in a circle. Does this sound like Alzheimer’s? His family doctor prescribed donzepil but his heart doctor told him to not take this medication unless it’s absolutely necessary. I haven’t noticed anything strange yet but it’s worrisome. And he won’t go to an actual specialist. :(	0
"I haven't really talked about this with anyone outside of my circle or with clients who needed to know why I wasn't available. A month ago, my dad had a stroke. He had a stroke last year, too, but it was a small one and we thought he was just declining in his alzheimers. He bounced back relatively well from that one. This time, he didn't.  He's been spending a lot of his days just laying in bed, eyes closed. We celebrate any times he opens his eyes or speaks clear words. He is getting in-home hospice care, which is exactly what we all wanted for him when his time would come - to pass away peacefully at home.  Today he had a really good day, and that kind of scares me. I know that terminal patients can rally when they are close to death. They can act almost like normal, even, which seemed to be what my dad did today. I couldn't get to the house soon enough to witness it myself - I only saw the after math once he had tuckered himself out, and he did seem more energetic.  Here's the crazy thing - and I say this as a person who no longer entertains the super natural... Our dad's caretaker who has been with him for almost 9 years now, told us a few months ago that dad grabbed her hand, and said very clearly (despite his tendency to mumble after the first stroke) that he would die on November 18. Again, I try and take these things with a grain of salt but with his burst of energy today and knowing that patients can rally before death, I'm kind of freaking out a little. It doesn't help that two days ago, the only clear thing he said to me all day was, ""Don't be afraid"". Again, kind of had the opposite effect.  I don't know why I'm writing this. Thers been so much on my mind and I can barely keep up with my own life because of what's happening. Every day just kind of looms over my head, and I never know what the last day will be. We're all just kind of taking it a day at a time and looking towards Nov 18 with a skeptical eye. I want to tell myself he's doing well and who knows what will happen, because he's always been strong. But he's 91 and an alzheimers patient... The ironic thing is that he didn't believe in spiritual or supernatural things, either. The irony.  Anyways... I just kind of wanted to write something out. I know most of my siblings understand what it is to ""rally"" but my half sister takes a good day and seems to think he'll be fine, and I hate having to listen to false hope. When my mom died, so many people had false hope, but I was the one who spoke to the doctors and knew what was going on, but I was dismissed when I tried to exppain that to people because, ""you never know what will happen!!!"" And right, you don't know, but we have a pretty good idea of where this is heading.  Like I said, I have no idea why I'm posting this. Just trying to work out my jumbled thoughts with other people who know what alzheimers does to someone. For ten years, I kept thinking I can't mourn my dad anymore, and then he gets worse and there I am, again. I didn't expect to feel this way when he was closer to passing away. I thought I would feel relief that he wasn't suffering anymore, but he had his small forms of happiness that he enjoyed. I was still happy when I could buy him something he'd like to eat, even when he couldn't swallow solid foods anymore. Sure, he could no longer appreciate the birds outside, but I can't count how often I'd catch him petting the cat or dog. He seemed to be at peace for those moments.  Now I'm just happy if he opens his eyes slightly if I speak to him.  It just sucks I can't appreciate that he had a good day today without worrying it may be his last 'good' day. I hate thinking like that. Anyways, thank you for letting get that off my chest."	0
TL;DR: the title. Dramatic, sudden decline - anyone else have experience with delirium in a loved one with ALZ?  My MIL, who I love dearly, has early-onset (diagnosed at age 60).  She's 30+ years divorced and has lived alone since my husband, her only child, moved out. No other family close or close by. She knew something wasn't right but hid it for a long time, and unfortunately jumpstarted her noticeable progression by abruptly stopping taking antidepressants, which she had been on for over fifteen years. Her symptoms began progressing with a vengeance. We knew something was up, but this was right as covid got serious early last year, and it was incredibly difficult to visit her (she lived 7 hours away) and pursue a diagnosis, as most medical facilities in the area were closed except for emergencies. So it was some time before we received a diagnosis.   We dropped everything when we finally knew for sure what was happening, sorted and took over her financial situation, sold her house, sold her car (both after *numerous* discussions with her and after assuring her full consent, meanwhile keeping her friends apprised of each decision and why), moved her to be near us, into a very nice apartment building. My husband sees her every day before and after work. We have respite car visits all but one day a week, twice a day for some days. I visit her often, make her a lunch every single day. We do things with her on the weekends - drives, walks, rock-hunting. We've done, in short, absolutely everything we can to make sure she's safe, healthy, and as happy as you can be when you know you have Alzheimer's.  She's been here since last August, and for the *most* part had seemed to have plateau'd. I mean, there's always good days and bad days, and the slow but noticeable decline, but overall things seemed somewhat sustainable. Last month we began to get serious about arranging assisted living - MIL was still okay, but we could tell things were beginning to approach that eventuality.  And then, a week and a half ago, she just.. fucking tanked. Waaay more confused, losing words at a MUCH greater frequency, making things up, getting lost in her apartment, crying a LOT. She stayed up all night a few days ago and 'packed' about three-quarters of the stuff in her apt because she was 'moving back home.' My husband has had to leave work twice today - once because she had hidden her phone in the dryer and wasn't answering, once because she managed to call him, crying, because she didn't know where she was. I'm probably going to have to go and stay with her after I write this, in all likelihood.  This is *drastic*. We're trying to get hold of her neurologist, but this looks, feels, and sounds a lot like an episode of delirium to me. Around the time this started, she started a new med - the antidepressant that she had been taking before this all started. She also is very stubborn about eating and drinking sometimes.  Has anyone else experienced delirium with someone who has Alz? Are there other telltales? Have you also experienced a much more rapid decline in the person even after it was addressed?  We moved like lightning (thank god we'd already started planning) and are moving her in to a facility next week, but I'm trying to get a better picture of what the future looks like after this - I'm afraid it's gonna be different than what we had anticipated before.  Thanks in advance. Love to all you guys - I hope your strength does not fail you and you remember to love yourselves too.	0
Just putting this out there for any good karma, prayers, or wishes I can get!    She is 86 and fighting, threw her tray at them when they confined her to her room.  Go mom!    Word is some staff were refusing vaccinations though required by NY.     Best wishes and all good returned to all of you going through this double nightmare.	0
"I'm a 36 year old who's mother is beginning to progress down the path.  Her mother had Alzheimer's, her sister has Alzheimer's, and although she has seen several doctors, including some specialists, she is yet to be diagnosed.  However, she forgets things minutes after having lengthy conversations about them.  This finally came to a head this past weekend when I made the two hour trip to see her for her retirement party.  She's in her mid 60s and I think she would have worked until she dropped dead, but I'm suspecting her work is ""*suggesting*"" she retire now.  Anyways, we were at dinner and as she was looking at the menu she kept asking if she liked a particular item. Over....and over....and over....     While we were there, she mentioned that her neurologist wants to get her to use this newer drug Aduhelm.  I've read quite a bit of controversy about this.  Including someone who died here very recently, potentially from brain swelling (a known side effect.  I told her I feel like we should get her a referral to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MINN.  Anyone have any experience with this?  Sorry this was a little scattered and rambling."	0

In 2017, shortly after our 23&Me test came back showing that my mom (now 72) and I (now 38) had one copy of the APOe4 Alzheimer’s risk gene, I began to notice odd blips in her communication, namely, constantly reversing pronouns (always “he” for females and “she” for males) and becoming more easily tongue-tied. In addition, she became confused in the airport when traveling to visit me in NYC and was increasingly paranoid that her debit card had been hacked, thus carrying massive sums of cash to avoid using it.  However, she still scored 28/30 on her MOCA in 2018 (not great given that she was once a brilliant engineer), and there was no noticeable further decline until the pandemic and with it extreme stress, isolation, sudden weight loss/frailty, and a catastrophic series of spinal fractures from rapidly progressing osteoporosis. In just 8 months, mom looked and sounded like she’d aged 10 years. A trip to the gerontologist in fall 2020 revealed her MOCA score had plummeted to 21. The doctor suggested early-stage Alzheimer’s. Mom went into furious denial and refused follow-up appointments. We did, however, manage to stop her osteoporosis progression with Reclast and hormone therapy.  Fast forward to now: Mom struggles terribly with communication, garbling or  substituting “it” for a given noun every few words.   For instance, when trying to explain the switch between standard time and daylight savings, she said to me: “it’s up and it comes through now in the bedroom and then after it’s the same time but less of it.” When what she means is: “The sun comes up earlier now, but in the evening, it’s dark earlier, too.”   Additionally, she’s forgotten my (her only child) middle name, my birthday, that I was married for 14 years, and massive amounts from her own past (like that her lifelong best friend died of cancer 21 years ago. Mom was at her bedside). She’s also unable to recall her medications for a doctor, use a computer (insisting it’s broken), or set up her own appointments.   But at the same time, her house is immaculately clean as is her hygiene. She scoops her cat’s litterboxes and feeds them like clockwork. She drives to the post office and grocery store nearby with relative ease and still manages to pay her bills on time (I carefully monitor her finances). She also keeps track of both my partners, their jobs, and my own job search — enough to hold a conversation with me despite her many missing words.  I’ve done several assessments online to figure out her stage, and I’m completely stumped. They all say she’s MCI or very, very early stage Alzheimer’s. But doctors, when they speak to her, indicate to me that she’s much further along given her tangential speech, missing words, and memory gaps.  Indeed, I can’t find any description of Alzheimer’s in which language and long-term memory are the first to go. Has anyone else experienced anything like this with their loved one? I’m so afraid that her early loss of basic words will render her unintelligible to me or her caregivers years before her body gives out.	0
"How do you deal with patients when they don't want to do something that could be good for them?   My mom has always liked singing and belonging to a choir. Since she has Alzheimer she's no longer able to do this, so my sister had the idea of calling a music therapist to improve her life. She offered it and my mom refused. There was no way of convincing her. She even randomly called my sister (sometimes she remembers stuff) to tell her not to force her to go to ""music lessons"".   Is there a way to do this anyway? We can't force her, right? This is not like medication where she also refuses but after some arguments she takes them anyway.  Anyway, how's everyone else's experience? thanks in advance."	0
TL;DR Moved mom in with me and the family to take care of her and protect her assets. Starting to feel like a bad move.   My mom was a single mom starting when I was three years old. She had a high school diploma and an hourly job. We lived in someone's basement for a couple years after the divorce, then to the second story of a crumbling two flat. Mom was frugal, used old bed sheets for curtains, shopped the generic aisle almost exclusively (the old school black and white generics), dressed me entirely in hand-me-downs from cousins and neighbors. She still managed to provide an amazing time growing up for me. A week long vacation every year, a ticket to Great America once a summer, even found an NES under the Christmas tree in 1985.     Mom worked for the same company for 42 years before retiring. She managed to own a small condo outright, owned her modest car and had a decent retirement account.     After a personal tragedy to her 20+ year boyfriend, I started noticing the little things that indicate a problem. Forgetting days, dates, the time; an occasional shirt on backwards or inside out; some crazy stories that in hindsight I believe were hallucinations. I didn't think there was a problem at this point but wanted her closer to me (she lived an hour away) so she had daily interaction with my family. We sold her condo, she bought a townhome and things were supposed to be good.    Having her closer and interacting with her more, I realized there might be more to what I thought were just quirks. After a couple years I realized she was forgetting to make meals, had expired food in the fridge, was getting lost in her car, was having difficulty getting dressed and had a small issue with incontinence.     After considering the options (in home care, assisted living or moving her in) and consulting with an estate planning attorney, I decided we'd sell her place AND my place to move us all into a house that would give her space and allow us (my wife, three older kids and myself) to help her.     A small aside here. As I began raising my own family I realized the struggle it must have been for my mom to raise me alone. I also found out my grandmother (her mom) criticized my mom for dating when I was young, telling her I was her main responsibility and dating would compromise that. I felt terrible for my mom and promised myself I would find a way to pay her back. I saw moving her in and caring for her as my opportunity.  Additionally and the be honest, I was also selfish about securing what mom had worked her whole life for. *stopped typing here to help her with going to the bathroom, she had a bm in her Depends*. My mom had a small retirement account and owned her townhome. Liquidating that for private care in a memory facility would maybe cover four years. I thought it would be better to save that money and buy a joint property with some of our combined assets.      Here we are now about six months later. Mom has declined quickly. She has both urinary and bowel incontinence, can't dress herself, can't bathe herself and can't follow very simple instructions. Caring for her has become a strain for my family. We were ready to interview an in home care service tomorrow but now my son and my mom have tested positive for Covid making a difficult situation worse.    I love my mom beyond description but this is terrible. I created this am full of regret. We can't just move her into a care facility now without covering her portion of the property and don't have the assets to do it without selling the house we just moved into. I made a deal with the devil.	0
"Hi friends, I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/qlvg3k/nearing_the_end/) a week ago about getting my dad on hospice. It's been a whirlwind. His facility at the time had been oscillating between asking us to find my dad a new facility and then saying for over a month he could stay. My dad had started having issues with aggression and hurting staff and residents. Hospice got him on dilaudid 3 times a day and my dad is barely affected by it. His facility said he could stay ""for the rest of his life"" and then the next day flipped again and said he needed to go. We have REALLY struggled with finding another facility willing to take on a man with ""behaviors"". Well, we found one and pulled the trigger despite knowing a move would be pretty catastrophic for my dad's behaviors.  Well, we moved him today to the new facility. He hadn't even been there a few hours before we got a call from the hospice nurse that he's punching people and throwing things. Sigh. I just am hoping he doesn't have to suffer long like this but I just am so worried he's going to go on like this for years. He is completely unable to give direction to, he can't focus on you, you can't get his attention, he is forgetting who my mom and I are, he speaks almost entirely jibberish now, he's completely incontinent and falls a lot. He needs assistance with all but feeding and that's becoming a challenge. He can pretty much only eat with his hands. I just don't know how much longer we can bear this and if his new facility will work with us and keep him. I'm just amazed the dilaudid isn't really doing what hospice expected. He has zero quality of life. It's so depressing. I just hope he can stop suffering soon."	0
Our mother is in a memory care unit for Alzheimer’s and has escaped from two different facilities. Her current unit is very responsive to breaches, but they have to maintain fire egresses and she’s still able to read exit instructions and get out onto the street.  We’re considering getting an Apple AirTag or some kind of tracking device we can tie onto her shoelaces. Has anyone used tracking devices to keep track of their loved ones in this way? Any suggestions on how to minimize these safety risks?	0
My girlfriends mom has Alzheimer’s. On Halloween she took a bad fall. I’m worried that it will take a huge emotional toll on her if/when she gets worse. I watched my mom take care of her own mother as she went through a similar situation. It was incredibly hard on her and I fear the same for my girlfriend. Any advise on how best to support her would be greatly appreciated.	0
"I am dealing with something perhaps someone out there has advice on.  My mom has Alzheimer's; it was hidden from us for years, and has now become unavoidable.  They're on the young side, she's 67 and he's 70.  She has hallucinations most days.  Short term memory loss.     She's starting to forget who we are at times.  And cannot get dressed herself.  Her hygeine is questionable.  We do not know what stage she is at because she forced my Dad to drive to her neurologist and cancel every upcoming appointment.  He obliged.  Their house is in absolute shambles; the grief has caused my father to start projects around the house that he does not finish.  There are piles of tools and screws and saws and dust on literally on every single surface.  My mother doesn't have anywhere to go and will sit on the couch playing with a ball of yarn that she untangles and re-tangles.  It's so crazy to type something this disturbing, as our upbringing was generally pretty happy.  We do not know if she is taking her medicine, but I doubt she's taking it properly. My father is not administering it.  She took her wedding ring off on Halloween out of fear it would fall off when handing out candy, and it seems to now be lost.    My sister and I are trying to pick up the slack by finding an elder care lawyer, locating a new neurologist, scheduling the appointments, and even arranging to have my aunt take my mom for a walk when we need my dad to be available.  We've also talked to the elder care resources in their county for a home visit and to possibly set them up on wheels on meals.  (They lived a very blue collar life.)  But every once in a while, I need a piece of information from him, and he can't make himself available.  He texted me today saying that I can no longer call him on the phone for these matters, because it makes my mother upset when he steps away for a period of time.  I think his grief is profound, and his house feels like quicksand.  This week for the first time he broke down crying on the phone and hung up on me when I brought up trying to get them Meals on Wheels.  There is a lot that I still need to do, but he does not return texts, does not return emails, forgets to bring his cell phone with him, but does not answer it.  It's like trying to help a brick wall.  However, he will reach out when my mom has a catastrophic episode in the hopes that we can help get her mind off the task at hand.  This happens every three days or so where we'll get an urgent text telling us he needs one of us to call immediately.  He can't get his mind around telling therapeutic fibs, and is constantly getting into arguments about how there are ""no other people living in the basement.""  Last week I was so worried about my father I gave him the number for the Suicide Prevention Hotline.  I am doing all that I can, and taking a pretty huge amount of my week trying to help (I live on the west coast with two kids and an unstable career, they're in New England).  But the guy needs medicine, therapy, and group counseling.  And my mom needs even basic care.  I have a feeling my situation isn't atypical, and curious how anyone else has helped ""lead a horse to water"" as I'm trying to do in such desperate situations.  Or whether or not this is severe enough for me to fly home for a few months, and take legal guardianship over my own mother from my dad.  (Though I have no idea how I would swing that financially.)  Thanks in advance for any perspective!"	0
My Dad has dementia (neurologist believes it's Alzheimer's but no solid diagnosis yet) & using remote for his tv has become impossible. I show him which buttons turn power on, change channels, turn volume up at least 50 times a day & 30 seconds after telling him he can't do it anymore. I can't sit on the couch next to him 24/7 to change channels etc.   Does anyone know of a SUPER simple remote that will work in a situation like this?	0
7/8 years ago my dad was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s.   He was a VP at a company and dealing with a very stressful time in his career, working impossible hours abroad. My mother was aboard with him and couldn’t work so made friends and created a support system for herself. My dad felt like she wasn’t supporting him properly emotionally and that she was just out having fun while he was working non stop. Im not here to judge that situation as I wasn’t there and I can see how it would have been hard on both of them in their own ways.  My dad was diagnosed when they returned to the US. He is now retired & on disability. He often connects his diagnosis with the fact he felt she didn’t support him and that’s why he had this mental break. Since returning home, for the past 7/8 years, he has been depressed and irritated and while sometimes this is directed at the diagnosis and his declining short term memory and focus, a lot of it and majority of anger is directed at my mother for their time abroad while he was working.  He cannot or will not let go of the issue while they were abroad and has emotionally been quite abusive to my mom for the past 7/8 years. He won’t or can’t move on, says it’s just constantly in his head and that his heart and trust is broken for the emotional abandonment. He’s made her apologize multiple times and has only just “accepted” it recently when he made her write it out - but he still can’t move on. They have had (and are still having) therapy and counseling, he has a hypno therapist and he is on medication - none of this seems to help. He wants to switch therapists whenever they want to keep talking about what happened or when they mentioned that he shouldn’t keep trying to claim to spot of victim.   He’ll go from wanting a separation and being depressed/angry for a few days to telling my he can’t live without her and she’s the best. If my mom suggests separation he says she’s selfish and that’s the easy way out for her because he’s sick. She doesn’t want to leave because he is Ill and will soon need someone to care for him but this has taken its toll on her. He’s like Jekyll and Hyde.   I try to be there to help and emotionally support but there is only so much I can do. I feel so bad and don’t know how to help the situation. I know Alzheimer’s affects emotional and behavior stuff as well as mental faculties but is this it for the next 5/10 years?	0

My dad has always had a temper. He's always been angry. He's always been an emotionally and verbally abusive to my mom.  Edit: I realize now that I'm ranting and venting more than I might actually asking a question. I'm sorry. Not a lot of people you can talk to about this sort of thing   But it didn't used to be that bad. He kept himself in check. Throughout most of my life I didn't even realize how much of an asshole he was until I was in my mid 20s  But now that he has early onset Alzheimer's, it's amplified all of his worst qualities. Angry all of the time about things that don't matter. And then once he starts on a tangent, he starts talking in circles, and he's yelling about things that don't make sense, and he usually forgets what he was angry about in the first place but he still continues to be angry.  He's not far enough along for us to put him into some kind of care home. And even if he was, they probably kick him out for being abusive to the staff.  My mom should have divorced him and left him decades ago. But now it feels too late. Part of it's the guilt. She doesn't want to leave somebody who's dealing with something he can't help. She'd feel like a terrible person for abandoning someone in need. And he has no friends. And his family doesn't like him, none of  his sister would take him in.  And because he doesn't have any other support, anywhere else to go, I'm convinced that a restraining order won't be enough. He'll forget and keep showing up at the house anyway.  She can't afford to just pack up and leave him. Even though that's probably the best and only option. And hell, part of the reason why we don't have anything saved is because of how you're responsible he is with money. He's not far enough along for us to get power of attorney. We can't stop him from accessing his own bank account. So every time is disability check comes in, he immediately takes cash out and buys pot. And now he's at a point where he'll smoke everything he buys almost immediately, forget that he bought it, and then try to buy more. He's taking from money that should go to the car insurance or the mortgage  I've seen so many stories of people losing a family member to Alzheimer's. Somebody tragic stories of people talking about how they're watching their loved ones slip away. And it's heartbreaking. But that is not been my experience at all. This asshole has become an incredible burden.  I mean, I'm damn near 40 and I'm still living with my parents. I moved back in after his first heart attack to help him out. But before things got stable enough for me to move out again, that's when his Alzheimer's started showing signs. And now I just don't feel safe leaving her alone with him.  TL;DR, how do you deal with someone with Alzheimer's when they're Alzheimer's amplifies all of their worst qualities to the point where you wish they would just fucking go away?	0
"Hello all, thanks for all your advice and comfort during this shitty journey. I feel we are nearing the end. My dad began getting aggressive and agitated a few weeks ago. Last week hospice was called and we began hospice. The hospice nurse has been talking to me about terminal agitation and that she thinks that's what he's experiencing. They still oscillate between dementia ""types"" but my dad had been in a rapid decline the past several months. I hadn't noticed it as much but my husband had. My dad became completely incontinent, complete lack of facial expressions (just a slack face), I can't get or hold his attention anymore (even with tapping his hand, giving him a hug, etc), he didn't recognize my mom for the first time last week, he seems to be eating less.   I know everyone's final stages are different. It feels like it's been rapid but I don't think that's too uncommon. Hospice has begun dilaudid to keep my dad comfortable. They do not suspect he has much time left. Any thoughts/experiences you all can share when your loved one got to this stage? My dad has not had any quality of life for some time now so I am mostly at peace with this. I know he would be so mad we even ""let"" him get to the stage where we had to move him in to memory care. At this point, I know he's just suffering. It's still a very painful decision. Thanks, friends."	0
I'm 27 and I've been dealing with my Dad's early-onset Alzheimers in its late stages for the last couple of years now (incontinence, aggressive behaviour etc), he's suffered from Alzheimer's for the majority of my adult life. However, his living situation isn't usual. He has a live-in carer, in a house that's nearby to his sister & her husband. They cover the carer's breaks each day - something I find crazy considering how bad things are getting - there isn't a desire from them to remove Dad from his home and into a care facility (sister has power of attorney). Anyway, I cover a long break every other Sunday. This is becoming harder & harder for me. I feel like the anxiety I get is ruining my week before, I'm on edge the whole time I'm there & it's taking me 2-3 days to recover once I get home & back into my routine. I feel like this is down to the fact I have to change Dad when he soils himself, try to calm him down when he's very distressed, screaming, trying to hit me etc. My auntie & uncle are insistent that he's getting the best care, in the best situation, living by them, whereas I would much prefer to visit him maybe more frequently in a professional care environment & remove the anxiety of making sure I'm doing a good job keeping my Dad clean & safe. I don't feel Dad is under any threat or that he's in danger, but for me it's becoming too hard to enter that environment. I'm just wondering if anyone has experienced something similar, how you've dealt with other family members, or can tell me I'm not an awful son for finding this situation extremely difficult to manage.	0
I'm questioning if she really needs to go into 24-care now, even though she's in late Stage 5 Alzheimer's, and I was really sure about it when I made the reservation for her. I'm scared about the process of tricking her to get there, because she won't agree to go, and having to lie to her. Has anyone else had this experience?	0
"Has anyone set up an Amazon ""echo show"" device to keep in better contact with a loved one in a care home who has dementia/alzheimers?  We are going to be moving my step-dad into a care home this month, and so we're trying to find a way for him to stay in contact with his kids and wife.  He is not able to use his mobile phone very well, because he has arthritis in his fingers and he forgets how to navigate into the phone screen, etc.   (Plus he often forgets to charge his phone.)  I thought perhaps it might be easier for him to just say ""Alexa, call \[person\]"". Then each of us can have our own echo show device in our homes.. and we can do video chat, etc.  What do you think? Is there an easier way to keep in contact with someone in a care home?     Maybe something like Facebook portal?  [http://portal.facebook.com](http://portal.facebook.com)  (I just heard about this one, but I don't know anything about it, so I'm not sure it would be super easy to use like the echo show?)

Starting down the path with my Mom so many of you have already tread. Thanks to this sub in advance for putting yourselves out there. A lot to learn and a long ways to go.   I’ve been avoiding my Mom’s cognitive decline as long as possible. I thought I was hiding from the warning signs with her. I thought I’d been following her lead and she would bring it up when she was ready. I thought she was scared and didn’t want to tell anyone, and so the best I could do was just make sure she was comfortable. I thought I was hiding for her—I was doing it for me.   I have avoided the issue more than I even knew. I wanted to believe she was capable and understanding of what was happening to her. I wanted to be supportive without forcing her to do anything she didn’t want to do. I talked to her about “letting me know if anything is ever wrong”, having great conversations and being ready to tackle the issue when the time came. And so long as she wasn’t telling me there were any issues, I pretended it was fine. I feel so dumb now.   It occurs to me now just how little she might understand of what is happening to her. How scary it must be. Shes not hiding from it; it’s now hidden from her. She can’t fully bring it up because she doesn’t know. She’s still my mom, but the part of her that’s missing is the part I was not fully prepared for.  It started with erratic decision making about six years ago. Big decisions unlike her. Major cross-country moves to places she didn’t know anyone. Suddenly. She had some personal trauma, so erratic didn’t seem so far off at the time. I didn’t know.   Three years later and the longtime forgetfulness and other behaviors were noticeable in a new way. Conversations became more repetitive, shorter, less depth and breadth. Questions were repeated. She became more deeply fixated on a fewer number of things. She got nervous easily. Still didn’t know.   Two years ago and Mom was reluctant to get together for the holidays. I forced her to come see her family. She was nervous and uncomfortable. She seemed unable to follow the basic plan. She missed the first shuttle to come get her because she just lost track of the days. I chastised her for it and got her on the next one. I was confused how anyone could mess it up. She was a bit difficult the whole time. She repeated conversations to a more alarming degree. I knew something was wrong but didn’t do or say anything.   18 months ago she completely reversed her cross country move but the planning and execution were a mess. She planned for Months. A week before her move she called me asking me to fly out and move her because she had no plan. I scolded her for being so careless. Five days later she had driven 7 hours to my doorstep on the way to her destination. She was just standing there at 10:30 pm unannounced. We could not get a hold of her the prior four days. I yelled at her because I just didn’t understand what was happening. It was so erratic. She said it was stress. I thought about it later and started talking to people about cognitive decline and realized I had been less than helpful to her by scolding her. I still didn’t do or say anything. She seemed better and manageable for a while and I was just scared.   All through covid we had been in touch but the calls became so short. I had been supportive but not direct with her. She would just repeatedly ask if we had gone back to work yet or if our state had been opened back up. Every call—Usually 3+ times per call. And I just kept asking if she was okay. We just kept repeating ourselves. She also started becoming very suspicious and her Facebook turned into a Qanon feed. Our calls dwindled over the last six months.   Today I got a call from her landlord. He stopped by to get rent. Mom couldn’t figure out why he was there. She wasn’t sure what she was supposed to do so she asked him to write the check out for her. I logged in to Facebook to see two of her friends had reached out to tell me they were worried about her cognitive decline. She had gotten very sickly looking too. That she had withdrawn from everyone lately.   I called my Mom right away. She was puzzled and upset by her TV not working and that was all she would talk about. Nothing else. I asked if she was okay. She said she just couldn’t figure out the TV. Over and over. Told her I was going to come visit this week to see if she is okay. She told me to wait til the TV was working. That we will talk tomorrow when TV works. I have never had a conversation like that with her. It’s like the echo of a person. There’s just someone distant and strange on the other end talking about the TV. It happened so fast. I had to get it off my chest. I feel guilty and stupid for not understanding the gravity and acting sooner.   Tomorrow I will be calling her again and making plans to travel to her. I will be reaching out to Alz support tomorrow and to her doctor hopefully as well.   And for the first time I am seeing what this really is and how terrible and confusing and frightening it must be for my Mom.   The end. If you suspect an issue, don’t wait. Don’t hide. Have an honest conversation about it.	0
My dad has moderate stage Alzheimer’s. He has been in the hospital and rehab for over a month now. He is going home soon and he is now asking about his dog. His dog passed away shortly after he went to the hospital. Is it better to just directly tell him the dog died? Should I just tell him the dog is ‘away?’ I’ve seen conflicting information online, and I really can’t figure out what’s best.	0
My mother (63 years) has been sick for many years now. My father cannot manage taking care of her anymore, so tomorrow she’s moving into a care home next door from my father. She doesn’t want to move now, even though she initially said yes. She is in need for professional care, and my father is so so tired and worn out from taking care of her.   She has been so angry with us all day today, and she even said that she would kill herself if she had to move.   I’m so sad for her. And him. I live in another part of our country, and have a family of my own, so it’s not possible for me to just stay here and take care of her. Right now I’ve taken some time of from my job, left my husband and two small kids at home, so I can be here when she is moving in tomorrow.   I hate Alzheimer’s. I hate that it took my mom. And I wish she was happy and didn’t feel sad and anxious all the time.	0
My grandmother lives in assisted living because her dementia is too far gone to live on her own. My mom and her sisters take turns visiting and caring for her. My nom hates visiting because my grandmother doesn’t know her anymore. I’ve never seen my mom be emotional but she’s cried about it before and I know she dreads visiting and feels like a bad daughter because she doesn’t go as often as she should because it’s so hard on her. What can I do to support her after these visits? We aren’t really a family who talks about our feelings a lot and that wouldn’t be comfortable for her. How would you want to be supported? Is there anything I can do at all to make her feel better? It breaks my heart.	0
&#x200B;  Hello Redditors  Thank you on behalf of my fam for your input on Part I. We are listening and open to any ideas you may have.  Update:  Since last post, N (F 70) has spent a great deal of time with my Dad, P. (M 77) who has moderate / mild Stage 5 Alz. This woman is still pushing him to complete redecoration of his condo, which at one point  discombobulated him so much that his caretaker reported that he left the condo thinking it was someone else's home and then headed for the curb where the car he hasn’t owned since 2018 should be parked. The redecoration was estimated by his finance person to cost him 40K.  We had originally decided that indications he was going to marry her would be our redline, warranting us getting a lawyer to pursue conservatorship to protect him from further exploitation and perhaps even annul the marriage? The family that would help us to get this lawyer is not financially connected to P.  However, that redline had to be redrawn because N did something so incredibly outrageous that no one really expected it - she got him to open a joint account at his bank and transferred over 16K into it. This opens the floodgates to N having him transfer every penny into this account which she can then empty, this being a far more efficient way to fleece my Dad than waiting months to meet the two requirements of a confidential (not on public record and hidden until his passing) marriage in CA: changing her residence to his address and calling herself Mrs P.  At the same time, P also spent several hours calling the credit card companies and cancelling the cards he had sent to his adult kids back before N. came into his life. Apparently he is having cashflow problems because of the condo redecoration and enormous 9k per mo caretaker bill. N told him it is your kids and the credit cards you gave them so problem solved.  Thing is, P. has real problems keeping track of all the CC he has opened over the past few years, and the ones N told him to close because of his kids also pay for his utilities and caretaker expenses.  It is likely that the utilities and bills will stay unpaid until they start coming due and then there will be darkness and silence in my Dad's condo and no one to answer any questions because the company that runs the caretakers are hardasses and will pull them out asap.  The best part is the CC were all known to his accountant and monitored and paid through Quickbooks. Any new cards he ordered now will go straight to P and not be monitored. So far, N has removed the physical devices meant to keep him safe from running off, and has now removed the accounting system which kept him safe from financial scams.  Today the fam did a call and we decided that J (his youngest son M 50)  would offer P. a chance to voluntarily accept conservatorship so he can be protected and still do whatever, including getting legally married to this “person” if he really wants.  We expect him to tell N, who will pressure him to resist, making her the only person telling P to not cooperate with his fam. She has already advised him to tell us to fuck off and that it is his right to get married to whoever he wishes. He is 1000% in love with her and will do whatever she asks.  The plan is after he tells us off, that's when we hand this off to a lawyer and say to a court or judge that given his diagnosis is there any way to at the very least stop him from moving money around and first explain where it is going and why.  I have to say I don't see much hope here. This is actually the THIRD time he has been involved with such a difficult and demanding woman like N. His first marriage after he divorced my mom was to a N. He was totally lovestruck and acted pretty much the same long before his present diagnosis.  We appreciate any thoughts or impressions you may have.  edit: Del name	0
Can anyone point me in the right direction of where to fax / send Health Care POA for purposes of U.S. Medicare / Medicaid?  I called Medicare and they said to contact Social Security, because these are benefits, but Social Security is having long-term issues with their telephones, and, thus, can't get through. (I tried several times and they have a notice on their website about this.)  All I can find on the SS website is a form to fill out for someone who still has their faculties about them, and have also seen somewhere that they don't recognize POAs. My loved one has Alzheimers and it's too late for them to fill out the form.  I just want to fax the Health Care POA related to Medicare / Medicaid, so I can contact them on behalf of my parent in the future.  I don't have an urgent need to contact them right now, but am wanting to fax / transmit these to all who I might need this to be in place for. I've got a 7-day trial of an online fax service, and have faxed to all parties/entities but Medicare / Medicaid. LOL	0
When grandma was a kid, her dad said she had to turn off everything at the wall at night to stop the power “leaking out” of the sockets.  She has got it into her head (again) that this is true.  I don’t mind her unplugging e.g. the toaster, obviously. But anything with a clock has to be reset every morning so she doesn’t get confused about the time. She will also turn off the washing machine and dishwasher in the middle of an overnight cycle so I get a mini flood when I open them. More seriously, she turns off all the nightlights so she can’t see going to the loo. She turns off the phone base stations (sometimes we’ve missed incoming NHS calls because of this). Has even turned off the power of her emergency contact box “so it doesn’t call anyone”. That box detects it has lost power, and rings EVERYONE!  So, my problem is, that U.K. plugs are arguably the the safest in the world (https://youtu.be/UEfP1OKKz_Q). I want to make them less safe so grandma can’t turn them off at the socket or pull them out of the wall. Is there any box that can be fitted over the socket to stop her disconnecting the things that are supposed to help her?	0
I’m hoping this question is appropriate for this forum. I’m not asking from a management perspective ; but rather as another human being and a co-worker who cares because It’s clearly impacting their day to day.  I’ve read through many posts in this subreddit and they are both heartbreaking and heartwarming. The amount of support i see brings me to tears.   What can I do in my position to help this individual? Or should I just leave it alone and  not mention it bc it’s not my business?	0
Dad (71) has said he think he has early-stage Alzheimers.  He stopped working part-time over a year ago now because he made a major mistake. He often looses track of where he's going when he's driving. Today he didn't realize that there were cars waiting at a light in front of him. My mom had to scream for him to realize they were going to crash, then swerve into another lane to avoid hitting the cars ahead. Today we discovered he'd ordered some boots from a fake company. He thought it was Etsy, but it was actually a look-a-like site called Etsy-Center.  Normally $300 boots being sold for $59. It's strange he didn't question if that was too good to be true.  He often forgets things, like he'll make a full pot of coffee and then leave.  He says that there's other things he's been hiding.  He's always had trouble remembering things, and needs to keep lists and reminders and to keep himself on track.  Social skills and language skills are very good.  I accept that there could be some kind of dementia that may be setting in, but I guess it's hard for me to accept it could be Alzheimers.  He's also a health nut, loves the gym, eats very mindfully and takes all manner of supplements. Everything from green tea and coconut oil to lifetime extension supplements.  I started looking up information on how to plan for a family member with dementia or Alzheimers. And it's all very vague, euphemistic stuff about considering your options and the individual's preferences. Tell it to me straight - what do we need to be doing now and in the coming years?  I have a young child and live nearby but I can't take on too much myself.	0
Hello nice people. I have a question that may sound silly, but I am kind of a person who would prefer talking to real people if not paid doctors rather than internet articles.  Do you guys remember the first times you were aware that you started forget things?   I am 29 and I started to forget the names of the foods that I know very well, the district names of my hometown etc… These kinds of things.   I lost my grandmom a while ago due to this disease, and I am a little afraid if I may have it too. I don’t sleep early at all since 5 years, always 3-6 am, and I sleep 10 hours. Or sometimes I am up for 2 days and sleep 18 hours. Due to nature of my work.   I appreciate any response. Take care!	0
I’m a wreck. that’s all. seeing posts here where i used to check for help breaks me even more.	0
I’m 36 and my dad was diagnosed with alz last year, at 76. He lives a 25 hour drive or flight away, and I am the primary caregiver of 2 kids under 6, so visiting him regularly is not really possible.   I’m struggling because his primary caregiver (long term partner, previously known as my step-mother) is a toxic person. I won’t go into the whole back story because it would be way too long, but for the first year after he was diagnosed, she and I spoke regularly and she kept me up to date on his progress and was open about her feelings. Then in the spring they sold their home and moved closer to her daughter (which I was very happy to hear, as previously they were very isolated). But during the move she started avoiding my calls, saying she was too busy to talk. Which I’m sure she was.   But now it’s been nearly five months and she still refuses to talk to me. She won’t answer the phone and she hides whenever I am talking to my dad, so if I ask to speak to her, he just wanders around calling her name but she refuses to come to the phone.  My dad is lucid and seems happy, but I am well aware this is not the whole story. He has never been much of a conversationalist, and now our discussions are limited to a few high level ideas he repeats - mostly how nice his dog is, and how dry the weather has been.  I just... have no idea if they have any support. I have no idea how his symptoms are progressing. I have no idea how she is handling the stress of being his caregiver. Based on her behaviour over the past 25 years, I am fairly confident the answer is “not well.” I have suspected she has undiagnosed bipolar or manic depression for a long time.   I worry she will not tell me if / when he begins to decline.   I don't even know how I would be able to coordinate a visit to go see them. Do I just book a flight and show up at their house unannounced?   Anyway... thank you for listening. If you have any advice on what I can do, I will gladly listen.	0
My dad is the full-time caregiver for my mom. Mom is progressing rapidly and we're trying to get Dad some help. What do you have your in-home helper do?    My mom is super-resistant to the idea that she needs help - but Dad can't get anything done around the house when she's there and home.  We really just need someone to distract her, but Mom's not going to sit and talk calmly with anyone for a couple of hours, nor will she let anyone give her a bath or do chores she thinks she can do (dishes, trash, clean, etc).    Thanks!	0
"Hey all, I know these stories are a dime-a-dozen (I've read through all of them on this subreddit) but here we are with another. I'm really struggling with this. My dad suddenly had a bout of aggression a couple weeks ago and there were a few incidents of him harming residents and staff. He was good for about a week and the facility said they would keep trying to balance out his meds (he's been checked for infection, etc), that we had time and they'd work with us. Well, another incident happened yesterday and we are being asked to find him a new facility IN ADDITION to hiring a 24/7 caregiver to be there with him until we can move him. As you may know, caregivers are expensive so it'll run over $800/day plus the facility costs right now.   I, and the facility, have called many places for help; they wanted to send him to the hospital but we have his advanced directives as ""comfort only"" and the EMT's said the hospital wouldn't do anything; not to mention most hospitals around here are on divert because of COVID. I've spoken to all the local geriatric psychiatric units and NONE of them deal with folks with dementia. We need someone willing to help us balance out his meds AND take in a man with an aggression issue. Thankfully the facility has decided he qualifies for a hospice eval (we all suspect he's stage 7) and I should be meeting with them tomorrow. I'm hoping hospice will have some resources for me. There is one skilled nursing facility who said they'd be willing to take him but it's $12,000/month and WAY out of our price range.   I'm really stuck. Anything I haven't thought of? My local area agency on aging has not been helpful and neither Alz Association. Thanks, friends. Elder care in this country is a disgrace."	0
Title says all. All the memories I created with my dad, he has forgotten. Every 10 minutes he asks who I am and where I’m from. I always put a smile on my face saying its your son dave!! and he gets all happy about how he raised such a good son, and then it just repeats thruout the day. It’s getting difficult keeping a smile on my face. All i want to do is cry	0

I've tried searching on this in this sub, but may not be using the correct terms to find it. I know I'll need to consult with an attorney, too, but just wondering if Healthcare POA is generally the only thing needed to put a family member into a Memory Unit in a nursing home.	0
My grandpas wife just recently passed away. He has had Alzheimer’s for a few years and can never remember new information. Every morning when he wakes up it feels like the movie 50 first dates when we have to update him on everything. When he asks for his wife is it healthier for him just to lie and say “she’s out right now will be back later”? I just can’t stand watching him go through the mental pain every morning grieving the death of this wife of 68 years.	0
So he's having hard time with working memory. He works as a sales person at a pastry shop and I noticed he does mistakes in calculation 2/3 of times. Especially when there are multiple orders. I n the past 2 days, he forgot the car's key inside the car and didn't lock it. Also last week he left the pastry shop without locking it. It was literally open for theives. I took him to a neurologist last year but he assured that nothing is wrong, he asked him easy stuff like name, date and what did he ate..	0

"Hello,  I've been lurking here for years and finally feel the need to rant for a little while. My mother was diagnosed 11 years ago at age 60.  Overall, up to the end of last year it's been a very slow decline, which I understand is somewhat rare. Usually every six months or a year there was maybe a 1 point drop in the cognition test provided by her doctor. I was able to go to work and she could function at home (she proactively gave up on driving pretty early on, and finances were monitored for her) while being checked on throughout the day. Thankfully due to this sub I could read your stories and mentally prepare myself for what's to come - as much as possible anyway. I am very grateful to those who post their experiences on here. I'd like to do the same for future subscribers.  &#x200B;  In the last year we've seen a significant decrease in cognitive ability. Her last test a few months ago resulted in a 6 point drop which really surprised me. She's now struggling for words and thoughts and will need to have someone present with her pretty much at all times. Thankfully so far bathroom and hygiene practices can still be done without supervision, but I know it's only a matter of time. She can dress herself but will do things like mismatch earrings. I try not to correct small things like that as it will only agitate her.  Irritability and frustration are at an all time high. She has the desire to do things around the house but gets so mad when she can't functionally perform a task. Any attempt to help causes more confusion and thus more frustration (now directed my way). I've tried multiple approaches to helping and now think it's just a no-win scenario. My best solution at this point is to just be as proactive as possible in house chores to avoid the situation completely.   &#x200B;  The last two weeks though have been especially rough. I keep saying it would be so fascinating in how the mind works with this disease if it wasn't so damn tragic. There was a benign event that led to some significant chain reactions in thought patterns that no one could have predicted. It goes like this: Our neighbors cut down a tree in their yard. No big deal, right? Well, seeing workers outside in *their* yard made her believe they were in *our* yard cutting down *our* tree. She would frequently go outside in the backyard to check on her tree. In a day or two the thought process morphed into her believing the old neighbors moved out (they didn't) and new ones moved in that wanted to cut down the fence and take over our yard. I explain that is not the case but it's useless. A few more days go by and the fixation on the ""new neighbors"" morphs into her wanting to say hi to them. At least it's not negative paranoid thoughts anymore. Now, after a few days of wanting to meet the ""new neighbors"", she is under the impression that it is us that recently moved in. I keep getting questions like ""Do we live in a town?"" and ""I'd really like to see the schools and what downtown looks like"" in a city she has lived in for 30 years. There's been casual mentions of wanting to go walking outside to look around, which is very concerning. Is it time for child proof locks? Probably.   &#x200B;  I suppose this stage was inevitable. I just find it so interesting that we got here from a goddamn tree. It's almost funny. Now when she looks around at a house she no longer recognizes as hers, it brings thoughts of insecurity and more confusion. This disease took most of her personality a long time ago. Now it's taking her sense of security and comfortability in her own home. And again, this has been overall such a slow decline over 11 years. Now we are hitting warp speed. I quit my job a few months ago to stay home. I don't believe she would respond well to caregivers that she doesn't know.   &#x200B;  And this is terrible - but I just want it over with. I sincerely don't want to be insensitive to those who lost/are losing their loved ones quickly. My heart goes out to you and I apologize if I come across as uncaring. I can't begin to comprehend your struggles when I read about them here. But I can't help but be envious to some degree. This has been so prolonged. I just want to rip the band-aid off and get it over with. In my mind, the person who was my mother died a long time ago. I've already grieved her death and made peace with it. However she was replaced with this deteriorating broken shell who is clearly suffering, but can't be fixed. It's a mind-fuck. Literally. And the guilt! I feel guilty for even writing this. That is SO weird. I feel guilty for having these thoughts. I feel guilty for making it about me and not the person with the actual disease. It's crazy. And it's no wonder care-giver depression is a thing. I wish I understood that early on because it combined with the general mental health crisis from the world today is really taking a toll.    &#x200B;  So, with all that, thank you if you are still reading. I apologize for rambling. I again want to say that I am grateful to those who post their experiences on this sub. I really appreciate the stories that allow for much needed perspective on the timeline/milestones of this disease and all of the advice on how to cope along with it. I wish you and your loved ones all the best."	0
"Hi everyone; I'm new here, so forgive me if I'm overlooking posts on this topic. My grandma is living in a senior living facility that I find to be garbage. She is getting neglected, being served terrible food, everyone who works there keeps getting annoyed at her for wandering despite telling us they needed to charge more to move her to a ""memory care unit"" (in other words, a smaller room that is now shared with someone worse off where she can't really watch TV and is barely being monitored, despite the higher price tag). There is no special memory care being provided. She has now had multiple falls. I believe staff is stealing some of the items we send. No one can tell us what's happening or why she is falling. Supposedly they have cameras everywhere but the rooms (okay? So what goes on in the rooms if staff are abusive?), but every time she falls or someone hurts her, they ""don't have cameras in that area"". Just pure B.S. and she deserves better than this. I am trying to figure out ways to get money coming in so I can try to figure out a better situation (her money for this facility is running out quickly), but I have health issues that make a lot of jobs very difficult. I guess I'm wondering a few things:     \-What is the typical cost (in California) for live-in care? I wonder if it might be cheaper to rent a small house or apartment and hire someone, but it could be more? I mean, her current facility's costs are exorbitant, but I don't know if it would be cheaper to hire someone and pay rent for a little place instead.   \-How do you find a really wonderful caregiver? How do you make sure they treat your loved one well? Cameras?   \-Does anyone find that there are people who would be happy with some kind of arrangement where they get free rent (or low rent) in exchange for providing care services, or something like that?    \-Her house is in shambles. I'd like to find a way to fix and rebuild it; and I'm looking into starting my own building/design firm or trying to get investors to build some new, unique kind of senior care facility that's really nurturing and innovative, but I don't know what I'll be able to pull off. It obviously costs money for all of these options.    \-I cannot find a facility that seems good for less than what she pays for this current one, which is crazy. Maybe I'm not looking in the right spot but hers is over $5k a month. I would think that we would be able to find a solution for less than that, one where she is happy and well-cared-for, where people actually love her instead of neglecting and snapping at her. Our family is just at a loss and her money is running out fast. We don't want to sell her house; it's been in our family for a long time and we love it. I would love to be able to fix it someday and bring my future children there; but it might take me a few years to be able to buy it. Right now, my older relatives feel like they might have to just sell it. We don't know how to look for other places to move her to. My doctor just started this amazing place, but it's $12k a month...Impossible right now. Where can I look for better facilities that don't cost so much? How do we know they're reputable beyond Yelp? Any ideas?     I know this is long, so thank you for reading. I would be so grateful for any help, resources, ideas or a direction to look in. I guess I will ask the Alzheimer's Association, too. I hope you all stay well and safe. Thank you!"	0
Hello, I have been taking care of my grandmother for quite some time now. She has suffered from depression, anxiety, chronic pain, and recently broke her hip and leg in a fall last year.   Recently, in August, she began to complain of hearing voices/conversations about her, hearing people knocking on her bedroom wall from the exterior of the house, invasive thoughts about homosexuality and pedophilia, and extreme, extreme anger. She’s very conspiratorial and secretive.  Initially, I was told that she was suffering from Opioid Induced Delusions; she has been in high doses of morphine, gabbapentin, trazodone, along with sertraline, levothyroxine, and lisinopril.   I began to taper her down from all of these per her doctors orders; she was taking 4 morphine 15mg tabs per day, and 5 gabbapentin (unk mg) per day. I have successfully tapered her down to 1 15mg morphine per day at night, and 2 100mg gabbapentin per day. But I haven’t seen any improvement, in fact things have gotten worse.  I am starting to become worried; she has so many ailments that I don’t know where to start. She is 72 and prone to UTI’s due to catheter use, and I have read that can cause similar issues. She also has issue with liver function due to high amounts of OTC Tylenol in the past because the morphine wasn’t working, and I have read that can cause an issue as well.  Now, I was told my a friend who works in asssisted living that she believes it may be Alzheimer’s; all of the early symptoms seem to be there, except for the forgetfulness (she knows how to do stuff, but she will forget words or how to use her tv remote, or she will forget what you just told her, like she asks what’s for dinner 3-4 times).  I was hoping that maybe I could get some insight from those who have dealt with this first hand, does what I described fit any of the criteria? Any help is appreciated.	0
No idea if any of this will make sense, I'm just putting words down and hopefully it means something. Maybe it just feels good to talk about it.  My wonderful, loving, charismatic, brilliant father has been on the decline over the last few years and was diagnosed with Alzheimer's earlier this year. It wasn't a surprise to anyone, but it hurt to hear out loud none the less.  He's confused, unable to fully track conversations, and agitated by things that break his routines, but he's still my dad right now. He still knows me and loves me and lights up when I walk through the front door just like he always has. The dad I knew my whole life is deteriorating but for now it's still feels... small, I guess? minor? It still feels like if he could just stop declining he could live a happy life with his family. His condition impacts his day to day, but it hasn't had a major impact on our relationship yet.   I'm so proud of him for how gracefully he's dealt with this so far. I know he feels shame, embarrassment, frustration, and pain with his diagnosis and what he's losing, but he has stayed so positive and has been so vulnerable in describing the way things are making him feel. His eyes well up with tears when we talk about the future. It's heartbreaking. He knows he won't be around for all of it.   I'm trying really hard to stay positive too. I'm so grateful that I was able to move back to my home town and that I get to spend so much time with him. I think about people who's parents died or will die unexpectedly - a car crash, covid, cancer - and feel so lucky that I've been given enough of a warning that I get to cherish him for a while more. I give him longer, tighter, and more frequent hugs than I ever have before. I'm not sure if he notices. I hope he doesn't because I know it would make him sad to think about why.   Yesterday it occurred to me that this sub probably existed and I went down a several hour rabbit hole of reading through hundreds of posts here. I just read and read and read and couldn't look away. I cried a lot too. I think it made me face the reality of what my family and I have ahead of us. I'm at the tip of a painful iceberg and reading the posts here took from me any hope of downplaying how massive the iceberg really is.   I'm really fucking scared. I'm scared of how hard this will become. I'm scared of how much pain my dad will go through. I'm scared that my mom will sacrifice her physical and mental health taking care of him. I'm scared it will be too heartbreaking for her to watch her life partner, her best friend, her lover, her first line of support, her biggest cheer leader, her everything, slowly slip away leaving a shell of a person for us to care for. I'm scared it will be too heartbreaking for me. I'm scared that by the time he dies, I'll have watched him suffer for so long that I feel relief more than anything else.   All of that said, I can't explain how encouraging it is to see everyone here supporting each other the way you all do. This sub scared the shit out of me, but I'm so glad I've found it because I know I'll have a community of people I can talk to, ask questions to, support, and be supported as each of our own personal tragedies unfold.   Thanks for reading :)	0
We had our wedding in June, but mom can’t fly/be around too many people because of the disease. So we’re having a private ceremony just the 3 of us! Mom used to love getting dressed to the nines, so I’ll make that happen, but any suggestions for how to make the ceremony memorable? Almost thinking to make it “her” centric and have amazing pictures and good memories with her (I’ve already had my big day!). Thoughts? We’re going to dinner afterwards at a nice restaurant	0
"My mom (64) is now entering the territory of asking about people who have been dead for years as if she's wondering what they're up to. Last week, it was her uncle (her mom's brother) who has been gone since 2008, and today, it's her mom, who has been gone since 2004.  I'm terrible at the lying to try to redirect, and obviously telling her they've passed away years ago is an emotional roller coaster and not easy either. Also, the lying to redirect makes me uncomfortable, because what happens when she says ""can I see/talk to them?"" I know she may just forget after we've changed topics, but she still has some slight short term memory, and the way some of these conversations are repeating, it wouldn't surprise me to be asked tomorrow ""hey when can I talk to my mom like you said I could,"" or some variation of that.  If you've read my other posts, you know I'm struggling in general with the care of my mom and coping with her Alzheimer's in general. We've been at the point for two months now, where she doesn't realize that I'm her daughter, and she is constantly asking me what my name is. Last night, she told me she wanted to ""go back to dad's"" because she wasn't having ""any fun here."" Here is our home, where she's lived with me for nearly 9 months, and there hasn't been dad to go back to since 1977. It really feels like she's in early-middle adolescence with the way she'll say or ask for things. The going back to dad's comment makes me feel like her parents sent her to stay with me for the summer or something and she's homesick. Today, that kind of echoed after she asked about her mom and said ""they told me the whole reason I was going to come here was to have fun, but I'm not having any fun.""  She knows obviously who her mom is, but ask her who I am, she'll say I'm her mom. The wires are crossed so badly, and it's both sudden and unexpected, while still being expected. The progression she is riding through is unreal. The way she's just so nonchalant about everything scares me and makes me so sad. I know it's all real, but it still feels so unreal. Like I'm waiting for someone to jump out and say ""gotcha!"" I'm just having such a difficult time coping. Any advice is always appreciated.  Oh, one more unrelated thing, her toileting accidents are becoming more and more frequent, but the last two times now, she has been so adamant that she didn't do it as if someone else peed all over the bed and the floor, or that someone else pooped in her pants. I really just have to pretend like it doesn't matter and go along with it, don't I? I know there's really no point in arguing, it's just such a struggle for me to let go."	0
Yes grandma you’ve been in bed all day. No midnight is not the time to get up. I was hoping to get some sleep. I’ll give you an iPad to watch “your telly program” in bed. Well if it’s too warm there why did you want a hot water bottle 15 minutes ago? If you wouldn’t get out of bed for the nurse because you’re too ill this afternoon, you don’t need to be up now.	0
When grandma complains there are too many vegetables in her meal and she couldn’t eat it all. I take away her pudding. Because she can have it tomorrow instead. She quickly says it’s all fine.	0
Here's a summary of posts today 1. Dementia is not necessarily hereditary, but you can still get it 2. No supplements can treat Dementia but can help relieve some symptoms 3. Smilz oil/gummies could help calm them, relieve anxiety and improve sleep 4. NZT-48 could help improve memory and reverse symptoms of early onset dementia 5. Magnesium is also good for the brain.  What else am I forgetting?	0
Hi everyone!  We are still recruiting for the University of California San Diego Caregiver study!

My grandfather passed away before my mom could participate in this program, but it sounded interesting and might help someone else. It is all online and they provide a tablet.   https://leafstudy.ucsf.edu  Alzheimer’s sucks the energy out of caregivers and families, so hugs to all the families dealing with it!	0
"I'm not sure how to convince my dad to get the flu shot and COVID booster. He refuses to go because he thinks he doesn't have insurance. I just need some advice to understand my dad's thought process so I can counter it.  I've tried explaining that every month he gets medicine from the pharmacy and it's covered by insurance. The nurse that comes every week is covered by insurance. He thinks that's something else covered by the state. At one point he understood that he has insurance so the medicine and nurse are covered, but thought his insurance just got canceled a few days ago...so he can't get the vaccine now.  I've also tried saying that we can pay for it because the flu shot is like $25 and the COVID booster is free. He thinks I'm lying about the cost. I've tried showing him the cost online, but he can't really process what he reads. Sometimes it takes him days to understand a few sentences.  I said he hasn't paid for anything in years, so I'm not sure why he thinks he would even pay for it. We handle all the bills. Then he goes off onto how nothing has ever been paid and the government is going to come and seize the house. I've said that we pay all the bills. If we didn't then they would shut it off. He cannot process that. He just knows I'm wrong.  I've also said that if he doesn't have insurance then it would be cheaper to just get the vaccines because the hospital bill would be very high. He just ignores that and goes back to ""I don't have insurance so I can't get a vaccine.""  I just don't know what to say to convince him."	0
I am a mentally ill 34/F and both my uncles and mother have left me the primary care of my grandparents who both have dementia. I cannot do anything without being harassed by my grandmother. Since I'm the only one that is always with them my grandma takes everything out on me. I can't go out of the house, i can't do anything i like, i have to be within her eyesight all day. I am trying to complete my college degree and nothing angers her more than me leaving for class and coming back past 3pm. She screams that she is more important than me obtaining an education. Last night she was being verbally abusive and I tried to choke her. I feel like shit.	0
So a few days ago I found a camcorder my parents bought years ago and decided to charge it and see what was on it. It had videos I don’t remember recording, things I remember happening but not remembering they were recorded. Everything was from 8 to 10 years old.  So as I went through them, there was a video I recorded of my mom and it was pointed at her face. I watched it and I started bawling. Hearing her talk, laugh, make facial expressions, move around, and just look like a real living person broke me. I just rewatched a bit and I’m full on crying while trying to type this. She looks and sounds so much different it’s terrifying.  There was another video I took of my brother being silly and he walked into our kitchen and she was in there too. Seeing her opening the refrigerator, walking to the sink to grab wipes from underneath, and speaking doesn’t even seem real. Comparing her from then to now is crushing.   I’m so fucking pissed this goddamn disease literally killed my mom. She doesn’t even resemble the person she once was and it’s so scary. I miss her even though my memory can only remember how she’s been in recent years. I miss my mom and who she used to be. It’s not fucking fair my mom is now a walking corpse and a shell of who she was. I just want my mom back.	0
Oh. My. Goodness.  I think it's always best to leave family members (who don't want to help) out of the care situation entirety.   It's not good to ask, or expect anything from them. It only causes hardship.  Summary is that my heart breaks for my wife who has two sisters, one who is very helpful and another who isn't at all...and refuses it. However unhelpful sister likes to make comments about decisions that have been made regarding care giving.   The family politics and drama is insane. I'm sure I'm not alone in this.	0
Xplora X5 play smart watch for kids- great for wanderers/walkers who forget their phone. Lots of videos on YouTube   Edit- the geocaching is all of a sudden working and I am getting notifications when he leaves his safe zones. I did an app update and it has started working today!  My dad has Alzheimer’s but is still able to live alone but we are on the last hurrah of independent living because he has always been an avid walker/hiker and it is the “dangerous” activity that is only a matter of time before he becomes disoriented. Right now he still knows his routes and neighborhood. He has recently started forgetting his phone when he sets off for his walks and I stress when I can’t get him on the phone or track where he is through his phone. We recently got him a smart watch that is geared for kids so it is user friendly enough for him to use but looks like an adult smart watch. From my research you have to be careful when you buy these watches as they don’t work in every country and you have to make sure your cell phone carrier can support it. I am located in British Columbia Canada and I was able to add a line to my Rogers cell phone plan to get a SIM card and phone number for the watch at an additional $50/month on my plan. When I went into the store the Rogers sales associate told me he couldn’t guarantee that it would work perfectly and it might be glitchy. He told me he could only guarantee that an Apple Watch would work perfectly. An Apple Watch is too complicated for my dad and has too many features he doesn’t need and it doesn’t have the ability to geocache “safe zone notifications” like the kids smart watches do. The one we got is called the Xplora X5 play. He wears the watch and I can monitor him through the app on my phone. The watch allows him to send and receive calls, text messages,instant messages, take pictures and it is VERY accurately GPS tracked. I am able to set up “safe zone notifications “ in the map from my map so I get a notification if he leaves his home or if he enters the shopping Center. I find the geocaching isn’t working very well (I am not getting notifications when he leaves the safe zones I have created) but it is new so I might not have set it up properly but according to reviews I’ve read that function hasn’t worked for a few people. It isn’t the biggest deal though because I can always see where he is regardless if I get the notification sent to my phone that he is on the move. The gps is so accurate that if I drill down on the map when he is at home I can see what part of the house he is in. When we were running errands I kept my eye on the accuracy of the gps all day and it was bang on every step. When we were in the mall I could drill down on our location and i could see the name of the store we were standing in front of on the map. It has taken away all my stress that he will forget his phone at home and get disoriented on a walk and I can’t reach him. If he falls- his phone is right on his wrist. I can always call his wrist and track where he is and the routes he has been taking so I can see if anything starts becoming outside of the normal (like he goes off course on a new route I didn’t know about or if he all of a sudden starts going for out of character 2am walks around the block. I’ll see it the next morning when I wake up the first time it happens when I check the tracking history from the night before. So far we are not there yet but when things change they change fast and I want to be ahead of the safety game. If I can get the geocaching notifications to work I’ll know if he does it in real time I will be alerted if he steps out of his home which I cached as a “safe zone”. The geo caching should work and maybe when they release an update it will work for me on my iOS). It is also handy when I am meeting up with him somewhere outside the house- he doesn’t have the stress of trying to describe where he is or give directions to me which is something he obsesses over. It’s one of his “things”  The battery lasts 8 days on standby. This appears to be accurate. With all day constant use the first day we got the watch and played around with it more than it would normally be used it still only used up 30% battery in the first 24 hours. You can see what the battery life of the watch is at through the app which I find handy in case I am not with him I can see if his battery is low and remind him to charge it. A full charge takes about an hour.  I find the calling, texting and gps features work perfectly and the only issue I’m having is with the geocache notifications. However, this watch is android and I have the app that runs the watch on my iPhone. I wouldn’t be surprised if android cell users would get the geocache notifications. But it is working like a peach considering it’s an android and I’m controlling it from iOS- only the geocache notifications are glitchy and that is okay.  Dad always liked Star Trek and he is GETTING A KICK out of holding his watch up to his ear and mouth to talk on the phone. He says he feels like a futuristic Star Trek character. The watch is plain black so it doesn’t look child-like at all like some of them do. The speaker is loud enough that you don’t have to put your hand up to your mouth or ear when you are at home talking on the phone but when we tested it in the mall he had to put the watch right up to his ear and he could hear fine and I could hear him fine on my end. The ringer is quite loud (his hearing is fine) and it also vibrates AND rings when someone is calling so it would be great for people with hearing issues.  This watch would be useful for Alzheimer’s because really the only function they need to be able to do is answer a call on it if someone calls. The gps will always work. Even if they can’t understand how to dial out as long as they know to hit the green phone button to pick up you can be in contact. That’s ALL they really need to do to make this useful. The screen is very basic and user friendly for kids so it is the better option to adult smart watches. Dad is struggling a bit but IS getting MOST of it. All the important parts. He can dial in and out. Hasn’t mastered the voice text messages yet- that’s a new one to him. He has even been sleeping in the watch. I asked him if it bugged him in his sleep and he said not at all. I find comfort in being a dial away on his wrist while he is laying in bed.  I wish Apple would make a smart watch for the elderly. It would be SO useful. I have a list of a few functions I think that would be useful for the elderly that would be different than kids needs. A 2 way radio function where you can hear their surroundings even if they don’t pick up and communicate where they don’t have to press a button on their end? Or a notification if they try to spend over $500 on a banking card that is linked? Can someone please make a call and make this happen?  If phone scammers ever become a problem we will cut off his cell phone and just have him use the watch. The reason for this is that only phone numbers that I put into the contact list on the app can call or receive calls from the watch. It’s a safety feature geared for children but it will be great when he gets to the point he might fall for a telephone scammer. The watch holds 50 contacts. Right now it is important he still has his own phone and he can track his kids whereabouts from the app on his phone still. It is only fair if we can track him he can track us and his phone is part of his independence. He has just never been remembering to bring his phone with him. He will leave it upstairs and go downstairs or outside all day and I sit at work with my stomach turning. This has taken that stress away completely.  Xplora X5 play smart watch for kids/wanderers- works on a Rogers SIM card in Canada.	0
My grandmother is 88 years old and lives in her own separate house located on our property. She's been diagnosed with alzheimers about 1 year ago and since then she's been rapidly declining. Today she was out with my mother and I got the job to go take a look around her house cause we have the feeling she hasn't been taking her medication (we put her medication in a pill box every day and hand it to her in the morning and she brings us back the empty box in the evening). She has forgotten to take her medication before and then quickly emptied her pill box out and put the pills in a drawer so that we wouldn't tell her off, so I checked there first and there was 1 pill. I moved some papers aside and there was a whole cup full of what mustve been 30+pills. I was sorta shocked. I decided to keep looking around and when I checked her pantry my heart sank. I found all kinds of medications tucked away between kitchen towels and food. 3 boxes of aspirin, imodium, codeine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, paracodine, boxes of her blood pressure medication.. I don't know how she got them  cause they're not expired so they can't be that old.  I left everything the way I found it and I guess we'll just tell her doctor about this.  It makes me wonder if she can be trusted to live on her own anymore and if maybe it's time for her to go to a nursing home. Moving into our house isn't really an option, this situation is already extremely stressful at times.  Is this a common thing with alzheimers? How do you make someone take their medicine when they just lie about it? We've tried to make her take it while we're standing there but then she gets offended and says we act as if she's a child.	0

I’m not sure how far along he is in medical terms. I’m too afraid of upsetting my mother by asking. I’m 20 and in college and rarely have any free time to travel up and see him. I see him maybe once a month. His memory is foggy but he still remembers his loved ones and most important things. I’m worried that his memory is going to slip by before I have the chance to spend enough time with him. I’ve never experienced anything like this in my life. I know the worst is only yet to come and I am terrified of that.   He told me that I should pick up the piano again. I am so exhausted by my degree that it’s hard to do anything outside of it. I need to try for him, though.  I don’t know exactly what I’m here to ask. I just want someone to hear me, I suppose.	0
I’m really worried for my mom (55) lately she’s been forgetting more and more regarding simple things. Like if she locked the door, put away food, closed the water faucet. She even forgets when she asks me questions, and will ask me multiple times. I’m really worried that she might be developing Alzheimers. My grandmother also had Alzheimers so I was wondering, is it hereditary? I’m just really worried for her and was wondering if you all could give me some tips to know if she’s developing Alzheimers and how I could aid her. Thank you!	0
"Thank you for your help. This is my second post ever. (My post was to post this one in r/legaladvice)  My father-in-law (FIL) was recently diagnosed with brain and lung cancer. It's expected that he will be gone within a few months. The stress of this news has rapidly progressed what we believe to be dementia in his wife (mother-in-law - MIL). Before my FIL's diagnoses, we had been unsuccessfully trying to get my mil to a doctor for proper diagnoses, but she hates ""traditional medicine"" (anti-vax, anti-everything) and refused to go. We were trying firmly, but there didn't seem to be a massive urgency since we were only seeing small hints of dementia and my FIL was healthy and of sound mind.  Since FIL's diagnoses, the stress of everything has *rapidly* accelerated her decline. She has entirely changed in less than 4 weeks and now can't be left alone. My FIL has taken care of his affairs, but everything gets left to MIL. MIL has a paranoid delusion that everyone wants to steal her stuff. She will NOT sign a will, power-of-attorney, or any other end-of-life/post-life documents. And she will NOT go to receive any medical care. It's important to know that she has very few assets to worry about. I make more in a year than she has total. So she's not protecting a fortune. My wife just needs the authority to take care of it all when she's gone. And, the most important part, my wife will most likely have to pay MIL's bills and take care of all other daily affairs after my FIL passes. MIL cannot manage even a few hours on her own at this point.  We have no plans to put her in a home. We have space for her here and people around to help. But if MIL survives for a while, we may have to sell her house because it's an unmanageable hoarder nightmare. She can't live there. FIL kept an area clean and livable, but MIL was too much for him to keep it all nice. Now that he is sick, she has ruined every bit of that house.  My question: Without an official diagnosis, what can my wife do to take over MILs affairs so bills can get paid and the house can get taken care of?"	0
Has anyone here heard of or had any experience with your loved one ever taking Vesicare(Solifenacin) which is used to treat overactive bladder but also has a significant risk of dementia in middle-aged and older patients.   I just this out and my father who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s 8 months ago has been on this drug since 2014.   I’m just learning all this now and I’m a little floored. So wanted to see if anyone out there had come across anything like this.  Thank you.	0
"My mom (63) is taking care of my father (78) who's Alzheimer's has been   getting worst and worst quickly since he retired and the pandemic started. Lately he has not recognized her much and thinks she is ""another Rose."" He asks her to take him home most days even though he is home so he can go back to his wife Rose. Today my mom said he wouldn't go to bed and was mad that she wouldn't ""take him home."" He told her to make sure she closes her door because he might come and hit her. And that she doesn't know what she has done and that she has created so many problems.   &#x200B;  My mom doesn't know what to do in these situations. Does anyone have any advice I can give her?"	0
I recently began helping to care for my grandma. I noticed when something is out of place or wrong in some way, I try to fix it as soon as possible. Ie she's  running out of something, the hummingbird feeders need more food, etc. She gets stuck on that one thing until it is resolved, bringing it up a several times throughout the day. It's obvious she's worried about it. She knows she isn't able to solve those problems.on her own anymore.   Now, I try to fix the issue immediately so she isn't stressed, but I am wondering if I shouldn't  do that? If  I solve every issue, is that going to make her less able to deal with other stressors I don't have control over? Or is it for the best to make her time that she is still aware, easier for her?  Any thoughts on this would be helpful!	0
A little bit of a back story. My grandpa wants to have a family vacation. Unfortunately my grandmother has Alzheimer’s. For a few years she’s shown decline but it all really went downhill during pandemic and shutdown. Her speech is really affected. It’s hard to understand what she is saying. She has anxiety. She’ll have good days but then other days where she thinks we’re trying to kill her. Her anxiety gets worse if she’s tired too. Fortunately she can still care for her basic needs like brush her teeth, dress herself, use the bathroom. She remembers who her family is even if she forgets our names. And she also isn’t violent or rude. She’s very sweet. Everyone at her drs office loves her. I feel like my grandpa wants to have this family vacation because he feels like it might the last chance he’ll be able to with my grandma. We’ve seen a decline since the pandemic started and we’re afraid that it’s only going to get worse. That’s why I was wondering if anyone has any advice on traveling with some with Alzheimer’s or maybe someone has good reasons as to why we shouldn’t travel with her. I’m really open to hearing any type of advice or suggestions. We live in the usa and we were thinking of traveling on plane somewhere close (like 3 or 4 hours away).	0
My question is 2-fold. One to offer myself as a study to help progress research in this awful disease and also to hopefully catch it quick/ early. I am a 38F with a strong family history of Alzheimer's. While I have not been diagnosed, I know that (based on my experience) that once you're diagnosed, the writing is on the wall, so to speak... and I see symptoms (possibly) already. Is there some research study group that I can join that may benefit the research and possibly give more data to my impending diagnosis that my help my own journey or (dare I say) treatment in the Central Texas area? All I am finding is studies for people who are already diagnosed...	0
I came on here a while ago because I was in desperate need of some support due to my mom’s diagnosis. It’s been an incredibly stressful year, although I’ve been experiencing profound personal growth that I sometimes feel guilty for even finding the time to explore. Taking over someone’s entire life paperwork and becoming a POA feels like second job, I’m burnt out half the time and I shut down for a week at a time after each new “task,” because it’s never just that, is it? It’s a reminder that my parent is deteriorating and that I’m preparing for some difficult stuff, it hits me like a wave and takes so much out of me. I stop going out, not interested in entertainment, leave my books half read, and I mean forget about working out, I can’t even lift my arms. Everything halts like a bad depressive episode. It doesn’t happen every single time thankfully, and I’m getting better at bouncing back.  I couldn’t continue with the support group, doesn’t feel right yet. I guess because she hasn’t progressed too much since the new meds, or the fact that I feel bad for people who have it worse, fear of hearing about what’s to come, or all of the above. My siblings and I have been venting and supporting each other through it so I guess that kind of took over as well. I appreciate that we have a more matter of fact approach about it with each other.  Does anyone else with parents with Alzheimer’s wonder about their future with the disease? Can we stop saying it’s not guaranteed to happen? I mean maybe it’s not… but I feel that in order to defy the odds, you better have a damn good life. I mean no trauma, mental stress or other mental illness (bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety), have good sleeping habits, diet and exercise. Some of that we can control. But I’ve experienced a lot of trauma, and it makes me wonder how much damage has been done. My mom’s came on so damn early. She had some signs as early as her late 40s and we didn’t even figure it out. Her fucking late 40s. I want a family but I could never imagine putting this kind of pain and stress on people I love. I feel like I should just enjoy the time I have and do some good in the world, enjoy my hobbies &amp; career, travel, and just make a decision about my quality of life later on if I notice anything alarming… sorry if that’s dark. But another part of me wonders if that’s just a fear based decision that will rob me of having a husband and kids, and feeling that completeness I always wanted under my own roof. Who knows.	0
"Just some good news that I really wanted to share with some people.   Background: I am in college (19F), my father is (83M) and was diagnosed with Alzheimer's about a year and a half ago but has been suffering form memory decline as well as health issues for far longer dating all the way back to about my freshman year of high school. We've always been close due to the fact that we're very similar personality wise and his Alzheimer's has been hitting me really hard, especially since I'm so young and am currently in college so I'm no longer always there to help him.   He's always loved music. He played in his school's band growing up and either has perfect pitch or something extremely close to it, to the point that he never learned to read music and simply listened and recreated it the next moment. His birthday was last month and I bought two tickets for him to see the symphony that was putting on a Beethoven concert in the city where I go to college (him and my mom live about an hour away in a smaller city that doesn't have these kind of opportunities.)   I bought the tickets for him and my mom to go, intending it to be a sort of date, but my mom told me that I should go with him. I've always been musical as well, not to the extent that my father was, but it's always something my dad and I have been able to bond over. My mom, in comparison, is hilariously tone-deaf and readily admits so. So, I agreed and my dad and I decided to go together instead.   I took my parents out to dinner beforehand and then me and my dad went to the symphony while my mom went to a bookstore.   My dad loved it.   Loved it is a total understatement. He was absolutely enthralled with the music. I bought the cheapest tickets available (college am i right lol) but they ended up being in the very front row. I was worried it might be too loud for my dad with his hearing aids, but he didn't complain or say anything. The entire time he was watching with so much attention and joy and wouldn't stop telling me how exciting it was to be so close to a real orchestra and how he'd never been to a symphony before.   He cried multiple times. Tears of joy and not unusual bc my dad's always been more sensitive and his emotional regulation has gotten worse with the Alzheimer's. During intermission he sat and talked to me about how wonderful this was and would sing some of the parts from the symphony that he thought were particularly amazing.   When it ended it was far later then my dad usually stays up (he's old and was a military man so he's usually in bed by 6-7 PM) but he was so full of energy afterward!! On the car ride back to meet with my mom he continued to tell me how magnificent it was, how much he enjoyed it, how grateful he was to me for taking him, etc.  I hadn't seen him smile that much in months.   It was such a surreal experience. I was so happy that I could do something so good for my dad, bring him some joy in his life again. He told me hat it was something he'd ""never forget"" and even though I know that's probably not true, it almost brought tears to my eyes hearing it. My mom was glad that she got to take some 'her' time (she lives with my dad, is younger then him, and although my dad is still capable of basic functions my mom always cooks and cleans) and I was happy to have done something so good for both my parents.   TL;DR my dad has Alzheimer's and loves music. I bought him and me symphony tickets and he absolutely adored it. It was a magical experience for my dad that I'll cherish forever."	0
It seems to be having the opposite effect. Have other folks had this experience? It’s getting to the point where the memory care facility might ask us to find another facility.	0
Been a full time caregiver to my gran for 3 years. The next time someone says “you should try looking after kids” I will scream at them.	0
I just finished watching 'The Father', a new film released about Dementia, starring Sir Anthony Hopkins.     It is incredible.     Without saying too much about it, the film successfully manages to paint a vivid picture of this awful disease and how it affects both the patient and family members.     It really hits home. Moreover, it has given me a much-needed boost of sympathy (which I hope will last). The next time i lose my patience I will try my absolute best to rise above it and imagine just how scary it must be.     Go watch it and spread the word on this film if you can. The more awareness this awful condition gets the more chance it has that one day a cure will arrive.	0
"I've posted about my mom a couple of times before, and she's even worse since the first time I posted a couple of months ago. I guess I just need to vent. She's 64 and was diagnosed with early-onset in July after a year of suspicions, ruling everything else out, and trying to get to the point of diagnosis.  She has lived with me for 8 months as of last week, and I am really just trying to catch my breath at the realization of how bad she's gotten in this timeframe. She already doesn't recognize me, though she knows I am someone she is comfortable with. She thinks she has another daughter, another version of me. Earlier this week, she even tried to tell me she had kids, plural. It's constantly ""my shady-pines-ma,"" ""the other shady-pines-ma,"" but if I ask her what my name is, she'll say it's her name, or she just doesn't know. I asked her if she had other kids, why aren't they here taking care of her, and of course, she doesn't know how to answer that. Sometimes, she'll call out ""mom"" as if she is genuinely calling for her mom to come do something for her. Last week, she asked me if I knew where mom was. Or sometimes, she'll ask me where my mom is. I knew we would deal with that at some point, I just didn't know it would be this soon. She doesn't resonate with the way she used to tell me she loved me ""I love you to infinity and beyond,"" or ""you are my happy thought"" anymore.   She'll ask me if I know her brothers (my uncles), or she'll ask me if I knew her parents, and then in the same breath, she'll threaten them in some way for ""not telling her"" about me as if it's some sort of conspiracy. It's so rough and surreal. I know she's basically Benjamin Buttoning, and I feel like we're in her teenage years right now, but also teetering on toddler. The way she talks back to me sometimes now can be incredibly upsetting, especially if I'm already at my bullshit limit for the day. I don't think I ever had the same attitude with her when I was an actual teenager. She has also said some incredibly awful and mean spirited things to me like wishing that I get Alzheimer's and die when she's really upset. I'm truly at the point where I wish she would just die already, and it hurts me so much to think that when I used to be terrified at the thought of life without her. I know it will be a bittersweet relief when she is finally gone.  She cannot be left alone, even if I'm only just outside for a short amount of time, and when I am able to get someone to look after her for a short while, she has major separation anxiety and just cannot settle down and is very restless. It's exhausting. I went out to organize something in the garage, left her with a show on, things should have been fine. Came back inside after 30 minutes, she had eaten 4/6 bananas that I had bought barely 12 hours before from grocery shopping last night. They were meant to last her the whole week. She also had taken her shirt off, but was very adamant that she only ate one banana and that I had told her to take her shirt off. The four banana peels in the garbage and the half of a banana I found on top of the toilet says otherwise. I now have what are supposed to be child proof covers on my deadbolt locks and child proof door knob covers on my doors in an effort to prevent her from wandering out unsafely and getting lost. I'm screwed if she figures out the deadbolt covers in particular. I'm really hoping the doorknob covers are enough of a deterrent as well, but I know she could totally figure them out if she really wanted to. We'll see about those I guess and hope for the best.   I spent a good chunk of change on a really nice medical ID bracelet, and she does a great job of keeping it on 24/7, so there's that, but she really has no idea how to use her phone anymore, and there would be zero guarantee she could use it or even think to use it in an emergency. I almost feel like it might just be best to cancel her phone plan and direct anyone who wants to talk to her to call me. Does anyone have any input on that? I'm genuinely curious to know how you've handled your loved one's phone privileges. She also says she sees people and hears voices telling her things. It's always ""someone was here,"" ""they said this,"" ""last night when they were here,"" etc., but she can never actually tell me what ""they"" are doing or saying to her. She really can't tell me anything of purpose anymore, or when she does seem like she has something to say, it's never anything relevant, and it's all half thought out and incomplete with zero sense to be made of it. She still has most of her speech function, but it is limited and childlike, or just straight up delusional.  She is constantly moving and hiding things that belong to both of us. She won't stop taking pictures I have out of frames, especially ones of me as a child because they're pictures of *her* shady-pines-ma. She's lost two that I've now had on my refrigerator for years, and they're the only copies of these two pictures in particular that I had. I ended up taking everything decorative off of the fridge in defeat. She'll take things from my craft workspace and put them on her nightstand. She put a metal canning jar lid in the toilet. She took the finial off of her nightstand lamp one morning, I screwed it back on, and then later in the day it was gone and completely missing. The TV remote is currently MIA for the past few days. We can turn it on and at least watch streaming stuff through the other input, but it's stuck on one channel for now until we can find it. When she's not doing that, she's pulling books, CDs and DVDs off of the bookshelf and spreading them all over the room. I'm going to be boxing those up this weekend in an out of sight, out of mind, effort.  She can't bathe herself completely anymore. If she is supposed to be washing her hair or her body, she'll just pour shampoo or body wash into her hands and rub her hands together vigorously, but in the same breath, has no idea what she's supposed to do to wash her hands in the sink. She doesn't know how to brush her teeth anymore. She can't go to the bathroom independently anymore most of the time, I'm having to be in there pulling her pants down and making her sit on the toilet. My subconscious has learned to wake up in the mornings on the weekend when I hear her wandering into the bathroom, and I hate it. Otherwise, she'll just sit on the toilet fully clothed and pee. The disposable underwear can only hold so much. She pooped her pants again earlier this week (we're now on the third time that's happened, and I know that number will continue to rise), and stuck her hands in it, and then got it all over her pillows. Or she'll wander into the bathroom, turn on the light, and walk right back out. Or there was the time this week where she walked into the bathroom and dumped water from her glass into the toilet. Oh, and let's talk about how she wastes toilet paper and tissue now. She'll unroll toilet paper and just leave it on the counter or stash it in a drawer, but never actually uses it to wipe herself like she's supposed to, or she'll pull tissues out of the box and scatter them around so she can use the tissue box like a storage container for pictures or trash.   We have toured an adult day-care center, but she isn't able to go yet, because I can't do their specific pick up and drop off times with my work schedule. I had to fill out an application for our county's transit authority to be able to do that, but they sent back the application I filled out because I didn't provide proof that I had the right to fill out the form, so now I have to send proof of my POA and start over. I've also finally spoken with a company for in-home respite care, but it's going to take a few weeks for that to get in motion too. Memory care is the final boss, and the financial situation is overwhelming. It seems like I won't be able to avoid protecting her assets and we're going to have to do a spend down anyway before I can get any other assistance. Her money is going to go so fast. My sanity and making sure she has the proper care is a priority though, so it is what it is. I'm hoping to have her placed ASAP. Before spring comes if I can help it. Some of the referral agents I've spoken with are really recommending I keep her close by, but our area (Bay Area) is so expensive. I feel like the money would stretch a bit further if I get her a couple of hours away, but I've been attempted to be talked out of it in a ""well, what happens if something happens and you need to get to her quickly?"" manner, but at this point, I almost don't care. I know it will also limit how often I'm able to visit her and spend time with her, but I feel like I'm okay with that too. That's just how I feel about her and our situation right now. I don't know. I just don't know. Twice now, it's been recommended to me to just leave her at an ER and tell them I can't care for her anymore, but that seems like the worst thing I could possibly do. What would even happen if I did that?  She is just so far gone, and has the emptiest look in her eyes. She truly has no idea what the hell she's doing anymore. I almost just feel so gaslit, but I know it's the Alzheimer's gaslighting both of us. At the same time, I have completely detached from her as well. I love her and I hate her, and I hate that I hate her. I just miss my mom and it really sucks that she's still here but not still here. I want someone to take care of me. I am running on empty, and the only reason I haven't had a complete mental breakdown yet is because I can't afford to. I am in therapy, and trying to find actual support groups are still on my to-do list, although on the flip side of the idea of a support group, what's the point? We all just share our feelings? She also got denied by her insurance to try the Rivastigmine patch (Donepezil caused severe gastric upset and dehydrated her to the point she was hospitalized for three days shortly after she moved in with me), and we certainly can't afford it out of pocket. I don't even think it would make a difference at this point, though either. The hardest part about this too, is knowing that she could be on a fast track to the end, but completely plateau for years after all of this, until the actual end. Not having any kind of timeline or prognosis to the end is hard. She is moderate to severe though, I know that much. It has progressed that fast in just a year of first realizing something was wrong with her.  I'm so angry still, it blows my mind. I saw a post on FB a few weeks ago that read ""Someone said 'anger is sadness that had nowhere to go for a really long time' and I'll never forget it,"" and it's so fucking true. This is the most extreme sadness and anger that I have ever felt, and I can feel how utterly toxic and harmful it is. I feel like a prisoner and an indentured servant, and I know she feels like she's a prisoner too. I still just can't believe this is our life, and that makes me so sad. If you've read this, thanks."	0
My grandmother is currently in a nursing home in Greece with Alzheimer’s (we live in the U.S.). When my grandmother was being diagnosed/treated prior to her move to the nursing home, the doctor apparently tested my mother for early onset as well and it turns out that she has it. This was maybe 5 or so years ago. My mom refused treatment and never told me or my brother. Over the last year she has definitely been showing signs of Alzheimer’s that my brother and I are all too aware of from taking care of our grandmother. On top of that, my mom drinks heavily (to the point of blacking out nightly) which of course doesn’t help with her symptoms. I’ve talked to her numerous times about her symptoms and the other day she finally admitted that she has early onset Alzheimer’s and refuses any treatment. Obviously I’m pissed and I have no idea what to do. She’s too stubborn to hear me out and keeps saying she will let me know when it’s getting bad and will go to a nursing home in Greece when the time is right. That makes zero sense though as we are all in the U.S. and we can’t afford to be traveling back and forth to Greece to see her. We want to come up with a plan now but she refuses. On top of that, I’m pregnant with my first child (her first grandchild) and she’s super excited and wants to be very involved in his life. I can’t let that happen. She doesn’t even remember to feed herself so how could I trust her to feed/change a child if I weren’t around? She also doesn’t know current safe sleep practices for babies. I’ve tried explaining them to her but she keeps forgetting and suggesting I buy/do things that could lead to SIDS in my baby. So of course I can’t trust her.  With the baby on the way, my husband and I will not have room in our home to take care of her. My brother and his fiancé are not financially stable enough to care for my mom so we’re all stuck in a predicament.  Does anyone have any suggestions on what we could possibly do or how we could better plan for her to inevitably be placed in a nursing home?	0
Hoping this is the right forum for asking this question. I've read about a new drug - simufilam - that has started phase 3 trials, and although there seem to be some citizen petitions going on to delay the studies, the results so far seem very, very promising. I remember hearing about blockbuster AD drugs that did well in phase 2 but ultimately flopped in phase 3 ([this article](https://scrip.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/SC097113/Surprise-Its-A-Phase-III-Failure) lists those from Pfizer and Eli Lilly).   I know nothing's guaranteed what happens in phase 3, but it seems like the FDA is very eager to do something about the AD epidemic, what with its controversial approval of aduhelm. I was wondering, though, if anyone could provide a medical or pharmacological perspective on if simufilam sets itself apart from other drugs that have come and gone in terms of efficacy or mechanisms, and if the results so far are to be taken very seriously. Thank you in advance!	0
My 78 year old mom recently developed significant short term memory loss. She's mostly functional (she can feed herself, move around, use the bathroom unassisted, bathe herself, prepare simple meals), but her memory suffers after about 10 - 20 minutes.   She likes to stay active and I'm trying trying to find ways for her to fill her time. Reading doesn't hold her attention anymore, because she can't follow a narrative. Same with tv/movies. She putters around in the garden when the weather is nice.  I set her up with lumocity, which she seems to enjoy, but she can't do that all day. She spends a lot of time doing chores like laundry and cleaning. I don't want that to be all she does.  I'd love to hear any thoughts or suggestions you have. Thanks	0
My mom's partner has been showing signs of worsening cognitive decline for the past year. It began at the height of lockdown, when he was under a lot of stress, and started with sporadically forgetting random recent events while impulsively and passive-aggressively acting out. He's never been an easy person to deal with, so we assumed it was just the sort of stress and anxiety most of us were dealing with through the pandemic.  He was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment last fall and put on donepezil, and has been taking curcumin supplements as well. He has categorically refused to make any lifestyle changes though. He stays up for over 24 hours at least one day a week (he's been doing this consistently for over around fifteen years), and hasn't maintained a normal sleep schedule for the last several months. He's constantly awake. He complains about waking easily because of everyday sounds other people make, but will not use earplugs or a white noise machine as suggested. He's also been prescribed sleeping pills to help insomnia, but refuses to take them.   My mom has tried for the past year to get him to exercise regularly, but he refuses - this includes light exercise like going for a daily walk. He will only go if she accompanies him, but she has her own health issues that leave her exhausted after work. His primary activities are basically watching TV dramas whenever he's awake (this goes on for 6-12 hours a day) and going to work. He's alienated his relatives and friends by being critical and emotionally abusive, so he also gets very little meaningful social contact.  On top of this, his diet is dismal. He has always refused to prepare his own food, relying instead on my mom to do it for him. She works full-time at a high-stress job, so she rarely has time to prepare healthy meals for him. She does buy brain-friendly foods (fatty fish, walnuts, greens, etc) for him to prep and eat but this is also someone who has, for decades, refuses to prep a meal and clean up after himself. Unless he has food cooked and served to him, he'll subsist off sugary, high-carb snacks and coffee loaded up with sugar and cream. It probably doesn't help that he also vapes nicotine constantly, or that he's been a lifelong smoker until a few years ago.  In the last few months, my mom has noted that he'll forget events that happened that day, and that he'll repeat the same stories and phrases over and over. He constantly forgets belongings like his phone or even his work paychecks. He also now seems to have trouble with basic things like knowing road rules, but has been able to keep commuting to work because it's a route he's taken daily for over a decade. He's always been a very angry person, but seems to have trouble controlling it effectively now. He vacillates between giving my mom the silent treatment for imagined slights, throwing temper tantrums, and begging her not to leave him. It has just been a lot to deal with.  He's now on both donepezil and memantine, but has shown no improvement. I guess I'm asking what we can do, or what to expect in the coming years, especially when he refuses to do things he needs to do to maintain his health. I don't know what we can even do for him anymore.	0

Hello, I'm sorry about the long post..  (I also just want to preface before asking my question that I don't know very much about Alzheimer's  and as I haven't been directly involved with the situation so I can only explain what I've heard)  Some backstory first: My aunty has been living with my grandma for a very long time now (just for the convenience not so much because of health issues) and she began to notice sometime last year that my grandma (in her mid-90's) was showing symptoms of memory loss and a lack of appetite. My family does their best to call her and would visit regularly outside of quarantine, but each time they talk to her, her memory gets shorter.    This afternoon my aunty called to speak to my mum and explained that she needs to come visit soon.    My grandma's lack of appetite has gotten worse, to the point where she can no longer keep the few foods she was able to eat before down. Last week I overheard that my aunty got scared and almost called an ambulance because my grandma wouldn't respond to her questions - she just sat and stared.    Another issue that they've been dealing with recently is my grandma forgetting to turn off the gas stove in the kitchen etc. - my aunty keeps having to watch her closely because of this.     My grandma feels like she's being treated like a child and, to some degree, my aunty is doing just that.    She understands that something isn't right but can't figure out what it is and when told, she can't remember it a couple of minutes later.    Because my grandma still believes that she's able to take care of herself, they sometimes argue and a lot of tension has been created between them.    A while ago my aunty started doing a course about Dementia and Alzheimer's, trying to understand it and some of the things that could help - but so far nothing seems to have worked or lasted.   My question is, I guess, what do I do, or more like, how can ***I*** help?    No one wants to involve retirement homes (I don't want this either) or a helper - although, I don't know what they'd be able to do to help other than ease my aunty's stress and provide emotional support.     It just doesn't feel like there are many options, if any at all. Most of what I was trying to come up months ago (e.g. puzzles, colouring, reading, post-it notes around the house to help her remember or a note book etc.) aren't doable anymore because she can't focus.    Food wise, my aunty's tried soft foods and smoothies, even sneaking supplements in, but they aren't really an option either.   My family are trying their best with what they can do (especially with being in quarantine), but is there more we can be doing... or do we just keep doing what we're doing....?  Thank you for your time.	0
"Hello everyone. I previously posted about my grandfather [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/o4ylse/how_do_we_take_the_dogs_away_xpost_from_rdementia/). Things have progressed and I'd very much appreciate some insight. My mother is POA and sort of the unofficial caregiver, but does not live with him.  First of all, shortly after that post, one of the dogs was put down. We are unsure exactly what happened, but she was throwing up and apparently miserable. I believe Papa was talking about ""putting her down"" like, ""in the backyard"" if you catch my drift. This was alarming. My mom convinced him to try a medication the vet had suggested.   The short version of this story is that the dogs looked very similar and the wrong dog was getting the medication and therefore the sick dog did not improve and therefore got euthanized by the vet. To say I'm horrified about this is an understatement.   The remaining dog (11 year old yellow lab) is overweight, arthritic, currently has a double ear infection, and recently sprained an elbow. Supposedly she fell off the bed. She is 110% not getting medicated for arthritis, nor is she getting the care she needs for her ears, because Papa does not remember to do this.   He loves the dog. But also apparently is starting to forget he has a dog. I guess he asked my mom last night ""where did this dog come from?"". But also still thinks he has two dogs sometimes. His GP and Neurologist seem to think it's good for him to have the dog. Do they know about the state of the dog? I do not know.  Papa is moving in to an assisted living facility this month. My mom is trying to work in conversations about the dog coming to stay with me/my husband while he moves in and then hopefully he'll just forget about her. My mom is convinced this isn't going to work and Papa will get belligerent. I guess she's brought it up a couple times before and it hasn't gone over well...the general idea of the dog coming to live with me.   Quite frankly I don't give a shit if he likes it or not. This dog is suffering and needs to be taken care of and no one is taking care of her. Papa is already forgetting her and how many dogs he does/does not have. I know the doctors think the dog is good for him, but it's not good for HER.  What can/should I do? From what I understand about Papa's condition, he's going to be angry about it but probably not remember it the next day anyway. Do we take the dog and all the dog stuff out of the apartment at the same time and then POOF! she's gone from his mind?"	0
"My mother is getting deeper into this illness (Stage 5 or 6) and starting to display a lot of restlessness, agitation, compulsions (OCD!), and anxiety.  She expresses these anguished sighs one might make when very overwhelmed or stressed.  Every morning she has a couple cups of coffee.  I understand caffeine is advisable early on but this late in the game, I'm wondering if it's just making her symptoms worse.  We're certainly not saving her memory or anything at this point with a couple cups of coffee.  My father, while the primary caretaker, is very stuck in his ways. When I asked him about why she needs coffee, he kind of shrugged like ""well, that's just what she's always done...""  **What do you think? Necessary? Good for morale? Better to switch to something less stimulating?**  **P.S.** I could go into the science and my concerns about coffee and cerebral blood flow, cortisol, etc. but I want to first suspend my judgement and get your very much appreciated opinion."	0
What is your experience dropping a family member off at assisted living? Do you lie to them? My dad will most likely be moving into a facility in the upcoming month and I'm not sure what to expect. I am sure it will be unpleasant as he almost threw a fit when he thought he would have an overnight stay in the hospital.   &#x200B;  Although he is only 58 he is rapidly declining. He does know who is family members are, recognizes all of us when we come visit and is aware of where he is. However, he is in adult diapers and not aware when he goes to the bathroom, and often screams when it is a bowel movement and screams in the shower. He also will take the diaper off and go to the bathroom on the floor or couch and sit/lay in it. He has problems sitting up and back down as well as laying up and down and leans to one side when standing and falls often. That is why it has been hard to make the switch because although his body is declining, he still knows us and the house.   &#x200B;  My mom is paying out of pocket for a caretaker when she is at work but I know she is up all night as he wakes up every half hour even with an increase in medication that is supposed to calm him and let him sleep.   Also, do we bring furniture/items as if we are going to a dorm room? We thought we would tell him its like a rehab to make himself stronger and help physically. Not sure what to expect. Should we not visit right away? How long/often are your visits?	0
I'm only 40 but over the last couple years I've started to forget a lot of things. I can't recall movies I watched from 2 weeks ago (until I rewatch it and then it all comes back), I can't recall certain events in my 20s (like where I first met an ex-gf) and a lot of other things. However with numbers, especially telephone numbers or any set of numbers I can recall from way back in the past.   Anyways I know this may be an early sign of potential Alzheimer's disease and want to know what I can do to slow down the process, if so. I have a pretty bad diet and don't really exercise much anymore. So I know I need to fix those things but are there any other pointers anyone can give me. I saw my grandmother go through a mild level of Alzheimer's where she would forget conversations from 5 mins ago and wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.   So far I have mapped out a plan with the changes I need to make in my life  1. Eat better 2. Exercise 3. Do math equations to stimulate my brain  If anyone can add anything else, that would be much appreciated.	0
Forgive me if I’m doing this all wrong, this is my first post in Reddit. I’m 41 years old and my mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s (early stages) two years ago at age 74. She was relatively healthy otherwise. In the last couple of weeks she has had a sharp decline overall but still very high functioning. She was living with myself and my spouse and 6 year old daughter but she has a one track mind of getting back to her boyfriend in Canada. The boyfriend is not honest with her (they still speak on phone), but tells my siblings and I that he cannot take care of her. She blames us for keeping them apart, even though he isn’t allowed to come to US anyway due to Covid. Every day was arguments about pills and remembering to eat. She would get angry when we’d try to help her, claiming that us not letting her do these things herself is what’s making her “brain fail”.  Left to her own devices she is not capable of taking her pills appropriately or cooking a decent meal. She claimed she had all this money (she does not) and we must be stealing it. She would get verbal aggressive and the arguing started to have a real effect on my spouse and daughter (and me)!  We placed her in an “apartment style” AL that has a memory care neighborhood and she is irate. She claims she wants to die, she hates it, her life is over, we dumped her, and she’s refusing to take her pills now. I feel like I’m going crazy - the guilt and grief and sadness just never ends with this disease. She is truly high functioning for memory care but not appropriate for more independent assisted living or independent senior housing. So we are stuck in this cycle of her begging us to get her out so she can go be with her boyfriend in Canada, us gently trying to redirect, and her spitting venom at us again. It’s awful and heartbreaking. I guess maybe I’m just venting, or looking for reassurance or similar experiences? Thank you for listening and I’m sorry to all who love someone with this awful disease.	0
Hello,   My father was diagnosed with Lewy Body dementia 6 years ago - and I have started coming to my parents house once every few months with microphones and audio recording devices - to make recordings of his memories (his old memories are razor sharp - his new ones dont really stick).  I wanted to make recordings for him - so he can listen to his own stories - and I will get people who are in his stories to record their side - so when he is in the throngs of dementia - he can listen to his own memories and stories.  This is also so my and my brothers children will be able to see videos of him and hear his stories.    I'm here to ask - what kinds of questions would you want to ask your father?  What are somethings you wished you would be able to ask - or things you would be curious about?  Serious and Funny questions - Here are what I am asking/planning on asking   1. What do you remember about becoming a father 2. What if anything was something you stole - how did you feel after that 3. What was it like meeting mom - and getting married / having kids? 4. What was it like growing up durring the segregation movement ending? 5. Who was your first kiss -  6. What was the most scared you had ever been? 7. Did you ever want to leave after you started a family? 8. What was your favorite trip you have ever taken? 9. What was your favorite memory growing up? 10. How has love changed as you have gotten older?	0
\*\*We are so sorry for the repost but we need more participants for this study and we greatly appreciate those who already did the survey and discussion posts! Thank you so much again!

My dad celebrated his 72nd birthday last week, and yesterday he was diagnosed with early Alzheimer's. This disease scares me more than any other because he can't really fight it. I'm scared and sad and mad and trying to figure out how to support my dad and mom when I live a fair distance away. I'm thankful my dad is very tech savvy so we can use different things to help him with his short term memory, but beyond that I don't know what to do. I just need some support so I can help my parents.	0
Can’t believe the day has come. I knew for so long. He’s been fighting this disease for almost 10 years. I thought I would be more prepared. This was prob one of the saddest  weeks of my life. I’m glad he’s not in any pain anymore, but I’m just sad that I will never see my dad again. It’s just not fair.	0
I was wondering if anyone has had their loved one recommended PEG feeding tube surgery? It’s for patients who can not eat or chew, and a tube is inserted surgically into the stomach where you pump liquid food into their stomach. My grandmother had this done because she couldn’t eat and her veins had a blockage due to having IV fluids pumped into her for a long time. (Her arms were purple from all the IV injections). She had the surgery done and was sent home. We then saw she had trouble breathing like there was fluid in her lungs. We took her to another hospital to get the fluid suctioned out but they said that it would come back again. She only survived a day or two after that.  I read an article somewhere that this PEG feeding tube surgery can cause fluid buildup in the lungs. And that’s exactly what happened to her. Does anyone have a similar experience?	0
I work at a local credit union.  A week ago an elderly lady came in who very clearly had some advanced alzheimers going on. Infact, once we found her record and account it was apperent that her son was the one who was supposed to be taking care of her. I was told after I was very patient with her.   I had to explain things to her up to 10 times over, and she often ended up in a cycle of questions about things she'd already told me about. It was a very emotionally rough experience I'm not going to lie. It was about an hour I was with her too.  We attempted to contact her son using the information we had on file, but could not get ahold of him. This lady did mention something about how he was probably at work. And then later she'd ask if we could call him, when we said we couldn't get ahold of him she asked why, we'd say 'he's at work' and she'd wonder why he was at work.   I was rather annoyed with her son actually for not taking care of his mother or ensuring she's safe. She eventually decided she would go home and wait for her son, after a couple times of walking out, then immediately turning back in and forgetting the whole interraction. Fortunately, it seems she lived just about a mile from the credit union and down the road, but I did not feel really too good about how that was how the interraction ended.  So in the future, in case she comes wandering in again, or if I have a different credit union member come in who's showing that they're not entirely with it, is there any sort of number or service we would be able to call to ensure they can safely get home? I did not feel comfortable at the end of the interraction that she ended up leaving, still alone, and I would've really wanted to just escort her myself but my work's policies (and the fact it was a saturday with reduced staff anyways) prevented me from doing so.   I live in the Salt Lake region of Utah if that helps. I was thinking during the interraction of actually calling a paramedic or doctor of sorts. We also left a note on her account to tell her son to leave us some other family member numbers as well, but there's no gaurantee we will get any from him.	0
My MIL (85F) has Alzheimer’s for a few years.  At first her symptoms were light but it’s progressing now.  Recently,  her doctor ordered a driving evaluation.  This week, we received the letter that she is no longer allowed to drive.   So my husband and I went to her apartment to meet my MIL and my SIL (62F). The plan was to tell her that we are taking the car away.  So my SIL proceeded to tell her that she is no longer allowed to drive and that we are taking the car away.  She was shocked and almost started to cry.  Saying no more car,  no more car,  then she calmed down.  15 minutes later,  we proceeded to take the car keys.  She then asked why?  We explained again,  that she was no longer allowed to drive.  Once again,  she almost started to cry, repeating no more car,  no more car.  My SIL stayed with her when my husband left with the car.  She asked why he was taking her car?  SIL explained.  MIL had the same reaction, sadness and resolution.  It makes me so sad to see her stuck in this memory loop.  I needed to share.	0
Tomorrow (or today depending on when you read this) will be the first time I’ve been able to see my grandma in over a year.  It’s been a long hard road with her dementia diagnosis and she’s finally settled and comfy in her LTC. Rules have eased up for visiting so it’s easier to go and see her.  I’m just feeling anxious because the last time I spoke to her on facetime which was sometime late last year she still remembered me. Tomorrow I know she won’t and I don’t know how to mentally prepare for that knife to my heart.   In part I’m more worried about my grandad seeing my pain because I know he’s upset about me seeing her like this and not in her normal “grandma” way. I’m scared I’ll lose my composure but I also know I don’t want her there by herself with me too chicken to see her.  So if you have any kind words or pieces of advice, I’d deeply appreciate it.	0
Hi everyone,   I’m 15 and my dad is 69, and recently he’s started to deteriorate, recently, he’s been confusing there and sometimes forgets where we are going, but there was one bad episode that was about 10 mins, he woke up and had no idea who I was, this was really a hit on me for a few days, but I got over it yet it still makes me cry. I am currently ok but this is slowly picking up and I am slowly losing my dad.. and this is so painful for me to watch it happen. He’s being moved to assisted living soon and this just pains more because despite his condition I think him going to assisted living is worse then his apartment currently because he will be around people in much worse condition. The point of this post is, does anybody have any coping methods? This so hard on me, luckily I’ve been able to manage it but with things slowly getting worse I need more help..  thank you.	0
Has anyone ever developed a sort of 'coping mechanism' later on in life? I'm 31 and I recently started cracking my fingers. or more often, making the motions to crack my fingers because I can't crack them on demand. It started when my dad went into the hospital, and now I do it every time I'm anxious, stressed or nervous about something. It's like I need to do it, but sometimes I don't even notice I'm doing it. It's fucking weird.	0
My father is 60 and has early onset Alzheimers. Since his diagnosis, he has been living at home with my family and I and care taking hasn't been so bad. In the last couple of days he has become suddenly violent, with the rest of my family and I being afraid for our safety. Because we did not complete his power of attorney documents, no facility that can better deal with his aggression will hold him involuntarily. I know that going through the process of getting power of attorney over someone in his state may take time, but I wonder if there is a speedier process for my emergency since we are afraid for our safety if he comes home from the emergency room today. (context I live in Virginia)	0
My father (80) has Alzheimer’s and his side of the family has a history of dementia.  Looking back it was probably Alzheimer’s.   Today I just had the biggest space cadet moment I’ve ever had in my life and to be honest, I’m a little concerned that this may be the first sign of Alzheimer’s for me.  I just walked into the restroom at work with my mind preoccupied with some serious work challenges and I walked up to and started peeing in the trash can.  It only lasted for .5 seconds.  When I heard the sound I clicked immediately back into reality and stopped.  I’m not on any medication or other substance that would impair my thinking or judgment.  Perhaps this was just a stress fugue and spending time with my father is making me paranoid, but how can you really tell?  I’m only 48.  Edit: typo	0

My dad just passed away and I’d like to request donations in his honor to an Alzheimer’s charity.  Is there a preference?  I looked at Alzheimer’s association and Alzheimer’s Foundation and the latter has better ratings on the charity navigator website.	0
Cassava Sciences has started recruiting for AD clinical trials. Please assist them to enroll patients. I have reviewed their Phase 2 trial results, and the data is spectacular.  I am not aware of any medication date that has been as effective as Simufilm. I am optimistic about the potential (as an MD).  The medication is still undergoing testing, but based on the initial results the FDA has decided to expand testing.  Below are the results, more information, and the most importantly, locations of research sites that are enrolling patients.  Im not an employee of Cassava, but if you have questions on this thread, I'll be more than happy to try and answer them.

"My mother is 75 and has dementia.  She is literally sick nearly every day.  She had a heart transplant, kidney disease, osteoperosis, and several other health issues.  She can not manage anything anymore - meds, doctor calls, appts, etc.  I need to be with her at every doctors appt as she can not remember anything or even tell the doctor what is wrong if she is sick.

Im 19 years old, my mom has been atruggling with Early Onset since I was 12. The progress was relatively slow but still drastic. Since my early teenage years I've been watching my energetic, social, charismatic and loving mom turn into someone who projected their whole anger about her illness on me. For a few years we would do nothing but fight. I was already prone to depression and selfharm, this ony made my relationship to my parents worse. They were so busy worrying about my mom that they would completely forget about me. I was very lonely from around 13-16, with barely any friends and no emotional support whatsoever. My social skills improved with a lot of therapy (that I organised myself at 15) but that constant empty feeling and the inability to form close connections stayed.  I'm not feeling well as is. But the worst thing is, I feel so alone. Even though I have great friends now and a good therapist. They just don't understand. They can't help.  By now, my mom needs help with everything. From getting dressed in the morning, to putting lotion on her dry skin (which is gross and I hate it) to making every single meal for her to having to listen and accomodate to her constant nagging and little problems daily. Barely getting any sleep because she can't keep the rooms apart at night when she wanders and being woken up in the middle of the night by her just blasting into my room and starting to talk. My dad has it worse, he gets even less sleep because they have to share a bed. We don't have that much space.  I've asked my dad for over a year now for some help for my mom, just like a daycare or something like that and he just yelled at me for ""wanting to deport my own mother to some home"" and brushed it off. I graduated highschool this year so my head wasn't in a place where i could organise something like that for my mom, too. I'm just so exhausted all the time. And so is he. Lately my dad has been leaving me alone with her for days at a time like once a month. That worked out fine until a year ago but now i'd have to stay home 24/7 for her. She cries when I leave only for a few hours to meet my friends. Sometimes my dad starts to binge drink and is not able to care for her anymore. This always lasts a few days too but lately it has happened more often. I told him specifically how shitty his behavior makes me feel but he will just agree and then not change anyway.  He has been physically abusive in the past and frankly I don't like either of my parents. I would be a lot happier without them in my life, but they are both so dependent on me and I feel so sorry for them. My mom can't help being ill and my dad lost the love of his life, his wife of over 20 years. I understand the, but I hate them. And I don't know what to do anymore. I try to move out but I just can't afford it right now and I'm so scared of leaving them alone.  What if my dad starts to drink again, but this time, never stops because I'm not there to guiltrip him into stopping? My mom will be even sadder all the time because she won't understand that I'm a grown up now and I need to move out. They fucked my life over and I feel so bitter about the version of myself I would've become if Alzheimer had never affected my mom. Now, everyone in my home is just incredibely depressed and uncontent with their life. Family and former family friends all ditched us the second my mom's illness got serious..."	0

My dad was diagnosed about 3 years ago and is still in pretty good condition (has trouble conversing, can't follow multi-step directions, etc), and we're going on a family vacation next month.  We'll be staying at a beach house on vacation, and my sister and I are a little nervous about Dad having issues wandering around the house at night since it'll be a completely new place.   My sister and I have each had experiences where Dad got lost in the middle of the night in our homes recently, and are wondering: does anyone have suggestions about ways to alert my mother if he leaves their bedroom at night?  Is there a sort of portable alarm system out there? Does anyone have any tricks they've used while traveling with an Alexander's patient? Thanks!	0
My dad is 73 and has rapidly declining later stage Alzheimer’s. He kept falling down a step or two at home, so we moved him into the memory care unit of a nearby nursing home 3 months ago. He started off ok, but is now refusing most food and liquid. This leads to him falling even more frequently, (3-5x a week) and he gets combative and aggressive with staff when they try to help. He just qualified for hospice today, but our issue is with him still being ambulatory, he’s a fall risk at all times. We don’t know what to do, as his risk of falling would happen anywhere, but we’re afraid he’s going to get kicked out of the facility. They said we can hire someone to watch him 24/7 and it’s an extra $700/day. 😑 Obviously this isn’t the first time this has ever happened to someone with ALZ, but we keep getting these emergency calls and not sure what else to do? Hospice is going to get him on seroquil, which i’m praying will help somewhat. Has anyone been through this before?	0
I have two older siblings and we haven't had the discussion yet of who wants to become power of attorney...     Some questions i'd appreciate if anyone could answer:     1. Is it possible that the position be shared? Would that be beneficial? What downsides would there be?    2. What exactly is involved with being power of attorney?    3. How easy is the whole process of getting started  etc?     Thank you	0
My dad has been having memory issues and confusion for the last year or so, and he finally agreed to get it looked at. Turns out that he has early stage Alzheimer's. I'm still processing, obviously, but have worked in healthcare long enough to know that there are some things that should be handled early while he still has (most of) his faculties.  * He is in his mid-70s and lives with his wife (my mom) full time. Given his lifestyle habits and other comorbidities, I expect that his prognosis will be on the shorter end of normal.  * He is a practicing healthcare worker, but has been informed that his license will be revoked due to his condition. This is very distressing to him, since he found a lot of meaning in his work.  * My parents are middle class and both are still working, though they had planned to retire in the next year or two. They have a nest egg and were not particularly concerned about finances in their retirement life until now. Now, we don't know what to expect as far as medical needs, costs, etc. They own their primary home outright, and have a condo with a 15yr mortgage they bought a couple of years ago in preparation for downsizing. They have a financial planner who was helping them with retirement, but I don't know if she's familiar with costs associated with Alzheimer's.  * My mom has a much better health profile than my dad, and it's clear she was suffering from caregiver fatigue even before this diagnosis. How do we ensure that her needs continue to be met and that this disease doesn't negatively affect her wellbeing as well?  I guess my question is: What should we be thinking about right now, while he's still pretty aware and able to make important decisions? Are there any good resources that you recommend? Given how new this is, we still need to have a robust discussion on next steps as a family, but I would like to come to that discussion with a good sense of priorities and how to get through this.	0
In what ways did they act differently during early stages of Alzheimer’s? I’m wondering because I think my mom (63) might be in the early stages of Alzheimer’s but it’s hard to tell.	0

Today we tried taking my grandmother into a nursing home that specializes into taking care for dementia patients, but she tried to run away. She was very aggressive and basically the home refused to take her in. We can't take her into another facility because the same thing will repeat again nor we can hire a nurse to look after her because of her behavior. She has been on antipsychotics, but they don't seem to calm her at all. I (25yo) have been her main care giver, but I can't emotionally handle this situation any longer. I am tired of having to chase her around the apartment building a few times a day, her trying to beat me or yell at me. My family also refuses to look after her. So this entire situation seems very hopeless. On the other hand I can't just leave her she is the person who raised me. Has anyone been in the same situation? I now that I should probably take legal actions, but this will probably take months.	0
"I'm not the best at explaining things, so please bear with me.  My grandma was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and it's been hard on everyone. But most recently, she's been saying gibberish all the time. It is completely involuntary and uncontrollable. It goes something like this- ""babababbababa..."" There's also a lot of other noises and sounds involved, but mostly this. She goes on for hours at this and not to mention, it's extremely loud. I'm worried sick that her vocal cords might tear in the process.   My mom and I are her primary caretakers now. We are trying our best to calm her down but it seldom works. Our doctor has prescribed sleeping pills, but we don't wanna give it to her everyday as it has too many side effects. My grandma is 80 and she can sleep on her own, most of the time. But, right now, it just went completely out of control. We tried to make her tell stories, whatever she remembers, and she tells it. But the moment the story is over, the gibberish starts. I don't think she is even aware that she is doing this. It breaks my heart to see my grandma like this.   I would appreciate any advice on how we can deal with this. It's been weeks since my mom and I slept properly and it is just painfully exhausting for everyone.  I apologize for errors, English is not my first language."	0
Hello all! I posted a couple of months back about the doctor prescribing my dad alprozolam to calm him. It made his insomnia,anger, wandering and delusions worse. When we took him to the hospital they said that Xanax can be disinhibiting instead of the intended calming effect.For my dad, it was like somebody took the dial on all his symptoms and cranked it up.  I'm posting this for the purpose of information. It's not going to be everybody's experience, but I wish I had known this was a possibility when the doctor prescribed it for my dad.  Stay strong everyone. This disease sucks!	0
GBH is currently streaming the documentary [*WITH DAD*](https://www.wgbh.org/with-dad) for free on-demand. The 30-minute film chronicles the work of Massachusetts-based photographer Stephen DiRado, during the 20-year period of his father’s decline and eventual death from Alzheimer’s disease. DiRado, known for long-term projects, used his antique large-format box camera to meticulously document the end of his artistic mentor's life in a way that celebrates a legacy without concealing the trauma inherent in the premature loss of a loved one.  You can learn more about the backstory [in this interview](https://www.wgbh.org/news/arts/2021/09/21/in-with-dad-a-son-documents-his-fathers-20-year-fight-with-alzheimers). I hope the members of this community find the film to be as beautiful and compelling as I did.	0

Hi all, first time posting so bear with me.  My 89yo gma is nearing the end, I think. She has been diagnosed with Alzheimers for several years, but her state has declined rapidly since the pandemic started, I think partially due to the elimination of her limited stimulation- church and bingo.   My husband (25m) and I (29f) have been her primary caretakers for going on 3 years. In her normal life, my gma was always a friendly, cheerful person, typical grandma shit. I can't say we had the closest relationship, as she is pretty religious and I am not, but she was never a mean or malicious person. That has changed dramatically, and I'm at the end of my rope.   My husband and I got married in dec2019, right before pandemic started. So during our still very new marriage, when we should be enjoying ourselves, the whole world went on lockdown and we were constantly caring for my gma. We have had to do the typical alzheimers things- she's completely incontinent, constant repeated conversations, locking the pantry/fridge so she wouldn't eat literally everything in the fridge (including jars of mayo or sticks of butter). She had been throwing some fits for about the last year and a half, but in the past month these fits have become violent. She has threatened me with a knife, swung a hammer at my husband, and today, broke my bedroom door by smashing her walker against the doorknob repeatedly, while I desperately tried to lead a meeting for my work from home job and couldn't get her to simmer down.  She spits on us, hits us, bites us, calls us horrible names, accuses us of stealing from her, lies constantly. I know it's the disease but my sympathy is rapidly running out. She doesn't quite qualify for hospice care yet, but I'm at a loss because my safety is at stake. I can't even reasonably defend myself, because if I push her off and she gets hurt, it's going to look really bad.   The cops don't bother coming any more, they've been called several times due to her yelling and screaming at us. They know by now we're not abusing her, she's just completely off her rocker.  I feel very isolated here- my mom has been somewhat helpful but is also an extremely busy woman. Her siblings are almost no help- one never visits except for $ and the other lives really far away and can only come occasionally.  It is causing a lot of strain on my marriage, because when we first came here to help out this hecticness was not part of the agreement. I should also mention that we do not stay here for free and we are not freeloaders- in addition to giving her care, I pay rent and buy my own groceries, pay my own bills etc. I'm literally paying to be abused. I just want to go one day without being yelled at, called a bitch, etc.  I'm not sure what I'm looking for here. I guess i just wanted to vent. I'm wondering how close to the end we are- does anyone have any similar experiences? Thx for reading if you made it this far.	0
My mom has been acting strange for a few years now. Having serious conversations and making life changing plans then saying we didn't. For instance when I was pregnant we had a big discussion about how she wanted me to move home to the farm and raise the kids and look after her. That wasn't my plan but we decided we would because she's on a small income and we could pay her bills. It would also save us rent money because she owns the home so it would help everyone.  That and not having to constantly drive back and forth to help her. I gave notice for my apartment and started to pack. Then she said she would never want me to move home and acted like I imagined it. Thankful my super gave me my notice papeback and said he'd forget I ever gave it to him. Another thing was she repeatedly told me I wasn't pregnant with twins because I wasn't fat. I was like a beached whale lol. I also had ultrasound photos. The babies are 5 months old now and she doesn't care about them at all. It's like they don't exist when she had previously wanted grandkids so badly.  She keeps referring to them as they boy and the girl. As if she doesn't know there names. I read online that dementia can cause lack of intrest in anything  Do you think I need to put her in a care home? I can't drive constantly back and fourth I don't have time and she's not appreciative when I do come Or do you think she doesn't like me or the babies? I'm not sure	0
This past Friday we moved my grandfather to a memory care facility that specifically houses people with Alzheimers and dementia. He was becoming too much for my grandmother to handle on her own. He is still pretty sharp sometimes but he has started wondering off and leaving the house, which is what prompted the decision.   Well apparently last night he left the facility without the staff even knowing he was gone! He eventually came back inside (thank god) asking where they had parked his truck. In my mind this is completely unacceptable. Another spot opened up at a facility that is closer/nicer but we are worried about moving him to a new place. We don't want to confuse him or upset him more than he already is, but we also want him to be safe.   I don't have any experience. Is this a common occurrence? Are we overreacting by being outraged?	0
UK here. Our dad was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s about 10 years ago. He’s 71 now and is at the late stage where he can’t wash, dress, toilet or eat independently. He shuffles rather than walks, and will wander aimlessly if given the freedom to do so. His speech has deteriorated in the past year from a couple of words and whimpers to now only a word or two of assent with considerable prompting. He lost a huge amount of weight in the past year and was hospitalised last Christmas for just over a week. When he was released into our mum’s care, he spent days on a hospital bed downstairs, with her looking after him. We honestly didn’t think he was going to pull through, but he gradually did. He has a permanent urinary catheter and has recently started to wear Depends due to some fecal leakage.  Our mum is a nurse, 69 years old, and still works 2 or 3 night shifts a week. She pays local people to stay overnight with dad, but has refused any professional social support services. She lists a number of reasons for this - the cost, the inconvenience, that she doesn’t want strangers in the house - which change from day to day. Dad went into a care home for a few weeks last November whilst mum had an operation, and when he came out he had deteriorated so she is strongly averse to putting him in a home again. She says that it’s the cost, the concern, that she doesn’t know how she’d cope without him, and that she thinks if he was put in a home he’d be dead in 6 months. But she’s exhausted. She’s sleep deprived, angry, concerned, physically in pain, unable to make decisions, and trapped in a cycle of coping for a while, gradually sliding into a complete meltdown, getting a bit of a breather, and then repeat.  We called Social Services last year. She went ballistic. They reviewed things and eventually closed the case as ultimately he wasn’t in grave danger. He was fed and clothed and clean, and there are adults much more vulnerable than him. He remains on a care home waitlist but even if a place came up we don’t think mum would do it.  There are limits to what we (her kids) can do to help due to work, families, etc. We could possibly do more, we admit. But the worse dad gets, the more personal care he needs, and we can’t commit to that.   Really, this is just a vent. There are no solutions unless mum gives in and gets professional social support. Or ends up dead or physically incapacitated herself (though honestly, we doubt even that would stop her). It’s a mess :(	0
Is it different (and how) from regular alzheimers? Looking into internet resources I still don't get what to expect for a person with severe alzheimers at 63 years old. Wondering if someone has useful/trusted resources to read on this matter?  * I am just trying to prepare myself.	0
Has anyone left their career to take care of a parent with dementia ?    At what point do you move to assisted living?   My mother is 75 with dementia, heart + kidney issues.    I have been taking care of my mother now for 5 years and she needs someone to remind her about pills, take to doctors appts, feed her, laundry, etc.    She has several medical issues that often require med changes or doctor visits nearly every week.  She know who I am but gets really confused about most things.  My other sibling has cancer and so I have 100% of care.  Assisted living with in memory care unit will likely cost $3-4k / month.     Financially I can afford to take a few years off to take care of my mother, and wondering if I am crazy to pause my career to be with her over the next 1-2 years.   I would guess she will have to be in assisted living or nursing home in 3-4 years.	0

"My partner of 25 years has Alzheimer's. I recognized the symptoms three years ago. She doesn't eat well enough. So I try to get her eat. Today, she asked for an specific item, a Southwest flatbread chicken pizza. The problem is that the deli that sells them had pared down their menu and her favorite is no longer on the menu.  But I had to try.  The girl, had years with the company, behind the counter knew the item, and put together an order with the individual ingredients and ""make a pizza"". My partner had her Southwest flatbread chicken pizza for.lunch. She ate her slice with joy.   My caregiving plan is to keep her safe, healthy, and give her as many happy moments as possible, and this lunch touched all three."	0

So Mom is stage 7.  I have her POA and am handling Dad's estate.  I have had 2 different financial institutions reject the POA.  It is so frustrating.  One told me I needed a new  one.  If she could handle her affairs well enough to make a new POA she wouldn't need a POA.  The other wants a guardianship.  It says on the first damn paragraph the POA is to avoid a guardianship.  Besides the guardianship system for seniors is riddled with fraud.  I am just trying to take care of my mom.  Why are these people making it so damn hard?	0
Bit of a weird question but when I think of how I would react (I'm a 24 year old guy with a hopefully normal brain) to forgetting someone who is saying they're my son/daughter or other close family member, it would freak me TF out. I'd be hurling questions around trying to understand who this person is and why I don't remember them.  But when I've seen my grandfather go through the same scenario with his children he seemed almost unbothered. He didn't start asking questions or trying to understand who the people in his house were he just sat there and asked his wife who the people were every now and then.  Do people who suffer from Alzheimers forget things so quickly that they don't have time to get scared or do they just loose the ability to think logically and rationally about situations?  I know it's abit of a hard question to answer but any answers are appreciated.	0
"I have an aunt who has dementia (I don't think she is aware but her family certainly is) so I looked around Reddit for a group to get some support and just feel a little less alone. So I looked at one of the groups here, which is titled ""Alzheimer's Group"" and the description says something like ""for people dealing with Alzheimer's to share fun new discoveries in their lives"".   Upon looking into posts/comments, it became clear early on that it's just a bunch of 12 year olds posting dumb comics and poking fun at Alzheimer's/dementia. I made a comment explaining how frustrated it was and that my aunt probably won't remember my name somewhere down the line and how this is not funny and makes it harder for others to find legit support. They responded ""what you mean this is hilarious"". So I made one more comment, basically feeding the trolls a giant feast. It just makes me so mad. I even pointed them in the direction of a sub specifically for being silly and immature, and pointed out that I'm also subbed to it.  Is there a way to get this fake group taken down based on the sensitive and painful nature of the topic? Has anyone else dealt with similar in that group or others? Thanks."	0
Looking for advice on how to be supportive to my dad while he navigates his mom being diagnosed with Alzheimer's.  In the beginning of this year, my grandmother was diagnosed and my dad is having an extremely difficult time navigating it. We were all together this weekend and when my grandparents left, my dad had a breakdown saying she's not the same and this person isn't his mom. You can imagine how heartbreaking this was to see and I just hugged him not knowing the right words to say. :( I could really use advice on how to be supportive to him as he goes through this, this was the first time he opened up to my brother and I about the toll it is taking on him emotionally.  My grandmother was always an extremely happy person, one of the greatest joys of my life. She now frequently gets angry and grumpy, and often times forgets about her diagnosis and will call my dad or aunt and ask about it. This is all truly gut-wrenching. I would greatly appreciate any advice you might have to offer	0
Hi, My mother has moderate dementia. My father is taking good care of her, but every once in a while he just needs to get out of the house, which means my mother is alone for a few hours.  Lately, when I phone it's about a 50/50 chance that she will be able to answer the phone correctly and she often doesn't know how to hang up the phone either.  So... I'm wondering if there is a phone that would allow me to:  * call  * AND remotely answer for her.  * then allow me to hang up for her.  That's probably a tall order, but if anyone knows the answer, they're probably on this sub.  Thank you.	0
My grandmother has alzimers and she refuses to eat.  Not only that but she doesn't recognize me anymore so that doesn't help when trying to get her to eat.  Any ideas of what to do?	0
It’s almost been a year since my mom was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s. She was diagnosed in September 2020 and was 53 at the time. Prior to all this, she was diagnosed with cancer in July of 2014 which then became terminal. I was 12 when she got cancer and was 18 when they diagnosed her with Alzheimer’s. We recently got an assistant (??) to help with her since my dad is the main provider for us and she would always bother him and could barely get any work done. It’s been extremely hard and frustrating because she’s just so difficult. I know it’s not her fault and she doesn’t mean it but we’re both combative at each other and I lose my patience very easily so we don’t have the best relationship. I feel like an awful daughter because I shouldn’t act like this but her personality isn’t the best either.  What makes it worse is she’s like a walking corpse. She’s physically here but not mentally and I can’t imagine how that feels. I feel like I don’t even have a mom anymore and seeing my friends moms talking and just doing normal things hurts so much. My mom can’t drive, make food, take a shower on her own, get dressed, read, understand people telling her to do things, or speak a normal sentence anymore. I’m just rambling at this point but I just feel so unbelievably lost	0
My nan has alzheimers, she’s the sweetest soul and last time I saw her she was perfectly standard - infact she hates that in her care home she’s the only mentally well (? - idk if thats the phrase) one there.  I saw her for the first time yesterday since COVID (so over a year), and her health has gone massively downhill.  She forgot my name, forgot my brother existed (he hasn’t seen her for nearly 3 years but I reminded her of it) and she kept saying how everyone thinks she’s guilty because she killed the head carer’s grandma but she know she’s not guilty but she’s being made to suffer (when she told me she was being made to suffer I had to pry it out of her and she still wouldn’t completely tell me- its definitely not the care home). She says the voices in her head laugh when she’s suffering and if she’s not suffering it upsets them. Her speech has also gone downhill (going from mumbling to mouthing words to talking normally)  She refused to go to the toilet because they want her to suffer. She even asked me to leave (which my nan would never do).  I told my Dad everything and he said he’s going to see how she is when he sees her in a couple of days. He said he’s going to get into contact with my uncle to let him know that the nana we once had is no longer there.  Honestly heartbroken, she’s 84 and I don’t want her to forget me, I don’t want her to go but we don’t know how long she has left	0
Didn’t know how to handle a situation this morning. Mom has a yorkie we’ve been waiting weeks to get groomed. I had her looking a pictures because she didn’t like his last cut. She decided all the pictures were scams and they didn’t have dogs and a bunch of other things and refused to let me take the dog to get groomed. I didn’t handle it well. I had a headache and was feeling irritable. But I didn’t even know how to get around this	0
"Me and my wife live in a condo sharing a back wall with this kind little lady who we've always maintained a good relationship with. Over the last year, we've noticed a switch in her temper, she's become much more quick to anger, and her usual old lady forgetfulness was becoming more common and on more significant details. I got my first hint of something wrong when I noticed her dinner table covered in post-it notes and reminders.  Fast forward to yesterday and her grabbing me in the parking lot to show me her old wedding pictures, but confusing her wedding with her sister's. We invite her over for dinner, and she re-asks the same questions three times over the course of the meal, repeatedly expresses surprise that my wife has an accent (she's American), and when discussing the health care system differences between both countries, asks with genuine interest if the United States are a developed nation (don't worry, we held back the many jokes that came to mind at that moment). More importantly, she recounts an anecdote where she yelled at the pharmacist for writing on her pill bottles ""For Alzheimer's"", which made her incredibly angry, because she says she has a bit of a depression, not Alzheimer's, and she won't have anyone implying that her occasional memory lapses are Alzheimer's, she finds the idea insulting.  So, we're worried about her. We're not extremely close, we're just friendly neighbors, but we know that her family situation isn't the best. She's not on excellent terms with her only remaining daughter, which she accuses of only wanting her money; she has one sister she's still in touch with, and she accuses her of scheming with her father when they were kids to have her put in an orphanage. Don't know how much of these is true, she does show some signs of paranoia and seems to make up or mix up stories a lot. We want to make sure she has a proper support system in place and people to rely on when the Alzheimer's gets really bad, even though she's extremely hostile to the idea of a retirement home. We also obviously want to make sure she doesn't become a danger to herself, or others around her. We've been periodically bringing her food to store in her fridge and freezer because we know she only eats convenience store meals at the moment. But as her situation progresses, we don't know how much help she's going to need, and we're not even in a position to provide that help as we're going to be moving before long.  Would it be too nosy to contact her sister, or daughter, to see if they're aware of the situation and can take care of her? Especially considering that she certainly wouldn't want us to get in touch with either of them? It's a pretty delicate situation to be sure, and me and my wife are both unsure what to do, or whether we should even get involved, ethically speaking."	0
I'm equal parts angry, scared, and sad all at once. He's only in his 50s, I'm only in my 20s, it all just feels entirely too soon. I don't know what to do.  Edit: I just wanted to thank everyone for your kind words of advice and nuggets of wisdom. I freaked out a little bit at first and now that I’ve had some time to read up on Alzheimer’s and talk to my parents I’m a little less frantic. It’s still a weight on my shoulders but you’ve all given me the realization that this is just another curveball in life, another cross to bear. We have tons of family photo albums and home videos that will keep him young in our minds and in his. And my parents recently retired and downsized houses so they have more time to spend together. It sucks knowing what will eventually happen, and my dad is still in a bit of denial, but we’ll confront it together. Thank you all. I imagine I’ll be here quite a bit in the future, so see y’all around.	0
But I still had to clean it up and clean her up because she didn’t know what to do. And then I vomited and it was awful. Oh and there was a huge mess on the floor that needed to be cleaned in the bathroom on top of everything else. Plus the laundry I now am having to do.   I have three different candles and two air purifiers running in my apartment.   She is full time in disposable underwear for the past month because she started wetting herself and stopped wiping herself. As much as she wants to hate me for making her wear them, I know I’m right. And they still don’t save me from the fact now that she’s decided she doesn’t regularly have to use the toilet anymore. She peed her bed four times in the past week even with the disposable underwear. And every single time, it is at 7:00 am, which is exactly when I’m supposed to be online and clocking in for work. But no, I’m having to strip the bed, or mop the floor, get her into the shower and clean everything up. I’m so tired of it.   And now we are really at my literal shitty nightmare and I can’t do anything about it other than pray it’s not a common occurrence, until I can finally get her in memory care. I’m working on it, but it is so overwhelming starting to search and the finances of it all is terrifying. She has a settlement she recently was awarded, and that is helpful, but it’s going to run out so fast. I guess my whole plan of putting it in a trust and thinking we could get enough assistance without having to spend it all first is not as attainable as I thought.  She had a UTI last week and started believing that I wasn’t her daughter, that she had a different one, and I was suddenly in her life like some sort of switched at birth conspiracy that was planned by her mom and her brothers she was going to “get them and sue them.” She’s a bit more back to normal now that she was being treated for it, but she still has brought it all up a couple of times like she was still questioning things.   I hate everything. I just want her gone and I still hate that I would rather that over having her be here and being my mom. Mom has been gone for several months. She is truly just a shell now.	0
My grandmother has Alzheimers. Her condition is worsening rapidly, but she refuses to take her medication also to go to her doctor's appointment. Can you give me some advice on how I can persuade her. Also I would like to thank you all . Having some sort of support from people who are going through the same thing has helped me immensely.	0
This looks like an interesting webinar, so wanted to share it here:  [https://neuroimaging.qmenta.com/live-webinar-the-aduhelm-fda-approval-fresh-insights-and-opportunitie?hsLang=en](https://neuroimaging.qmenta.com/live-webinar-the-aduhelm-fda-approval-fresh-insights-and-opportunitie?hsLang=en)	0
Hi I am new to this subreddit my grandmother has been in the hospital for 4 days now with COVID-19 my family and I had expected some progression with Alzheimer’s but not like she is now. We got news from the doctors today that she has progressed in one week as much as she would have in 3 years she’s now being aggressive not eating using the bathroom or anything that she was doing before. My family is going to put her in an assisted living home because she’s going to need 24/7 assistance. I don’t know what to ask for as far as help or things that we can do to make my grandmas time better. Is there anyone with resources or help groups just anyone to talk about this would be greatly. Thank You in advance.	0
My dad loves Activia yoghurts. He eats one/multiples day. My mum bought some double cream to have with desserts. She came home from work the next day to find my dad had eaten the whole tub of double cream, he'd thought it was yoghurt.	0
My grandfather has pretty progressed Alzheimer’s, going on his third year. He lives in a memory care unit and we visit him multiple times a week. He’s been an engineer all his life so he keeps trying to take things apart, I.e. pens, his hearing aids, the remote control. The occupational therapist has suggested giving him things we don’t need anymore to take apart or things for him to build. Does anyone have any suggestions for things like this? We can’t give him real tools because we don’t want him to get hurt, but also we think he will start taking everything apart around him. Just something interesting to keep his hands busy. Any suggestions would be appreciated!	0
My FIL has Alzheimer's and MIL is primary care giver on paper but has my wife do everything.   MIL decided she wants us to rearrange the living room.  It is the only room FIL spends time in.    I think making a big change could confuse him more.  She also wants more chairs which will add trip hazards.  Any suggestions? Thanks	0
This disease sucks. Just heard from my dad that my mom isn't recognizing some of her friends anymore, and can't properly put together the right clothes for an event or outing. And he's really struggling with full-time caregiving.   Those of you who don't live near your LO, how do you help out? I'm trying to rearrange schedules to spend a week there every 4-6 weeks or so (thank goodness for flexible and remote work), but would really like to do more from where I am.	0
It has been demonstrated that anesthesia increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's dementia.  (See e.g.   [Risk of dementia after anaesthsia and surgery](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3939441/).)  For patients with existing Alzheimer's disease, if surgery is required, what is the risk of acceleration of mental decline, and are some types of anesthesia worse than others?	0
Hey, my(f20) friend’s (f21) mother (f57)is very sick with Alzheimers. She is pretty alone going through all this😔What can I do to support? What is the wrong and right things to say and comfort with?	0
I have a family member who shows signs of dementia or Alzheimer's. Unfortunately this person aggressively refuses to get diagnosed - we've managed to get them to a doctor once and as soon as they realized why they were there they simply walked out of the clinic.   Are there any strategies or ideas on how to deal with this? Most of the things I see online are centered around either getting them to a doctor or handling the aftermath of a diagnosis. Neither of these are the problem - they just walk out if the conversation turns to memory issues.	0
I've suspected for a while but today we got the confirmation that my mom is solidly in stage 5. She was diagnosed with Alzheimer's last spring in 2020 (previously it was thought to be some form of dementia but unspecific at that point).  In any case, she's been really good at hiding how bad things have gotten. I see her twice a week. She didn't recognize my sister last weekend (specifically the 22nd). It was awesome that I had to be the one to tell her (/s). I thought it might have been some form of hallucination. I thought she just didn't recognize her because of this. It turns out, I was correct. She called my sister today and said there was a weird man named (dad's name) in our house and she couldn't find our father, (dad's name). In retrospect, I'm incredibly glad I warned my sister about not recognizing her because she was so thankful this call didn't take her completely off guard. Unprompted, my Dad told us that she wanted to pay him for watching the house and wanted to know where the man who lived there was. My dad says he could only describe it as a hallucination. I suppose I should have warned him this was coming, I thought I had more time. I have a psych degree (undergrad only) and specialized in memory disorders because my paternal grandmother had passed from complications with Alzheimer's.  I'm a bit rambly. Tonight has been hard and I hit the wine a little too much.  I'm not ready for this. I want my Mom back. I'm only 32. I have a 3 year old and a 1 year old and I wanted them to know their grandparents like I never knew mine. How is this fair? I miss her so much.	0
"Yesterday I asked DH where his walker was.  He said with assurance, ""It's downstairs.""    Me:  ""We don't have a downstairs.  There is no basement, we just have a concrete slab and the apartment is all one level.""  DH:  ""We DO have a downstairs.""  Me:  ""Where is it?""""  We went back and forth a few more times and all the way to bedtime, and beyond, he went in search of the door to ""downstairs.""  He swore up and down we have a basement ""because I've been in it!""  He was a bit haggard by the end, having tried the door to the pantry, the garage, the laundry room, the utilities closet IN the laundry room, my walk-in closet, both bathrooms, and even looking carefully at the windows.  He insisted, ""there IS a downstairs and I know how to find it, there's a way to get into it without even going outside.""  I suggested it might be better to look for it in the morning and I finally got him into bed.  We laugh a lot at his Alzheimer's (as well as everything else) but I'm kind of afraid to remind him of this incident, not that he would get mad at me but he might spend the next day and a half searching for a basement that doesn't exist.  Just thought this might give someone a smile.  Have a great day, caregivers!"	0
Sorry, confusing title, I know.  My mum has diagnosed alzheimers. My dad has had an assessment, but we haven't heard the outcome yet - but there's some kind of cognitive decline going on.    My parents are still living independently, and they are getting on each other's nerves something shocking.  One (or possibly both) keep moving things around the house, and the other can't find said item.  This could be pills, wallets, books etc etc.  These items are often found in the most obscure places.  Anyway, my issue today is: both parents are insisting the other is verbally abusing them; deliberately hiding things; threatening the other with 'being taken away' etc.  I don't know who is actually telling the truth (or the truth as they believe it) and I just don't know what to say to either of them.  They can both sound coherent and make sense (sometimes!), and neither of them seems to remember that the other one is unwell and that they need to be more patient with the other.  Mum (for instance) says she knows she 'forgets a few things' but seems to have no understanding of just how much she forgets, and if we try to explain it to her, she gets upset and defensive.    Dad is just off in his own little world, ignores mum most of the time and never wears his hearing aids (presumably so he doesn't have to listen to mum repeat the same story/question over and over again).  He will make a statement, apropos of absolutely nothing, and 5 mins later deny saying it.  When we try to explain this is what's happening, he refuses to believe it.  In short, they are both forgetting that they are forgetting stuff and blaming each other for anything and everything!  Does anyone have any tips or hints about how to deal with this?  We're at our wit's end trying to negotiate this stage of their lives, and it's incredibly stressful that after almost 60 years together, they don't even seem to like each other any more.  Any help or suggestions would be gratefully received.  FWIW, I'm in Australia.	0
Hi friends. I hope to gain some help in ways to deal with my situation so any advice is much appreciated as I don’t have anyone to speak to about this.   This year my grandma has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s which was a big and sudden blow to our family. She is the closest person to me in our family so you can imagine it was devastating to hear.   My mother took her in to live with her to watch over her and make sure she’s okay. She watches over her, cooks for her, makes sure she takes her medicines and she is trying very very hard.  My mother is one of the kindest and selfless people I know, she does everything for us. However, she is a very explosive person who often screams and loses patience easily without even realizing how she is speaking. This was a hard adjustment (and still is) for her to accept that her mom is not the same full thinking adult that she used to be and to be aware of the diagnosis. She often gets into arguments with grandma over small things, even though these fights are absolutely pointless as grandma just gets the stress but will forget everything the next day. Not to mention they could be easily avoided. After these fights she feels bad but the damage is done already. I fear that grandmas condition worsens as a result of these stressful situations. Whenever I try to say anything to mom about this or how she speaks to grandma during these periods she gets defensive and screams at me, which also results in nothing being resolved and her not hearing me.   I understand my mom and her frustration. All of her children live abroad, her partner is also living in another country and due to Covid they cannot even see each other, so she is alone in this and on top of that Alzheimer’s is very frustrating to deal with, especially considering fact that it’s happening to her mom and she obviously feels scared and sad about that. She is doing her best and I know that she is just tired, and grandmas comments such as “I am a burden to you all” just blow her fuse off at the end of the day when all she does is for her family and she barely ever does anything for herself.  I feel sad and hopeless and I worry for both of their states. I don’t know how to approach this.  I wonder does anyone else have a similar situation and how do I deal with it?	0
Hello everyone,  I'm a young person who has a grandmother than we believe is hit with dementia but her case is rather unique. She had a heart attack a few years ago and we discovered with recent medical checks that most of her brain cells have died ever since however she didn't lose most of her abilities right away, it was progressive and it was something we didn't notice at first.  The most signs we had noticed was when my grandfather passed away in 2018, that's when she came to live with us and we believe that his death was rather dramatic since her state has worsened ever since. At first the issues weren't that big, she could still hold conversations and remember things, she could observe people and give judgement about them, etc. She would sometimes become anxious when being alone and would have troubles sleeping at times but that's it.  2019 things became more difficult, her sleepings difficulties have increased, her memories have declined, we were expecting it so it didn't shock us much at the time, she could still stay by herself when my parents went to work and I would help her when I came from school by preparing us lunch.  2020 that's when the troubles became, she had become too unstable, she couldn't sleep at night and whenever we left her alone in a room because we had things to do or needed to discuss in private she'd wander around until finding us and staying by our side, she couldn't stay alone in a literal way and even if she would be with people she would start wandering from times to times. She could still use her bathroom alone and wash her hands.  2021 my father doesn't live with us anymore and has moved elsewhere because she was too unstable for the family and we couldn't sleep nor focus on our school activites or work, he's currently taking care of her and I visit her during vacations. I saw her this summer, she has become a lot worse, she barely can say more than a few words and 95% of what she says is nosense or unrelated to any events, she can barely count to 5 (she counts our fingers), she can't tell what time it is anymore nor does she remember how old is she. (She still remembers her name)  She forgot my mother's name (despite having lived with her for more than 20 years), she confuses my father's name with mine and calls most people by the same name, sometimes she pronounces random names of people we aren't really familiar with (perhaps from her youth ?)  Another major issue is that she wanders a lot and has become quite agressive whenever we try to call her inside or want to make her sit for a bit (because she hurts herself while wandering), even if it's dark outside she will open the door and leave (my father has to lock the door and remove the key from there and even then she tries to snatch the door away, gives up, wanders around then repeats)   My father has been on low sleeping cycles for almost a year now, my grandmother sleeps only a few hours and then never ends wandering, she sometimes sits at the balcony but conversation with her is rather impossible and we even have to force her eat sometimes because she stops after every spoon she takes.  Can someone tell me what stage is this ? From what I read it does sound like stage 6 of dementia but I'm not quite sure. Since she had a heart attack her progression has been rather fast compared to how dementia evolves (according to the articles I've read) and it might be due to her cerebral damage.   For how long can we expect for her to be by our side at this point ?	0
My mother is petrified when she goes to the dentist.  It seems like she now had issues with her teeth (cavities, crowns, etc) nearly every month.     She is so scared when I say we are going to dentist and we have tried some pills like xanax to relax her.  Any tips or is this common for those with dementia ?	0
Mom is stage 6E on the FAST scale.  She is approaching Stage 7.  The doctors won't give me any ballpark ideas for life expectancy.  I am trying to make sure she doesn't outlive her money.  Internet research says 1-3 years at that stage.  She sleeps most of the time.  Anybody have any experience you can share?	0
My dad is still in the early stages. But getting worse fast. Easily confused whenever he's in an unfamiliar place. Which pretty much means whenever he leaves the house now. But also won't admit how bad he is, so he keeps insisting on going out. Sometimes takes the car keys and goes before any of us realize he's gone.   Said he just went to the corner store for coffee. He was gone almost 3hrs. Can't even account for where he was, doesn't realize he was gone for so long.   He won't wear a bracelet or necklace. Keeps loosing his phone or forgets to charge it, so a simple phone tracker app won't help. What else is there? Shame we can get him chipped like a pet lol.	0
   Tl;dr  Dad has alz stage 5  Lives with caretakers  Falls in love with longtime friend during pandemic  Changes personality and becomes hostile to fam  Friend moves into house n removes safety measures  They now intend to marry despite his clear decline and impending end  Fam in disarray  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  My 77 year old dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in October 2019 and is now in stage 5. He lives with caretakers in his home, a condo in a senior living complex.   He has developed sleepwalking symptoms and was found outside with no pants at one point, requiring his other son who lives closer to put alarms on the door and for Dad to wear a gps watch. The HOA  people have warned him that the next time he is found outside like that they will revoke his lease!   During the pandemic he rekindled an old relationship and before you know it he had a girlfriend. Good for him - the old boy has plenty of lead in his pencil as his doctor buddy is prescribing him cialis (it helps alzheimers symptoms?) which powers up his hypersexuality, leading him to spend astounding amounts of $$ on porn.   After about a year of dating he asks her to move in and he agrees. And this is where the trouble starts.  I know he is free to pursue love and happiness right down to his last day on earth. However, this man has been diagnosed with a progressive and terminal neurological disease and he needs care.  His girlfriend, a 70year old widow we will call N. has so far removed family photos from the wall, saying they bothered her. She removed the alarms on the door placed there to keep Dad from wandering off.  She forces his caretakers to care for her and her dog, causing constant conflicts with these wonderful and competent people.   She takes him to her place and he stays long enough to miss med doses which isnt good for him. She acts like he is is a normal healthy 77 year old dude and will not dispense meds to him or act lIke a caretaker AT ALL. When questioned by my brother, she says she has no intention of wiping his ass.   She is insisting on remodeling his apartment and moving his bed upstairs even though we moved it downstairs for his safety. The caretakers are there 24 hours - he plans to cut it to 12 as N will be there. She was with him but asleep when he sleptwalked a few times last month and peed in a sink.   Dad and N went to his lawyers to draw up an agreement so she can legally move in within the next few weeks.  During the meeting he said they had been together for a year and after another year they would get married. Under normal circumstances, mazel tov!   But these aren't normal circumstances. First off, he lied to her right off the bat, saying he had only mild memory impairment (MCI) even after he was diagnosed and voluntarily gave up his drivers license which is a huge deal here. Second,  he went to all the trouble of setting up a trust for his kids and grandkid and getting everything legally squared away. But his personality changed within that year and now I guess he has different priorities now?  As for protecting him with legal measures - the state of California is totes cool with alz patients signing on the dotted line as long as they can show they are competent by responding to questions from the notary public or other official.    My Dad is very charming and could convince any one he is competent to get married. That prevents us from getting conservatorship and getting a restraining order against her. They are in love and love trumps all. Even a fam trying to deal with the long slow death of our Dad.   There is nothing I can do as N. has totally brainwashed him to the point where he will get angry if you question him. We were supposed to be looking for a nursing home for him when he hits stage 6 - we are all aware of what is coming next for him. The only person that does not seem to know or care is N. I just want my Dad back.	0
The wife's memory has been failing over 2-3 years. MRI and Cat Scans showed up nothing.  After insisting, GP gave us a referral to a psychiatrist specialising in dementia.  Initial consultation led to strong belief on Alzheimer's. Sent us for further tests, both nuclear medicine tests, SPECT and PET.  These tests showed up the temporal lobes plus the rear and top of the brain having diminished activity. In addition to memory, gait and balance would be impacted as well.  Gait, I have noticed already. This failing had led to a fall and a fractured shoulder. After 3 surgeries, all is healing. But 3 lots of general anaesthetic has not helped either.  On Aricept at the moment. Just working out correct dosage now.  Moral of the story, MRI and CAT scans do not always show up the dementia.  BTW, as Australians, none of the diagnostic tests cost us anything. All paid for by the Government.  BTW, wife is 71, I'm a bonny 59.	0
I'm fairly new to reddit posts so I do not know how to exactly format this, but I still wanted to make a post. About two or three years ago my mom was first diagnosed with frontal variant Alzheimer's disease (fvad). Even before this diagnosis I had noticed that my mother would have irrational and spontaneous moments where she would lash out in anger. Whether it be coming home from work, taking me to church, or even just eating dinner. It's an odd thing to deal with this kind of stuff especially since I am only 19, and was first dealing with the situation at a younger age. The main issue currently is that my mother seems to be progressing further at an alarming rate. Recently I had heard that this could be directly related to having covid. A few weeks ago she was tested positive and since then things have been spiraling out of control. Currently my mother is trying to file for a divorce from my father and it is putting an overwhelming amount of pressure on me in the process. She even tries to play a child-like game of winning me in her favor. From an outside perspective I find no reason for the divorce to be even in process since someone with alzheimers shouldn't even be living by themselves. My mother has severe short term memory loss and it concerns me that if she somehow won the legal battle, she would be living alone. For example of such memory loss, my mother will repeatedly ask me questions concerning some of the simplest stuff like classes or even if she fed the dog. While I am at college I constantly get text messages and phone calls from both my parents and it stresses me out.  &#x200B;  Another difficult thing about this situation is that it seems like me and my father are almost crazy because we are the only family members who can actually recognize the change my mother has went through. Some of the family members on my mothers side even act like total assholes to my father and get up in his face. The legal difficulty about this is that my dad cannot just force them out of the house because my mother also owns it, thus she can legally invite whoever she wants over. On top of this, my mothers family members also have her help watch over some of their kids, and have her almost doing a 'task' for the benefit of themselves. It seems like total hypocrisy. Both me and my father fear that they may try to use her so that they may gain access to some of her assets. Something of which I find no reason for. With the progressing rate of alzheimers, we also worry that my mother may one day get lost. This happened to my best friends mother, and she was unfortunately killed while walking along the highway. On top of this, my best friends family was sued and lost a lot of money to the drunk driver who killed his mother. It's sometimes stupid how the legal system works.... The main point of my post though is to gain some outside information on how I might be able to deal with this situation in a more effective manner. Has anyone else had some similar situations happen to themselves?   &#x200B;   If I could get any answers in relation to advice on the situation, it would be much appreciated. Much thanks to those of you who read my full post!	0
So like the title says I woke up to a phone call from my parents and my.mom informing me she had been diagnosed with dementia. I don't even know how to process. She has been my biggest supporter in my.life and secretly the biggest deterrent when I was at my lowest to not take my own life. I have no idea what to do. I'm terrifies of losing the connection we have.	0
We had to take the cars away from my MIL (patient) because she's been determined to be unfit for driving. My FIL wants his car back, but it can't be returned until he has a plan for keeping the key safe from MIL. We were thinking about getting a finger print controlled lock box for the car key. Do any you have experience with something like this and have any advice? Thank you!	0
My wife quit her job to help take care of her Mom who has been formally diagnosed with dementia.   My wife and I are struggling, the stress is too much and it's made worse by the fact that her mother was HORRIBLE to her entire family for years with verbal abuse and hoarding.   I'm trying to remain positive. I'm normally an over compassionate empath, but now I feel heartless.	0
My mom, 56, got her official diagnosis, early onset (obvi) early to mid stage alzheimers, earlier this year. I first noticed symptoms 6 years ago, but it wasn't until last autumn when she got into her car and drove 2 states away, didn't know where she was or how to get home, that my dad finally agreed to have her evaluated.  Since then it seems like she is progressing rapidly, the medication is helping with agitation, but thats it.  They rent a beach house every year with an open invitation to us, which was last week. During the 1.5 days i was up there, I noticed she's started confusing my oldest brother for our other brother and my dad. She also wasn't sure of my name. I asked my dad if he was having someone come to house yet, he works full time outside of the home, to which he said no and brushed off. Then he's talking about next year hes going to rent a week at the same house for just the two of them then a bigger house for another week for us kids and our children to visit... im thinking like dad who knows if she's going to be able to make the trip next year.	0
My grandpa is visiting this weekend with my uncle and cousins. He’s doing pretty well! I was afraid that the weekend was going to feel a little sad, but he seems almost like his old self. We had an addition put on our house about seven years ago, but he doesn’t remember being here since then. Other than that, we haven’t really noticed much.   He’s spending the night at my house tonight instead of staying at my house tonight instead of staying at the hotel with my uncle. He’s telling us a lot of funny family stories, and things he remembers from when my mom was a kid.	0
My mother is her mom's primary caretaker and recently my grandma has gotten really bad. We don't know for sure if it's actual Alzheimer's or dementia, but she has regular mood swings to the point where she will be speaking (nonsense) in a normal mood and then immediately switch into the most hurtful and mean things we've ever heard. She tries to start fights with members of the house, she hoards loose chips under her pillows, and frequently leaves the house unaccompanied. She was getting in the car at one point but my mom and dad now hide the keys. Now she can't do that, she goes into the woods behind their house or will cross the street to the neighbors houses. Yesterday they found her underneath someone's porch.  My mom isn't sure what to do or how to get help. They've tried talking to doctors, and my mom is her power of attorney, but apparently the Doctor doesn't think she's a danger to herself. Just trying to help my mom get some relief or assistance, they can't afford to pay to house her at a facility that's equipped to help people like this.	0
My grandmother  was diagnosed with early stages of Alsheimers last year, but her condition is getting worse by the day. For instance today she decided that she was to be wed to a stranger who has called her on the phone. I tried explaining to her that that isn't true and there is no one, but she got very aggressive - she tried jumping off the balcony, bit me  etc. The emergency hotline said they couldn't do anything. I have never felt more unprepared in my life. I'm incapable of taking care of her, but also I don't want to send her to a nursing home. She is the one who raised me and it feels like I am abandoning her, but I can't give her the proper care she needs. Can someone give me advice? She won't tolerate an assistant and I doubt getting her to a nursing home will be any easier. Thank you in advance.	0
My grandfather moved the both of them to our city because he couldn’t take care of her by himself anymore. My grandmother had a hard childhood with a slew of mental health problems that went untreated for most of her life. She lost both of her parents by the age of 10 and grew up in a time when mental health was highly stigmatized. So, she never got help and became someone who lived very unhappily (depression, OCD, bipolar disorder) but still loved her grandchildren despite her inability to live with a clear, happy mind. I knew her this way as a child and into my teenage years. She was a workaholic who went to workout classes almost every day after work. She stayed up late doing dishes every night and spoke ill of the people who hurt her in the past, sometimes saying things to us we didn’t need to hear as children. I understand now that she wasn’t well.   Years later, she doesn’t remember my name but she cries when she sees me and comments on how beautiful I am. She always preferred the granddaughters of the family, but I will admit it feels odd to receive such a warm and genuine hug from her after all these years, before which her tormented mind didn’t really know how to be in the present moment and enjoy time with her family. She used to be so fiercely independent, refusing to let anyone do the dishes after dinner, and now I am afraid to let her touch a dish lest it should fall and hurt her.   Alzheimer’s is a harrowing disease. But I look at my grandmother, and I know she loves me, despite the memory loss. I think of the kindness in her eyes, despite the hardship she’s faced. This is all so strange to process. She is not like yesterday. And from here on out she won’t be.	0
Hello,   My mother in law is in a memory care facility. My father in law is there 5-6 hours a day, 7 days a week, helping her. She also has serious gastro issues in addition to advanced Alzheimers.   My FIL's neighbor just asked my husband if he could take over a day a week to give his dad a break. His mental health is low, low low.   We visit every weekend and leave when she gets too tired. We can adjust to visiting for longer periods and helping more if needed.  This will include a lot of bathroom stuff, which my husband is dreading (but will do if needed, of course).    With her gastro issues she's in constant pain and paired with her Alzheimers and OCD, is absolutely obsessed with bathroom stuff. For example, she is scared of going to the bathroom for nonsensical reasons. Last time I was there I was helping her in the bathroom and she was convinced a man down the hall would kill her if he found out she was going to the bathroom.   Also, My FIL makes her eat and drink. She wouldn't otherwise. He calls doctors, makes appointments, advocated for her, etc.  I am just wondering if it's normal for a husband to have to do so much care in a memory care facility. I thought this is why she was there, to get more help for actually taking care of herself. Or is this a special scenario? Last time we beat FIL there and she just kept asking for him constantly. I think she was embarrassed. Why aren't the nurses at the facility helping her? Is it just too constant?   We really had hoped that FIL would get to be a visitor. But he's Definitely still her primary caretaker.   She is moving to a brand new, super nice facility in October. I am hoping it will help her, but we are worried she will be too far gone to even enjoy it. I just want to know what to expect in this nicer facility. Should I call them? This is so hard.	0
 TW// s**cide - not mine though  I should start out by saying: my mom and I have a relationship like a broken piggy bank taped together. My childhood was not a happy one. I forgive her trespasses in exchange for having a mother. She’s been abusive but less so than my other parent.   I feel like it’s just all so much right now. My first day as a senior in college is tomorrow, technically today, and I want to be asleep, but I am up tonight thinking about my mom’s eulogy.  I am 22 and my mom was recently diagnosed with mid-stage Alzheimer’s. She’s also in renal failure. She doesn’t actively treat either. She goes to doctors appointments to track her progression, takes vitamins, and takes medication for her blood pressure/blood sugar (she’s diabetic) but that’s it.   It’s been an absolutely fucking emotionally wrecked summer. She had a suicide attempt earlier this summer when she found out she was in renal failure. She watched her brother die from diabetes and was a nurse for decades, so she was horrified of going through dialysis. She had been abusing pills for years anyhow. When she attempted suicide, myself and my siblings didn’t even know about her kidney problems. She was on death’s door. My dad found her catatonic in the bed. She was in the ICU for days. Then we find out about the kidneys. And a week ago, it’s dementia.   Plus, while I’m taking care of her over this span it’s punch after punch. She’s not drinking water consistently because she doesn’t like the taste and gets a UTI- then a kidney infection. She vomits. I feel awful for her.   I am trying to speak with a therapist at school. I am taking 18 hours and working technically two jobs. Plus I (at least part time) take care of her on weekends. There are other times where I am her primary caregiver.   I wish I could be a kid. My siblings are both a decade older than me. I am so so deeply frustrated with my life right now.   I know all I can do is accept- but this is such a shitty plate to eat. I know life isn’t fair. I get it. I get it. I get it. It doesn’t make it any better.   I want to know that my mom will make it to my graduation. I want to know that my mom will know who I am when I graduate.	0
"I (23 f) am emotionally exhausted from being in the company of great granny (87 f) because she seems to lack the capacity to understand I can't gain the weight she expects.  For context, I'm from a mostly Puerto Rican family, we are blended with Dominicans as well. It's probably not even relevant what our race is, However there's this stereotypical standard of the latina body being curvy, thick, round, stacked or even just basically chunky and fat is expected and acceptable. This applies to my sisters, half sisters, my female cousin's, nieces, the daughters of my cousin's. Older and same age aunt's.  You get the point.  I am a string bean, petite and flat chested.  I just wasn't privy to having the same genetics. But it's fine. It's never been an issue for me or my family. Atleast until there was a change in my great grandma a little before I had turned 19. She confused me as one of my 12 year old nieces. The family would actively correct her though over time she would be bewildered seeing me in this ""condition"" when I visited.   She accused family of not feeding me, worried if I wasn't eating enough. We thought it would remedy the situation if I visited my aunt and grandma more often to eat as they are her caretakers and grandma was a better cook anyway. I was happy to at first but it got tense why great gran wanted me to have a second plate of rice and beans or more potato or the extra fatty porkchop or another piece of plantain lasagna. I ate in abundance but I wasn't gaining weight because of course that's not how my metabolism works. This couldn't just continue, especially because my mom and half sister miss eating with me at our apartment complex. And sometimes the bus rides weren't worth the 15 minute commute.  I cut my dinner visits for a few days just to get phone calls from aunty explaining that great gran was actively looking for me to offer me food or desserts. I could hear her in the background calling for me, accusing grandma of not inviting me, sadly lamenting my absence when they put her on the phone with me. It breaks my heart.  We tried other options like switching things up and inviting other cousin's and adult grandkids so great grand could have plenty of company and liesurely get togethers with family. It worked for some time. But then it gets uncomfortable if she saw a ""flaca"" like myself among the visits and she'd go right back to demanding they are eating more or requesting to be on the phone with me because I have to make sure I come over right away so I can eat. I don't know what to do and I'm so worried if she's suffering with concern over something that can't even be helped."	0
About two weeks ago, my grandma (74) was diagnosed with colon cancer. Now the entire family has their input on what my mom and I, her caregivers, should do. They never talked to us before as she struggles with Alzheimer's.  It may seem really morbid but last wishes and death has always been a talking point in our family since I was a kid. So much so it comes up atleast once a week. Thankfully, because we talk about it so much I know what my grandma's wishes are when it comes to treatment. She has told me many times she doesn't want a colostomy bag, chemo, or anything that will keep her on machines for the rest of her life.   I have already accepted her eventual death. We didn't think she'd live past 2017. It's been 4 years since then and we've tried to make the best of them we could. It still hurts to know this is probably the end but I'm ready for it. My mom is still getting there but not far behind me in accepting what will come. My other family wants us to do everything we can to keep her alive. They're blaming us for not doing more to help her. They've been distant for many years and offering no help whatsoever with her Alzheimer's and other medical problems.  I'm not sure how to end this but my mom and grandma go to the surgeon today to discuss options. I'll update if there is any major changes.	0
My mom moved to assisted living 4 months ago because she woke up one day and no longer recognized her house as hers. (She was diagnosed in January 2021) She was convinced the people who lived there would come home and find her and call the police. At that time we decided to move her to assisted living. She still recognizes her family and most of her friends and can do self care for the most part so she’s not in memory care yet. Unfortunately for the last 2 days she has been very distressed because she does not recognize where she is again. I try to calm her and tell her to look around and see her furniture and pictures in the apartment. I tell her she is safe and loved. I have signs I made for her answering her most frequent questions posted in her apartment but that does not seem to be working anymore. Any suggestions to help her be calmer and feel safe?	0
I wouldn't usually post or reach out like this but I am not sure what to do in this case okay so about 2 years ago I started dating my girlfriend and moved into her mums house after a year and been here since so about 6 months ago her mum has been diagnosed with alzeimers at only 58 years old and me and my girlfriend are only 20 and we are having to pretty much take care of her and take her to appointments make her dinner and its affecting me being able to work fulltime because I come home to relax and the mother is just standing behind my qnd talking bon stop while I am trying to make my dinner and relax it is non stop issues and I feel like me and Mr girlfriend can't just get on with our life because we have been left to deal with this all on our own	0
Age 80, a Navy vet whose service ended in 1964.  With this mess in Afghanistan, he came to me in a serious tone of voice telling me he wants to go help with the evacuation of Americans and friendly Afghans.  He said he would be able to help getting people out of the country, he just might need to update his security codes.  I told him I didn't think the government would take him, at 80 and with Alzheimers.  He said he would be willing to take drugs to treat the dementia.  I pointed out that he's already on drugs for Alzheimers (memantine and donepezil).  Poor fellow.	0
My only living grandparent is my grandmother, she is 94-year-old, she experiences some dementia, and she was hospitalized last winter due to pneumonia.  The staff at the hospital left her unattended for too long at one point, and she ended up falling and experiencing a concussion.   As a result, she experienced a blood clot in her brain, which was thankfully addressed via surgery.  However, due to the surgery and other variables, she has lost some of her ability to walk, and her legs are not as strong as before.  She now completely depends on some of my aunts and other family members, and they have been overwhelmed by the process of caring for her.  They may be in the process of hiring someone to help them from time to time, but I am not sure when that will come to fruition.  With that said, please recommend any forms of technology that my family can invest in, that will make the process of caring for my grandmother easier on my family.  Your help is greatly appreciated.	0
My grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in January. Her doctor graded it as moderate to severe. She and my mother had a financial POA contract drawn up and signed it. I am the backup on the POA contract in case my mother doesn’t fulfill her role as POA.  Meanwhile, my uncle has been desperately trying to take advantage of my grandmother. He and his wife don’t work and live off of government assistance and handouts from local churches. They have had many issues with CPS over the years. As soon as my grandmother was diagnosed, he started getting her to give him money, buy him things, etc. He convinced her to give him some family heirlooms also, including some WW2 guns that belonged to my great grandfather. Then he got her to agree to let him have some of her land, worth about $40,000 and co-sign for him to buy a trailer for it. Luckily, my mom let him know that he can’t do that without her signing off on it. He and my grandmother are both angry that my mom is preventing this.   My mom and I have noticed that my grandmother has been sort of distant from us the past couple of weeks. Then today she told us that my uncle took her to see a different attorney and she going to make my uncle her POA. My mom asked her if she told the attorney about her diagnosis. My grandmother argued that she doesn’t even have Alzheimer’s and that we are lying to her.   I think my uncle has convinced her that nothing is even wrong with her. I think that he is telling her what she wishes was true so that she will be more helpful to him.   Mom and I don’t want her money or land either, because we assume it will all be needed to pay for her care. She’s only 72, so young to suffer from Alzheimer’s. We probably have a long road ahead. But if she truly doesn’t want one of us to be her POA that’s okay, it’s her life, we just don’t think my irresponsible uncle should do it.   Do you guys have any advice? Can she make my uncle her POA at this stage in her Alzheimer’s? Is there any option other than paying an attorney $300 an hour for finding a solution to this? If we can’t afford an attorney can the state appoint someone to be her POA?   We are new at this and we don’t really know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated!	0
This is the worst she has ever been in front of me with me physically there. She refused to go to the pet store to get food for her cat because 'they' told her she can't go now, and then she proceeded to talk to 'them' through the wall. This was such a shock to me as I had never seen the paranoia/ delusions exhibited so openly. What am I supposed to do? I tried to calm her down and then left, and Im going to get her cat food and deliver it to her, but feeling very scared seeing this so openly.	0
Has anyone given up on their career to be a caregiver for parent with dementia ?     I am single and no kids.  I can financially afford it for a few years and feel like my mother might be in nursing home in 2-3 years and think it is hard to measure the time I can spend with her now while she still knows me versus what she may be at in 2-3 years.	0
How do you take care of a parent with dementia who is sick all the time?   My mother has early stage dementia and heart issues, kidney issues, and other medical issues.  She needs someone to do her pills, make sure she take pills, go to doctors appts, talk to doctors on phone, go to have labs,  etc.      I am physically and mentally beat up.  I do not think having a visiting nurse come will help much because my mothers meds chaneg all the time and she has 10 different doctors that call and so ultimately will not really save me time a I will have to go back to talk with doctors, etc anyways.	0
Has anyone had any luck getting access? The rollout since FDA approval has been pretty spotty, and details very murky when I talk to our doctor.	0

I'm curious to see if there are people out there who have had experience trying some of the research-based but not yet validated treatments out there, especially for slowing progression of early alzheimers. Some of the ones that seem interesting to me have been:  * 40hz light/sound therapy https://picower.mit.edu/news/new-trial-test-brain-wave-stimulation-alzheimers-preventative * Plasma exchange https://health.ucdavis.edu/blog/lab-best-practice/plasma-exchange-with-albumin-replacement-for-alzheimers-disease/2021/05 * Rapamycin https://news.uthscsa.edu/ut-health-san-antonio-gains-2m-to-study-rapamycin-for-alzheimers/ * NAD+ supplementation https://www.pnas.org/content/115/8/E1876  Any experiences with these or other potential treatments in this sort of edge-of-research area would also be super appreciated.	0
My dad is 57 and was just diagnosed yesterday. He was also told he has brain plaque. He's seeing a neurologist in a month to get more information. I know all cases are different but could anyone give me a rough idea of how long I might have with him . Right now he does have any severe signs of it , hell go out to his car and forget his phone or something and on occasion hell get tongue tied but I would say its very mild at this point. How fast does this progress and how long could I have to be able to do things he still enjoys before he is no longer capable. Thanks !	0
Hi - my mum was officially diagnosed with Alzheimers a couple of years ago, but her cognitive decline had been evident for some time. Overall, it seems to be a steady, but slow decline.     We were all so concerned and attentive towards mum, that we just didn't notice the decline in dad, or put his occasional 'confusion' down to being tired, or a little worse for wear (ie he did love a drink).  Now, it's becoming apparent that he is also headed down the dementia path, and we are waiting for his official assessment.  The trouble is, I think he has a different type of dementia - perhaps Lewy Body or frontal lobe dementia.  He gets very frustrated and loses patience incredibly quickly nowadays (he used to be a very patient man), and he seems to have lost a lot of empathy towards mum; sometimes he just talks rubbish and I can't figure out what he's on about; he gets up in the middle of the night, convinced he needs to shower and dress for an appointment.  My biggest problem at the moment is that he and mum are driving each other crazy!  Part of mum's behaviour is obsessing about things, and she won't let dad out of her sight for very long, scared he will fall over and hurt himself.  There's a history of this, so it's not an unreasonable concern - but she follows him around constantly, and it drives him nuts!  Mum's also exhausted, because of dad getting up throughout the night - but she won't sleep in another room, as she's too scared he will get up and fall over, and she won't hear him.  So, with mum being extra tired and dad being extra impatient, they are constantly arguing and bickering - apparently a few nights ago they had a serious screaming match ... but neither of them can recall what exactly was said or by whom, just that they were both upset and that it was the other's fault.  So fat, my sister and I have heard several versions of what triggered the intense argument, but as the stories constantly change, we simply don't know who or what to believe..  My parents are, at this stage, refusing to go into any kind of care in any capacity - not even for respite.  According to them, there's nothing wrong with them, they just forget a few things (!) and get a bit impatient with each other.  My sister and I do have PoA and Guardianship; we've stopped dad drinking; we've taken both sets of car keys and we're trying our best to manage them - but jeez it's f***ing hard.  Both parents are in their early 80's.  Has anyone else had both parents develop dementia?  Do you have any suggestions/opinions on how we might move forward?  FWIW, we're in Australia.  Thank you for reading this far ... apart from anything else, I needed to do a bit of a verbal dump ... this shit is just so exhausting and overwhelming.	0
For those that have moved their loved one from assisted living to memory care, was there a new behavior or something else that finally cemented the decision to do the move?  I'm putting off memory care as long as I can (almost double the cost) but obviously safety and well-being is the first priority.	0
“He’s had another accident” my mum said when I waked in. “I left his pile cream and toothpaste together in the bathroom.” “Fuckin hell mum, which one did he use?” “I dunno but he’s either got a minty arse or tight gums I’ve not found out yet” My Dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2014. We think he’d had it longer. Hes 75 now, an ex semi professional footballer in his younger years, and as it has been well covered on the news recently, it is now very common to see this generation of ex players suffering from it after years of heading heavy mud soaked footballs in the 60’s and 70’s.   Throughout my time growing up in wythenshawe, everyone knew Big Rick. Wherever we went when I was introduced to anyone he used to play with they would eulogise about how great a player he was. I used to find it annoying as a spotty faced centre forward trying to be my own man and living in his shadow in the Manchester amateur football scene, but looking back it was something I should have enjoyed.   He was larger than life in my teenage years. Passionate about sport. Loved his horse racing, golf and snooker. Terrible gambler. Would bet on two flies on a wall. Some of my earliest memories is being on holiday where we were dragged into a smokey room upstairs in pontins in Prestatyn whilst he played brag. He would sit laughing and swearing at everyone with a massive cigar on the go.   That’s what makes it so difficult now. It’s never easy for anyone altzimers. It’s a bastard of a disease. The long goodbye as it’s commonly known. It’s a gradual thing. Human beings only remember in the short term, and the longer it goes on, you remember the person they are now rather than then. With my dad the most painful thing was watching the confidence disappear. He was such an alpha male. To see him turn nervous and apologetic was heartbreaking.   I was going through some old VHS tapes recently and found him doing a speech at a sportsman’s evening from the mid eighties. I felt a lump in my throat straight away. There he was, full of life and passion, delivering a wonderful speech to a room of hundreds of people. I called him in and he sat down. “Watch this” I said and as he walked on stage his old smile beamed across his face. “Look at that” he said. He watched the whole thing in silence and it was like we’d stepped into a time machine together. It was wonderful. At the end he turned to me and I looked at him holding back the tears and he said “who was that again?”. I just burst out laughing.   Recently he has got worse and the stories have become more ridiculous. He was always telling you which football league grounds he had played at when you were watching the games, but he tried to tell me he’d played at the Allianz arena last week. “Have you fuck” I told him, then felt really snide. He also recanted a wonderful tale to me recently of how his dad had been kidnapped by Germans during World War Two but the tootengam hotspur team had rescued him and his dad had took him to spurs as guest of honour when he was young and they were paraded round the pitch. Another one in the car was when we were driving through Bramhall and he said “when I was a kid there were no cars round here.......just elephants with men riding them”.   I had to spend a weekend looking after him recently when my mum was away and it is only when you spend an extended period of time with him that you see the disease in it’s entirety. It comes down like a cloud. Sometimes, it’s like he hasn’t even got it, then other times it’s like he is completely not there. On the Saturday night we watched match of the day together then I give him his tablets and put him in bed and just as I tucked him in he looked at me with an expression of complete clarity like he was 20 years younger and said “thanks for doing all this for me son”. I give him a kiss and went in the next room, lay down in the dark and cried like I hadn’t for years.   I’m not complaining, he’s 75 and still here. Some of my mates lost their dad very early and I realise how lucky I’ve been. But in all honesty and as hard as this is to say out loud, when he does go it will be a relief. It’s hard enough now, seeing him in the middle stages. I just hope he goes before it gets worse. If I got the call in the middle of the night that he had gone in his sleep, I would grieve for my dad, but a part of me would rejoice. I would celebrate that I won’t have to watch any more of it. To see him deteriorate to the point where he doesn’t remember you any more, that’s got to be the worst. I hope he goes before then, on his own terms, riding the big elephant to the sky, detouring through bramhall first, of course.	0
My grandpa has talked to me twice now on my grandma’s memory. She’s 75 years old. He first mentioned it to me last winter, but said it may just be her getting a bit older. I had noticed she seemed to be writing things down more, both on a notepad in her purse, and on a calendar she keeps by her armchair. She had also started asking me to remind her more often when I had appointments and such that she wanted to come up for.  This past weekend, he mentioned it again, but explained that things are getting worse. She’ll go pull out the sweeper, sweep, put the sweeper up, then a little bit later go pull out the sweeper again, and then just leave it  laying out. She’s forgetting conversations more often, to the point where my Great Uncle even mentioned it to my grandpa. My great uncle’s wife had Alzheimer’s, and he told my grandpa that my grandma reminds him of his wife before her diagnosis. Another odd behavior my grandpa mentioned was that she’s started to screw bottle caps on wrong. He showed me that this morning, she left a bottle of orange juice on the counter, and the cap was on it crooked. Though, full transparency I’m not for sure how/if that’s a sign of Alzheimer’s, I didn’t see it while I was searching around.   All of this aside, another thing we talked about was how/if we should mention this to her. I love my grandma dearly, she’s been almost a mother to me, but I know she can be stubborn and doesn’t take perceived criticism well.   What’s the best way to go about bringing the potential for this to her attention? I don’t want to hurt her emotionally, but I’m so scared that if this goes un-checked by the time she get’s help it’ll be too late	0
"Hello, i've posted before a couple times and figured I would post again.     The last two times, pre pandamic, I tried to visit my Grandma and did, however both times she did not recall who I was. We were always very close so this was extremely hard for me, but I put on a brave face and she did tell me I was ""Quite a nice young man"" at the end of the visit.     Fast forward to 2021, last year she had a fall and broke her hip, she'd now in a wheelchair, and i've been internally conflicted if I should still go and see her next time I get a chance, or stop visiting. I always feel a bit awkward visiting her (I'm on the autism spectrum) but I've tried my best the last few times. I posted this because internally I am conflicted on seeing her how she is now, or just remembering how she was at least before the fall.      Thanks in advance for any answers."	0
Please can somebody help me? I have so many questions.  He isn't too far gone yet, but I can see he isn't himself anymore when I'm visiting. Like, can I help in anyway even though I can't live with my parents? What should I think about when I talk with him?  How fast does it take ahold? Can I help my mom in anyway that live with him and have a hard time handling/dealing with this? And much more PM me or write in the comments	0
Throwaway bc family and friends know my reddit acc.  My step-father is in his mid fifties, diagnosed with AD three years ago with clear symptoms at least five years ago. In his family, his father had it, his grandmother had it, and his great-grandmother had it as well as certain members of his extended family. It's a prevalent disease due to, I imagine, inbreeding. His family comes from a small village in my country and according to his mother, his father and her were relatively close cousins.  He has been more of a father to me than my actual father in so many ways, a really brilliant mathematician who used to love doing sudoku puzzles and now he can't even write the first letter of his name, let alone a word or a calculation.  Currently, he still remembers all of us, however his short-term memory is non-existant. He is irritable when my mother isn't around and always wants to go outside though thankfully he can't find the door. He constantly needs to be kept active, which is something that my mother did not marry him for - he used to live slowly, lounging on the couch and reading etc. The most recent antics of his are being unable to pee into the actual toilet. This, while disgusting, is even more problematic due to the fact that he was diagnosed with a Hep B chronic infection, which was caused by a blood transfusion from a surgery a few years ago. My mother is primarily worried about me developing an infection, even though I was the generation that was vaccinated against it.  How long does he have before death? That is the only thing that we can hope for. Hospice care is far, far too expensive - especially for patients who are able to walk. Nurses as well, we don't have that kind of money. Our country doesn't really have a good safety net for Alzheimers patients. I love him, I really do - but I don't want my image of him to deteriorate further.	0
My grandma has been staying with us for over a week because my grandpa is in the hospital. She is nearing the end of the moderate stage. She is at the point where she doesn’t know who anybody is. She sometimes thinks her husband (my grandpa) is her dad,  thinks my mom is her sister. It’s endless. She just won’t stop asking questions, some of them don’t even make sense. I feel bad for getting annoyed but it’s so tiring listening to her ask my mom all these questions when my mom keeps giving her the same answers. She has a tablet that she likes to play solitaire on which helps distract her but even that sometimes won’t work. I know this is very vague but there is too much to put on here. What should we do that would maybe help with all the questions/distract her?	0
I hadn’t seen my grandma since last mothers day. All she could talk about last visit was how pretty I am. I had pink hair that was a bit longer than it was now last time. Im afab trans masculine and last time she asked me a few times if I was a man or a woman. She doesn’t usually remember who I am but it doesn’t hurt my feelings. I have shorter hair now and this time I visited her she gendered me correctly half the time. She doesn’t know Im trans and my family misgenders me most of the time (though its not a big enough issue for me to pick a fight about). It was interesting to see how her perception of me changed depending on the conversation since she forgets things so easily. Im not sure it means much as far as how well I “pass” given her condition but instead of calling me beautiful this time she called me handsome more often than not. She actually flirted with me a bit which I found funny and flattering. I don’t think she’d retained that Im her grandkid. Maybe Im weird for not being weirded out by this and taking it in stride. She was being pretty innocent so it wasn’t a bid deal for me but I realize this could be a sensitive subject so Im sorry if it is for those who read this. I was genuinely curious if this was a common behavior for people with Alzheimer’s? Like is it common for people to hit on their family members in this way or is my Grandma just an oddball?	0
Alzheimer's runs in my wife's family, particularly in the women. She's approaching the age where her grandmother, mother, and two older sisters were diagnosed. We want to make sure that there aren't complications that I or, if something were to happen to me, her daughters would have to navigate.     I'm reaching out to an elder law attorney this coming week and would like to have some idea about what questions to ask. Thank you!	0
At 62, My mom is showing some clear onset signs of Alzheimers in poor money management and lack of self care. She wont save money, or set money aside for rent. She wont bathe often, nor will she visit a doctor, even though she is appearing malnourished. She's not terribly forgetful, but she will often gaslight me in very important situations saying she told me key information, but it was never said. It's a very dramatic behavior and I'm struggling to cope with this. I have no guidance on how to handle this situation, so I'm turning to reddit to help me find resources to help her. I heard often the only thing to do is wait until she becomes an endangerment to me, before committing her to help- but I know there HAS to be something I can do. She is intelligent enough where I believe with treatment, she can retain her faculties. But I am scared, I am terrified, that if this festers, I will lose her or my lose my freedom trying to help her (I am only 26 years old). Alzheimers runs through my family so I know I'm not imagining things. PLEASE HELP.	0
Dad refuses to wear a coat when it rains. Conversely, he refuses to take his coat and scarf off when it's sunny. We had a heatwave in the UK recently - yes, 32⁰c is considered V E R Y warm here - and dad insisted on joining us for an evening walk with his jumper, coat and scarf.   After some lengthy negotiations, he removed the coat and scarf which we promptly hid from view. Just as we're leaving we realise he had replaced his scarf with one he made himself. Out of toilet paper.   Absolute fashion icon.	0
My mother has Alzheimer's and frequently asks to speak with her parents, I don't have the heart to tell her that they are dead. What would be the best way to deflect this question without upsetting her?  &nbsp; ## **Thank you for all the lovely responses! <3**	0
My mom told me about a week ago that my grandpa was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. It’s something that we’ve suspected for a couple years, but hearing his diagnosis is still incredibly painful. My grandpa and I are extremely close, and I’m having a very hard time with it. He’s coming to visit us in a few weeks with another family member, so it’ll be great to see him. My step-grandma says that he’s on a medication that’s helping him for now. He’s aware of his diagnosis, and knows what it means. I’m dreading when his condition worsens. I have a very hard time working through grief, and I know that this is going to be one long grieving process.	0
I haven't been able to figure out how to keep my mother hydrated properly. She never drinks water on her own and when i give it to her i'm lucky if she even takes a sip. She barely drinks a bottle of water a day if even that. I think giving it to her in a cup helps and she also seems more willing to drink it when i bring it to her on the toilet (not sure why). If anyone knows of a good method please let me know. Thanks.   crossposted	0
Mom was recently moved to memory care.  They allow electronic monitoring of the rooms.  Has anyone done this?  Have a camera or system they recommend?  I am thinking of the Amazon show and maybe one other camera.  Thoughts?	0
Ok. So a back story is my mother is late stages Alzheimer’s but she has not quite made it over the hump.   So last week I see that the assisted living home had added even more antidepressants and antipsychotics which was causing issues and I politely asked to remover her off the zyprexa due to the side effects she was displaying and how far she is out of it.   This in turned upset my aunts and uncle to the point I’m getting messages stated elderly abuse and all kinds of crazy stuff about lawyers being involved. I’m the poa for moms medical.   On a side note these new drugs was not prescribed by moms neurologist. So Friday I was in contact with moms neurologist to get them the list of new meds and the one I requested them to remover her off of. This was trying to get mom a better options for care.   I was in contact with a lawyer Friday also to try and get an emergency conservatorship. I’m thinking that’s a lost cause.   Thoughts on what to do in this situation.	0
For people with family members suffering mild to moderate Alzheimer's, a company called Cassava Sciences just release data at AAIC that showed their drug improved ADAS-Cog scores by 3 points over a 9 month period. Which means improved cognition. They are starting their Phase 3 clinical trials in the Fall so if you live in the US or Canada, and want to know more about the trial, you can go to [https://www.cassavasciences.com/static-files/c45b6f43-ccc1-4391-bfed-e1c68fbae5fd](https://www.cassavasciences.com/static-files/c45b6f43-ccc1-4391-bfed-e1c68fbae5fd). It is a pill taken twice daily and safety profile is clean. I hope this helps some folks in this group. I've also included the link to their trial study below.  Best everyone.

So this week I thought my dad was dying. He was non responsive the facility called 911. He was admitted to the hospital for two days. Sleeping the entire time. They did blood tests, CT scan, UTI test. Found nothing. But he wouldn’t wake up.  The hospital mentioned he might be getting over medicated. The facility denied giving him more meds. My family and I were starting to think this was the end. My aunts were getting ready to come down and say their goodbyes. I took It a lot worse than I thought.  I had to hire a hospice service. They released him from the hospital and I went over expecting to see my father in his forever sleep. When I walked in he was bright eyed and said oh hi!  I feel like I haven’t seen you in so long!  He was the most clear I’ve seen him in a long time. He declined super quickly in the 6mos hes been in this place. I literally thought my dad was dying and then one of the caregivers proceeded to tell me all this stuff that is going on at the facility. Like there’s a nurse that over medicated to manage the residents. I don’t know what’s the truth but I am so upset. Has anyone experienced this?  This is suppose to be a very reputable facility and very expensive. I’ve started looking at other places but this has really made me lose faith in these places. On top of everything he fell and broke his nose today! My poor dad. I feel so guilty. I did so much research when finding this place. I thought It was going to be so good. I just don’t know where to go from here.	0
" My grandmother comes from a family where Alzheimer's is incredibly common and hard to avoid. She was the youngest of 11 children, and every single one who lived long enough developed Alzheimer's - only her mother avoided that fate, who lived until 96 and in full possession of her mind the whole time (the Alzheimer's gene seems to have come from her father, who started exhibiting symptoms during the 1950s at a relatively young age and was almost completely disabled throughout the 1960s). From 1982 up through 2011, she lived hundreds of miles away from us so we only saw her once or twice per year. The June of 2011, she came to live with me and my parents after her husband died, where we cared for her for the next three years until her death.     **2005 (Age 81)**  Normal, lucid adult full of boundless energy. No signs of dementia no matter how closely you searched for any.  &#x200B;  **2006 (Age 82)**  She had a few weird moments where she repeated herself in a very brief timespan. Otherwise normal. There was a large family reunion which took place in 2006, and Grandmother was nothing more or less than simply another family member, rather than someone who stood out due to being a dependent or a victim of dementia (as she would of course become some years down the road).   &#x200B;  **2007 (Age 83)**  No real change noted here. This was the last year she remembered to send me a birthday card and the last year she regularly emailed my mom. She drove to our house 500 miles away for my nephew's baby shower with no problems, and displayed no symptoms of Alzheimer's during the few days she spent here (aside from a few instances of repeating herself within a very short time, as per the year prior).   &#x200B;  She did, however, drive all the way back to the hospital in their hometown 500 miles away when Papa started having some issues with his heart during the visit, rather than going to a local hospital. She explained herself to my mom a few days later over the phone by saying ""I just panicked,"" though my mom found such an extreme lapse in judgment very odd. Since Grandmother overall seemed very normal, though, my mom put the idea of her developing dementia on the backburner, taking a more 'wait and see' attitude unless and until more obvious problems arose.  &#x200B;  **2008 (Age 84)**  Generally normal, though minor symptoms become more common here. Grandmother started replying to my mom's emails more and more inconsistently throughout the year, and stopped entirely by the year's end. She showed some problems with judgment and fell for a few ""prey on the elderly"" scams. My mom visited her that July, and Grandmother burned the turkey that she tried cooking for my mom by leaving it in the oven too long and forgetting about it altogether - something my mom found strange since Grandmother was always very meticulous about everything she did and had an excellent memory, though my mom was unsure if Grandmother was showing early signs of dementia or if it was a simple memory slip resulting from normal aging, since otherwise Grandmother seemed quite normal during the entire three day visit.  &#x200B;  2008 was the last year that Grandmother had full independence. She paid all the bills, she drove into town every week and bought all of the groceries, she managed all operations of the household since my grandfather was physically disabled from a stroke in 2006 (though he remained lucid and cognitively normal for about 2-3 years thereafter). Whatever problems she might have had - and it's possible that she might have had more trouble doing these things than anyone realized since nobody was keeping a close eye on her, assuming she was perfectly 'normal' and capable - she's plainly more or less a normal adult at the end of the day given that she was able to manage throughout the entire year completely unsupervised.  &#x200B;  **2009 (Age 85)**  Things begin to get serious here. As the year progresses she leaves behind ""early Alzheimer's"" territory where the disease is largely an invisible condition, and reaches the cusp of early/mid levels of the illness. This was the first year where she showed clear-cut problems in functioning. Her internet connection had been taken down by August 2009 because she forgot to pay for it, and she had her keys taken away in September after a drive to the grocery store ended with her getting so lost that she ended up on a beach dozens of miles away.     Grandmother was at a stage where her Alzheimer's wasn't apparent, or at least wasn't *that* obvious, during simple regular conversation, but the cracks in her memory and thought processes were very clear when she had to do something mentally demanding. Grandmother drove my mom somewhere during our yearly visit which that year took place in August, and though the ride was generally fairly smooth with my grandmother seemingly capable of the basic mechanics of driving and remembering the route to the nursing home, there was one point where my mom had to take control of the wheel because Grandmother was driving the wrong way down a one-way road. And later that same day, Grandmother was unsure if we were going to go back to her own home, or to ours. (Since we live about 500 miles away, the answer should've been obvious)  We visited my grandfather at a nursing home that August, who was 91 and in much worse shape (he made a partial recovery and was in much better shape throughout 2010 than he was during either of the two bordering years, but it's a miracle he managed to survive 2009). At the time, I thought of Grandmother as having a foot in two worlds. My grandfather was on the obvious demented, sickly, broken side. Grandmother was MOSTLY on the healthy, lucid, aware side with the rest of us, and she self-identified as a 'normal' and 'healthy' person in stark contrast to her sickly husband's ""broken old man""... but she did have one foot in the world where my grandfather was.  Late 2009, in response to September's beach incident, was where she started to receive some light assistance. My aunt brought her parents groceries, paid all of the bills, and made sure Grandmother remembered to take her meds. Otherwise she was independent.  There's a test known as the Barthel Index. It assesses the independence level of someone based on their ability to do simple things learned in childhood - bathing yourself, dressing yourself, walking unassisted, feeding yourself, using the toilet. At this point there's no question whatsoever that Grandmother would score the maximum of 100 on the test.  &#x200B;  **2010 (Age 86)**  Definite mid-tier Alzheimer's. She recognized everyone and could still hold conversations, but she had little to no memory of recent events and she had no real detailed awareness of her surroundings. In 2009, she remembered that she couldn't remember her computer password; in 2010 she probably didn't know what a computer or an internet was. The 2009 Grandmother's short-term memory was noticeably impaired and spottier than the average person's, but it was far from completely gone or completely nonexistent. 2010 Grandmother's short-term memory, though... yeah, totally gone. If it happened longer than five minutes before, it never happened.  2010 Grandmother was perfectly capable of holding conversations, but only if those conversations were limited to things from maybe the 1990s and older. If you mentioned a friend that she'd made during the past 10 or 15 years, she wouldn't recognize them. Political figures and celebrities that made their debut later than the 1980s or so would just result in a shrug if you mentioned them. Technologies that were popularized during the 90s or 2000s were something she wouldn't recognize at all. She knew perfectly well what a television was and I think she'd recognize certain 80s technologies like CD players (just assuming there based on her overall level of functioning), but there was no way she had any idea what the internet was.     By this point, the fact that Grandmother has dementia is very obvious even during casual conversation. Conversing with her isn't a frustrating endeavor or anything - if you say anything to her, 9 times out of 10 you will get a reasonable response that shows real comprehension of what you said - but it's still overwhelmingly obvious with even small amounts of contact that she has experienced some amount of transparent cognitive decline.  Still capable of all basic tasks of living. I think she would still get a perfect 100 on the Barthel Index. We visited the grandparents Thanksgiving 2010 - great visit, Papa was doing fairly well and Grandmother wasn't THAT bad yet - and I don't think we had to help her with anything listed on the Barthel Index.  &#x200B;  **2011 (Age 87)**  The more severe end of mid-stage Alzheimer's. She still recognized her kids, but it's unclear if she remembered the grandkids. Her memory of the past became more distorted, and she began telling stories about things that clearly never happened; in 2010 all of her recollections of the past were factual. She began falling asleep around 6 or 7 in the evening, whereas in 2010 she always fell asleep at her usual 10 or 11 PM. She alternated between using a cane and walking unassisted; in 2010 she always walked unassisted.   She could still sign her name. There was one moment this year where she tried to add two double-digit numbers together, and did so correctly. She was talkative and would go on long monologues, and those monologues were very clear and coherent and easy to follow, but probably 70 percent of the time her responses to things other said had little relation to what was said.  Grandmother's adult sense of social etiquette eroded some here, with some much more childlike moments. During a visit to the grandparents the May of 2011, Grandmother had my brother and my mom move Papa because he was sleeping on 'her side' of the bed (Papa being very frail and skeletal and just a few weeks away from death). During the summer, she removed her medical alert bracelet and put Papa's on instead; when my mom informed her after discovering this that Papa's bracelet was useless for her, Grandmother replied with ""but his is prettier than mine."" And, of course, there was the time in December that she hid my sister's car keys, telling her ""If I can't drive, nobody drives.""   The grandmother of 2009 and probably 2010 would have handled those situations differently. Despite her decline in memory and function, she still had the emotional maturity of an adult and so would have dealt with those three situations in the same way that she would have prior to developing dementia. The 2009 Grandmother would have identified Papa as a sickly old man and simply let him keep her side of the bed, understood the purpose of the medical alert bracelet and kept hers on, and she wouldn't have gone around hiding anyone's car keys.  This is the first year where there's a decline in Grandmother's Barthel Index score. Using an online calculator, it seems like 2011 Grandmother would get a score of around 70, putting her in the Minimally Dependent category.  &#x200B;  **2012 (Age 88)**  Early severe. She started the year off using a cane most of the time (she continued to walk unassisted sometimes during the early months of the year) and ended it always using a walker. She became a lot more quiet, though she still talked some. Her speech was still coherent. Her responses to others very rarely showed any comprehension of what was said. She still ate on her own. She clearly did not recognize the grandkids. Her recognition of her children was spotty and inconsistent. She slept more frequently than in 2011. In 2011, though she fell asleep in the evenings, she was alert and active prior to then; in 2012 she began dozing off every couple of hours, on and off through the day. 2012 Grandmother would get a Barthel Index score of around 40, putting her in the Partially Dependent category.  &#x200B;  **2013 (Age 89)**  Her speech was largely gibberish by this point with only occasional recognizable words. Early in the year she would open her mouth to let us feed her, but by the end of the year she subsided off tube feedings because she couldn't eat without choking. In early 2013, was capable of moving with a walker so long as multiple people helped her. By late 2013 she was wheelchair-only. 2013 Grandmother gets a Barthel Index Score of around 20, the Very Dependent category.  &#x200B;  **2014 (Age 90)**  Grandmother declined gravely almost the moment 2014 began, with there being an enormous difference between the Grandmother of Christmas 2013 (who, despite the issues talked about in the previous paragraph, seemed to be fairly happy and content - she enjoyed company and laughed a lot at the antics of the great-grandchildren) and the Grandmother of January 2014. She became bedridden and entered a semi-comatose state, sleeping around the clock. Would cry out and panic every time we tried to move her to clean her up. Don't remember her speaking a single coherent word throughout the year. Though Grandmother's Barthel Index scores from 2011 through 2013 are an estimation with a small margin of error, her score for 2014 is very clear - zero, Totally Dependent.      This phase didn't last too long. She passed away the August of 2014, a few months shy of what would have been her 91st birthday."	0
Hi Reddit,  I’m looking for some advice, my mother (72) is going downhill rapidly with Alzheimer’s, my father (70) is a very logical thinker.  Recently my father has purchased a Campervan and to take my mum on away within our country. They have always travelled around the world previously which is obviously now not possible.   My older brother and sister are dead against this to the point they will not communicate with my dads group text messages to the point they are ignoring my dads messages on their first trip to a family property.   Does anyone have any experience with this?   I know my dad will look after my mum 💯 but I’m not sure if I’m missing something, my brother and sister are so against my Dad and I don’t understand why, as I know they love both of them so much.   Appreciate any feedback from anyone who has been through this before.  (Please pardon my username, created long ago to be a lurker and totally unrelated to my post)	0
My dad recently started buying more stuff when he goes out. A few examples is home buying a cookie from the store every time he goes along with him buying me 4 Gatorade’s randomly because I workout. That and just an overall more willingness to spend/buy things for himself or others in the family. Does anyone else have any similar experiences, I think my dad is in the more earlier stages of Alzheimer’s	0
My late 60s moms has significant short term memory loss, episodes of confusion that lead to irritability and sun setting in the evening. She has a history of encephalitis that was rather significant and also seizures. The neurologist said that it dose not appear to be Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s yet but they want to put her on Aricept? Does anyone know why they would try such a strong drug without a formal diagnosis of Alzheimer’s? Since they can’t say for certain what is causing the memory issues, is this a way to test to confirm a diagnosis.  Has anyone been in a similar situation and could share the outcome or purpose?	0
"My beloved Dad started with forgetfulness about 10 years ago- in October of 2016 I finally had him in agreement to get tested for Alzheimer and then he had a stroke 3 days before the test was to be conducted so of course we cancelled it and went forward with massive rehabilitation for the stroke. fast for to November 2020 another ""stroke"" hit and he was hospitalized for a week with no rehab- my mother kept saying the Doctor said no new medication and I kept arguing back antibiotics aren't a permanent medication he has a UTI- so he suffered for a week after being released from the hospital with crazy symptoms and pain I am sure. My dad today is probably late mid-stages. This past weekend all hell broke loose between my mom and daughter because my mom just doesn't provide the care my Dad needs, truthfully she can't even take care of herself she is covered in bruised from falling and constantly tearing her skin open and weighs about 80 pounds now. My daughter and I would like to take my Dad however she (my mom) will not allow it so she contacted a person connected with the VA and is placing him a VA nursing home 6 hours away from me roughly 4 from my mom and kids. Is there anything I can do to stop this? My mom is a hateful woman and just wants to stick him anywhere and just move on and live her life- which will be very lonely once she places my Dad because myself and my children won't be going around!! Does this disease make families fall apart? Luckily or may be a curse I am the only child and my Dad and his parents were always my saving grace!"	0
We are finally moving dad to assisted living in a couple of days, and would love any thoughts and tips on how to make it as smooth as possible. He’s going from a small single family rental home with a great yard for his dog, to a studio unit. He always loved gardening and I know he’s going to miss his outdoor space, although the facility has nice grounds for walks. Fortunately he’s able to keep his dog for now.  My sister and I came in from out of town to help move, and will be here for about 5 days after move in day to be with him as much as possible.   Lots swirling around in my head between getting him moved in, getting some old larger furniture out of the house, and all the smaller things sorted and packed. Would love to hear what’s worked for all of you, and also what to look out for as he hopefully acclimates over the coming weeks.	0
My dad hasn’t been doing well these last few days. Yesterday he was very out of It. And then today he was just in bed sleeping and non responsive. I broke down today when I saw him.  I know it’s the disease progressing, and I thought I was mentally prepared, but It broke my heart today seeing him like that.  Has anyone experienced this with their loved ones at the end?  He’s not eating and I know we won’t be trying to prolong his life with feeding tubes or anything. He’s been out of It before and then was better the next day. But I hadn’t seen him like this before. Is this the end?  I just feel so heartbroken losing him to this disease. I really thought I’d be prepared for this, but I can’t seem to stop crying today.	0
I am looking for opinions on what brand of adult diapers is the most absorbent and also looks the most like underwear.  My LO is quite young (61), still has a lot of cognitive abilities, but has recently been unable to control her bowels/bladder.  This started a few weeks ago.  I want to get something that will help but also manages to preserve some dignity.  Any thoughts/recommendations?	0
"So my mother, her mother, and her father all had early onset Alzheimer's. My mother and her father also had Parkinson's. I recently took a genetic test and both markers showed up in my genes. We still don't know the possibility of me getting it but it's really put me into serious thinking mode. I took care of my mother starting at the age of 14, She was 53. So I've seen the beginning, middle and end of it all. I also saw the terrible time my own father had to deal with his wife declining so rapidly. Look at him now makes my heart hurt, they were together for almost 40 years and he watched his best friend go through all that.  Now speaking on myself again.... Should I even risk a relationship? For my own bodily autonomy I want to be Euthanized should I do develop the issues. It is legal in several countries.  So.. That's my question to you all. Do I just spend the rest of my life alone as to not even bother burdening someone with my own ""selfish"" choices or should I try?"	0
Hi all,   This is something that I have been struggling with. My father is 71. Before the lockdowns he was functioning normally. During the lockdowns, him and my mother due to the differences of my opinion concerning the lockdown were arguing a-lot. They really don't argue that much so it took a big strain on the relationship. During this time his became a little withdrawn and sulky. 2020 was a crazy year. Then his sister (my aunt) died out of nowhere and that when his mood started to change and so was his memory. In the past several months it seems that his personally changed and he did not want to do anything, he became kind of forgetful and did not seems there all the time. He also would not talk that much and it seems like he was not as sharp. The change was noticeable and it alarmed me and my mother and my aunt. His voiced seemed to of change too. He just seemed tired. My mother and I has scheduled him to get a physical. He can still drive and do other things, he can talk about current events and the like but the decline came out of nowhere and it became worst after his sister died. Like I said he is a bit better because is not as withdrawn as he was a couple of months ago. I just never seen him like this. What do yall think? Maybe a stroke?	0
Preface for why we need a watch with safety locks: My father will leave the house with just a shirt and underwear on. Small devices will not work well for tracking my father for that reason along with the fact that he will toss things out his pockets. It isn't unusal for my father to leave the house without shoes either, hence gps tracking soles aren't what we are looking for either. Regular wrist watches will be taken off when he wants to, hence devices like a apple watch aren't gonna work.   We are looking for a wrist watch with a safety lock feature. We have stumbled upon the theora connect. Anyone have experience with it? Anyone have other options? Thank you for your time.	0
Hello, as the title states, my Aunty has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. This has been a long time coming and is not surprising. I would estimate she has had issues with her memory for about a decade now and it has been painfully obvious to my mum (her sister) and I that something was wrong. Her kids are not very helpful and have been in denial about the whole thing up until she got diagnosed.   I’m not exactly sure how far it has progressed, but what I do know is that she is no longer allowed to have a drivers licence and repeats herself a lot. Sometimes she will tell the same story 3 or 4 times in the span of a conversation. Just for clarification I never bring this to her attention because I feel it would be upsetting for her. She gets confused about her grandchildren’s names and sometimes doesn’t recognise them in photos. She has also stopped all of her hobbies over the years, for example she used to draw, sew, make candles, etc. Her handwriting has become quite shaky as well. She is really a shell of her former self and it is horrid to see.   My Aunty is very dear to me and I wanted to be an Aunty when I grew up because of her.   I guess the advice I need is how to talk to her about it when she brings it up. She will sometimes say she’s mad and belongs in an aged care home, and is quite aware she is forgetting things but she doesn’t know what she’s forgotten. The last time I saw her she told me she had gone too far in the wrong direction and she had tears in her eyes. I just don’t know what to say. I want to be able to comfort her but have no idea how.	0
"Is anyone else's family members getting confused by the naming ""2020 Tokyo Olympics"" in 2021. My grandmother is getting confused by it especially now it's on tv all the time.  &#x200B;  Not really asking for anything, just wondering if it is a shared experience."	0
Doc prescibed alprazolam as needed. Seems like my Dad is getting angrier and since we started it,like he's getting worse. He was getting worse and that's why we started, but can ya'll share any experience with this drug? This feels chicken and egg-like and I'd love some feedback.Thanks so much!	0
They gave her a week left to live. I just don't know if I can see her like this. She is not even there anymore and part of my asks what the point is of even visiting her. Am I a jerk?	0
"My mom will be 64 next month and was formally diagnosed earlier this month with early-onset Alzheimer's after a year of trying to get her into doctors appointments and testing. I'm 31F. She moved in with me in early February, when it had become very apparent that she could no longer manage living on her own. My living room is now her bedroom. She was put on Donepezil the day she moved in with me, and was on it for three weeks before it dehydrated her (constant and severe diarrhea) to the point of passing out, and she was in the hospital for three days. We're supposed to be starting the Rivastigmine patch soon to see if that does bypass her GI system well enough for any possible improvements.   I have loved my mom more than words can express, and she provided me with a really wonderful and enriching childhood, but we've always had a very volatile relationship. I don't even know why. Hoping to get that figured out, as I'll finally be starting therapy soon. She was a single parent, and we were really over dependent on each other. I have been stuck in the anger phase of my grief since she moved in, and I hate every single day of my life. I have completely emotionally detached from her in the sense that I no longer have a mom, but I still care about her enough that I am incredibly protective of her. I know she loves me so much, but I don't feel like I have that maternal protector anymore. Someone I can count on. My mommy. She's still ""here"" ​and mostly lucid, but her capacity to understand life in general has greatly and depressingly diminished so fast. I'm weary of not being with her, and the thought of eventually putting her in some sort of memory care housing terrifies me (even though we so desperately need it already) because I don't want her to be abused or taken advantage of. We are completely in a ""child has become the parent"" scenario, and I am having the worst time coping with the way she can no longer do things for herself like dress or speak properly, bathe, eat without making a huge mess, etc.   I have a really difficult time with controlling the way I react to her when she can't do something, even though I know it is completely not under her control. She's also so incredibly stubborn, and is having a really difficult time accepting that this is our reality and that I haven't been making all of this up. She is convinced that I'm not letting her do things like use a computer because I simply don't want to, when the complete fact of the matter is, she doesn't understand how to use a computer, her iPhone, her iPad, or even a tv remote anymore. And of course, this makes me look bad to anyone who is willing to listen to her make this all up, because she only sees it as me preventing her from doing these things. She really resents me for the fact that her driver's license was revoked, and that she never got to make the decision that she wouldn't be able to work anymore. I hate that I am making some of the last memories that she can retain be ones where she thinks I'm mad at her. I know it should be the absolute opposite.    She has had a shit go at life, and for this to be what's going to end her life is shittier. I was the result of an abusive relationship with a drug addict, and I think she has a lot of unspoken traumas about that. She lost both of her parents young. She was in her 40's, when she was a caregiver to her mom while her mom was sick with and died of lung cancer. My mom's career suffered because she basically quit to take care of her mom, and then the recession happened, and really just screwed her over after that. She's got two younger brothers who really aren't going to be there for her because they're too self involved, and they've also had strained relationships over the years. She has no retirement money, only a small amount of savings that she was able to build up when she was working at her last job. I'm still in the process of getting her set up with SSDI. She does have a settlement coming soon due to an unpaid overtime and wage theft case from her former employers, but the attorney and the IRS will get the majority of it. Whatever is left when she finally gets paid will get put into a trust for her care. She was a caregiver for a man with dementia, and his daughter refused to pay my mom legally. She worked for nearly two years, because they had a truly incredible bond, but the daughter finally let my mom go after noticing her own symptoms present themselves. The fact that I now fully understand just how much work goes into being a caregiver, and how much caregivers truly should be paid will never be lost on me. Occasionally, when she's really upset, she'll ask to clarify that she didn't contagiously catch the Alzheimer's from the man she cared for. That's hard to hear each time, especially because this is not something we ever would have imagined. We don't have a family history of it. She was just supposed to be the caregiver of a person with Alzheimer's, not develop it too.   I just feel like I'm drowning. Like when a wave knocks you out and you don’t know which way is up because you’re just tumbling every which way under the wave. I am strong, but I am not okay. I fear that my stress and anger will be what kills me because of this. I truly would prefer that this disease takes her quickly so that we're both not suffering for years to come. I know what to expect from this disease and the thought of having to endure this for YEARS kills me. My only hope is that because of how rapidly she has progressed, it will, but I obviously have no control over that. It kills me even more to be having these feelings that I would rather my mom no longer be alive than have to participate in this journey with her. I never in a million years would have been able to imagine life without my mom as a child, and I am struggling to balance out those feelings with the feelings I have now. I am terrified that I will never get to have children or a family of my own with her in my life the way things are. I always imagined she'd be the kind of mom who would be helping me raise my kids like her mom was to me. And on the subject of children, how is it that I am otherwise an incredibly nurturing and compassionate person, have had a career of working with children, and desperately want my own, but I don't even want to take care of the woman who wanted me more than anything and brought me into this world? I feel like an indentured servant. We had no choice but for me to drop everything in my life to take her in. I don't make enough money to truly be supporting us. Maybe if I at least had her in her own bedroom and bathroom, but I will never be able to afford a 2 bedroom on what I make right now, nor will I be able to even consider memory care without financial aid (but it's not like the financial aid doesn't come with it's own logistics in terms of assets and finances). I'm so jealous of anyone, but especially friends who still have parents that are perfectly capable of caring for themselves. My mom won't ever get to be one of those older people who has ""golden years."" My best friend lost her mom at 56 to brain cancer two years ago, and was a complete rockstar caring for her mother, and her mother's mother. She lost them both that same year to cancer. I have incredible guilt for sharing my feelings about my mom with her, knowing how much she wishes her mom were still here. Sometimes, she'll get an attitude of her wanting to fight the disease as if it is something she can fight. And I don't want her to. I don't think she really understands what to expect from this.    I hate sharing my bathroom with her. I hate that I constantly only want to be in my room now. I hate every single time she won't close the lid before she flushes the toilet. I hate how she has things she tries to tell me, and she just can't get the words out or describe things coherently. I hate how I have to tell her she needs to take a shower, and how she can't turn the water on and off for herself in the shower, but she has no problem randomly turning the cold water off when she's not done rinsing and then somehow turn the hot way up, and then gets stuck under scalding hot water until I can dash over to turn it off. I hate how her clothes are a constant battle now. I hate how she plays with her clothes because it's her ""busy work,"" but she's not actually folding them. She's just picking them up and down on her bed. When she's not putting her clothes on inside out or backwards, or sticking her arm straight through the head hole of a t-shirt to wear it like a one shouldered top, she's changing her clothes three times a day for no reason at all, and she doesn't even know why she does it. Or how she'll put her underwear on over her pants, or a disposable underwear on OVER her underwear, wasting them both when she has an accident. I hate that I have to explain or ask her to do something five times in a row. I hate that she has a huge bed, but only sleeps on one edge of it and doesn't understand how to center herself in it or not sleep sitting up. I hate that she thinks I'm gaslighting her half the time because she just can't comprehend the situation. I hate when she's crying, smacks her head with her hand, and talks about her ""dumb brain."" I hate when she cries in general, which is multiple times a day, I don't see my mom, who is a sad, 63 year old woman. I see the little girl version of her, a little girl who is just so lost. She cried yesterday about how ""this wasn't what she was supposed to grow up to be."" How fucking heartbreaking is that?  I hate the defeat when she just can't explain what should be a simple thought. I hate that I don't know how to comfort her. I hate that I don't have the compassion I know she deserves, especially coming from her only child. That I don't have the same resolve to care for her like she did with her mother. I very rarely give her hugs anymore, we were so attached when I was a kid, I slept in her bed with her until probably middle school. We cuddled in our big chair every night before bed. We used to call each other three times a day after I finally moved out on my own. She sent me to Europe and Australia in school programs, and I called her nearly every day with prepaid phone cards. That's when it all started. It all got tiring very quickly, but I did it because I knew she counted on it. How do these feelings just go away? How did I get so cold and how did I shut down like this? I don't know how to warm up to her again without it just feeling fake and forced. I hate that I know that she is going through a hellacious, traumatic, life destructing experience, and how I feel like I can't do anything for her. I hate myself for how I feel about our life.   I think about how I'm not going to have many pictures of her or us together as she ages for as long as she's here. I can't bring myself to want any to remember these days. Nor am I the type of person to just jump next to her for a selfie for the fun of it. I struggle with loving her the way I used to. Everything just feels like a chore, and I'm the only one who can do anything. I know that I do really love her and it's the disease I hate. I just don't know how to project that and fix this. I know that she'll be way better off if someone else is caring for her, but I don't know when we'll be able to get to that point. She is absolutely eligible for a home health aide through Medi-Cal, but I can't even have friends over anymore, my apartment is so cluttered with stuff we haven't been able to deal with since she moved in. I know we need the help, but I can't stand the thought of having a complete stranger in my house with junk everywhere. I know there's respite care, which I desperately need, and she also just needs more social interaction and activities to do, but again, I'm terrified about leaving her anywhere. I just don't know where to start with anything now. I feel like I've been running a marathon for the past year just to get her to a diagnosis, and I'm now crawling wearily and exhausted to the finish line, and we're really only just getting started.   I have really lost enjoyment to do anything, even basic things like decorate with the tons of seasonal decorations I have, or a reusable calendar that I had made with various themed magnets. I really took pride in things like that around my home. I miss my old life. I have really great friends, but they can only do so much. She has some friends, but not a large enough circle like she used to, to build a close support system for herself. She was otherwise a really well liked person when I was growing up and afterwards. She never found love. And now she's just stuck with me. I work because I have to, and this is the first stable job I've had in two years after nannying and contract work in the tech industry, and it has health benefits. But it's soul sucking. I'm just trying to stick it out enough to see how I can move into a leadership role. I hate the work, but I'm really good at it, so I know that I'm somewhat valuable in terms of efficiency and productivity. And respected. Thankfully, I get to work from home for now, but it's also hard when she's barging in on me while I'm on the phone with customers, because she's concerned about a scam call coming in on her phone. On top of grieving the mom I no longer have, I'm grieving the end of a three year, long distance relationship. He completely ghosted me. The pandemic really fucked everything up for us, and I know it could be said that I clearly dodged a bullet, but I really love him. I believed he was the person I had waited so long to meet, my lifetime in a reason, a season or a lifetime. I guess our season just changed, but I feel like I'm never going to get over him or be angry enough to want to get over him. I'm sad that there's no closure after a head over heels first couple of years and trips back and forth. The last thing he said to me as I was boarding a plane to come back home the last time I saw him in person was ""I'll see you before too long."" I can't get that out of my head. It just makes me so sad. I was really counting on ""before too long."" I hate that I feel like the idea of trying to start dating again or finding a partner feels impossible. And it's all I've ever wanted.   If you've gotten this far through my long, disorganized, rant (and if you have, thanks. These are all thoughts I've been needing to release for awhile now), how do you do this? I don't want to do this. I don't want to see the days where my mom doesn't remember who I am. I don't want to get further into delusions and things that are happening in her head that aren't happening in real life. I don't want to have to be one of those family members calling police and putting out a silver alert because she's wandered off. I don't want to deal with the fact that she'll put a nightgown on like it's a skirt and put a different shirt on with it, or how she'll wake up in the mornings, walk into the bathroom, and just pee all over the floor. How do I get rid of this anger? How do I come out of this alive? How do I deal with losing her and her truly losing her mind? How do I just come up for air?   TL;DR: Mom has early onset Alzheimer's and I don't have the emotional capacity to handle it, but I have no choice not to"	0
Dad's a wanderer. At night, we can lock and bolt the doors, and he doesn't get too upset about that (yet). But in the daytime, if he can't open doors, he gets violently upset. When the doors are open, he has a habit of sneaking out and trying to go for walks, which would be great, except he can no longer find his way home. So we're looking for a 'tripwire' - a piece of security equipment that can detect a door opening and send an alert to mom's smartphone. We don't want anything loud, as Dad is noise sensitive, and we don't want to wake the neighbours.  &#x200B;  Mom's considering Rogers Smart Home Monitoring, but I've heard questionable reviews about the installation, and I don't want to get a bunch of extras on top of what little we actually need.  We've already got one tracking device (samsung tracking device), and are ordering more (airtags), but we'd rather have multiple redundancies.  Does anyone have any suggestions?	0
My Grandmother recently moved in with us. I have an 8 year old and 5 year old. My Grandmother constantly picks on them, yells at them, and now sticks her feet in their face (no idea where that came from!) My girls are not saints, but they are really not doing anything wrong when these incidents occur. I can see this is effecting my kids (anger that she can act this way), and she is now hurt they don't want to sit next to her and simply avoid her. Anyone else have a similar experience? Ideas? She does fine with adults. It's just the kids she has this attitude towards.	0
Just thinking. Rather than several individuals paying for a carer, could a few families pool so a few carers look after multiple people?	0
The University of Florida, in partnership with the Alzheimer's Association of Florida, has developed a fun and novel life story activity (i.e., digital Life Story Book) for supporting people with memory difficulties accompanied by a family member or a friend. The activity takes place completely remotely. As this is a research project, besides their own Life Story Book to keep, participants will be paid $60 once fully completed in study.   If you are interested in participating in this study, or would like more information for your loved one with memory difficulties, please text 352-559-9917, leave a voice message for the Life Story Lab at (352)273-3813, or email them at [lifestorylab@psych.ufl.edu](mailto:lifestorylab@psych.ufl.edu).

my Mom is still in early stages, however her condition is very evident at this point. i am a frequent cannabis user and yesterday my mother smoked with me. i’ve noticed that when she partakes, which is very occasional, she seems to be much better at recalling past memories she usually struggles with. additionally, she has a better grasp for time (i.e. recalling when in her life events have occurred) and in general can hold a conversation easier. on the flip side, she had a bit more difficulty than usual with her syntax, which was the only negative effect i observed. i am wondering if you have similar, or different experiences with weed and it’s affect on those affected? thank you!	0

I just became my Moms primary caretaker and I’m learning so much over the past couple months. I was wondering, some days are worse than others (mostly by the evening) and I’m wondering if anybody has any tips on how to keep her mind sharper and brighter. Prevent those nights where her mind seems to take a bigger dip. Have you done anything that you noticed made a big difference?  More games? Outdoors? Water consumption? Socialization?	0
"I am new to this adventure, caring for a father fresh out of the hospital and a mother with Alzheimer's, so a lot of time is non-stop between tending to them and working (which I can do from their house).  And then you have the nice, calm, silent times like yesterday morning after they both had eaten their breakfasts.  Which was when my mother hit me with ""Did you pick me up by the head yesterday?""  I laughed way harder than I really should have.  Don't worry, I did not.   Hoping somebody else here gets a portion of the laughter I had."	0
Someone I know just read this book, Making Rounds with Oscar, by Dr. David Dosa, a geriatric physician. She said that he recommends not treating other life threatening or severe illnesses, such as pneumonia, for Alzheimer’s patients. I’m probably misunderstanding her but she said that the doctor believes if you extend their life, you are only extending their misery. I feel like this shows no compassion. I have not read the book so I’m unsure if I’m misunderstanding what she is saying or if she is misunderstanding what the book is saying or if this information is accurate. Has any read this book? What was your take away?	0
Hi.  We've known my grandma has had dementia for about 2 years (probably longer) and recently she's gotten a lot worse. Leaving oil in the frying pan and not being able to smell it, falling and not using her alarm. She had carers come morning and night, but she got a leaflet through the post about a carehome and suggested it to my parents.   She's been there 3 weeks and she's on a rolling 2 week stay at the moment to see how she likes it. Things seemed to be looking good, she's always kind of gloomy about things but when I last spoke to her a few days ago and I asked her how she was, she said 'oh, not so bad!' which is the best I've heard from her in a long, long time. She's stopped calling my parents in distress every day and she's been making friends and sitting outside. Stuff she never did at home. She would just sit there and sleep.   But at the moment, there's a COVID case in her care home meaning no visitors and no AC during the UK's heatwave. She called my parents yesterday about not feeling fit enough to go to work and that she was worried about not going to work. She said she felt decrepit and useless. She has a recurring UTI that causes delirium, and the heat may be partly to blame for these thoughts, but she said it's too noisy and she can't cope much longer. My mum suggested that she get up and go to her own room if she wants a bit of peace, but she said she is so decrepit she can't even do that, so my mum changed the subject. At home she was depressed and lonely all the time and had started wandering outside sometimes, and wanted to go home when she lived there too. She's thinking about her old house.   We can't force her to stay. But she can't live alone. Do you just keep telling them 'give it another week and see how you feel'? It feels so... Unethical. But allowing her to waste away in her house, living off icecream, potentially setting fire to the place is surely worse.	0
I was just sitting here, watching tv with my dogs, perfectly content and it occurred to me I could be at Mom's hanging out with her and I got this stab of guilt. But you know what? I just can't continue to feel guilty for everything I'm not doing for/with my mom. I do a lot every day and she has help, she's in the early stages now.  However, she also will suck every scrap of attention that I or anyone will give her. She's always been that way, but it's worse now.  I've spent my whole life stiff-arming my mother to keep her at a distance, but now I have to take care of her and I'm losing my hard won boundaries. It's so hard to figure out when it's the disease making her extra emotional or if she just wants my attention.  I just feel like an asshole all the time. All this would be much easier if we had a better relationship to begin with.	0
To make a long question short, does anybody know what causes incorrect memories?  I took my mother (who has Alzheimer's) to a doctor's appt.  The whole time we were out, she over and over again got real angry that my father made her this appointment and made me take her because he did not want to (none of it true).  I can wrap my head around the loss of memory and confusion, but these are just false memories.  I don't know what I am battling here.  Thanks.	0
I just found out that almost all of my girlfriends family on her mother's side had strokes and alzheimers. Everyone on her dads side has high blood pressure. She already deals with a few mental health issues like depression. If she starts to live a healthier lifestyle and get more sleep (she has super bad insomnia) can she save herself from it? She's in her earlier 20s...	0
"So it's time. Mom's paranoia and anger has gotten to the point where she can't stay home anymore - she's dangerous to herself and my father. Question - HOW did you get your LO to go into the AL/MC facility? She's aware enough to know exactly what is going to happen once we pull into the parking lot (my aunt was at the AL facility at the same location)? She's going to go in kicking and screaming - hopefully not literally - but any tips or suggestions are welcome.  &#x200B;  \*\*\* UPDATE\*\*\*  Kicking and screaming carried the day. We pulled in to just ""see a doctor here"" and she wasn't having it. She knew exactly where we were and had no intention of going inside. Started screaming, got out of the car, hit me when I started talking to her, and ended up inside with a couple of the nurses with Dad eventually to have coffee. We thought it was going better but she started yelling at everyone and got completely out of control. One of the nurses called it  psychotic episode-like behavior.The doctor there suggested a ride to the ER and placement in a geriatric psych ward so that's where we're at. It was one of the worst days of my life. My father was a champ, and as much as he loves my mother (to the moon and back), he stayed the course. She'll be there 7-10 days then go straight back to the MC facility.  I hate this disease SO MUCH. "	0
"Illinois. Near Western Chicago Suburbs. My dad will be having an MRI on his brain July 26 and we will discuss the results with a neurologist July 29. I guess a quick first question is, will they tell us anything July 26?  Anyway, my dad had a traumatic brain injury in 1984 in a head on collision. In 2003 he was deemed permanently disabled due to that injury at age 46 so he has a background of brain injury. He is 65 now.  Well his memory has gotten worse but most of all he has been ""acting out."" He hasn't bathed in over 2 months. He took advantage of some dribbling issues he had where he got diapers and now just pees in them 24/7 and has since stopped changing his diapers regularly. He just lays in his pee soaked through his diaper through his pants and it stinks up the whole house as it flows through the air conditioner.  I guess he's manageable now though it's not fun. But one would say that soon he would need a home care aide or an adult day care specializing in memory care. I've read horror stories on reddit about how some patients even entering/in final stage Alzheimer's and are still being denied entry into nursing homes through Medicaid. Is this common?  If he gets really bad I think a nursing home would be preferable. His lifestyle is bedridden at the house. He doesn't get up ever. He just lays in his pee watching TV. Plus, the house is an absolute mess borderline hoarder house. I would feel absolutely horrid if a home care aide had to come into that. His room is just littered in junk and urine. I would love it if he could go to a adult day care for the remainder of his life and get some activity. However, the nearest one with memory care is 14 miles away and no one can drive him. I read on another thread that there might be programs that would be a few bucks to pay for his transportation but I bet it was a lot shorter distance than 28 miles each day. Does anyone know of any? My mom can't take care of him.  That's all I can think of for now. I'm really trying to do what I can with what I've got to keep my family afloat. I'm glad I found this thread.  Edit: As of about an hour after this post he is now pooping in his diapers per my mom..."	0
Just want every care taker to know that Yelp will keep images of dementia people who had their picture taken at business without their consent.   Back story- I found a negative review of my moms biz and in the review there is a photo of my dad suffering from late stage dementia. I kid you not. He is standing tall and looking at the camera. He was not wandering. But he sure as hell did not and could not give consent.   I reported this reviewer and review but Yelp will not take it down.   It’s elder abuse and disgusting. He has since passed away and I am doing everything I can to remove this review.	0
Hello Reddit. Towards the beginning of 2021 my elderly step father had a sudden violent mental episode which led to a diagnosis of Alzheimer's.  The hospital sent him to a psychiatric facility to recover and then to our local nursing home for rehab. He has Tri-Care insurance and medicare which covers 100 days in a nursing home after a medical problem. During this time my mother has worked with the nursing homes insurance bookkeeper to get him qualified for Medicaid. He financially qualifies, but even after an appeal they claim he doesn’t qualify medically. They say he doesn’t even qualify for at home nursing help.   This is extremely upsetting as there is no way he can go back home and no way my parents can afford the $6000/month nursing home. He can not take care of himself at all and my mother has serious health problems and can not take care of him either. There is no one else able to care for him. He has military training and got so violent in the hospital it took five people to hold him down and put him in restraints. Knowing this there is no way I could allow him to live with my mother or her pets. At the moment his is staying in the hospital because of a sudden serious health problem, but if he does recover there are only 20 days left of nursing home care covered by his insurance. His Alzheimer's is very serious and  he can’t recognize his own children, thinks his wife is his mother, and has no idea where he is or what is going on. It’s even worse now, because the medication he was on to help with his memory caused extreme side effects that almost killed him.   We honestly have no idea what to do and my step father never prepared for the future. If he passes my mother can’t even pay their mortgage and would have to sell the house. Should we look into hiring a lawyer? There is a long-term care facility for veterans near us, but I have no idea if they would accept him or how we could pay for that. This situation feels extremely hopeless and we are looking for any advice possible.  Infot:  He is in his mid 80’s  He is a veteran and served in the Vietnam and Korean war  He can do nothing on his own	0
"Hi everyone. I wasn't sure where else to post this, but I'm looking for some advice for my grandfather. He has Alzheimer's and whenever he wakes up, either from a nap or sleeping overnight, he says the same thing. ""Where is my wife?"" and ""I want to go back to New Jersey"". He lived in New Jersey 30 years ago before we moved here. He lives with his wife (my grandmother, who is taking care of him) and he will tell her ""I want to see my wife"" and she always insists on telling him that she ***is*** his wife. This confuses him to the point where he threatens to call the police. After a while, he eventually calms down and realizes where he is. I'd just like to know what we could do to possibly calm him down so he doesn't freak out when he wakes up since that when the majority of the confusion happens. My grandmother isn't in the best health either and I want to make sure she doesn't escalate things (she can be pretty impatient with him) because she gets really frustrated when he doesn't know who she is. Any help is immensely appreciated. Thank you.  &#x200B;  Edit: Wow. I am blown away with all the support and advice. I am grateful for everyone here. Thank you reddit!"	0
Hello, my dad with Alzheimer’s gets confused very late at night and tries to leave the house, looking for his mom (who passed away). When my brother or I try to stop him, he starts being aggressive and yells.	0
My dad (55ish) was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s a while back, maybe a half a year or more. I (16) have mostly been left out of the loop in regards to his treatments, what stage he is in, etc. What I’m wondering is if there’s anything in particular that I should look out for as the disease progresses. At the moment my father is kinda independent as he takes care of the animals, drives me places if their not too far, goes shopping by himself sometimes and just last week for example he helped me install an ac unit in my room. In regards to his Alzheimer’s, the only major thing I noticed is him telling me the same joke or story over and over or him forgetting to grab things as he leaves. That being said, I do know that things won’t be like this forever and I’m simply wondering if there are any key things or signs that you guys have noticed as the disease progresses from personal experience that I should look out. I mostly want to know since I can “gauge” how much he is affected and so I can know when to take more responsibility in the household per say if that makes sense. Thanks in advance for any tips	0
My husband is in denial when it comes to his mother's declining health. She is increasingly paranoid, blaming her home care attendants for everything from stealing from her (they aren't) to trying to kill her (if her food is even slightly spicy). Her health really took a turn over the last year due to severe isolation (due to COVID - she's in NYC where everything was shut down). My husband will procrastinate so I am trying to take a proactive role in getting her ready to be moved from NY to FL now, that way everything is lined up when we actually need to do it.   My proposed questions for him to ask her case manager are below. Are there other questions I should be asking?  Thank you in advance. This is not a fund club to be in, but I appreciate your wisdom and insight.  # Health Insurance  **Medicare**  1. How do you transfer coverage from NY to FL? 2. Does coverage change with location change? If so, how? 3. Are there prescription discount benefits?  **Medicare**  1. How do you transfer coverage from NY to FL? 2.

My grandpa has had Alzheimer’s for a few years now. He is in the late stages where he can barely speak, is bed ridden, and barely eats. After some very painful months of trying to get him in the right home, we currently have him in the hospital while we finalize our plans for him. It has gotten really bad and it’s just devastating in every way imaginable. I’m only 19 so I’ve never experienced anything like this before. It’s so painful and this whole situation makes me cry so much. I love my grandpa and I’ve been visiting him as much as I can. I don’t really know what the point of this post is, I just wanted to vent to people who I know have also dealt with what I’m feeling. Alzheimer’s is an evil, cruel, and awful disease.	0
I'm 35 and my mom will be 71 in August. My dad died when I was in high school. Both myself and my sibling live several hours away. How can we care for her?  I'm not sure how I'm going to handle all of this. I'm terrified my mom could get awful care unless I supplement with my own income, but at such a young age I just don't have any money.	0
This is a shit post. Mom(71) with AZ and she calls me 3-7 times every day. Asking where my dad is. He died 5 months ago. So I’m basically living  in this Groundhog Day hell of letting my mom know every day her husband of 50 years died 5 months ago. I just need to vent. I love this sub because I’ve learned so much.	0
hey everyone, i’m 21 and am living at home for the summer with my Mom who is 63 and has early onset. she also has a few other health issues and is currently in a boot for a broken foot. oftentimes she goes on tangents about how damaged of a person she is, how she has so many ailments in her life, and wants to put herself out of her misery. her punch line “pain is my best friend.” i have no idea how to respond to these comments, so i stay silent and let her ramble. it makes me so sad. i’m wondering how anyone here copes with hearing this rhetoric from those you know affected, if at all?	0
My MIL was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. It started slowly. She couldn't find her words.  Then, she drove alone. Passed a bunch of stop signs and caused an accident. She went from being a perfect driver to, not so much.  Now she can't form full sentences. No one understands what she's saying. She doesn't recognize anyone.   My FIL is a bit in denial. He agreed to revoke her license and sell her car only last month.   One thing my husband's family and myself don't understand is the aggressivity.  My brother in law has a small dog. And sometimes she will harass the dog until he gets angry and then slap the dog.  Or, the other day. My SIL was showing my MIL their new patio.  Don't remember exactly the words but she didn't believe it was built recently and then yelled F YOU and flipped everyone out of nowhere.   Can someone explain the aggressivity they feel?	0
Something we all hope for, though just wondering if there are any known instances of anyone recovering from Alzheimer's?	0
I’m sure situations identical to mine have been posted 1000x so I apologize in advance but I can’t read through any more posts right now.   I need to know what to do next.   Mom is 71. Her memory has been declining for last last few years, which could of course be attributed to age. However, she has two sisters (so far) who’ve been diagnosed; one with early onset whose condition deteriorated drastically and the other who isn’t far behind.   It’s at the point now where mom doesn’t remember things we talked about two days ago. She’ll call the dog the wrong name, forget the state I’m moving to, etc. I don’t live nearby so I can’t speak to the day to day ‘signs.’   I haven’t discussed this with her husband yet, which I know is probably step one. Im just concerned he’s going to say something to her which would be a disaster I’m not ready for yet.   Among my many concerns I’m sure you all can identify with, there are logistical and financial concerns I’m thinking about. My stepdad is doing well, but fighting stage 4 cancer. As anyone dealing with cancer knows, “good news” lasts three months, until the next appointment. If something happens to him or his health declines, and she needs care within the next 1..3..5… years, I am completely unprepared. Should I be looking into a LTC policy? Is that even a possibility? Am I wrong to think I should be talking to my stepdad first? Should I look into counseling or a support group that might help with navigating the conversation with her?   Many thanks.	0
Has anyone else had issues with their family member thinking their reflection is a different person? My dad has apparently started talking to his reflection as if it is a guest in the house. My brother said he was asking if the reflection needed to be fed. He doesn't seem scared of it like an intruder, just something interesting. I'm assuming he probably thinks of himself as younger than what he sees.	0
this is just going to be one big vent session, be warned if you're not in the mood   my mom is 54 and recently has been diagnosed with alzheimer's, she remains positive about the whole thing but i can't stop thinking about the rest of her life and where we go from here  i'm 18 years old, i'm going to college next semester but my dad is working a lot in order to pay for my college and for treatment and for college   i recently was unable to return to a job i was previously employed at bc i was late to turning in the papers and someone else had done it, and the other job i'm working at is slowly putting me on the schedule less,b bc so i'm currently making no money from that job, i could look for another job but i'd only be able to work until august 17th (when i leave for school)  my mom is the kindest woman ever and doesnt have a single mean bone in her body, it's heartbreaking to see her fall subject to such a terrible disease  ive also been thinking a lot about my future, i've got a 50/50 chance of developing alzheimer's myself, and i'm terrified that i'm setting myself up for a lonely future. yku see i dont plan on marrying at the moment and i don't want kids either. i'm unsure who i'll lean on if i have the gene  i need to get a gene test to see if i have alzheimer's	0
Hi all,  Dad has moderate early onset Alzheimer’s. Haven’t seen much in this group about aducanumab. I know that it doesn’t have scientific backing. Still wondering, has anyone started looking into it with insurance? Is anyone thinking to try it? Thoughts or experiences? I just want to gauge where this community is at.	0
"My grandfather was diagnosed with a rare strain of Alzheimer's about 7-8 years ago, that was so rare he was legally required to inform his offspring of his condition so they could get genetic testing to see if they also carried the gene.  I did a genome test about a year ago and found out that not only did I inherit the gene maternally, but I also carry two other variants of the Alzheimer's gene  from my father's side. So, in total I have 4 active genome variants of Alzheimer's.  &#x200B;  Yesterday I found out that my Grandfather has been moved into hospice care, and I love him with my whole heart but the idea of seeing him (he lives across the country) terrifies me because it feels like I'm looking at my ""not too far off future""  &#x200B;  Has anyone else had to overcome this, how did you get through it?"	0
My mom suffered through the pandemic solo taking care of my moderately affected dad and needed respite. So she dropped him off at my house under the guise of us “needing his help” with some projects and took off with friends. Here’s what I learned from it, and I hope it’s helpful:  1. We tried to keep busy. I knew he’d be out of his element and easily agitated with my mom gone. Every day we had either a small project to work on or a simple outing planned.  2. We made sure to keep all car keys tucked away in case he got riled up.  3. I allowed him to help me around the house and our farm. He was an engineer and loves to tinker. Even if it was something simple, like easy manual labor, he very much enjoyed feeling useful. Sometimes I had to go behind and fix things but that’s ok.  4. He insisted on buying things for himself and has the money, but struggles with his card. I allowed him to make small purchases but helped him at self checkout. I also had to ask my mom for his pin as he couldn’t remember. It’s a point of pride for him and I didn’t want to deny him that.  5. Alcohol is a problem. He wants to drink more than he ever has, and he doesn’t have an off switch. Instead of a nightly battle, I left a small amount of low alcohol beverages accessible to him. When we were out, I just explained I’d get more the next day. This really helped mitigate his symptoms.  6. We gathered his wallet, phone, and reading glasses each night and put them on the night stand. Sometimes they were hard to find but I could ping his phone and things would usually be together. I had extra reading glasses tucked away if his got permanently lost.  7. We stayed patient and calm with all our might. I reminded him to take a shower and asked if I could wash his clothes. I counted to ten when he asked the same things over and over. He needed more help in public spaces than I anticipated but usually accepted my assistance as long as I could get him on my side.   I hope this helps someone. It was better than I expected and I’m sure I’ll have to adjust my strategy as he progresses. Good luck everyone.	0
Unfortunately the time has come to move my mother into a Memory Care facility. We're moving slowly, getting some furniture, etc delivered. I have a short list of things to have there before she moves in. What did you find to be crucial, or maybe just helpful or nice, to have in the room before your LO moved in?  Thanks!  Current list:      · **Lamp**  · **Comforter**  · **Pillows**  · **Sheet sets - 2**  · **Blankets**  · **Towels and washcloths**  · **Shower curtain**  · **Toiletries**  o **Soap**  o **Shampoo**  o **Deodorant**  o **Toothpaste**  o **TP**  o **Lotion**  o **Q-tips**  · **Framed pictures**  · **Television**  · **MEDICATIONS**  · **One weeks’ worth of clothes**	0
"My dad died of mixed Alzheimer's/vascular dementia last August.  The following is something I wrote in honor of the first Father's Day after his passing.  I hope this is acceptable to share in this sub; it's part of my own personal processing of his passing.  Please take this in the spirit in which it's intended. === One day, when my daughter was two years old, our cat went missing.  We looked all over the house and didn't find her.  We walked out our front door, and didn't see her immediately.  But very soon we heard her meowing. I looked over towards the direction of the sound, and saw her - she had managed to get herself trapped on our neighbor's roof. I have no idea how she got up there, but you know how cats are. Cats have access to some form of unearthly magic that us mere mortals can only imagine. But there she was; the magic she'd used to get herself on the roof was not enough to get her back down. My neighbors were not home, but I noticed they had a ladder set up against their garage door. So I borrowed it, set it up and started climbing to rescue the cat.  My daughter, however, was immediately scared on my behalf, in this dangerous situation she felt that I was in.  In her most terrified two-year-old voice, she shouted up to me, ""WATCH OUT, DADDY!""  It took just a moment; I was at the top of the ladder, the cat jumped down onto my shoulder and together we climbed our way back down to solid ground.  My daughter was immediately relieved, and spoke to herself in her most self-satisfied voice:  ""I Saved Daddy!""  Now my daughter is thirteen, and like any teenager the best thing I can do for her as her father is simply to exist in a different room from her. I'm told that's normal. I remember being thirteen and having the same attitude about my own parents.  But today is Father's Day, and in my case it's the first Father's Day since my father passed on. So that's a thing that I get to process today.  I actually never lived with my father growing up. My parents divorced when I was two years old and for most of my life my dad lived several hours, or sometimes several states, away from me. But I would visit a couple of times a year.  When I was younger he lived on an eight-acre property outside of a small Midwestern town.  Whenever I would visit we would alternate nights between shooting off the illegal fireworks he'd acquired from another state, or setting up his back yard telescope to look at whatever planets were in view that night. Through those evenings I saw the moons of Jupiter and the rings of Saturn.  When I was ten he gave me the Universe.  When I was 21 he gave me a job.  By this time through his job he had survived a spinoff and a buyout, and he'd moved states a couple of times, and I accepted a summer college internship at his high-rise company in a major Southern city's downtown area.  It was my first grown-up job and I was impressed and inspired by his big-box corporate office. How many other 21-year-olds have the opportunity to land a summer job on the 35th Floor of a high-rise?  But then the summer ended, I came back to my home state to finish college, then went off to do some other things in other countries for a while. By the time I was 27 I landed in what would become my own career-defining job.  I've also survived a merger, a reorg, a Covid furlough and two rounds of layoffs, but here I still am. I like to believe I have his example to thank for my own longevity at work.  From my dad I inherited his taste in music; his taste in television; his sense of humor (sorry about that), but most especially his work ethic. And for that I'm grateful.  Last August he climbed his final ladder, the one he can't climb down from anymore. I can't save him, but I've come to the conclusion that maybe, just this time, he's the one who saved me.  Happy Father's Day. May you be well."	0
Mom is the main caregiver for Dad, and she has hit the “I’m tired” and frustrated phase. He has progressed to the upper tier of the moderate progression of this course over the last 18 months.   She comes from a childhood of poverty, and therefore has a mindset that there is never enough money for X,Y, or Z. However, my sister and I are fully aware that they have a net worth of over a million. Mom is reluctant to spend more than a day’s worth of having him at a local facility so she can catch a break or catch up on needed responsibilities, which is $175.   I am concerned that she might act out in frustration toward him or simply burn out in the process of caregiving. She is also highly persnickety about people coming into the home.   Mom and Dad are retired RNs, so this also makes the overall dynamic more stressful. I want what is best for them, but also know she is being stubborn to a certain degree.   What is the true cost for full-time assisted living per month? My sister and I have talked, and we would have him in a decent facility in the event Mom somehow passed first.	0
I need some advice. My mother is in a care facility in Louisiana where my three brothers live. I live in North Carolina. Due to my husband’s job, we can’t move. Each flight down with car rental and flight is very expensive so I fly down once a year. My mother desperately needs interaction. I can’t move her to NC due to financial reasons. I need to stay connected to her. Phone calls are not productive because she just hangs up. Any ideas on staying connected long distance.	0
"Hi peeps.  Tl:dr  mother getting worse, brother angry and in denial, we're pretty much the only people who are in contact with her.   Mostly read in this sub so far, it helps me feel less isolated and guilty.  I don't think I use the proper terms for everything, excuse that and please correct me if anything is offensive to you.   Mother has alcohol related dementia(Korsakoff), since about 3 years ago.   My brother became her legal guardian during her getting the diagnosis.   Mom isolates herself completely from everyone. Brother only sees her for doctors appointments and to sort out finances and practical things. Understandable, it's just that the rest, as in her seeing anybody at all, falls on me.  My parents are divorced so dad involves himself as little as he can with mom. My friends are supportive but aren't going through this.   I'd been worried about her drinking problem for about 15 years before that,  talked to family and friends of family since I was concerned but was told they didn't want to hear about it, and to not be so dramatic.   Distanced myself for a while from brother as we didn't have a great relationship.   It's like I'm back there now.  Her dementia has progressed rapidly since Covid, and when I've been with her and she's driving, it's been pretty scary!  Speeding when she ""feels like it"" as she says, and generally not following laws/rules as one should, and she previously has.   So when her yearly test came up, I was a little relieved as her continuing to drive seemed dangerous.   Got the results this week and they said she shouldn't drive anymore. Brother got VERY angry.  He called to yell at the doctor as he thought them being rude stressed her out and made her fail.   He's going to appeal.  When he's previously said she doesn't need any help and isn't getting worse, I've suggested help that doesn't cost money as her house is a mess and she's just so isolated.  Plus I've figured she will have to get used to having help as it will soon be a necessity, and better to get used to it now so she won't be so angry or shocked and scared when it's inevitable.   He just gets angry and tells me if I don't agree with him I can do whatever the f*** I want.  He gets angry with mom too, when she forgets things¯\_(ツ)_/¯  Juuuust a lot of extra strain, aggressive behaviour  , work that seems unnecessary and very counter productive to me.   Sorry for wall of text. Don't think there's much of a ""solution"". My brother is handling this his way and I can't change that.  Just can't help but feel like this could be so much easier for him me AND mom if he didn't act affronted any time someone acknowledges the reality."	0
Sorry for the length, needed a place to clear my mind.  Short history: mum has alzheimers and broke her hip in december. She is relatively young (just turned 70) and still remebers quite a lot. She will ask the same question 10 times, but does remember that I am job hunting. At home, she didn't eat, didnt clean and fell often. In the rehabilitation place, she found it hard to find her room  So we decided the best place was memory care.  Now they are telling me, she's too well. She doesnt have a connection with the other residents, because they are a lot more forgetful than she. And she is very independent.  I'm at a loss to what I should do. They say a different kind of care facility might be better, but I know if they give her too much independence, she will stop eating again and go back to her old ways. Also I'm not convinced she'll find her way back if she gets the freedom to leave the building.  The place she's at now is great. They take good care of the residents. Do fun stuff with them. Mums been there since march, and I can tell she's becoming less happy there. Thinking she can go home soon. (I told her once she can't. She was sad for the remainder of the day, but 2 days later she didn't remember)  I really don't know what the next step should be.	0
My (57F) mam has always suffered from “Brain Fog” as she calls it. Forgets things easily, has trouble following instructions or just generally listening to people.  Lately it’s gotten worse,the other day she called me asking me how to buy groceries online (we’re all close contacts and isolating). We had a chat and I asked her to do something and get back to me.  She rings me 20 minutes later asking me if she called me..and if she did what did I say to her. It took all my strength not to cry.  She said my brother was annoyed at her for not remembering and she started crying. I don’t blame him, I get incredibly frustrated with her as well sometimes, even though I know it’s not her fault, it’s just so hard to see her so unable to perform basic tasks.  Anyway the memory loss and general confusion is getting worse, and I’m afraid if we don’t do something about it soon and there is a  real problem, it will only get worse when we could try and catch it early.  Everyone in my family seems to be in denial, they know she has problems but there’s clear signs of an underlying problem but they keep ignoring it, no one will take action and she won’t do it herself.  I’m only 23, no job currently and I don’t drive. There’s only so much I can do to get the ball rolling  I just need some advice on the best way to encourage someone to get help, while keeping a sensitive attitude as I’m sure this is very upsetting for my mam, and just the best way to get her checked out.  Thank you so much in advance for any help/advice	0
Today my grandma (74) tried to leave for her mother's house. Luckily we do not have a car for her to take but she has gotten used to walking everywhere. She tried to leave and I tried everything I could think of to get her off that track. I ended up standing in her way and she hit. I can't believe she hit me. I know it's the disease but I never thought she'd get violent. It's just all too much	0
Just that for now.  I don’t post much here (mainly comment) but I do have to post later about my mom in care.  We just moved her to another place (long story) but it is great.  She is a bit melancholy again today, and it breaks my heart.  ❤️‍🩹  Edit	0
"Please please please I am seeking for help!!!   My grandma is 97 and she's been dealing with alzheimer's for a while now, bur her aggressiveness has been taking a toll on my mom's mental and physical health and mine too because we are the ones taking care of her. We are a bit short on money so getting a therapist or taking her to a nursing home are not viable options.   I know, I know ""it's the disease talking"" but that isn't enough to help the issue.I'd be so so so grateful if you guys could give me some advice, please."	0
My father just called me concerned about my mother. He mentioned that in the last 6 months, he's noticed some driving issues with her. The main one is not taking her foot off the gas when shes parked. He said it's like she doesn't even notice that she's doing it and he's had to physically pull her leg up off the petal because even when he tells her to take her foot off, she doesn't seem to clue in to what she's doing.    She is in remission from cancer and recently had a head CT with no concerns in that department but he was still concerned. Especially because he doesn't always drive with her, so he can't say if it's something that happens more often than he sees. My grandfather had dementia but, I'll admit I don't know a whole lot about it. When my father called, it was sort of the first place my mind went. Could this be an early sign?	0
We are checking my dad into memory care the first week of September. Mom has asked me to figure out how best to mark his clothes, sheets, etc. for the laundry. She had friends tell her to order iron-on labels. But she said dad doesn't like itchy tags. After looking online, it seems some are saying to use a Sharpie; mom is worried it will seep through his clothes and show on the outside.  Can anyone offer some advice on marking dad's things in a way that isn't uncomfortable, stays legible, and doesn't look sloppy? Thanks so much!	0
My father-in-law was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's last year.  He turned 60 in April.  He has four children, but me and my husband are the only ones who are trying to help him as he has no savings, retirement, or way to work.    We're trying to move him from AZ to CA (where we live) but not sure how to house him.  Assisted living is thousands of $$$ out of our reach.  He gets $1900 from disability and me and my husband are struggling to make ends meet ourselves.    Any advice on housing credits or federal assistance?  We think he'll just have to live with us for the time being.  He's an awful human, which is why the other kids won't help, so not an ideal situation but probably the only fiscally sound one.    Was just wondering if anyone could share advice/their experience/anything helpful.    Thank you!    Tl;Dr Need advice on how to house early onset Alzheimer's man who makes $1900 a month in CA.	0
"Hi there, I'm the adult daughter of two 80+ parents, one with Alzheimer's, who have been paying into CalPERS LTCG (long term care) for over 20 years. There's a class action lawsuit going on against the entity (it's run by the state of California). We're starting to get to the point with my mother where I think we'll need to start ""using"" the insurance soon, and have some help come into the house.  I'm totally uncertain as to how that process works, and how to interact with them, given their current legal status and the few interactions I've had so far. They aren't accepting new enrollment (this is the message that pops up everywhere on their site: CalPERS has suspended open enrollment due to current uncertainty in the long-term care market and is no longer accepting applications), and their website managers are very evasive as to why we haven't been able to log in for weeks.  I'm thinking there must be a more specific subReddit somewhere for folks who have that form of insurance ... anyone have any guidance to offer?"	0
Could really use any kind of help/advice here.  I'll try to condense the backstory as much as possible.  My (40m) mother (70f), had been diagnosed with dementia/short-term memory loss a few years ago.  Up until a few months ago it was nothing more than her repeating herself quite a bit.    Starting in February of 2021 she went to the ER with pain in her lower abdomen.  It was diagnosed as a UTI.  Cut to 4 months later. It was not a UTI, and since then she has had almost every test imaginable. CT scans, colonoscopy, urinary scope, gynological exams and utrasounds, etc, etc.  All the tests come back negative and the variety of specialists we have seen really don't have any answers.  She has been put on a variety of different meds in hopes that one might do the trick (overactive bladder, IBS meds, antibiotics).   Every 24 to 48 hours she is in severe pain and wants to go to the ER or urgent care.  She has been many, many times and although I think part of her knows there is nothing they can do, in her mind if you are in pain that is what you do.    Obviously, this whole thing has been really hard on the whole family.  To make matters worse her primary doctor was pretty terrible, And they are switching to a new one this week.  I know with dementia it can be very difficult for people to explain exactly what is happening with their body.  She has a follow-up appointment with a neurology center in August.    I probably left quite a bit out, but that is the general idea of what is going on.	0
While i was living in Oregon, I surprised my dad with a trip to visit me. When I say I surprised him I mean, I repeatedly asked him to visit and he made so many excuses I ended up buying him a ticket and telling him to just show up at the airport.  Knowing what I know now about dementia, I think the problem was that he didn't know how to purchase a ticket on his own anymore. He didn't want to admit he needed help.   When he got to Portland, he was excited to visit Cannon Beach, so we took the 1.5-mile drive down to the coast. When we arrived, my father stepped out of the car, looked at the beach, and got back in the car--he was ready to go. No explanation. And there was nothing I could say to convince him to stay longer.   On the way back home, I stopped in front of giant logs on the side of the road and made my dad pose for a picture. He pretended to be a bear.   *If you want to read more stories about me, my dad, and our adventures with dementia check us out at @mydadhasdementia on Instagram.	0
Sorry, but I really need to get some things off of my chest and I feel as if this is the only place I can. Just yesterday my grandfather has officially been diagnosed with Alzheimers. My family has been seeing his decline over the past year or so, and it's been really hard to deal with. I've been close with him my whole life, and it really hurts just to think about. It's gotten to the point where he still expects me to get dropped off by the bus after school, even though that stopped happening about 8 months ago. Having to see a loved one go through this is in my opinion worse than death, and I really wouldn't wish this pain upon anyone. I try to call him as much as I can, but he just forgets I ever did every single time, and it makes me feel even worse. Again, im sorry but I just really needed to get this off of my chest.	0
There are published papers in PubMed saying that CBD and THC might help Alzheimer's patients. My mom's pcp is fully supportive of CBD for her agitation, but I didn't ask about THC. Has anyone looked into this or tried for a loved one suffering from this awful disease?	0
Biogen and Lilly may be first to market, BUT, and this is a big BUT, it does not mean that doctors will prescribe their drugs versus Cassava's treatment when it is approved. I strongly feel that their side effects and costs will be a negative and that Cassava will be the medical choice for both patients, their families and doctors.	0
My husband asked me this evening about his mom's strange behaviors. (He is staying with her while his sister is out of town this week) He said she will go to bed when he does and stay in bed until she hears him get up. She seems to be copying things he does in general -- not eating if he doesn't, going to the bathroom right after him, getting a drink when he does, etc. This is a new behavior just since we were there at Memorial Day. I told him it makes sense to me, and that between that and her not being able to read directions on a box of corn dogs & not knowing what she can make for dinner, it really sounds like she is at the point where she can't be living on her own. Am I making an accurate assessment? I only know of Alzheimer's/dementia though watching my aunt and uncle tend to my grandparents before they passed a few years ago, but in my husband's eyes that makes me an expert!	0

My mother who has early stage dementia is often in the hospital for 3-5 days with heart or kidney issues.  About 50% of the time she gets really really scared and nervous when I have to leave at night.  I am here caregiver at home and live with her.  The nurses usually understand but any suggestions on how to help her relax ?    She has tried Ativan which sometimes works.  It seems like she has sun downing but some nights in hospital are fine others are really hard for her.   Thanks!	0
Hello All,    I am trying to determine the best way to try to negotiate prices with assisted living homes and their crazy prices.    I talked to one and they did say price was negotiable.  I was thinking about throwing $1,000 lower prices on the ones I do not want to send my mom to get some practice.    Any thoughts out there or tips??  Thanks 🙏!!!!	0
Just had to deal this recently. Dad decided to cut wood in the heat of the day wearing a heavy shirt. Before we knew it, he had come inside and near-about. Managed to hydrate him and get his electrolyte levels back up.  With summer upon us, remember to watch exertion levels and encourage or prioritize water and electrolyte, especially sodium.	0
These are not my Words. My Wife Wrote This.  It's an uncomfortable and tender feeling being the daughter of a woman who has Alzheimer's.   She is blissfully and sometimes unblissfully living in a different time and age. A time I didnt exist maybe, or maybe her young mother days. It could be four years back, I'll never know.  She herself is child like now, has developed a sweet tooth and the telltale bluntness that I've heard accompanies Alzheimer's, hurts you when you least expect it. I remind myself that's not Cathy, that Al. Fuck you, Al.  Today my mum asked me who I was very casually in the back isle of the discount store. She scoffed at my answer as if i was lying yet eagerly followed me. And i didn't know what to say to her. So I told her I was her friend. Which is true. But quietly, the Bargin-mania had become the backdrop to my sorrow.  I feel guilty and werid mourning my mums personality and her ways, while she is still here physically and giving that winning Cathy Barry smile. She truley is crucial to the whole damn operation. Responsible for so many planted seeds in my life.  I just fucking miss her. HER her. And I wish she understood that.  I don't share about this often,  but today, instead if going inwards and into the darkness, this short essay of my feelings seems correct.	0
Write-up from the *NYTimes*:   https://archive.is/gfhTg  Academic article from the *Journal of the American Medical Association*:  https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2775218	0
Our family is me (37F, single, not married, no kid’s) my father 74, and my mom 74 with dementia.   Father’s Day weekend I snapped on my mother’s dementia. I got pushed and pushed and I couldn’t take it anymore.   Here is some background:   I’ve live the beach house my parents own. It had been a rental for about 30 years, until 2016 when my parents stopped renting it because they could no longer handle the responsibility in their older age. I moved into the house in 2017.  I was never a big part of this house until I became unemployed in my career due to mental health reasons. I was able to stay in this house for free which was very generous of them and I am incredibly grateful. It became obvious my mother is a hoarder who had been storing trash and furniture for years in this house.   The property is in a resort area with million dollar houses all around. When I moved in the property was neglected like something you would see on the show Hoarders. full of trash, debris, broken lights inside, dirty refrigerator, fallen tree limbs, vines everywhere, insect infested.   As a way to pay for my stay, I’ve renovated the house. By myself. I learned to do electrical, plumbing, painting, house repairs, landscaping, etc by watching YouTube videos.   There were …FIVE… 1-800-GotJunk trucks that I hired and hauled away literal TONS of trash. I used some of my own savings, money I collected, and my parents money they gave me for this purpose to renovate.   Fast forward to this past weekend: my parents came to visit for the first time in many months. It was going to be the big reveal so I was really excited for them to see the changes I had made and enjoy their fresh newly updated property with me.   I guess my problem is that I forget my mother with dementia is not the person I want her to be….kind loving enthusiastic fun and reliable.   Instead, she has dementia .  Before she got sick, she only parented me until about 12. She was rude, disagreeable, argumentative, cold emotionally, and never got counseling or therapy.  She is now the original woman - not very nice or easy to love - who now has dementia.   That’s reality.   It’s been hard for my dad and I. I hold a lot of resentment towards her now. As an adult I came to see my reality as a child for what it actually was, and find it impossible to imagine myself ever treating my own children the way she treated me.    Dementia in my mother… is severe paranoia, aggression, instability, unpredictability, forgetfulness, sun downing, repetitive negative thinking patterns, irritability, flight of ideas, falling, and non-regular sleeping patterns.  She does however still have a lot of capability. She can make her and my father dinner every night, write checks to pay her mortgage, call people, feed her cat, use FaceTime, mow the lawn, drive to the airport.     So it had become really difficult for me to determine where my mothers personality ends and the dementia begins. It’s like a slow fade out process. Every six months she has a steep decline. Then will stable out for a while then decline rapidly again. The frustrating part is in between she can function to a degree due to day but she has become a disagreeable mean and aggressive paranoid person.   I feel like a monster for my wavering ability to tolerate her and remind myself that she does not have control over the physiological process her brain is going through.   On Sunday night we had a fight, then made up, then fought again, then made up all in the span of about two hours. I should have known better not to engage with her at night.  She has sun downing but also gets more aggressive and irritable and violent at night. I had been drinking some wine to cope with the stress of them being there.    All of a sudden - mid conversation about some trash I found while excavating the beach house backyard - it was like a switch in her brain flipped.     She started telling me that I lied to her and that she doesn’t trust anything I say and that I hate her and that I think she is an awful person …and on and on. She got in my face yelling, her expression twisted up with anger and aggression.   And I snapped.   I screamed at her that I hated her and she was ungrateful. I pushed her back away from me. She got scared and called for my dad. I Threw and smashed a wine glass on the floor in front of her, and chucked a pillow and water bottle. She was startled.   I took a step back from her, realized what I did, tried to slow down my heart rate and decrease the adrenaline in my body. I burst into crying. I removed myself from her. Went into my bedroom, sat on the bed crying uncontrollably. Then called 911.   I scared myself. I told them it wasn’t an emergency but I just couldn’t do this anymore and I wanted the police to come to the house.   I guess it was to protect her from me snd me from myself. They asked if I had been drinking? I said yes. They asked if I was on drugs? I told them no. They asked if I had any weapons in the house? I said no I’ve never owned a gun and no weapons. They asked if I was around my mother? I told them no I separated myself from her.    Within a few mins there were two cop cars outside my house with two female officers. I talked to one in my bedroom and explained what had happened. I told them I scared her. I pushed her away from me. I told her she has dementia and I snapped. I lost it and I couldn’t do it anymore and I wanted to be away from her.   They ended up bringing me to a motel in town with my dog. I brought my pillow and a blanket, some pajamas, dog food, dog leash and some treats, my toothbrush and contacts case. The motel was right down the street, but just being away from my mother made me feel horrible and relieved…all at the same time. I eventually passed out in the motel room. Woke up, made sure my father and mother were on the road back to their home and I got an Uber back to the beach house.   Now I’m writing this because I feel like a monster and I needed to get it out of me. It’s traumatic and every time my mother has visited me here in this beach house in the past couple years before this, something has always happened. She locked us out of the house once, got lost in a beach parking lot, started an argument with a random woman in a park I took her to.  The list goes on.   I feel like a monster saying this, but I really hate her. I hate her dementia.  But I also don’t like the woman she was before the dementia so it makes it even harder for me to tolerate her now.   I don’t know what I’m going to do.    I do have a therapist appointment , a woman I used to see who happens to work with families of people with Alzheimer’s . She has some really good insight and made me feel less alone.   Thank you for reading this if you got to the end. I hope I’m not a bad person. I don’t think I am. I am in the medical field and I love helping my patients and caring for people. It’s what brings my life meaning and purpose and I love my job (when I’m not unemployed in my career field). But when it comes to my own mother and her mean and aggressive behavior with dementia and our past mother daughter relationship…..I feel evil and bad for not being more understanding. I feel awful about myself and don’t want her to be in my life like this.	0

"Hi everyone-  I'm posting this here as well in hopes of getting as many opinions as possible.  My Papa (mom's stepdad) is quickly deteriorating into the grips of dementia. It's very sad to see. He has two labrador retrievers. They are both 11 years old, overweight, and arthritic. Papa does not want to pay for the medication that could help them live more comfortably (arthritis meds), nor does he want to pay for diagnostic visits when they get sick (this was a recent occurrence with one of the dogs), nor does he want to pay for euthanasia (I do not believe either of them need to be euthanized).  I suspect he is overfeeding them, forgetting to let them out (they are having accidents in the house), and giving them table scraps. The other day, he forgot he only had 2 dogs and thought he lost one when he let them outside (thought he had 3).  My husband and I have a farm with tons of space. We have offered to take the dogs in. My mom attempted to have this conversation with Papa, but from what I understand that didn't go very well and Papa got angry about it. However, the other day when one of the dogs was ""ill"", he asked Mom if we were still open to taking them. Apparently, in his dementia-riddle mind, we can have them if they are sick, but not if they are healthy (or as healthy as they're gonna get at this point).  I explain all of this to say: I feel he shouldn't be the caregiver of these animals anymore. But I also don't know how to go about getting them out of his care. Does anyone have any advice for how to do this? Or am I way off base?  Thank you in advance."	0
hey yall. around my early teens my grandma had begun showing signs of dementia around the time she was trying to become a us citizen. after a while my entire immediate family saw what was coming. at this particular moment she no longer consistently remembers me or my brother's name. in short i feel as if one of the people who raised me and gave me a lot has been subject to fate much worse than death. this has been difficult to process and take for obvious reasons as its like watching a death in slow motion and i wanted to just rant about it SOMEWHERE.	0
My 87 y/o Mom w/mixed Dementia has started sleeping about 19 hours a day. She does have a mild cold but the sleeping started just before the cold. Should I let her sleep? Should I try to keep her up? Is this end stage? Anyone experience this with their loved one?	0
My mom has recently started getting up in the middle of night (3 or 4am is my best guess) to try and walk 'home'. My dad and I are starting to get worried because the same police officers keep finding her and walking her back, and at some point they might call in APS and they'll take her.  I've read a bit about disguising the door and installing extra locks, but I was wondering if anyone's had success with other methods?	0
"So my dad is 75, diagnosed with general dementia about 3 years ago. He has recently regressed where his iPhone is too difficult for him. I've done my best to remove most of the apps and turn on various accessibility features.  However, he still manages to turn on airplane mode, turn off the volume, turn on do not disturb mode, etc. Today, he's officially ""lost"" his phone, aka he hid it somewhere in his paranoia and is now saying it never worked 🙄. I really wanted a phone that I could dumb down for him, and found this:  https://www.razmobility.com/solutions/memory-cellphone/?ref=9  Honestly, I'm so happy I found this! It gives me the power via a laptop to control his view and settings, while still allowing him to be independent.   Has anyone used this phone before?"	0

"Hi everyone!  There is a new helpline for a pre-bereavement charity in the UK which I think could be really helpful for anyone in need of a little extra support surrounding terminal illness/end of life.  The Anne Robson trust give support to anyone facing the end of their own life (if you're terminally ill yourself), people dealing with the upcoming death of a loved one (terminally ill family members), and also people who work in environments with people who are dying/at the end of life (nurses and care staff for example).  They'll talk through anything and everything surrounding dying, and I think they're particularly useful for those moments where you're struggling to cope and you just need to talk through your feelings with someone who will listen (and help you find ways of coping with your specific situation, if that's what you need).  Taken from their website: **""The helpline number is 0808 801 0688. The service is confidential, free to call, and operates Monday to Friday between 12 – 6pm""**  Their website has more info: [www.annerobsontrust.org.uk](https://www.annerobsontrust.org.uk)  I hope that this might help someone who needs it!

So I'm looking for advice, I am fairly unexperienced with dementia and alzheimers and I have just accepted a job as a chaplain in a hospital, 20% of my time will be spent in a seniors home that is attached to the hospital. Most of the seniors home residents have varying stages of dementia.  I only start the job in a few weeks so I am trying to gather resources while I have some free time. I am finding a lot of research on music and using familiar music to help seniors engage, I do play guitar a bit so I am planning on maybe learning a few old hymns and stuff like that (the seniors home is in a small bible belt town).  What are some things you've learned about this disease that would be helpful for a caregiver?	0
My mother is 91, with Alzheimer's. We've never had any easy or close relationship. Last week my dad, her husband of 70 years died.   While I was crying (at the palliative care when he died) and holding her she said that my grief and feelings didn't matter, only hers mattered. A lot of other unkind things as well.  Last month she flat out said I was a mistake, not even an accident.  All of it rings true. She would have been happier without children and she stopped parenting me when I was 7.   Is it the Alzheimer's speaking or has the Alzheimer's just removed her filters and releasing her true feelings?  It hurts so much.	0
Hi all, I just wanted to introduce myself and our situation. We started noticing some things about my MIL 2-3 years ago, and she recently got tested and diagnosed with Alzheimer's dementia. There's significant history in her family   We're in the early stages of discussing options for her and her husband going forward. I'm thankful there's a community here that I can come to for questions as they arise.  Right now we're trying to get them to accept in home care. They live at a facility that allows residents to move from their condos into assisted living and their nursing home facility. They wish to stay in their condo as long as possible.  I'm going to be scrolling through here to see what kind of treatments and suggestions you ask have been throwing around and really get acquainted with add much as possible.	0
Video chatting help- for my dad with alzheimers.  I just bought a nest hub max for him so we could hopefully video chat for a few mins a day.  But it seems a little too difficult for him to use.    Is there a device that just has pictures of family members on the home screen and then all he has to do is click on the picture of who he wants to chat with? Or does anyone know a better solution?  Thanks!	0
Hello,  Im not a member of this comunity but I would like some advise from people who know the desease. My grandpa has Alzheimer and is coming to his final stages. My uncle who visits him regurlaly informed everybody yesterday that he wont have long anymore. Now my father has no bond with him due to my grandpa being a heavy alcoholic most of his life. Since my grandmother past away around 2000 the contact has gotten less and less. For me to because he was always drunk and not really gave us any love.   When my son was born I visited him with my dad in the nursery home and that was okay. He was nice and not drunk for the first time in my life. My dad moved to Portugal soon after and I haven't visited him on my own. Before my dad left he gave me a present from my grandpa. It was a little wooden house that I used to play with at my grandparents house when my grandmother was still alive. I didnt even know he still had it or that he knew it was something I would like to have. It made me very emotional cuz it made me feel like maybe he did pay some attention when I was a kid. At first I wasn't able to visit do to COVID and then because of having no transport to the home. Maybe I also didnt feel like putting in much effort beacause I already have other things Im in therapy for.  Now I feel like I should visit him and pay my last respect to him. I dont want him to die knowing I didn't visit him. That leads to my question. Will he know? Will he know I did not come and say goodbye? My uncle says he does have some clear moments. Plus I also believe that when you die your soul gets released. (I dont what I believe what happens with it after that tho). So Im really torn. Im also afraid it will be a unplessand experience for myself since now I will only remember that one nice last visit and the gift he gave me. I dont know what to expect...   Please share your wisdom and advise.	0
My grandma is in mid-late stage Alzheimer’s, and is mostly bed bound. My mom and aunt take care of her. I’m a 20 year old college student, and I avoid being around her a lot because it’s heartbreaking to see her suffering. Part of me wishes she would pass now, because ‘herself’ is already gone, and I know she’s probably going to suffer like this for years. I feel like a monster for wanting to let her go, or for ‘accepting’ her death. ‘She’ is gone, only her body remains alive. I feel so callous for saying this. I don’t have the natural motherly instinct, I’m not a loving person, I’m very blunt. I don’t know how to care for her. I’m going to hell anyway, I just want to see if anyone else feels the way I do.	0
My dad has Alzheimer's and I don't know how I feel.  I'm scared because I don't have kids and am worried when I do, he won't know who I am.  I'm worried that something will happen to him and my mom won't be there when it does.  I'm worried that I haven't said enough to him; I haven't told him I love him enough, I haven't.....But I also feel like I'm being selfish because I'm not the one living with him, my mom is, so why do I get to be upset?  Also what happens now?  I just don't know what to say.  But I'm scared, I know that.  I'm also angry.	0
My maternal grandmother is in the late stages of Alzheimers; yesterday we were told she would be gone within several weeks, and today we were told it would be more like hours. My dad isn’t in the picture and neither are my mom’s siblings; it’s just me, my brother, our adult cousins and their mom. What can I do for my mom? What will she need from us? Thanks for any advice!	0
"Hi pals.  I just found this awesome group and read some messaged to know if the right place to ask the question that i want to shoot.  My mom has been ""affected"" with Alzheimer, she is 62, but this behavior have started about 6 years ago (she faced some big working issues at the same time her father passed away). Doctos was not sure about the name if this illness because she was very young, and on the beginning was not going fast, and he was just forgetting little things (she has one of the best memories that i have ever seen, she remember the Document of all their clients and the monetary status of each one of them - she was accountant).     These days, her manual mobility has been affected and she can not recall normally words used all days, she use to ask the same question over and over again when like 30 minutes have passed... The problem is that she always has been very curios and wanted to know everything.... We have tested with cannabis and with formal treatments, but we see no change.   My father is dealing with her, by taking her to the doctor when she has an appointment and helping her with daily activities, and managing his business as well.   I am full time worker  and finishing my Engineer degree to leve the country asap (living in Argentina) and trying to convince my father to come with me.  I have spoken lot of times with my father to hire someone to take care of my mom, or at least some  therapist contention for him, because he is maddest every day with all this crap.     Do you happen to have some advice for me to push the person who is taking care of her to start with psychologist or something?  &#x200B;  Thanks, and sorry for the long post.  Alex"	0
"Any suggestions on how to get help with caregiving ?    I only have 1 brother who is battling cancer right now so I have to take care of my mother 100% of the time.   I have my own business that I can work from home for right now.  I just get worried that hiring someone my mother will not be comfortable and / or nervous they screw up something with her 15+ meds, etc.  My mother has several medical issues (heart, kidney, etc) and seems like she is ""sick"" with an issue nearly every week."	0
My grandma with Alzheimers wont stop banging on the door few times an hour all afternoon. Whenever we ask what she needs she’ll just say i didn’t bang on the door. Has anyone else been through this? We give her sleep gummys in the evening and thinking about giving her some after lunch as well. I just worry it’ll affect her sleep at night if she takes a nap in the afternoon. Thank you in advance.	0
Hi everyone . With the approval this week, we are very hopeful for this drug. But does anyone know more about if it’s actually possible/going to be affordable to get? My dads is in a position where he would qualify as the perfect candidate for the medicine and like most people I’m willing to try anything if it means working against this memory loss. Thanks for any info !	0
Hi there- as the title states, my mom with Alzheimer’s is not compliant with treatment. I’m not sure if this stems from her time as an RN staffing a memory ward in her younger years or what. She gets almost combative when we try to get her to go to her neurologist, when we do get her to one, she finds some reason or another to dislike them and therefore not trust them or their treatment. My mom refuses to take her medication because it makes her “spacey” and is unable to care for herself. My dad, her caretaker, works out of town full time most days of the week and I have a job where I work 60+ hours a week. I don’t know how to help manage her care. How do you get your loved one to a doctor? I understand it is her choice to receive treatment but at this point it impedes on our life and ability to care for her. Anything helps.	0
My grandpa is 81 and has been progressing through the stages for a while now, probably 5-7 years. (Sorry my timeline is a little screwed up) I’m not sure what stage he’s in but it’s getting very bad. My whole life I had NEVER seen my grandpa get mad, or frustrated at anything.   Nowadays he’s always mad at people and his communication skills are basically non existent. I go to his house atleast 4 days a week to help with things around the house (and I spend 2 nights a week there for easier commuting) or whatever because i park the car I use to driver for uber at his house.  He does nothing all day except sit in his recliner, or stare out the window for hours. I bring my dog over to his house during the week so he has some company, it seems to have made him a lot happier as he LOVES animals.  Every time I see him it’s always the same basic questions over and over and over.. “Can I get you anything to drink?!” “You’re going to work?” “Where do you work?” “What do you do?” “Where do you live?”  He has asked me if I wanted a drink 5 times in 1 minute before. And him asking the same question 2-3 times in a minute isn’t uncommon EVERY TIME I GO TO THE KITCHEN TO GET SOME WATER OR WHATEVER. I often find myself not eating or not drinking because I don’t want to go downstairs and have to explain what cup I’m getting, that I want ice in my water, I’m hungry so I need a piece of toast, just stupid shit.  He will freak out if he sees me outside (which I often am) because he will think I’m a burglar or something. He’s a EXTREMELY paranoid, he thinks people are watching him whenever the windows are open. And he thinks there are burglars EVERYWHERE.   For example: A car stops a little bit down the street for more than a minute. OHNO OHNO THEYRE GOING TO ROB US CLOSE THE WINDOWS!!  I guess the part I need help with the most is how to deal with the constant questions. He never understands my answers, I have to explain things more than you would with a 3 year old, and then if he miraculously understands me, he just forgets 2 seconds later.  Today absolutely broke my heart...he was telling me some simple story in the most complex way that my dog heard my car and knew I was outside. I said “oh haha yup” and walked in the other room because someone was calling my name. He then storms in the other room yelling about how I’m so rude and I walked away from him before he could finish talking. “Grandpa I heard you” “Oh ya?! Then what the hell did I say?!” (I then repeat what he said word for word) He then says  “No you didn’t hear me say that because I didn’t say it yet!!!” *extreme anger  “Grandpa then how did I know what you were going to say?” *extreme confusion “I dont know...”  Please any words of advice or encouragement would help a lot. I’m struggling so badly seeing the one vibrant, interesting, loving grandpa who was more of a father to me than my father ever was.  Going to work everyday knowing I’m going to have to see him like that breaks my heart. He’s hardly the person he used to be and watching him deteriorate right in front of my eyes is agonizing. But I know I can’t just put him in a home and forget about him.  Thank you.	0
My 74 year old mother has alzheimer's and has been living with me for about a year and a half. I work full time and take care of her when I'm not at work. We have a little outside help - just enough to barely scrape by. Her needs for care are increasing and my availability isn't. I want to find a live-in caregiver to assist her full time 5 days a week. l am having a very hard time finding out how to get through all the red tape of minimum wage/overtime/sleep requirements. Agencies charge too much, I want to do a private hire. If you live in California and have a live-in caregiver, please message me! How did you figure out what to pay them? Are you following the rules or doing cash under the table? Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.	0
He’s been way more forgetful then normal lately and I think from my perspective I’m feeling more sure about being some form of Alzheimer’s or dementia. I think it would be inappropriate to not take action.   But I have no idea how to have the conversation. Any articles, YouTube videos, books, or personal experience that you found helpful that you could share would be immensely appreciated.	0
So my dad has symptoms of dementia since the last few years. No short term memory left, needs help with simple tasks, problems remembering words. He’s going for a memory test soon and I’m really worried how he will react. He’s always been super independent, in charge and in control. He will not be able to drive soon and going places with my mom is his only hobby. Are there any resources or suggestions to help deal with the impact of this diagnosis?	0
My mother is dying of dementia. She fell and busted her head open and they don't believe she is waking up. She has maybe hours to a couple days left. She is 5 hours away from me. I have watched my mom fade away slowly over the last 8 years and when we put her in a home I hugged her saw her smile for the last time and I told her I loved her and told her goodbye. I feel like my mother's spirit has been gone a long time and I don't want to see her like this. My extended family is trying to tell me that I should but I don't know..is it wrong to feel this way? Should I go?	0
My mother ended up in the hospital last weekend and was released Monday to my aunt's care. She has power of attorney and decided hospice care would help with costs. Met my mom's caretaker today and went through meds. Zyprexa, tramadol, and lorazepam are all she's on. Every 4 hours and they want to increase to every 2. Pretty sure they're trying to kill my mother. Anyone else have any experience with these meds or situation?	0
Who would admit them to a nursing home? Who would manage their finances and pay for the nursing homes if they are no longer able to do it themselves? How would they be protected from being taken advantage of financially or otherwise?	0
Does anyone know what one can expect from Medicare when it comes to in-home hospice.  Right now we have a day-aide and a night-aide.  Up until now my parents were able to use walkers to get to the toilet.  While they needed assistance to use the toilet they could stand up and turn around and sit down as needed (even if it was with a bit of help and/or coaxing).  Now they are both completely unable to stand up.  To get them up there needs to be one person on each side holding their arms  to prevent them from falling down.  This have become practically speaking bed-bound.  I think they are now ready for hospice care.  It's impossible for one aide to care for them as they used to be cared for.  Does anyone know what kind of assistance Medicare Hospice can provide?	0
"My grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in June of last year. I had started taking care of her last February when she couldn't remember how to pay her bills or order her groceries online anymore (she had stopped driving 2 years earlier as she didn't feel confident operating her car any longer.) She was calling me at all hours of the day and night, so I was able to submit a claim to her long term care insurance and began in-home care for her 8 hours a day, every day to help her with food prep and remind her to take her medication as she had missed doses for about 3 months but wouldn't admit it.   I found a care facility that offers memory care, and the place is lovely with really great staff. She moved in in December, staff says she's really flourishing. However, she frequently accuses me of ""imprisoning her against her will"" which is frankly untrue, she signed all the documentation to move it, visited with me multiple times before move in, she's even the one that asked me to find a facility in the first place. Now she's saying that she didn't sign anything, and that she doesn't belong there. I know telling dementia patients they have dementia isn't the way to explain things to them, but my dad snapped at her and told her she has dementia to which she replied that she wanted to see documentation of the diagnosis that we procured without her seeing a doctor. I explained to her that she did go to the doctor and I was there with her when she got the diagnosis.   Mostly I'm looking for advice on how to counter or change the conversation when this happens. She really believes in her heart that I've locked her up and that she was doing just fine at home ""by herself"" and that her diagnosis was falsified by me, which wasn't at all the case. I don't know what it is about the situation but I always end up crying when she lashes out and says I ""should be ashamed"" of myself. I know I did what's right for her, but I still feel guilty and I want to be able to have a conversation and relationship with her."	0
 My moms finds it funny to tell my grandma that her sister died. She just repeats it a bunch of times. My grandma talks abt moving back to her home town and my mom doesn’t want her too- so my mom will tell her that the senior living hone she wants to move to caught in fire which is kinda harsh. She will also tell my grandma that her friend from her hometown died.. my mom said she does this so my grandma stops talking abt moving back but my mom seems to find it entertaining / funny and I think she wants to see my grandmas reaction  . My grandmas friend and sister did not die but my moms says it as an excuse for y my gma can’t leave and than my mom laughs   My mom is with her all day so I’m sure she’s stressed sometimes & I guess with dementia my grandma will forget anyways- but it’s just obnoxious of my mom  I guess my grandma can be a handful but my mom can just start getting snappy and being like “remember I told you 1000000” times today to my grandma	0
Never realized my dad was losing anything cognitive wise. He’s always been straight forward and on point until a couple months ago. He told us (mom and I) he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2011. He’s degraded physically pretty bad the past few months.  All I’ve got to say is watch out for your parents/grandparents	0
"So I'm 14 years old and my dad has alzheimers. I'm keeping an eye on him this morning because my mom is at work. A few minutes ago he started whispering ""I just wanna die"" over and over again. I guess he didn't realize that I was nearby and could hear him until I asked if he wanted to watch a different show. I'm freaking out and I dont know if I should tell my mom or not. I feel like it would break her heart and make her feel like she isn't doing a good job as his caretaker. She does so much these days and is always stressed out, I really dont want to make things worse for her."	0
My grandmother and my great aunt died from Alzheimer's.   My aunt has the genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's, so I wanted to know if I did.   I do.   I have borderline personality disorder and major depressive disorder. I am fully aware of how I will probably start to behave once I start going downhill. (If I start. I understand that a genetic predisposition does it mean you'll definitely get it.)  I can't put my daughter and my husband through that.  I want to set it up so that I can get physician assisted suicide if I am diagnosed with Alzheimer's. It is not legal in my state.  Does anyone have experience with setting this up or helping someone else set it up? I just have some questions about it.	0
Hi all,  I was referred here by a mod from another sub. My mum was diagnosed with early stage Alzheimer's on Monday. We're all still trying to come to terms with it. She's only 52 and while I'm glad it isn't anything worse I'm devastated that this is the diagnosis. Being so young she's being referred to clinical trials and she's starting a supplement strongly recommend by her neurologist called Souvenaid.   I guess I'm just looking for advice on how to cope with it and how to help my mum as best I can. My 1 y.o daughter and I live with her and my dad as well as my sister.   I appreciate any advice that you guys may have for us.  Thank you 💕  Edit - I just want to say thank you to everyone who commented.  Mum and dad have an appointment to get POA sorted on Thursday. We wanted it sooner but mum just wanted to digest things first. I'm already in therapy and I had a session two days before the diagnosis. I'll be having another session shortly. I'll be asking our GP (he sees both my parents, my mum's mum, myself and my daughter) if he can offer therapy as an option to mum. I'm going to try and get her access to the NDIS which is a government disability service in Australia. I'm already on it with my mental health. My parents are lucky to be able to afford things as we need it. My dad has inherited money from a couple of relatives who passed and as morbid as it is I'm beyond grateful he did because they're going to need it. The Souvenaid is about $1300 a year alone.   This is taking a toll on everyone. Lots of tears were shed as we'd all hoped it was from the trauma of losing our family dog in 2016 and her having a car accident in 2019. The more I thought about it the more I realised this diagnosis was a long time coming. I noticed the changes in 2016, but again just chalked it up to our family dog passing away because she was in her late 40's still.  And for everyone who has had a loved one or has a loved one with this I am so sorry you've been through or are going through this or both ❤️	0
So my dad has Alzheimer’s. He lives with my mom and they take care of each other, but his short term memory and decision-making abilities(which he never really had) are completely shot. Last week he asked me to fix his computer because it seemed to have viruses.  I got the computer, and sure enough it was full of malware because he’s been going to very shady porn websites, and just clicks on whatever he sees. He also was friends with a ton of bots/scammers on social media and has been chatting with them. Finally, he has been going to hook up sites to try to meet strangers. The rest of his time he spends reading fake news designed to make people angry (think Qanon.)   Unfortunately talking to him about safety doesn’t work, he agrees to whatever we say, but then just does it anyways once he’s alone. We don’t want to take his computer away, because that’s all he does with this time, and that’s basically how he spent all day every day for decades. My mom doesn’t know much about computers and is overwhelmed, so she’s not really able to keep track of what he’s doing.  So far we’ve taken away his access to mom‘s financials, and I installed some antivirus and monitoring software so I could block the most dangerous looking websites. I also blocked the bots on his Facebook and changed his settings so only mutual friends can send a friend request. I made my mom the administrator on his computer so only she can approve program installations. Monitoring all of his Internet use is exhausting and distressing, but it doesn’t seem safe to let him roam freely at this point.   Any tips about Internet safety for people with dementia? Also, I’d love to get him off browsing the web, but he says he’s bored and that’s all he likes to do. Any ideas of activities/hobbies for someone that loves intellectual stimulation but is losing his intellect?	0
 FDA is supposed to rule on Biogen's treatment around June 7th. I don't believe Biogen's treatment, aducanumab, will receive FDA approval on the next round due to too many gaps in, and too small a test population in its current phase testing. I, however, strongly believe that Cassava Sciences' (SAVA) treatment will get approval because of its test population and continued track record of safety and efficacy. However it goes, these treatments will continue to put a spot light on Alzheimer's Disease and the FDA's need to work with these companies to get to a result in the near term. AD is the next pandemic and treatments must be viewed as critical solutions.	0

Hi there,  I'm a 27 year old who (along with my sister) have been caring for our father who has suffered with early-onset dementia for several years now.      I have been looking into the two week isolation period for residents that has just been scrapped by the Gov for 'low-risk' visits. This is obviously very welcome news, as I can't imagine my own father having to undergo two weeks of isolation when he is as ill as he is.     However, the rule does still exist for those who have been in hospital. I was wondering if there was anybody in the community who had something to say on this, I'm looking to gather information on it to raise awareness. Thanks!	0
Hi all, seeking some help or just opinions/experiences y’all had with dealing with family member suffering from Alzheimer’s and aggression.  My dad has Alzheimer’s for almost 2 years (could be longer, but it was officially diagnosed about 1year and 9 months). Lately in the last 2/3 weeks, he’s been a lot more aggressive (Cursing, shouting, spitting out food, swinging and lashing out at family and the caretaker). This is especially a lot more often when trying to bathe him or wash his face. But otherwise, it seems like every other minute he’s hissing, snarling and yelling out his intent to “kill you all”(in his words)  While I’m not too concerned about his murderous intent, it’s more of him lashing out (think punching, scratching etc.) at the caretaker that I feel is unwarranted since she’s not a family member.  He keeps this up throughout the day till he eventually sleeps. And it tends to get worse at night, where he acts out and tries to escape. He’s in a geriatric bed with a safety vest with a harness to ensure he can’t get out but still allows for mobility. (He’s a fall risk since he has trouble with walking and has fallen before, when we didn’t have the bed then and lapses happened during the night when no one woke up to support him when he does his nightly walks, when he could still walk around alittle)  It’s getting to the point where it’s affecting the lives of everyone since even though he’s in the bed with the harness, at night he screams out every other minute..etc. And no one ever sleeps well and it affects me and my brother since we tend to miss meetings (even from home, thanks to covid) or things slip up at work due to exhaustion (I was recently given off from work to get some rest, which is ironic since I hardly ever am able to sleep at home even if I’m given off) since we spend hours just trying to pacify him. Mum is a non factor here, as she left our lives a long time ago.  Sorry for rambling, but the point I’m trying to state is to understand how peeps are coping with aggression and Alzheimer’s and also, if we send him to a home. How do they deal with it? Do they sedate them? (Is it even ethical to do so, laws might differ country to country)   My brother is not too comfortable with that, although I did tell him it’s a case of “ignorance is bliss”( to a certain extent). If you don’t know, you will probably remember him in a better light rather than tainting your memories of him with his lashing out and violent outbursts.  Would greatly appreciate your input here, thank you all. Dad is currently taking memantine for Alzheimer’s and quetiapine for his outburst.	0
My mother, who only turned 65 a month ago, is suffering from stage 6 Alzheimer’s and likely has < 12 months before our final farewell.   I don’t know if it’s good or bad, but the Pixar movie “Coco” has been on my mind recently. Ive been listening to the soundtrack with my family (especially. 2 young kids) and Remember Me… man.. is there any song that is both depressing and hopeful at the moment?	0
my grandma has been changing recently. she is 73. she’s been getting a bit confused, mixing up words, having panic attacks/intense mood swings out of nowhere, rocks back and forth, shows behavior of paranoia, and said she hates the evenings.   i’m not sure if this relates to alzheimers, but i’m trying to consider all options. i don’t really know what’s going on. this has all happened in about 1-2 months.	0

Hello, I am 21 and currently live at home. my mother has been diagnosed with early onset ALZ. I am going to university about a hour away, and am moving in with my boyfriend but planning on coming home to work and stay with my family every weekend. My mom is 56 and it has been terrible for my family coming to terms with this and watching her change with nothing we an do. She can no longer wash her hair properly and can't drive, she also doesn't paint anymore, and that was her passion. It hurts me a lot being with her because I notice that she isn't the same mom I grew up with. I feel really bad being away from her too though. I am really worried about not being home as often and missing the good parts of her life, as we don't know how quickly this will progress. I am just so scared and don't know exactly what to do. it has been causing me immense depression and anxiety as well as mental breakdowns. Does anyone have any advice, or have been in my situation as a young person who has a young parent with ALZ? I feel like I can't talk to her or my family about it because they're all going through it as well and are equally as upset, if not more. I don't want to hurt them more. I am also fearing that I will get this horrible disease when I am older but I feel guilty for thinking about myself right now.	0
My mom, 80+ just recently is starting to act a little strange. My older brother noticed this too, during Conversations with her on the phone. Last night she wasn't answering her Alexa and she always did in the past. So I called her phone. She said she heard two women talking and didn't understand them. So she said she wasn't going to answer the Alexa.  I determined it was a TV program she was watching. The Alexa device rings loudly and announces my name. Yet she apparently didn't understand what was going on.  This is the first time I've noticed something like this with my mom. She had always known how to work that thing and had never been confused about anything.  My dad had alzheimers so now I'm thinking maybe she is developing it. I had mentioned to her that maybe her memory is failing and that my brother noticed same thing. She thought it was funny and said she didn't know why she got things mixed up. But it sounded like she was a little sad that I mentioned something like that.  My brother never wants to be honest and tell people they may have issues. Did I do wrong to mention to my mom that she may be having some memory issues?	0
"My mother is trying to make some changes to her and my fathers will.  My father is in a nursing home these days.  She is being told that without his signature she can't alter any part of the will that was signed originally by the two of them.  They are just saying ""you can't change that"".  I believe she has power of attorney since he's in a home (he obviously would just leave the home if he had the power).  So I don't understand how they think he should be able to sign legal documents.    Has anyone else gone through something like this?  I realize this is more of a legal question and you can't really give actual binding legal advice, but maybe we are just missing something.  I wish I could talk to this lawyer myself but I don't want to cause any problems or incur any additional fees.    Thanks!"	0
Has anyone done the spaghetti and meatballs similar to the spaghetti and hotdog thing?  Wondering the best way to do it.

My grandmother has early stages of Alzheimers disease. She is a lawyer, but I am concerned she can no longer handle cases. I tried talking to  her about quitting , but she is very adamant that she can still do it. I don't want to stop her forcefully, but at the same time she can't even organize her documents properly also mixes up reality and dreams. Can you please give me any advice on how to handle this situation? I don't want to hurt her feelings, but also there is a high chance that she screws things badly.	0
Can I suggest to my grandmother's doctor that he check her for dementia and Alzheimers? She may not be far along, or perhaps she is just aging (she's in her 80's), but I'm terribly worried about her.	0
Has anyone joined one, do you find it beneficial? I searched for support groups near me and there are a few listed on the alz.org website.	0
My father is in the mid-stage of Alzheimer's. He's only 67 and has always been my mother's greatest protector but the disease has caused him to not recognize her and can become verbally abusive, despite her best care. I struggle wondering whether or not he should be reprimanded in any way (left alone for an hour or two, ect). He no longer has the capacity to feel remorse for his actions and instead always feels like he is being victimized. We have an extremely close family, all of whom are bending over backwards to help. When he lashes out, I don't know whether or not recounting his poor behavior is worthwhile or if we should just comfort him because he is ill. Any thoughts?	0
Hi, so she's 75 yo, in late stage Alzheimer. She doesn't speak or make face expressions anymore, just utter silence. However she only bite, like when I approach her she grab my arm and bite my elbow(she has dental meal so the bite is not hard) or she tries ro grab my neck and bite my cheeks. She then tries to remove food or saliva and start to rub my elbow gently. I'm curious about this behavior and can't find anything online. Hope someone can give an explanation.	0
I live a far distance from my dad, he is 67 and has never really had the best memory.  He and my stepmom usually don’t let me know if things are wrong medically with them until it is absolutely unavoidable but my step mom dropped a bomb on me this weekend.  Apparently my dad has been getting progressively worse, this weekend he attended a baptism and didn’t know the names of the relatives there and insisted he saw his sister who died last year.  On the way home he instructed my stepmom on the way home but was giving her completely wrong directions even though he has lived in this area his entire life.  When he got home he was insisting that someone was trying to steal his house and sobbed.  My stepmom told me these episodes sometimes are worse at night, that he has emotional outbursts (he has never been prone to cry) and has also started pacing and wandering in the house.  She even told me that when they are out she has to take a portable jug for him to pee in occasionally.  This sounds serious to me and they are just now finally starting to get this looked at.  His mom (my grandma) had Alzheimer’s and I am concerned that is what this is.  Am I just over reacting?	0
Hello,  Found out my cousin's wife has advance Alzheimers in her 40s with 2-3 years life expectancy. He is struggling finding support to help take care of her and based on what he told me isn't maximizing his health insurance/benefits 100% because he doesn't know what he is entitled.   He is under a lot stress and I wanted to help him find resources to get a care taker/nurse and teaches him his rights with California health insurance & disability.  This is just what I got from one hour catching up. I found some resources already for him to contact but wanted to post here to see if fellow redditors may have information/resources specific to Latinos.  Thank you	0
She was diagnosed with early onset about a year ago. Haven’t seen the docs much since the pandemic.   I’m mostly just curious for more information. When I do research on the disease, the focus seems to be more on the memory and less on these other aspects.   Does this suggest a certain type of Alzheimer’s or dementia? Or is just different for everyone?	0
Any ideas for bra shopping for my wife? Clearly new to this so do stores have fitting service? Is there an online option? Thanks	0
My mom has recently taken on taking care of my grandma 24/7. My mom's primary language is Vietnamese, with conversational English. My grandma only knows Vietnamese, maybe some Cantonese if she hasn't lost it yet. I'm not literate in Vietnamese at all.   I'm looking for resources and support groups in Vietnamese to send to my mom. She doesn't know anyone else in her situation, and I think she would benefit from learning about how to deal with my grandma's hostility and confusion better. I know I can put things through Google Translate, but it would be nice if she could navigate the website on her own in Vietnamese instead of me sending her a bunch of links since she's not the best with tech. I think a support group would go a long way since she's pretty alone in the situation now, and has anxieties about developing dementia herself since my great-grandma was also affected.   I already found the [alz.org](https://alz.org) Vietnamese site, and a weekly day group near my mom's, but any additional resources and support groups for caretakers would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!	0
Hi. I work with a start-up nonprofit called [Lorenzo's House](https://www.lorenzoshouse.org/), that provides support for families of people with Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease. They have put together a FREE one-day youth camp for kids. This will be a virtual experience, so people can participate from anywhere without having to travel:  >WHAT IS [LORENZO'S YOUTH CAMP](https://www.lorenzoshouse.org/youth-camp)?   **The purpose of Lorenzo’s Camp is to give youth with a parent diagnosed with younger-onset Alzheimer’s a chance to connect with each another and realize we are not alone going through this tough lifestyle. It’s a free-one day youth summit and in the pilot phase this summer of 2021.**   At Lorenzo’s Camp there will be time to bond, share our story if we want, listen to the stories of other kids. There will be time to share our own caregiver ideas and learn from each other. There will be time for raffle prizes, to do cool art, laugh and maybe even heal some. Most important, it’s a time to build an alliance with one another because we are on our similar journey and can help each other.  There will be an info session on June 7 for anyone who might be interested in learning more.	0
"For like 2.5 weeks, I would have to look at my journal for exact dates, but my gma has been getting weak from 4-6 pm. My mother and I have moved her dinner early and I take her for walks(well, rolls, she's in a wheelchair when needed) to get her out the house and get some sunlight. . The past two days, she wants to ""do it herself"". She has a walker and she is ""grown"" lol.  I told my mom to help lift her, but let her think she did it herself. She's gotten some confidence back thinking she's doing it herself, which is good, but now, when she needs help and ask for it, she gets mad. My grandma is a trip. 6+ years now for me. 1.5 for my mom taking care physically. She's still learning.   I do know my gma is happy that my mom and I are here. The other day, she pretty much ignored her other kids(on the phone, who lived down the street and did nothing, yet my mother and I had to move here to take care of her). I'm going to say allegedly, but allegedly, word on the street was they planned on putting her in a home and leaving her so they could wait for her to pass and get her money(they are disgusting people). Surprise when I got here, from a place I loved living and working in, they left. My mom and I are the only ones that have really taken care of her since she was diagnosed. My brother is the only grandchild that calls. Frustrated, but people suck as we learned over the last year.   My gma has talked badly about my mother and I since as long as I can remember. As much as that upset me growing up, I'm glad I can be here for her now."	0
Hello,  I need some advice. My dad has been banging on his bedroom walls late at night. He's also been tapping his dishes with his utensils lately during meals. He doesn't seem agitated when he's doing it and he says he doesn't know why he's doing it either. I think it might be because he's bored, but I'm not sure. Is this fidgeting? I was was thinking of getting a fidget blanket, but I'm not sure if it will help. Any advice is greatly appreciated.   &#x200B;  Thank you	0

"Apologies in advance for the long post. This is half catharsis for me and half cry-for-help. The most relevant parts of this post are the last couple of paragraphs; a lot of the rest is back-story.  My mother started suffering from Alzheimer's in 2015-2016, when she was 71. My father (they've been married over 50 years) has been her primary caretaker during her decline. I moved back in with them a couple of years ago to help out where I can, but he and I are both struggling and in need of some help and suggestions.  I was the first one to notice my mother's cognitive decline throughout 2015-2016. We had a memory test done that did not show any issues, so everyone relaxed about it for the better part of a year, but when it started getting worse, we started pursuing it again and got the crushing news. My grandfather on my father's side also had Alzheimer's in the '90s, so my father has some experience with this, but it's his first time actually living with it 24/7. By the point where we got our ""diagnosis"", my mom was already starting to show confusion about every-day things like the date. My dad did not want her told that she had Alzheimer's, so she has gone through her decline and care without any knowledge that she is suffering from this. He is also adamant that he does not want her put in a nursing home (though in light of the below recent developments, he has started talking to an in-home caretaker as well as a senior ""day care"" facility).  Over the past year and a half or so, my mom has gone through a very sharp decline, both in her mental capabilities and her treatment of her family. My dad is now having a lot of trouble getting her showered and is starting to have problems helping her in the bathroom as well. She has to go very frequently (sometimes several times in an hour), and can't go on her own (she often forgets to pull down her pants/underwear), but when he tries to help, she accuses him of molesting her and refuses to believe that she is safe with her family, or at home. She has become abusive, inasmuch as can be labeled as ""abuse"" with this disease, and has been verbally harassing/attacking my dad with increasing frequency throughout the day, alternating with showing him love and affection. She also sometimes does not seem to process or understand the things we say to her, and has been asking for ""help"" but then cannot articulate what she needs help with, and accuses us of not wanting to help her. She cannot control her urges to stand up and walk around and wander, and then tells us how badly her knees or back are hurting. We haven't been able to get through to her that she needs to rest and that her frequent walking around is contributing to her pain.  My dad, who is extremely sensitive and has had anxiety issues for a long time, is struggling under this burden and his interactions with her are sometimes not constructive. He often reminds her of something they've seen or done together and follows it up with comments such as, ""Don't you remember?"" or ""We've been through this X times today."" He has a lot of trouble not taking the cruel things she says personally, and his frustration often comes out when she does something ""wrong"" (his tone and mannerisms will be very clearly annoyed or frustrated or stressed out). I think these behaviors are causing my mom to emotionally associate him/his presence with feeling berated or attacked, and are degrading her relationship with him more than it would otherwise. Unfortunately, when I've tried to bring up this concern with him, he gets defensive and tells me I need to be more empathetic of what he's going through, or tells me I don't know what he's enduring because my mom tends to respond better to me and trust me more than she does him. I've tried to convince him to go to a therapist or support group to learn coping mechanisms and strategies, but he has been resistant to this. I believe he is already on antidepressants, along with both of them being on a whole pharmacy's worth of other prescriptions and supplements, but I'm very worried about his mental health.  I'm looking for suggestions on how to make my mom more comfortable and receptive to our help, and any advice that can be given on how to coach my dad to interact more constructively with her. I thank you all greatly in advance for your time reading this and helping out."	0
My father is pretty far progressed in his Alzheimers. Lately, when he hasn't slept (a regular occurrence where he might not sleep for two days straight) he might try to get violent with his caretakers. He's succeeded quite a few times, and today was the first time he's seriously hurt his main caretaker who has been with the family for 8 years now. He punched her hard in the face while she was changing him. She says she cat chew on her left side, but attributes it to swelling. I told her we would cover any medical costs and I like take her to urgent care since I'm afraid he might have damaged her jaw, but she wants to wait it out for now.  Ironically that sudden violent act tuckered him out and he pretty much fell asleep right afterwards.  I've already talked to his doctor about upping his medications before this incident and am waiting for him to call back to see what else we can do, but while I wait for them to call back, I was hoping to get some advice from other people who have experienced the same thing.  My siblings and I are discussing our options right now, though obviously we're waiting to talk to the doctor, but any advice from someone who's experienced this before would greatly help. Obviously, we've never been in this situation before. His caretaker, while adamant that she's okay and she is fine taking care of dad, looked unsure for the first time since I've known her. Frankly, I wouldn't blame her if she finally had to tap out, no matter how much she cares for dad. We have another caretaker, a man, who has been getting the brunt of his violent outbursts, but he barely even bat's an eye when it happens. My brother lives at home and he's usually able to control my dad when he starts to act up, but he can only be there for so much of it. He's stuck in his job until November, but he's considering taking family leave at that point so he can be home to help handle dad.  That's where we're at now. Any advice is appreciated!	0
First time posting here.  My wife has early Alzheimer's or mild cognitive dysfunction.  We recently heard about gamma light and sound therapy to remove amyloid and prevent tau, with light (and sound) flickering at 40 per second.  Not sure if this is the right forum to discuss this since she is very early and lots of posts here seem to be about more severe/later cases.  There is a free app that works on phones with a refresh of 120/sce such as iPhones or iPads.  It's called AlzLive, can download from app store, free or $9.00 a month for enhanced version.  There are also lamps that do it apparently.  Does anyone have experience with this?	0
I'm glad we have a place we can ask questions. I want to thank y'all for being here for me and my family. I've been doing this for 6 years now, so if anyone wants info from me, feel free to ask.	0
I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder at age 16 and has been taking benzos on and off. During my college life I took adderall/concerta for my adhd symptoms. Recently I have noticed I have developed ataxia which I have trouble walking in a straight line or even balancing. I googled prolonged use of benzos can develop ataxia and alzheimer's disease. Now I am very scared and was wondering if ataxia can not be reversed or not. Please shed some light thx.	0
Does anyone take care of someone that gets really scared when alone  ?    My mother who lives with me and has dementia often gets scared when I leave for a few hours.    I leave post it notes and phone # for her to call, but she gets really scred and will start crying not knowing what is going on.  &#x200B;  Any tips how to help with this ?	0
I’m not sure if this is the right place to put this. This is a genuine question I don’t mean to cause harm if I do.   My late grandpa (mom’s dad) lived with me and my family when I was really little, so the memories I have are very limited. I do remember him running out the house and my dad chasing after him. My dad would pick him up and practically drag him back into the house. My grandpa would be screaming and yelling like he was about to get murdered.   My grandfather was also pretty aggressive. He would knock stuff over and yell at everyone.  I was reminded of this memory a little while ago and I’ve been thinking about it ever since. When my dad tells his account of what happens, he makes himself to be the hero. ‘The son in law who cared about his wife’s dad so much that he even embarrassed himself just to make sure he was safe.’ My dad is a narcissist so I know that’s not true.   Is it possible that my grandfather acted this way because of my dads aggression towards him? Is it even right to drag someone into the house against there will even with Alzheimer’s/dementia? Maybe my grandfather felt trapped and was trying to escape.	0
Quick background. My gma is pretty much almost blind, but is still eating well, thank goodness. Looking for a variety of foods for her. If they are in her hand, she'll eat them. If they are not, she forgets and then doesn't eat. Oh and you can't be in the room while she eats. I give her a piece, walk out, and come back in every 2-5 minutes to give hand her more. She does not want to be fed. Any thoughts? We are doing, my chicken dishes, but on a bun, she likes it, but I want to give her some variety for breakfast, lunch and dinner.   TIA	0
My grandma had suffered from the tragic development of Alzheimer's. This led to numerous difficulties and inflicted great frustration. However, it became evident that the only way through this obstacle was to recognize her humanity, and love her for what she still had to offer. Here's a short story capturing the effects of her diagnosis. Would be awesome if ya'll could check it out.

My mom's partner got very, very stressed during lockdown and was dealing with a lot of anxiety and anger through most of 2020 - he'd been furloughed and was home 24/7, and didn't have opportunities to socialize or partake in any activities. He started experiencing memory issues last fall, was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, and put on Donepezil.   He's been taking it for about six months now, but his condition still seems to be deteriorating. He constantly forgets basic things (like his wallet, phone, sometimes his paychecks), and tends to repeat stories constantly while misremembering details. He's also started having tantrums and showing uncharacteristic impulsivity - he'll do things like yell at my mom in front of the neighbors for not fixing him dinner, or randomly start crying and begging her not to leave him. His mood is very up and down, and he seems depressed and withdrawn overall. He also appears to have trouble sleeping, and is constantly awake when he should be sleeping.   We've tried to get him to look after his health more, but he can never stick to it for more than a couple days. He rarely gets exercise, doesn't really socialize, won't engage in any mentally stimulating activity (the main things he does at home is watch TV or polish his car), and won't change his diet (he eats a lot of carbs and saturated fats). I'm worried that he'll develop Alzheimer's within the next year at this rate, especially because he doesn't manage his physical and mental health. It's clear he's declining, and it's hasn't even been a year since he started having memory issues.   Is this how the early stages of Alzheimer's look? Or could it just be MCI combined with stress and poor lifestyle habits?	0
I caught her several times having 5-10 minute conversations with her reflection in the mirror, sometimes even standing in the pitch black bathroom talking to the mirror about the sink. I have asked her who she is speaking to and she says ‘my mom’.   She has even begun speaking in third person about herself....  it’s very creepy	0
First time poster, but just curious if anyone has dealt with an issue like this.    Was looking up a local company to get my chimney cleaned and noticed they have random, casual Alzheimer’s “joke” on their business website. Basically the gist is “If you can’t remember the last time you had your chimney cleaned, you’re either overdue or you have Alzheimer’s. Haha!”  As someone who has had their family deeply impacted by this, I was shocked and kind of gut punched. How has no one noticed this? Why is that attempt at humor still up there? Disheartening.  Who knew I’d get so steamed this morning looking at chimney cleaning services?  I called them out with a Google review, but basically I really just wanted to vent to this wonderful group and see if anyone ever had similar experiences. Thanks.  The page with the “joke” on it: https://www.chimneymonkey.com/service/chimney-sweep/   My Google review is their most recent. Hopefully they respond soon to say they have removed it.  UPDATE - I called them out on a few channels, and they have since changed the language to remove the joke. I’ll take it!	0
I know that Alzheimer’s has 7 stages. I’ve googled a lot about the different stages and I think my grandmother is between 4 and 6.  She sleeps mostly during the day, and is awake wandering around the house throughout the night. She thinks it’s morning when it’s night. She’s extremely paranoid that we’re all going to leave her. Every time she wakes up, she asks several times if she has to go to her job but she’s been retired since the 1990s. She makes up a lot of wild, elaborate stories that aren’t true. Just recently, she started sundowning and tonight it was the worst. She couldn’t understand why it was so dark, but it was 11 at night. She absolutely could not be convinced it was night time. It’s also becoming increasingly difficult to have a conversation with her because it’s like she just doesn’t understand our words.   She’s well beyond just the memory portion of Alzheimer’s. She can still move around fairly well, but she can’t bathe herself, cook, or drive. Do you think this is still the early-mid stages, or could she be near the end stages? It’s a tough thing to watch and part of me just wants it all to end because I know she’s frustrated and suffering.	0
Sharing a funny story about a friend of mine and his dad.  His mom and dad declined at roughly the same time.  His dad kept asking where the car was after the dad had gotten in the last of numerous accidents and the car was retired from service.  My friend’s dad used to call him every day to ask where he put the car!  This went on and on for many months, and my friend had some amazing coping skills to deal with the calls.    For fun, he made up more outrageous explanations over time for what had happened to the car and where it was... not to be mean but truly to look at the humor of those calls he knew he had to deal with everyday.  The stories went from the norm to the fantastical, the following are examples.     You get the point.  At the end of my friend’s story told each morning, he would explain to his father that the CIA and FBI had already located the car and would return it the next day.  And so, like the movie “Groundhog Day,” rinse and repeat with another creative explanation. 😅	0
First time posting, sorry if it’s too long!! I just need to vent to people who understand, and who maybe can offer some advice or relate in some way.  My dad is 74 and was diagnosed almost 3 years ago. I am 23 and it was right around the time that I first moved out, which makes me feel partly to blame for his mental decline. He raised me as a single parent since I was 5, my mom is an alcoholic who has been in and (mostly) out of my life. My dad and I had a good relationship, but he was more of a friend than a parent and had really bad anger issues, so there was lots of yelling and I felt as though I never had a real parent figure. He chose to have me with an alcoholic woman at 50 after spending his life partying and ending up with no savings for when I arrived. It’s safe to say I resent him for this, though I try not to because he did try his best. Flash forward to now, I’ve been living with him since April 1, 2020. He has gotten so much worse this past year. He can’t make his own meals (doesn’t remember/know how to microwave the food I leave him), doesn’t bathe himself (I have him put a bathing suit on and give him a shower), he doesn’t flush the toilet and/or leaves shit on the seat, takes food out of the fridge and leaves it on the counter, is confused all the time and gets mad at me when I tell him the truth, ie. we sold his car a couple years ago, or our cat passed away (insists I’m wrong or that it’s my fault). He also just talks basically gibberish to me now, usually about what he’s seen on TV, and I feel so guilty because I know he’s lonely but I just can’t Stand to talk to him, it is so frustrating for me to see my only parent like this. He confuses me with his ex wife’s daughter, his sister, or my mom. Every time I’m in the kitchen he asks at least ten times what I’m doing or making “for him” and then when I give him food he has two bites and that’s it. I have to hide my food in the fridge because he will just leave it to rot on the counter. I feel like I’ve had a toddler for the last year and I don’t know how I’ve dealt with it for so long, but now that he is getting really bad I just feel so angry all the time and I have to go to my room and scream into a pillow to keep from yelling at him. This past year has made me so cynical and cold, I love my dad so much, and I feel awful for thinking this, but his death will be a huge relief for me. I feel like I’m going insane. Sorry again for the long post but none of my friends really understand what it’s like dealing with this. Anyways, thanks for letting me vent and any advice is greatly appreciated :)	0

Hi Folks. I've been reading through the posts and I feel for all you, we are in this together! I would love some advice, but just having a place to vent is great as well.  My mother (70) started showing symptoms about a year ago, and it is progressed VERY rapidly. My dad has been great with her, even though they don't have the closest of relationships. I've been making a point to head over to visit and cook dinner once or twice a week, knowing that loneliness is a major factor.  My father has always been stoic and calm, but has started throwing these incredibly uncharacteristic tantrums. From what I've been reading, this could very well be the onset of dementia. I'm worried that living together may be exacerbating his mental decline, but my mom has always been very dependent on him.  I am their only child, and we aren't very close (physically or emotionally) to our small, extended family. I don't have the money for a care facility, nor do I have room in my home. They have a few, dear friends in the area that are essential to their happiness, so I can't buy a place for us outside the city where I can afford the space. This has all happened so suddenly.  On a selfish note, I'm 35 and my career is starting to take off, and I don't think my parents will have the capacity to be proud of my accomplishments. I never knew how much that meant to me...	0
"Hi everyone - my mom is recently diagnosed early stage and is currently enrolled in a clinical drug trial. Taking things day by day, as we're all still processing and adjusting to the diagnosis and what it means.   I've been reading various articles and studies about the possibility of diet playing a role in risk for AD and even seen the Alzheimer's Association post about it recently. My understanding of these theories is that there's a possibility the brain of those with Alz can't metabolize glucose and carbs, so eating those items muddles the brain and doesn't give it proper nutrition. The solution to this in theory is a diet very low in glucose and carbs are high in proteins and fats – allowing the brain to then be in ketosis and able to metabolize the energy it needs to properly function.   When I read about these studies and theories, a lightbulb in my own brain went off, as my mom essentially only eats carbs and glucose and has done so her whole life. She eats very healthy, but what if her brain wasn't able to metabolize the food she was putting in her body even if it was considered ""healthy"" and it has contributed to the Alz? I thought we might as well try shifting her diet to keto as these trials are doing, while she's currently in the drug trial, however of course a keto diet is very difficult to follow properly and even harder when change is difficult for someone with dementia.   Does anyone have insight into these studies or thoughts on this? Has anyone tried something similar with a loved one? I know a generally brain healthy diet can't hurt, but a strict keto diet could really affect her quality of life since it requires a big commitment and makes meal time more difficult, so I'm asking myself if it's worth it. Like I'm sure many of you are, I'm grasping on to any little sliver of hope and given her lifelong diet this seemed logical to me to give it a shot."	0
"Hey all, this is my first ever post on reddit - I searched up this group on a whim after a couple years of feeling intensely isolated with regards to my experience, and am really grateful to have read the stories posted here. This will be a somewhat lengthy post, but I am really hoping that someone will be able to give me some advice.  My dad is 74, and is in the mid-stage of ALZ. His working memory is non-functional - he forgets anything you tell him instantly, repeats himself over and over, has lost his attention span and interest in activities, and gets obsessive over things that are causing him anxiety. He is very withdrawn, doesn't contribute much to conversation as he struggles to follow it, but still has his sense of humour and is happy to see me and be involved in whatever is happening in the house.  2 months ago he took a memory test which he has been taking regularly to chart the progression of his disease (I can't recall the name of the test, sorry), and he scored 15/30. This score indicates that a person is no longer safe to operate a car, and his doctor had him sit a driving test to confirm this, which he failed. His license was suspended, and he has to sit another test with a written component if he wants his license back, which he will not be able to pass.  I live 3 hours away from my parents, and unfortunately can only get down to visit once a month - my last trip down was only a couple of days after this all went down, and he was understandably very upset and was stuck in a loop of: not knowing that his license had been taken -> not knowing -why- his license had been taken -> understanding why, including all the implications - which was deeply, deeply upsetting to watch. My Mum was able to placate him to an extent by buying him a bike so that he was still able to get up to the local shops, and although he was still upset, this seemed to help him accept his situation a little better.  I was ill for a couple weeks around the time I was scheduled to visit the following month, so I missed that visit. My most recent trip down was this past weekend, 2 months after the license revocation, and his disease was advanced noticeably during this time. He is now completely fixated on the loss of his license, but where before he was depressed and had some level of understanding about it, he is now angry, paranoid, and in denial that he is unable to drive. When he asks ""was there some kind of driving test I have to take?"", my Mum tries to explain to him that yes, she has booked him a test for 4 weeks from now and that he will have to take it if he wants to drive again. From that point the loop is: asking why the license was taken -> asking why he had to take a memory test -> not believing my Mum when she tells him that his memory has been failing for some time etc -> becoming angry and implying that he is being lied to -> storming around and slamming things. My Mum is doing her best to remain patient, but she is mentally and physically fatigued from living with these constant loops and repetitions, and is prone to lose her patience, which I know is the wrong thing to do but is completely understandable considering her situation. My Dad no longer seems to realise that he has ALZ, and  clearly feels that he is being abused and manipulated, which makes his baseline anxiety worse.  My question is this: what is the best course of action to try and soothe my Dad when he gets into this particular obsessive loop? I know that in many cases telling the truth is unhelpful, but I can't think of a lie that would both satisfy him and prevent him from trying to drive and getting caught up in the same loop again. This is mostly for my Mum, as she is the person who is dealing with the vast majority of it - any tips or suggestions that would help her to avoid being the focus of his anger would be gratefully accepted.  Happy to answer any questions or provide any clarification.  Thank you very much in advance."	0
After about nine months of a part-time aide and discussing our options for several months, my father (early 70's) was moved into a memory care facility about a week ago. My mom has been caring for my dad for the last seven or so years as his disease has progressed, and he's at the point where being in a facility seems like the right choice (issues with escaping/wandering, getting dressed, hygiene, etc.). Caring for my dad for this long has taken a big mental toll on my mom, not surprisingly.  We were able to get him a room in a facility close to their home that seemed like the best fit of the ones we toured (some virtual, this one in-person by other family members). Now that my mom has visited him in the facility, she thinks he could get better care at home, but it would really require a full time aide at this point. It feels like she's somehow forgotten how difficult and frustrating it is to care for him after only a week of being apart.   There must be a lot of emotions involved with putting your spouse in a facility, but I think she needs to stay the course (at least for a few months) and let herself decompress from the strain she's been under for so long. Does anyone here have advice I can pass along to help her re-frame the guilt she seems to be feeling? I will visit the facility soon, but I just can't imagine that my mom's life will be any better by immediately jumping back into the caregiver role that has consumed her life for almost a decade.  Any words of wisdom would be sincerely appreciated.	0

My grandpa has deteriorated a lot recently and it’s been pretty rough. He moved in with me and my family a month or so ago and there has recently been some issues. My mom thinks I might be his “trigger person.” The other week I came home and walked in and at first he thought someone broke in and messed up our living room but he was otherwise unbothered that I was there. I tried to explain to him that it was my younger brother who is a huge mess maker and had been playing with a close friend earlier that day but he didn’t believe it and didn’t remember my brother. Then he claimed it was me or one of my friends and had issues recognizing me so he walked over to the neighbors house and tried to get them to call my mom because he didn’t trust me. When we got back to our house after he had contacted my mom he locked me out because he didn’t trust me and was going to “let the police handle it.” I understand that it’s not his fault and it’s a disease but it has been really rough. He has been very emotional because his girlfriend of 30+ years passed away a few weeks ago. We are looking into a home but we’re not sure how it’ll go. He thinks that it’s his house and he also has had issues when he tries to feed my dog but we can’t just feed her whatever because she is older and has underlying health issues. It’s just been troubling me for awhile and I just wanted to put it out there I guess. Sorry for the ramble and i know it’s all over the place and hard to follow but I just wanted to know if anyone had similar experiences and how to deal with it? Thank you so much.	0

"He everyone. My dad is 59 and he doesn't have Alzheimers. I've just got a question about it. Your memory slowly getting worse is just something that happens when you get older and that's happening to my dad a little. My question is that when we discuss things like sports, movies, music, sometimes he'll forget the name of a song or an actor or a movie. Like he'll say ""my favourite song from that album is, ugh what's it called?"" Then he'll sing a bit of the lyrics or something. I know what he's talking about so I say the name of the song. There's been quite a few times where he's forgotten the name of something and he's trying to figure it out himself and if I gave him a few extra seconds, he would but I just tell him what he's trying to remember. Is it good to tell him or should I let him figure it out? I'm just wondering if what I'm doing can in anyway lead to problems or if I'm actually helping. Thanks."	0
I’m trying to convince myself it’s time to hire outside help for my mother, because I can’t do it all alone (surprise!) and she misses social interaction desperately.  And I’m prepared to say to her, as bad as it might make her feel, that I want someone around the house while I’m not because I would just feel safer knowing that she’s not alone.  How did your experience go?  Can you share any tips or tricks?  TIA!	0
Hi, I really hope I’m in the right place, and that I don’t sound like a monster.  My grandmother has Alzheimer’s. I’d say it’s mid-stage, and she needs someone at home with her at all times. The symptoms are all textbook, and I won’t go on about how horrible it is.  I’ve lived with her, my mom, and my aunt since I was 6 and I’m 20 now. I’m in college several hours away, but I’m home during the summer. I have very high hopes for my career—I’m a cellist and I’m often very busy with school, but it feels like my home situation is sucking the life out of me, and that my young years are being wasted due to this.  It’s a devastating disease to watch, and I do not have the emotional capacity to deal with this. I love my grandma, and I always will, but she’s not really here anymore. I’ve been emotionally preparing myself for what’s to come for years now. I never know what I’ll come home to each semester.   I want to move away from home permanently and get on my feet, because my career and my hopes and dreams are so important to me. My aunt is retired (and an alcoholic) and my mom is unemployed, and I have no other family. I want to save my mom and myself and live a peaceful life. It’s hard on my mom’s mental health; she can barely function. It sounds so awful and selfish, but I’m just so young and I want to enjoy my life. My childhood was extremely traumatic; my mom and I were both abused by my dad. My mom doesn’t deserve to live like this either. I wish someone could just save me from this.	0
Hi everyone! I’m new to this group, and have recently joined seeking much needed advice and/or support from others that have more experience in dealing with Alzheimer’s disease.   Both of my in laws have been recently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, and it is rapidly progressing. My husband is the one that deals with absolutely everything pertaining to their needs, wants, appointment, finances, etc. They now heavily rely on him for everything. The issue is that my father in law calls my husband on average about 10-20 times a day, and it is taking a huge toll on my husband both mentally and emotionally. Many, if not most of the phone calls are to repeat the same information that has already been given to him. My husband is burning out pretty badly and it is affecting his work, his moods, his relationships and most importantly, his well being. My father in law really struggles with anxiety and whenever he has any upcoming appointments (which is very often, if not everyday), he needs constant reassurance and repeating of the times, dates and details of all the appointments and subsequent information given.   I’m at a total loss on how to deal with things and am struggling to cope. I don’t even deal with a quarter of what my husband does, and I have lately been feeling like I’m at a total loss on how to deal with this.   My question to you all, as a community, how do you cope with loved ones suffering from this disease? What, if anything, can help them to worry less and thrive better with this disease? Is there any suggestions on things that can be done to help them rely a little less on us, to ease the burden? Any suggestions on utilizing anything to help them to worry less and help them to remember upcoming appointments?   We bought them a whiteboard to do a daily schedule on, just to cover the upcoming day, to keep it simple. My husband will give him a call daily and get him to write down the events for the following day, although we are both worried that it will only be more confusing for him or he won’t remember to utilize it.   We want them to thrive and do the best they can, with the circumstances. We do everything in our power to make sure they are looked after and keep them as happy and comfortable as possible. They both live together in a retirement home, but are not yet to the point that they need around the clock assisted care. Unfortunately because they are not yet at that point, they heavily rely on my husband for everything, but we want to try and delay their move to special care as long as possible because when they do, they will not only be potentially separated (sleeping in separate rooms), but it is a hospital-like setting and we worry their cognition and well-being would decline much more rapidly once they are there. We moved them to our city over Christmas and got them into the best retirement facility in the city, with the nicest, biggest and best suite possible and even with that, they aren’t happy, so I can only imagine how they would cope or feel in extended care.   Any tips, tricks, suggestions, advice or support is VERY much appreciated and I’m grateful for anyone taking the time to read this. Thank you.	0
Hey, all. I hope this is the right place for this post.  My sister and I are hiring an in-home care worker for my mom, whose Alzheimer's is rapidly advancing.  We're wondering how overnight workers are typically paid? Are they paid hourly like daytime workers? Or are they paid differently given that a big chunk of the night they're sleeping (though on call).	0
Hi everyone. As the title says, I need some advice about meeting someone with Alzheimer’s for the first time. It’s my boyfriends mother. We’ve been dating for about a month now, and I have yet to meet her (although I do want to!) I grew up with my grandparents so I know how to act/treat older people with respect and kindness, but I’d be lying if I said I am a bit worried about meeting her. I’m hesitant about how to act and what to say, and above all I want to make sure I don’t hurt my boyfriends feelings or make him feel awkward about it. I really care for him a lot, and I can see the pain in his eyes when I ask him how his mom is doing. Apparently she is quite advanced in her Alzheimer’s, so she most likely won’t remember me at all, but that’s no excuse. I’d be really grateful if anyone could give me some tips or share their own experiences!  Edit: Thanks to everyone who has responded so far! You have all given me great advice and I really feel much more prepared than I did before. :)	0
81 year old Mom was dx'ed with mid level Alz.   Dr. said she failed tests many 2nd graders would pass and has the cognition level of a 7 year old, but I'm having a hard time reconciling what the Dr says with what I see.    I'm not in denial, but I feel like she should have more symptoms than forgetting people's names.  Mom is very aware that she's got memory loss but my impression was that with Alz the short term memory is the first to go.  I wouldn't expect her to recall a Dr's appointment with a dementia Dr that she had a week ago, for instance, but she does.  I wouldn't expect her to tell me her cousin called her to wish her a happy birthday, I wouldn't expect her to remember that her friend had spent a week at her son's house to take care of his pets while he traveled.     The Dr. kept saying it's not what she CAN remember, but what she CAN'T remember and I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around this.  What am I missing?	0
Would this be a good idea? On the one side, I think it will help me understand what she's going trough and might help me understand her needs etc better. On the other hand, I'm kind of scared that it will completely horrify me and make me super depressed. Could I get your guys take on this? Thank you in advance.	0
My grandma is in her late 70s and has been in assisted care for about seven years and has been in a memory care facility for the past two and a half years. The facility is close to my cousins and they visit her a few times a week (now that they’re all vaccinated) but I live a few hours away and due to school and work can’t see her more than a few times a year. I try to call her once a week but she never picks up. Her caretakers or my cousins will play her answering machine for her once in awhile, so I leave her a message, but it’s not the same as actually getting to talk to her. On the few occasions I do get to talk to her, it’s really difficult. She doesn’t have much short or long term memory and has lost a lot of weight and a few teeth. Overall she seems to be content, but doesn’t have much awareness of what’s going on around her. She is a really incredible, smart, funny woman and I’ll try and remind her of stories she told me when I was little or talk to her about how my college classes are going, but she just sort of smiles and says “That’s wonderful” or “How exciting” to everything. Does anyone have advice on how to engage with her more? I know that we won’t have huge deep conversations and she won’t be the same as she used to be, but I want to try and entertain her or have some sort of real conversation if possible. Her days are pretty monotonous (not that she remembers what happened the day before anyways) and that just makes me really sad, especially since I’m not able to spend much time with her in person. Is trying to remind someone with Alzheimer’s of stories/events that they no longer remember helpful? I’ll usually try and talk to her about stories she told me from her college days, but I don’t want to confuse her or stress her out. What are some things people have found helpful when talking to family members with Alzheimer’s? If anyone has advice on connecting with people when you can’t see them in person that would be incredibly helpful as well. My grandma’s physical health has been declining over the past year and although she’s survived through a lot, I know that her days are starting to come to a close and I just want to spend as much (virtual) time with her as I can. I’ve thought about sending her letters and photo books or maybe making her playlists but I’m not totally sure how I would get them to her or how much of an impact they would have. I’d love to know what other people have found helpful in situations like this!	0
Adults who have parents with Alzheimer’s- what things did your kids do (or you wish they had done) to help you through everything?  My grandma has Alzheimer’s, around Stage 6, and lives in a memory care facility a few states away from my dad (but in the same town as his brothers, so she has family close by to visit her). I’m in college so I don’t spend much time with my dad, but I know this whole thing is really hard on him and want to help him as much as I can. He’s a proud guy and a really good dad so he never really talks to my siblings and I about how this is affecting him and has told us not to worry about him, but obviously we still do. He and my mom are divorced, his dad died over a decade ago, and my siblings all moved out of our hometown for college, and I just don’t want him to go through this alone. He’s not the type of person to answer honestly if I just outright ask him how he’s doing and won’t respond well to being pushed to talk about his emotions, but I want him to know that he’s got support if he needs it.   If anyone who’s been in mine or my dad’s spot has things that helped in this situation that would be awesome! Or if you have things you wished you had done or things your kids could have done that would’ve been a big help.	0
My grandmother has lived with my mom (and sometimes me) since 2013. She’s gotten steadily worse over the years to the point where her short term memory now lasts about 20-30 seconds. She can’t remember when she’s eaten so she eats constantly if someone doesn’t stop her. She’ll say she goes on walks but her feet are so swollen since actually getting her to leave the house to go anywhere requires at least half an hour of persuasion and fighting. Her personality is all but gone, and all that’s left of the old her is her ego. Sometimes I look at her and think “Who is this old hag and what has she done with my grandmother?” And then I feel guilty because I know she can’t help it and can’t control it. She used to be a very independent person but now she’s constantly asking what she can do and we tell her that we’ve got it handled because she just gets in the way if she tries to help. Even simple tasks must be explained to her very simply and repeatedly, and even then she gets it wrong half the time. It’s especially hard on my mom. My grandmother wasn’t always the greatest mother to my mom and now she relies on my mom for everything. She can’t make food for herself and she does no self hygiene unless forced and assisted. She’d wear the same robe, nightgown, and pair of underwear all the time if we let her. She’s turned into a child and it’s heartbreaking to see my once strong, smart, interesting, enigmatic, and independent grandmother be reduced to this. She’s travelled all over the world, met all sorts of interesting people, and done all sorts of amazing things and now she doesn’t remember any of it. She used to have these amazing stories about her life, but then they got wilder and less accurate as she gradually forgot them one by one. Now the only story she really remembers is about how the Nazi’s invaded Denmark and how her family helped Jews escape to Sweden. She’ll make up stories, trying to relate to anything someone tells her. 99% of those stories is bullshit but I know she doesn’t know that. She’s always been the kind of person who took control of a conversation, but now she stills tries but has nothing to say. Her English is also slowly slipping. She’s forgetting names of things, even things she used to love. Her favourite flowers are daffodils and tulips, but she doesn’t remember the names of either of them most of the time. I miss who she used to be. I know if pre-Alzheimer’s her met her now, she’d have absolutely no time for current her. She’d also be horrified at what’s happened to her. I also know if she still had her wits about her, there’s no way in hell she’d still be living with us. She’d probably be off travelling or spending time with her mom or sister. I feel like I love her less than I used to and I hate it but she stresses me and my moms out so much I don’t know what to do. She’s on the wait list for a care home but they probably won’t have a spot for her for two years. My mother and I have started counting how many times she brings up the Nazis or Trump (she hates him) because that’s the only way we can cope with hearing it over and over and over and over and over and over again. We know it’s always the first time for her but it’s hard to not let the frustration show after she’s asked about something for what feels like the millionth time. I really applaud and highly respect everyone who does elder care for a living. Living with my grandmothers has taught me that I don’t have that kind of patience. Maybe it’s easier if you’re not related to them; if you didn’t know them before. She doesn’t know she had Alzheimer’s and there’s no point in telling her because it’ll just upset her and she’ll forget again in a couple minutes but be in a bad mood all day. She’s very healthy physically, which is almost worse in a way because it means she’ll most likely die from this disease. My family is typically long lived, so she’ll keep getting worse for years. We’re doing all we can to slow the progression of the disease as much as possible, but we know there’s only so much we can do. I do feel very lucky that she’s gotten sweeter as her memory has gotten worse. Her father killed himself and we suspect he was in the beginning stages of Alzheimer’s, along with other issues, and that’s one of the reasons he did what he did. We do our best to keep her comfy and happy, but it wears us out. I’ve seen my mother cry from the stress of it all and that breaks my heart too. My step-grandmother is also living with us for the time being (she doesn’t have Alzheimer’s) and luckily she gets along great with my grandmother. But her being here does mean that my grandmother is awake and in the living room more often which means she asks more questions, reads the headlines from the paper repeatedly, and asks the same questions repeatedly too. I do my best to be supportive and answer her million questions. There are good parts, like how I can tell her personal things and get them off my chest without worrying about her telling anyone and she is happy to listen to my rants. I don’t really have an end to this particular rant; I just had to get it off my chest. None of my friends have family with Alzheimer’s so I wanted to post this here, where I’m sure other people are going through something similar.	0
My grandma died back in December and my grandpa has gone downhill fast. My grandma made us promise to live with him, which we would've done anyway. He keeps saying he doesn't want to move. We got approved for a loan and got his house appraised and he had no problem with that, but when we talk about finding houses he gets stubborn. Its worse on his bad days, but still. How do we convince him to move? He forgets we're looking at houses and when we tell him he is surprised and upset because he doesnt remember.   He's still there enough that he refused to give mom power of attorney, but she does have medical power of attorney over him. We want to talk to his doctor, but the problem is he doesnt remember he has Alzheimer's(oh the irony) so when I ask for his paperwork for his doctor he brings me the stuff for his k  Nee replacement which is in a completely different network.    On the upside, we've removed three tons of recycling from his house. My grandma was a 'clean' hoarder, but kept every magazine, paper, etc. Would print out emails and keep them. Her office looked like a maze. He went through the stuff we deemed recycling. At first I was annoyed, but it kept him busy and out of the way and he didnt end up pulling anything back out. We also got the basement gone through(looked like the warehouse scene in Indiana Jones) and have taken probably a Uhaul amount to goodwill.	0
As I am laying in bed crying I just needed to find a group to talk about this. My mother has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and everytime I get back to my place after visiting my parents I'm just so depressed. I know it's hard for my mom and of course for my dad. But it's hard for me as well. I see my mother unable to perform very easy task or being unsure of how to eat an egg and I get so angry. Because for me, sometimes there are two people. The mom I used to have and this new one. And my mom used to be so skilled and she could remember so much and manage our family. And I know that I shouldn't get angry at her. It's not her fault. But it's like - i want my old mom back. And then I'm angry at me for hating this new mom who isn't what I need and want. Like - what kind of monster am I?  Is there anyone else out here dealing with Alzheimer's in a relative and having a hard time handling it? What might help?	0
Jesus christ, mum decided to shit on the hallway carpet instead of the toilet. Then refused to accept it was her, suggesting it was one of the many people who pass through the house (there are not people passing through the house) . After accepting I was not going to be able to get her to clean up her mess I've been down with plastic bags, a sponge and some dettol. Figured a face mask might help with the smell. I'm not good with poo, there was heaving, and then a mask full of vomit. Genuinely wish I didn't exist.  We've had a few issues with pee which I can deal with, poo is a new low which is beyond me. Any suggestions for things to help please?	0
Hi everyone! My mother is a 53 year old with early onset Alzheimer’s. I’ve been going through a lot of our home videos recently and I noticed her voice has changed quite a bit since she started having memory problems. You know the voice you would do if you were imitating yourself as a child? That’s what her voice is all the time now. I guess I feel like it just used to be a lot brighter, and I was wondering if this is me in my own head or something others have noticed. Thanks so much for reading.	0
After arguing with my MIL for a year that she can't take care of him by herself, she finally agreed to put my FIL in a memory care facility. He is only 66, but has very severe early-onset Alzheimer's that basically took him from 100% to a shell of a human in about 18 months.   We checked him into the facility in January, and now 4 months later they just called and said they can't handle him there. He is aggressive towards other patients and staff, and recently just attacked a nurse and broke her wrist. They said we need to find him a private caregiver to stay in the room in the facility with him for 12+ hours a day. We absolutely cannot afford this (we saw rates close to $20,000/month). They said if we don't have a caregiver for him within the next month then they are kicking him out.   We are looking into what kind of financial aid or medicare coverage we can find.   What other options do we have? This sounds like a medication issue to me - can't they sedate him? The guy has no idea what planet he is on and can't identify even his closest family members. He is confused and scared all the time. What other options do we have if a memory care specialty facility can't even help him?	0
"This is how it goes for him.  He wakes up early, at around 6:45 AM, gets his day clothes on (he sleeps in his shirt anyway). He says goodbye to the woman that lives in that house and cleans it, telling her he has to return to his own house. My mother sighs and wishes his a good day.  He gets into the elevator (the apartment is at the third floor of  a condominium), he gets down at the ground floor and without getting out of the building he calls my mother on the phone. He asks ""are you home yet?"", she patientily replies ""yes, I'm here, please come"".  He gets into the elevator again, goes up, opens the apartment's door with his own keys (this is paramount), undresses and prepares his breakfast. Then he goes to bed again for about an hour, or until he gets confused with some thought and has to ask a question to my mom.  This happens every single day. On the bad days he get extremely angry at the people occupying the house *he bought* before getting out of it. My mother and older brother can't do anything but indulge him and letting him go, hopying he won't get out of the building or too far anyway. This comedy sounds funny, but it's indeed exhausting for everyone."	0
My mom is 60 year old female she had an MRI done on her brain this past Monday for on going cognitive issues for the last 5 years. I am not looking for an Alzheimers diagnosis but more of understanding of her MRI and I like this subreddit. I posted on here 2 years ago about her issues and will reference those posts at the end just so you all have a back story. Since I posted her Memory has def gotten worse but she hasn't forgot who anyone is or where she's at and still is able to drive like down the road to the store and sometimes 10 mins away if I got a doctor appt. I'm always with her when she does drive. Her short term memory is shot. She was long term user opioids for pain and even used a fentanyl patch for 11+ years. She is no longer on them after accidental overdose 5 years ago. We don't know if the opioids use is the cause of the issues or what. Last year when she had the MRI done it was normal. She's been getting them done each year and she does see a neurologist but she can't get into her doctor until June. In an MRI from a few years ago it showed ischemic changes but then like I said last year it said her MRI was normal. This was the MRI she had done on this past Monday and I was wondering if someone could help explain this because my sister and I are beside ourselves with worry. In the MRI it said that she has mild cerebral volume loss, multiple scattered FOCI of T2 prolongation seen of white matter that suggests chronic small vessel ischemic disease. The impression they got from the MRI is that there is cerebral volume loss with chronic small vessel ischemic disease. We just don't understand what any of this means. She will be seeing her neurologist again in June that she has been following up with. My sister and I are so worried though. She's the only living parent we have    left. :/      **Reference Post 1**      [https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/a0whg8/my\_moms\_memory\_issues/?st=JSARIYE9&sh=63cffaa5](https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/a0whg8/my_moms_memory_issues/?st=JSARIYE9&sh=63cffaa5)     **Reference Post 2**      [https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/as1jvy/worried\_about\_my\_mom/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/as1jvy/worried_about_my_mom/)	0
My mom (70) was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s about 2 years ago. She’s always had horrible anxiety from a life’s worth of trauma. But after her twin sister died she couldn’t recover and I guess that’s when her Alzheimer’s started.   I realized right away that when my mom gets anxious and overwhelmed she can’t really keep up with conversations or even remember something from a minute ago. Her native language is Spanish so I can actually communicate with her perfectly when she speaks Spanish. It’s like the Alzheimer’s takes a break and she speaks normally, but her English is just fading so fast.   The doctor put her on a low dose of Zoloft to help with the anxiety, but it hasn’t done much, 7months later. She also turns to alcohol for her anxiety. I explained to my dad to tell my mom’s doctor about how bad her anxiety is and how she gets very irritated and overwhelmed. Her misophonia is so bad (like noises such as a blender will cause her to go into a rage.)   But her doctor refuses to put her on any medication for purely anxiety because “she can become addicted”... This enraged me because I have seen my poor mom suffer a lifetime of anxiety and at this age she deserves to breathe and be calm finally.   Have any of you been given anxiety medicine for someone with Alzheimer’s? Is it not a good mix?  Thank you! Any suggestions would be so appreciated.	0
My MIL has dementia and over her life has acquired several family members belonging - like, most of the things that they owned. Now that she has dementia fairly bad we have moved in with her. She can still move and talk but it varies day to day and she isn’t capable of taking care of her self in pretty much anyway (she attempts to handle the personal hygiene but we don’t wanna cross that bridge until we have to). That being said she has grown accustomed to al of these things in her houses that we now also live in (my husband I and our 9 month old).   It’s overwhelming. Almost 3000sqft and basically no room is clutter free. Some rooms are only clutter and things that are completely unused. Others have been hacked at but still busy with things from several past family members. It’s equally as hard for my husband to let things go because he loved those people too (grand parents, his father and great aunt.) Obviously I respect their memories and don’t want to push anyone. But with her dementia all the clutter makes it so much worse and dangerous not just for her but for our baby.   My husband really wants to find a way to keep as much stuff and keep it all at home but some of the larger bulkier items like couches and chairs that aren’t used take up needed space. And donating these items only cause rage. Obviously I get it. I’m not trying to be insensitive but when the clutter causes more pain the pleasure where do you draw the line and how do you intervene? My husband is willing to let a lot of things go and that helps but at the same time when do we start just throwing stuff out or is there a better way? She honestly won’t part with any of it.   I need advice. I love her and she is the sweetest and I hate that I only met her at this time in her life because I love the things she loves but her safety is in danger and her life would be so much better if she had a proper clean and hygienic clutter free home.	0
Hi. I am desperately looking for anyone who may have some insight on Alzheimer’s in people already completely blind.   My dad (65) has been blind for the past 15 or so years. About 4 years ago he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and it has since progressed rapidly so that he no longer knows who any of us are on most days. I think this is made worse by the fact that he can’t see us.   Until about 2 years ago he could still get around well enough but since then his mental map has deteriorated and he often gets confused about WHERE he is.   So many of the suggestions for coping and helping have to do with visually seeing things.   I even contacted several of the Alzheimer’s organizations directly to see if they had any resources for people dealing with multiple disabilities. They had nothing, said they would look into it. But after a few months of fruitless email exchanges I haven’t heard anything else.   We finally admitted him to a home last month because my mother was caring for him alone and he required 24 he care.   However, they don’t want him walking around since he can’t see where he is going/is confused about where he is going and I am horrified to think that this man who has been active his whole life and is still in fine physical health is being confined to a chair most of the day.   Also my mom is basically a hoarder so I guarantee their home was far less safe for him to wander than his sparsely furnished nursing home room.   Anyway...just looking to connect with someone who might have had similar experiences and has some suggestions or just a familiar struggle to share.  Edit to add:   due to his Alzheimer’s he struggled to keep track of the cane he originally was using until it was just in effective and also sometimes forgets he is blind or why he can’t see. This is a different problem then my worry about his care at the home. Just another part of his struggle that I’d like to connect with someone else and compare stories on.	0
Hey everyone, I'm hoping maybe someone could give me some advice on how to tackle this issue. My Dad's symptoms have been worsening for the past 3-4 years and now his safety is at risk.  Long Story: About 2 years ago, our house (Dad's childhood home) had caved in forcing us to move to a rental house and eventually moving to our now home. My mom told me he has been exhibited symptoms for a while but kept them away from our knowledge until moving.   Even since we settled into our now home, he exhibits more sun-downing quiet often, forgets his wife and who she is to him, doesn't know locally where he is at (stayed in the same city just on the outskirts), has left home multiple times for unusual reasons, typically going the wrong way. Other instances have happened where it's very overwhelming.   As a result, this has made us get a security system installed so we can be alerted which direction he goes. Today he decided to jump our gates (6ft tall) and go running, because of this, there was no alarm set off. It's been over 4 times where we have had to drive to look for him (thank god for GPS on phones). He ran opposite of traffic, in rocks along a busy road, with no water and didn't answer his phone, today was the worst incident  I had confronted him last Summer when it became too much for me to witness only to be told 'I will do better, I'll work on it'.   My mom has been taking it the worst because she's losing her husband every day but doesn't seem willing to put him in a memory care unit  We had convinced him to go to a doctor only for him to get upset the day before and refused to go. He hasn't gotten violent. Not sure how to help in this situation. While a diagnosis is not necessary, it would be nice to finally get a solid answer on all this and medical advice on how to handle it or prevent it from worsening as fast (If that's possible).    Any advice would be helpful.  -Helpless daughter	0
My mother in law is in serious decline and my wife is just rolling with the punches. MIL has always been feisty but she has recently had the police called on her for trying to break in to the neighbor’s house, not out of confusion but to confront him about something that never happened. She cannot remember what was spoken about minutes ago and when she’s at our house she repeatedly tells me how much our kitchen reminds her of the one in the house she grew up in and that she can’t picture the one in the house she’s lived in for the last fifty years. I understand that Alzheimer’s is messing with her memory and the very long term memories are the ones she can recall BUT she has a weird twist where she can invent recent memories and hold them against someone. They are exclusively negative and she believes them with all her heart. The one I’m living is that I took her home Christmas morning and dumped her off at her house to spend the holiday alone. It never happened, she was with us the entire week and when she did end up going home, my wife took her. She is convinced my children who adore her and are incredibly patient with her have purposely made an effort to make her stays uncomfortable (always inventing stories about loud music or making her watch tv shows she doesn’t like) they are 10 and 12, they do exactly as they are told, especially by her. There have been many others and they seem to be coming up more and more often.   My question is how can those “recent” memories hold so steadfastly and consistently but things that really happen are gone within minutes? Honestly, I need help understanding how this is happening and if it’s normal because I’m struggling to continue allowing into my house.	0
So happy to share that my mom loves her new dog!  She is in advanced stages and this dog has cheered her up so much!    I shared the link below for the dog.  I wish I had done this years ago.   https://www.alzstore.com/doll-pet-therapy-dementia-s/1516.htm	0
Hello everyone. I've been lurking in this subreddit for a while reading the stories and silently accepting the idea that I'm not as alone as I feel, but no I'm in need of some advice.   I'm fairly new to the role of caretaker as I'm 26 caring for my 54 year old mother with early onset Alzheimers. I'm familiar with the disease after seeing it with my grandfather, but he had a stroke and wasn't able to communicate properly because of it. My mother on the other hand started out forgetting she had been diagnosed and forgetting anything was wrong. This was a problem when filing for SSDI and when trying to restrict her driving. Lately she has been consistently asking me if she still has Alzheimer's - I've never been one to lie to my mother, but every time I tell her the truth she gets very upset, tries hitting her head on things and even tries to run off like she did last night.   Has anyone had a loved one like this and maybe have a recommendation for a better way to answer this question?	0
To be honest my dad is always been an asshole and an idiot. But now that he has early onset Alzheimer's it's only got worse. And my poor mother is getting the worst of it. He hasn't become physically violent yet. But damn you're close to it. Punched a hole in the wall a few months ago.  Starts fights over the most stupid things. Oftentimes you'll start a fight over nothing at all. As if he had an imaginary conversation in his head that he's confronting you about. Sometimes you'll have a big blow out and then a couple hours later forget it ever happened and wonder why everyone's nervous around him.  My mom's ready to just give up and leave him. But can't afford to get out on her own. Can't afford to put him into a care home. He's not far enough along to qualify for it anyway. And he's too abusive, any home would kick him out. Can't just divorce him and kick him out, he'll forget and keep showing up anyways.  Just generally feeling trapped. Sure, I can save up some money and get out of here. But I don't want to leave my mom behind to deal with this alone.	0
So...my daughter spoke to my MIL’s doctor today, because it had seemed like no one else in the family besides my husband was willing to admit there’s a problem with my mother-in-law and do anything about it.  Turned out, he told my daughter that my husband’s sister took the same concerns to him A YEAR AGO. He suggested testing at MIL’s annual physical and she refused.  He said at this point, unless someone has her declared incompetent, there’s nothing he can do. I feel even worse for my husband now. He’s felt all alone in his concern for his mom, thinking no one else saw the problems or cared. His sister repeatedly tells him “it’s just old age.” Ugh.   So now the question is what to do from this point. She’s really already at the point she shouldn’t be alone. But clearly no one wants to do anything more.	0
New young caregivers support group   I’m not sure if this is really allowed or helps anyone at all but my friend started this caregiver support group for anyone who is 35 and younger. It’s focused on dementia for grandparents but she will allow other young caregivers in the group.   I do not have a Facebook but she sent me the name.   Its called Taking Care of Grandma A Young Caregivers Support Group. She is med and finance POA for her grandma and does not have any family really who can help so shes in it alone making decision for her grandma with dementia.  If you are 35 and younger this group might be for you   her link [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/140442438035680/)	0
"Hello, all.    My wife and I are each either side of 50 years old.  We have always planned to ""get out"" and go see the country (which neither of us has really done).  My mother was placed in a memory care facility about 2 years ago.  I care for her dog now and see her about every two weeks with the dog (since COVID restrictions lightened up a bit).  She's VERY high functioning.  I'm her only child and her POA/ Trustee, but she has a dozen friends and family who visit her frequently.  I'm struggling with a choice we're intending to make.  We intend to sell our home and buy a truck and RV and travel the country, in a new place every couple of weeks - perhaps for the next 3 years (ish).  I would still fly back approximately every 3 months (or for any emergencies) to spend a few days with her, but I wouldn't likely be able to bring her dog to see her (the dog is getting older, but she LOVES the dog).    Knowing that she'll need me around more in the future as she declines, and knowing that we're not getting any younger ourselves, we feel like we need this adventure in our lives now or perhaps never. Professionally and financially, we're finally in a place where we can do this.  But then I feel bad that I'm not going to be able to visit as often and that she won't be able to see the dog as often.  I devote a lot of time to her as her POA and Trustee, and I feel good about how I'm managing her affairs, but I need someone to tell me that this is a terrible plan and I'm a terrible person or tell me that it's ok to take care of myself and do what I want to do with my life while I still can.  This is an internal battle that I'm truly struggling with and any advice or tips would be welcome.  Thanks in advance!"	0
My mother in law was diagnosed with Alzheimer's about a year and a half ago. She currently lives with my SIL who is her carer. Her illness is progressing slowly (at least in my opinion). She can still play golf,  use her iPad almost independently, make breakfast, do some household chores. However, she tends to forget what was said 20 minutes ago in a conversation etc, ask the same question again and again, gets confused in unfamiliar settings.  I'm pregnant, with our baby coming in a few months. When discussing who could help me with the baby when I need a break and some time off, my husband doesn't want to consider an occasional nanny because his mother can babysit. He claims she is good with babies, had three of her own and used to help with her other grandchildren. I don't doubt she was amazing with children, but I just don't feel comfortable leaving my baby in her care, one on one. I'm happy for her to spend time with the baby when my husband and I are watching, but I can't fathom leaving her to babysit.   Am I being unreasonable? How can I explain to my husband that leaving a baby in the care of someone who needs care themselves is simply not safe, without hurting his feelings?	0
"My mom was diagnosed with vascular dementia 2 years ago and she only has one symptom of that my dad is having an affair.  He is 84 and verified he is not (in case you were wondering as everyone asks).  Her delusions enrage her as she thinks he sneaks out in the middle of the night (cameras on the house does not help as she thinks they are hacked), that ""the woman"" follows them when they drive and that she watches them from the trees in the backyard.        Her memory is still perfect. Intelligent. On good days (without delusions) she is almost perfectly normal and sweet.  No UTI (verified several times) and no thyroid issues (verified by endocrinologist).      Is this normal to only have this psychotic delusion that kicks in 1 out of every 3 days or so? (Sundowning does occur)"	0
My boyfriend's mother has Alzheimer's and her sleep schedule has been rough and it has taken a toll on his job trying to take care of her. Many nursing homes neglect the people they take care of, how would someone find a good nursing home that takes good care of their patients?	0
Hey friends -   A lot of posts have been about how to keep track of our loved ones as they wander. Apple announced their airtags yesterday - and from what I’ve seen, it could be a helpful solution. Think it works a lot like any other iOS / apple device where you can enable ‘find my…’ on it. I’m not sure of the range - but it’s a hell of a lot cheaper (and likely easier) than convincing our person to wear an Apple Watch or carry their phone, etc.   My dad wasn’t a wanderer (thank heavens) but I know how incredibly stressful taking care of someone with this dumb disease is. If it helps make your life a little easier, it’s worth it.   Lots of different cases and whatnot, but the belt / collar case in this Gizmodo article seems ideal. My dad wore his belt every single day. With his suspenders. Silly goose.   https://apple.news/Av2S9UqJJR_KftvPeRW-zaw	0
So My Dad and I both have some issues with memory. His was initially thought to be due to B12 vitamin deficiency.   However, even after taking vitamins he continues to forget things like whether he has eaten something from the fridge, recalls about our lives in a disordered way as well, and forgets things like when major events happened in our lives.   Did anyone else have similar experiences before diagnosis with family members? My sister thinks he is lying at times but it is pretty clear to me and my mother that he has worsening memory problems that won't be solved by vitamins.	0
My step mum now has 24/7 care. My Dad still lives at home with her but he just can't cope with all of her care needs. She has PCA so ha almost her ability to read or really watch TV. The only thing she wants to do is wall, continuously. Today she told the carer to leave her alone and that she was going to call the police on them. She then tried to walk across a busy dual carriageway to get away from the carer. The carer has, understandably refused to walk with her anymore as she feels like it is dangerous.  My Dad wants to be able to come to visit us and his grandson once a week but now feels he can't leave. If they lock the front door and say she can't go for a walk she starts banging on it and screaming that she is being held hostage.  I don't really know why I'm posting. It's just so unfair. My poor Dad is at breaking point.	0
I am working on a Phase 3 clinical trial for Alzheimer's disease and we are finding it difficult to reach out to those in the Alzheimer's community with so many in person events and support groups no longer taking place.   I am wondering if anyone here has suggestions for good ways to share information about our study to people who might be recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease or are looking to potentially learn about trials for their loved ones.   &#x200B;  Any help is appreciated. Thank you!	0
Today my mom let me know that my dad (early onset, mid stages) has been demanding to speak to or write a letter to the Pope about his situation. He has never been very religious (and never catholic) but is taking a very ‘I need to speak to the manager’ approach to this delusion. Thankfully it passes quickly and amuses my mom. Just wanted to share a funny-ish story in an otherwise very plateaued situation	0
"Any tips for caregivers to manage stress and be able to have a life outside of taking care of a parent with dementia ?  I find myself trapped at the house and unable to get away to enjoy anything.  I am in my 40's and not married and no kids.  My mother is 75, has dementia and takes several important meds for heart transplant and other issues.  My brother has pancreatic cancer so has been super stressful the last year and not sure how to get away for a break.    Just struggling for ways to ""escape"" my situation from time to time."	0
"My dad's (74) dementia has progressed -- the last time he took a MoCA test (last year), I think he scored about a six or a seven. He is still living at home with my mom (74). My siblings and I have been encouraging her for at least a year to get some in-home help, so she can run errands, go to activities, and get a break regularly. She has resisted, for a lot of reasons.  We just learned today that dad has stepped out of a moving vehicle (happened this week, while my uncle is visiting them). Dad walked almost a mile down the road, while they looped back around to get him. Mom admitted to my brother that it wasn't actually the first time he had done that. He will also sometimes leave the house if he gets frustrated or angry. I am looking at bracelets for him (that are not removable by the wearer). His main health concern is the dementia. I would assume it should say his name, that he has dementia, his address, and my mom's phone number? Anybody have good luck with bracelets? I have been looking on Medical ID Fashions online -- I want to get one that is comfortable, but sturdy.  Also, against our advice, mom is taking him away from home this summer to visit her family. They are being driven half-way across the US by friends, then flying home. She is now saying they may stay for six weeks (originally, it was two weeks). I offered to go stay with him, but mom declined. She wants him to see everybody one last time. (He no longer knows any of them -- my mom is usually his ""girlfriend"" or ""the lady."") I have spoken to his social worker, who spoke to his primary dementia physician, and they have said they do not want him to go -- my mom knows this. But we can't make them stay at home. We know that you can enable the child locks in the back seats. They will have to stay the night at least once on the way there (I think it's about a 19-hour drive). Does anyone have advice for road and vacation safety? They will be staying at a lake place, and I am so nervous about him getting lost in lake country. The lake place is yards from the water.  My siblings and I are going to move our messaging from ""you need an assistant"" to ""now is the time you need to pursue getting him into residential care."" We try to be gentle and non-judgmental. As is often the case, this is an elderly person taking care of another elderly person. Mom can be very stubborn, and stops speaking to us if she feels pressured, so it is a delicate procedure to guide her to better care for dad and for herself. Thanks for any advice."	0
"My grandma was diagnosed with Alzheimer's three or four years ago and so it's been getting more and more rough. She lives with me and my mom, stepfather, my brother and sister, and it's getting to the point where we can't handle it anymore. We're all doing our best obviously. This past week has been the worst. Every day, her episodes are starting with her saying she wants to go home, and she tries to leave the house, and after not being able to leave, she cries. She thinks she's being trapped somewhere, I guess, and that we're being evil by not taking her home. It's been happening at least once a day for the past week. Last Friday, she started banging her head on the window because she wanted to escape. I've heard her say ""Please God, take me. Take me right here and right now."" Yesterday before I went to work, she told me ""I'm sick. I can't take care of myself."" And then, she said she feels like she's in this evil place.   It is absolutely traumatic and upsetting to see my grandma this way. Someone I've known and loved my whole life, who was a completely different person before (obviously). It's really affecting me. I can't get it out of my mind. I can't focus on anything else. It's just that we seem to have entered a new stage of this disease, and it's been awful to watch. My boyfriend told me yesterday that he's concerned about me b/c I'm really really fixating on it and it seems to be taking a toll on me. He's right. My friends and coworkers have all noticed too. My brother told me if it's affecting me that much, then I don't have to feel the need to be as involved as I've been. But, I'm still just really having a hard time dealing with it, internally. What can I do?! What can I do to calm myself down more? I still need to step in and help but I need to take care of myself."	0

My mom has dementia with Lewy body. She’s 75. I’m 39 (single no kids and actively trying for both). My moms condition majorly worsened the last 6 months. But not horrible. It’s an insane depressing but grateful place to be. She knows everyone. But she can’t be alone. She won’t admit it. She’s depressed. She’s terrified. No short term memory. Cant Really reason but also can. Anyway. I know this will only get worse. I have her on every med and with every doctor. I know how this ends up. Her dad and sister had it too. I know the deal. It’s my worst nightmare came to life. She was my best friend. Good morning texts. Good night texts. Knew where each other was at evert moment. How am I ever supposed to be happy again? Genuinely. I have a great boyfriend. Were tying for a baby after a recent miscarriage. But I don’t see ever being truly happy ever again. Not losing my mom like this.	0
My 76yo grandmother has been in and out of doctors offices for the past 2 months, we don't have a diagnosis yet, though her doctor is on the same page as me as far as assuming it's Alzheimer's of some sort. She owns a business and recently got it into a bunch of trouble which took some time for them to get out of and she is stuck in the mindset that she needs to get up every day and go to work, because that's all shes known lately. Probbaly for the past 40 years. They've hired someone else to essentially do the bookwork and man the front desk so that she can stay home, but she doesn't like being left out of things shop-related, and when she goes there, she doesn't know what she's doing and when she tries, she just messes things up and is sending her business downhill. She should retire--- I know she's thought about it, and I've tried to talk her into staying home nicely... my main point, I suppose--- is that noone has power of attorney for her yet but she really needs to just stay home and I don't know how to get her to do that without being rude about it or taking her car keys. Shes always been very independent and she has no intention of stopping. She lets me take her to all her doctor appointments because if she tries to go anywhere but work she gets lost and she refuses to get a cellphone. She got violent with her employee today and she's never been the violent type but I know that he's been getting frustrated with her being at the shop and she's said that she's scared of him because he reminds her of her awful exhusband... I think he triggered her somehow, but thats straying away from my main concern.... I've tried to talk her into staying home and it won't matter if she agrees because she'll just get up the next day and get ready for work and go. Anything we tell her goes in one ear and out the other. I'm at a loss, and its time to get an attorney involved, I know that, but is there a nice way for me to do it? She practically raised me and these past two months have driven ME crazy trying to keep her happy, and it breaks my heart to see her so broken without realizing she is. She tells me the same stories over and over and then gets confused that she's already told me--- I can't accept her word for anything... she asked me to take her out for lunch at KFC today and I did and she tried to order a cheeseburger, and when I explained to her that we were at KFC and they didn't have cheeseburgers and she accepted that, but then I asked her again what she wanted, and she tried ordering herself a cheeseburger, again... Idk what to do. Help... please... I apologize that this is so long... I took the opportunity to vent a little bit... I appreciate any feedback.	0
My dad is 57 and has been showing signs for the past 5 years. At first we thought it was bipolar disorder because it involved a lot of mood swings and arguments. He still isn’t diagnosed because it doesn’t run in our family but in the past 2 years he is unable to work, drive, has no short term memory, has no idea about our finances, does not know when to eat or how to work any household electronics/appliances, has to be reminded to shower or wash his hands. I am shocked at how quickly he regressed.   Has anyone else experienced this? When he gets diagnosed officially- what stage will he be in? Does this all count towards it? When your parents or relatives get diagnosed before 60, how long do they live in this in between limbo? How much longer do they have? He’s still somewhat independent when my mom works if she leaves reminders but the doctors tell her he cannot be alone. And yet no official diagnosis. We’ve been dealing with disability for over a year, how long does it usually take?   Sorry, I’m asking for shared experiences. When you’re in your 20s, you don’t know many others going through this.	0
"My mom (63) and I (24) don't know what to do. She reached out to his doctor, but he told us we had to bring him in for tests if we want him tested. I think if we told him we thought his mind was going... well, he is a very proud man and would not take it lightly or try to understand. It would just start a very large fight and get us nowhere, except less trust from dad. He forgets everything and argues about things that he taught me. His moods bounce all over the place, and he gets frustrated very easily. Everything is everyone else's fault basically as well. I always knew I would be the kid to take care of my folks, and moved across the country with them to start that ball rolling. Now, with this starting, I'm terrified. I'm 24, I just figured out how to start taking care of myself. We were planning on buying a house together or some land, but now I'm feeling a lot more claustrophobic in that situation, considering the person who was going to handle most of it is now unable to figure out how to do basic things on his phone. I don't know how to get him any help with this without telling him we think he has alzheimers. And I really can't stress enough..... he would never admit that, even if he thought it himself, and would take it as a personal attack rather than something out of love and respect.   He just got so frustrated because the avocado he took out of the fridge is not ripe by any means and he can't use it for breakfast. He is the one who taught me that putting it in the fridge keeps them from ripening. He argued with me and now I'm crying. Most of my life was spent having a rocky relationship with my dad, and now that it is resolved and we can start to build a good one, he is losing himself. It hurts. I know it isn't about me but this is so hard to wrap my mind around. I am worried that I am not/won't be strong enough to handle this.   Does anyone here have any advice? Suggestions? Things that will make this feel any less groundbreaking??? I am young and a lot of my friends aren't ""there yet,"" if you know what I mean. Even my sister, who is..... 32 I think? lives in another state and always has. So she isn't here to see it all the time. Sometimes I tell her about things that he does (like trying to change the address on his pizza hut account through his phone's settings app) and she just laughs it off. Which, sure, that might sound funny, but witnessing it in person is horrifying. It has made me feel extra pressured to get my shit together before my dad is completely gone.   I am in therapy, and have talked to her about this, but I know it is going to get worse before..... well, before it just ends. I have no one really who has experienced this first hand. Are there resources I could be utilizing any better?  Thanks in advance for reading through this."	0
Hi everyone. At my mom’s recent annual physical, the doctor suggested completing a DNR form. I felt rushed so I checked no life saving measures except feeding/hydration. On further contemplation, it seems like maybe I shouldn’t have checked those when I know my mom does not want *any* lifesaving measures. Anyone done the form and have advice? I know this is a complicated and sensitive topic, but I appreciate any compassionate insight.	0
Hi sorry if this is not right way to ask or [place.](https://place.My)  [My](https://place.My) dad is almost 90 he has severe Alzheimer’s. He was in a care home but proved too much so was sent to hospital. From there he wasnt getting the care needed so was finally sent to a hospital for the elderly.      my question is due to the fact his symptoms have deteriorated rapidly in last six months, is there a time line to figure out how long he has left? He cannot walk or feed himself. He crawls around and doesn’t speak. He is acting more like a baby again. my mum is very worried about him and I know nothing about this disease.   Could he be like this for months or years? It’s really upsetting her. he doesn’t know anyone and I’m thinking it would be better for all if the unthinkable happened bc how can it get worse than this? She had spent her entire life looking after her family and has never had a break.   My mum is in a bad way worrying about him, thanks for your advice. NB sorry if this seemed harsh but things have gotten as bad as I could have imagined with this disease.	0
This is a long one, so apologies for the wall of text...   This is something that my bf is going through- his father seems to be forgetting things more often, like how to use his phone and so forth. The forgetfulness has been a going on for some time and I really don't have many details because I haven't spent enough time around him (I have been dating my fb for a year, but covid and his dad being away in a foreign country has prevented me from getting to know him).   His dad moved back recently to the states, and it seems that my bf's mother (a long time divorced, but still friends with him and she is also a nurse) came across some info while she was helping with his medication that stated that he was in the first stages of dementia. He is a big drinker (not sure if alcoholic?), and doesn't take very good care of himself (type 2 diabetes), and has had covid  recently (but hospitalized for several days). After he came back, he has been falling down a lot lately (big guy, maybe borderline obese? impossible to lift a 250lb six foot man).   Anyway, my bf is his medical proxy and is worried because his dad is going to leave the country again next week to go back to the tropical country where he was staying before he came back. We have no idea why he came back, but it seemed like he was breaking up with his gf. Anyway, that seems to have resolved and there is talk about marriage... We are worried that he can't take care of himself and will be in that country with a gf who might not really love him, but is looking for other things (she is 40, he is 73)... And she is not a nurse by any means and in no way equipped to properly look after him.  So I guess my question is this- if his father really had been diagnosed with dementia, wouldn't the PCP be obligated in some way to inform the next of kin of this, or the medical proxy? That was never done. His dad doesn't have any plan for this sort of thing happening to him, even though his mother went through something similar. We are completely at a loss as to what should normally happen and have no idea where to turn for help. What if something happens to him and he can't call my bf because he can't work out his phone? What if we can't find him in this foreign country? He still seems of some sound mind to make certain decisions, so getting any kind of injunction over his decisions seems like not at all a possibility and might cause some serious family issues. Does anyone have any ideas as to what to do here? This is a serious conundrum  TL:DR bf dad in beginning stages of dementia (maybe), leaving the country soon to be with golddigger. What to do?	0
I’m saying goodbye to my Grammy today.  I was her caregiver for a while before I moved out of state, and haven’t seen her since lockdown started a year ago. She was moved to a care facility 6 months ago, and probably had a stroke during surgery a couple weeks ago and has been placed in hospice care now. I was able to come visit for the weekend without my older two kids and brought my 6 month old who she hasn’t met, to see her for what is almost certainly the last time.  Trying not to have any expectations as she sleeps most all of the day, only awake about 10 minutes at a time every few hours and still largely unresponsive.  She took such good care of me as a kid, always picked me up from school, took me to dance classes, taught me to sew, made me so many cans of spaghettios, my favorite soup, Rice Krispie treats... Even if she doesn’t remember me or isn’t awake or anything, I still want to say thank you to her for everything.  This disease sucks and I hate it, but I’m glad to know there are others here that will understand.	0
"My grandmother is 74 and shes been bedridden for the past 10 years due to a variety of illnesses (dysfunctional neurological system, severe osteoarthritis affecting her entire system). We tried a whole bunch of different treatment techniques (allopathy and ayurveda) over several years and it isnt improving infact it seems to be getting worse and doctors have given up hope.   For the past four years, shes deteriorated considerably showing psychiatric symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations and forgetfulness. Most symptoms and an MRI scan indicate Alzheimers disease, including visits to two psychiatrists who prescribed her a range of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and dementia-related medication.   Caregiving has become very, very difficult. But finding and ""financially-supporting"" caregiving through external means has become even more difficult. And so my mom looks after her mother (my grandmother) now, and shes showing severe sundowning including lack of time orientation and mood swings and worst of all, insomnia. Shes too scared to sleep at night and keeps my mother awake all the time. I cannot find anyone else to caregive for my grandmother. I dont know what to do, because Im running out of patience to deal with my grandmother (she relentlessly calls people around her for minor things and refuses to sleep at night) and I get angry at her for causing my mother such distress.   Dementia related support in India (specifically Kerala) is very little. Im really tired and just want to end all this. Any help anyone can give me (people in India would be better) would be appreciated. Are there any homes in Kerala that take in bedridden dementia patients?"	0
I have read about articles that Alzheimer’s disease is also often called type 3 diabetes because patients with Alzheimer’s disease are likely to have insulin resistant brains. Of course being metabolically diabetic (as in type 2 not type 1) increases the odds of Alzheimer’s as well.   But has anyone tried to do anything of the sort like changing diet? Like trying to reduce insulin levels, make them go on Keto diets or fast for a whole day?   Maybe even MCT oils will help if this is true since ketones is a secondary source of energy for the brain if sugar or glucose can’t be used. If your brain can’t get the energy it needs of course it’s only natural it would start dying off but if we can try to get ketones to work then it would at least postpone or stop the progression of the disease.   There is also the article that some people with Alzheimer’s have 6x the aluminum content in their brains compare to normal people but I doubt there’s anything we can do here.	0
Years before my Grandma got her diagnosis I noticed some signs. For example, she lost 500 dollars then blamed it on my Mom and said she stole it. She would occasionally forgot to turn the stove off and burned multiple dishes. These are all the warning signs I saw. What did you guys see?	0
"I really do.  She just looked in my face, scream-bellowed twice, and emptied her dinner into the trash.  Then she demanded ""decent food"".  Because a cheeseburger is ""decent"" for a diabetic, and a bowl of homemade, organic, from-scratch Broccoli Beef is ""shit I don't deserve"".     I hate Sundowner's syndrome."	0
"My mother (76) has Alzheimers. She still lives in her own home, and my husband, brother, and I are her caregivers. I don't know what ""stage"" she's in as it's so confusing to determine, but she seems to be managing keeping the house clean, bathing, dressing, and feeding herself -- essentially the basics. I have managed her finances and medical care for the last 5 years or so pretty much completely. My brother gets her groceries, my husband tends to the house, and I take care of other things. She's alone most of the time, but she's preferred that for many years now, long before Alz. I could obviously give more about her state right now, and maybe I should since everyone here is so knowledgeable and could give advice, but that's not my focus of this post.  Her current primary physician has been with her for a long time, but to put it simply, his care for her is inadequate. Long story shortened, he ignored all concerns, and it was a neurologist who diagnosed her after being referred for another problem. The neurologist has given her medication and sees us every 6 months or so); the primary doc has pretty much pretended that nothing's different than it ever was. Recently we had more issues with him, and I made an appointment with a new doctor. Mom's not happy with him either, so it was easier to get her to go to a new doc, and this guy is my own and is awesome (the perfect example of what a doctor should be!).  We are seeing the neurologist tomorrow, and the new primary doctor next week. The new doctor has access to all of her medical records already. The advice I'm asking for is this -- what is all of the information I should provide to him? It's so hard to talk about her in front of the doctors, so I want to be as concise as possible and may even detail it all out for him to just read. But I don't know what all I should give. I want him to know what's transpired and what's going on with her now. I want him to help us determine where she's at and how close she might be to needing to move elsewhere. I want him to help us find services that can help us care for her. And so on ....   What details are going to be important for him to determine where she's at? Any advice and help you can give will be very much appreciated! This community has helped me so much already, so let me take this chance to say THANK YOU!"	0
My dad used to be a voracious reader but his Alzheimers has taken away that ability. I am looking into audio books for him already, but he’s also got bad hearing and of course no focus. I was thinking, though, that if there was anything like an audio book that also had a simple visual component that might be something he would really enjoy. (I know- I’m describing a movie, but movies just move too fast for him to follow.) Has anyone ever seen such a thing?  Thanks in advance for any ideas.	0

aj9i47,"hi folks,my 68 y/o mother was diagnosed with mild alzheimers this past april (though i noticed issues as early as 2014), and my aunt recently passed from the disease (technically renal failure, but you know how it goes). at the time, when my mother was diagnosed and the doctor said she was only in the mild stages, i somewhat disagreed with him, thinking that she was edging the moderates stages. after my aunt passed, though, my mom seems to take a downturn. here's a list of her current state:-sleeps quite a bit, maybe 10 hours a day.-not really repeating herself, as opposed to my aunt. we delayed getting her evaluated for quite a while because she never did this.-can no longer drive, manage her own finances, prepare her own food unless it's pb&amp;j or microwave, and has stopped the bulk of her cleaning aside from the kitchen (she was a very fastidious person previous and probably vacuumed once a week).-obsessively checks/cleans the kitchen whenever i leave it-wanders around the house quite a bit-has a grasp of the seasons, but i don't think she could tell me the date or even the month if i asked her (she didn't even realize it was christmas eve though we'd just told her the day before)-withdrawn, often speaks/whispers to herself-still bathing mostly daily, but lately has sometimes not changed out of sleepwear (again, unusual for her).-loss of inhibitions (i've heard the aricept made aid in this)most uncomfortably, she's developed several behavioral problems that are almost all directed at me, her caregiver. i've been called a thief and a leech, she's recently tried to block the front door with small stoneware jars (very unsuccessfully, of course), and it's like she can't wait to tell random people about how i've stolen her money or how it's my fault she can't drive anymore.is it safe to say that she's well into the moderate stages of alzheimer's at this point?",What stage?,"          i've been called a thief and a leech, she's recently tried to block the front door with small stoneware jars (very unsuccessfully, of course), and it's like she can't wait to tell random people about how i've stolen her money or how it's my fault she can't drive anymore.is it safe to say that she's well into the moderate stages of alzheimer's at this point? what stage?",0

rozx0o,"dear friends, recently - over the past two years or so - my mom and i started noticing some changes in my father's behavior. he sometimes forgets recent things - not obvious things like names or addresses, but more like details in a recent conversation, what he had for breakfast, who he was on phone with, etc. he also has a tendency to repeat things in the same conversation. mom and i were always worried that he would develop dementia (because his father and one older brother had it), so we got him to see a doctor as soon as these symptoms started showing. however, the doctor thinks his mri report was fine, and he made him take some informal memory and math tests which he passed easily. what's more, my father has always been a pretty forgetful (and repetitive) person, so we're not sure if this spike in forgetfulness is indicative of dementia, or just a quarantine side-effect.one thing i also notice is, his forgetfulness is kind of context-specific - like he would only forget details related to certain things, and only when he's dealing with certain people (e.g. he tends to forget more when he's communicating with my mom, compared to anyone else). i don't know what to make of it, but i've heard the first symptoms of dementia are only apparent to the primary caregiver (my mom in this case, i live abroad).i guess my primary question is, assuming the worst (early dementia) - what can we do to make his situation better (or at least, prevent it from getting worse)? i've browsed some of the material posted on the resources section of this subreddit, but they largely seem to cater to later stages in dementia, while our confusion is about the diagnosis itself.thanks in advance for any and all help! feel free to direct me to other resources/forums/experts to e-mail.",I'm not sure if my dad has dementia,"              i don't know what to make of it, but i've heard the first symptoms of dementia are only apparent to the primary caregiver (my mom in this case, i live abroad).i guess my primary question is, assuming the worst (early dementia) - what can we do to make his situation better (or at least, prevent it from getting worse)?

e36e12,"hello everyone, this is going to be a bit of a write up so bear with me please.for the past year or so my grandmother has been exhibiting minor short term memory loss, it became noticeable because my mother and her were marathoning a t.v show together, after they finished watching the entire series my grandmother wanted to watch it again, and treated it as if she had never seen it before.long story short, her and my mother wound up re-watching the show continuously for the past year, my mother was bored out of her mind but my grandmother always acted like it was the first time she was seeing it.this, compounded by other minor signs of memory loss led my mother and my grandmothers sister to try and talk to her about it. in most instances, my grandmother reacted with anger (kind of a how dare you attitude) but after a little deliberation they finally convinced her to see a doctor.this is where things get kind of weird, even though my grandmother had been showing signs of short-term memory loss she was still highly functional, and capable of living on her own and generally taking care of herself. she went to her doctors appointment, and in the interview process alone the doctor determined that she probably was suffering from the early onset of dementia. but for my grandmother, it was like she completely lost all cognitive ability after this doctors appointment, in a matter of days she went from being mostly self-sufficient with short-term memory loss to not even knowing where she was, sometimes when she talks to me or my mother now, she‚Äôll pause and ask us if we‚Äôre really there or if she is hallucinating.she gets these weird things in her head, and she‚Äôll make really weird statements like she told my mom ‚Äúwhen i die just leave me here to rot, you don‚Äôt need to go to the trouble of burying me‚Äù or she also once told my mom that her brother in law told her she was gonna die a long and painful death, because the drs would never give her pain medication, first of all this is completely imagined and fabricated within her mind, her brother-in-law would never tell her something like that, and when my mom explained to her that wouldn‚Äôt happen and hospitals have medication they give people in their final days and moments she just became argumentative with my mom.she refuses to eat unless somebody‚Äôs eating with her, and even then whoever‚Äôs eating with her has to basically gorge themselves with food to get her to eat just a normal serving as she watched you like a hawk and only takes bites when you‚Äôre cramming food down your throat.i don‚Äôt know the full extent of things yet, but i know that she‚Äôs become kind of aggressive and argumentative with my mom, this is very out of character for her as she has always been the sweetest person.i guess the thing that i‚Äôm struggling with most right now, is that she had such a drastic change so quickly after being told that this is probably what it was. can dementia progress in a matter of days? i‚Äôm not kidding when i say it went from being very minor memory loss, to full on confusion and hallucinations in a matter of days. today i‚Äôm meeting with my parents and we‚Äôre going to move my grandmother in with them so she can have mostly consistent monitoring and care.i‚Äôm just takin a back right now, i have not had time to process what is going on. everything i have read says that dementia generally progresses over the course of 8 to 10 years and some people have even lived upwards of 20 years with it, but that doesn‚Äôt seem to fit the case now with my grandmother, she has gone from fully functional to needing basically 24 hour care in a matter of a couple of days.have any of you had a similar experience with the progression process?thanks for any responses.",My grandmother (73) was recently diagnosed with early onset Dementia and I am looking for some answers about the progression of this disease.,"              everything i have read says that dementia generally progresses over the course of 8 to 10 years and some people have even lived upwards of 20 years with it, but that doesn‚äôt seem to fit the case now with my grandmother, she has gone from fully functional to needing basically 24 hour care in a matter of a couple of days.have any of you had a similar experience with the progression process?thanks for any responses.

ds7k0d,"so i've been looking around and because the insurance industry completely underestimated the high cost and high number of seniors living with chronic conditions (like alzheimer's , parkinson's etc) so their actuarial tables were flawed, and they took a huge losses financially ,.so to resolve this most just left the market (don't write ltc policies anymore) and the remaining ones offer stingy coverage options (most ltc policies have a coverage cap around 5 years) with no rate cap on what you pay in premium prices. keep that in mind when you consider a skilled nursing facility costs average around $400/day ~ $12000/month . that's why the ltc market is very limited ,because someone with a chronic disease and no other major health issues could live 5-10 years needing a high-level of care. no insurance company wants to be out $1mln in payouts. folks that currently have ltc plans are facing rising premiums every year like 20-30% increases.so i've looked everywhere and it seemsbasically the middle class is screwed. if your wealthly you can self-insure and just get a live-in caregiver or nurse , if your poor or indigent medicaid will cover you (but quality of care is atrocious in most cases) , middle class is stuck does anyone here have any experience with this? or any good alternatives?",Are there any reasonable Long Term Care insurance options in 2020?,"          if your wealthly you can self-insure and just get a live-in caregiver or nurse , if your poor or indigent medicaid will cover you (but quality of care is atrocious in most cases) , middle class is stuck does anyone here have any experience with this? or any good alternatives? are there any reasonable long term care insurance options in 2020?",0

5z4k56,"hi everyone.first of all, excuse my english, i'm from belgium so english is not my native language.my grandmother is in the early stages of dementia and i don't really know what to do anymore. for a while now everyone in my family has noticed my grandmother forgetting small things. the address my girlfriend works at (she still knows the company though), the name of our cat,... small things like that.when things became worse we decided it was time to have her tested. at the hospital where she did some tests it became clear she couldn't interpret time anymore. when asked what year it was she said 2013 while it was 2016 at the time.the doctor suspected alzheimer's although further testing needed to be done so we booked her an appointment for the tests a few weeks later.when the appointment approached the hospital for some stupid reason decided to call my grandmother, asking if she still wanted to go through with her appointment. so of course she says no, because she forgot what it was about and she believes the doctors are trying to pull a scam on her by having her do as many appointments as possible so they get paid alot.this of course put us quite a few steps back, as she absolutely does not want to visit the hospital to get diagnosed now.in the meantime my grandfather, who also happened to be diagnosed with kahler's disease at the meantime (cancer of the bloodcells), has to cope with my grandmother who is becoming increasingly aggressive and forgetful.every week they do groceries together and every week they bring home the same things they already have 9 of because she believes they ran out.when my grandfather points this out she becomes angry and doesn't believe him and even throws a fit right in the middle of the store.anyway, i'm drifting. i would like to know if there are any possibilities of getting my grandmother to the hospital to get a diagnose, i already know what dementia eventually does to people but i would like for my grandfather to have it easier. perhaps if she can take some meds that calm her down it would be a huge help.also if she has to be admitted to a nursing home it would be easier if she has a diagnose.it's just so hard because everytime the word doctor is pronounced she just immediately refuses any cooperation and we can't really tie her down and drag her to the hospital for tests.does anyone have some tricks?thanks for letting me vent and providing advice everyone. stay strong.",Need advice,              perhaps if she can take some meds that calm her down it would be a huge help.also if she has to be admitted to a nursing home it would be easier if she has a diagnose.it's just so hard because everytime the word doctor is pronounced she just immediately refuses any cooperation and we can't really tie her down and drag her to the hospital for tests.does anyone have some tricks?thanks for letting me vent and providing advice everyone.    ,2

5rto1f,"hi,i'm looking for some advice on my grandfather / dad (there is two of us here, however the grandson is typing so i'll be typing from my point of view), this is a **big post so i'm sorry** but if anyone could have a read and provide me with some advice i would greatly appreciate it!--# noticeable onsetin 2015 we started to notice that my granddad had the start of dementia/alzheimer's and we spoke to his doctor (with his wife/my nan) to make them aware and see if they could do anything but for some reason they said that they are unable to do anything or say anything to him until he asks/mentions it...# 6 months laterabout 6 months later he had a tia (transient ischemic attack) and was taken to hospital, they released him the next morning but started him on some tablets.# 6 to 12 months laterwithin the next 6 months several people like his neighbors mentioned that he is forgetting things and repeats himself lots.# other attacks &amp; hospital visits.since then, he's had a few more smaller tia's and we notice his memory is getting worse and worse, he can't remember going to the hospital in the last 5 years (even though he's been 5 or so times, twice by ambulance).# confusionhe repeats himself a crazy amount of times, even sometimes in very quick succession. he misplaces things like his keys, phone, hat, chargers... etc and gets confused with even the simplest of things that 10 years ago he would have been able to do just fine, he's broken several things lately from trying to ""fix"" them himself because he would have normally been able to fix them but now he just does things wrong.we recently installed new taps in the kitchen and bathroom and within a month he had broken the taps in the bathroom because he tried to undo them because ""they felt broken"" which is just because they are different and could be turned easily where as his old taps had broken and were pretty fused up.he purchased a new door bell recently and he brought it over unable to get it to work so he wanted me to have a look at it, he had tried to open the doorbell to fix it and had damaged all of the plastic where he was trying to push a screwdriver into it to open it up when all he had to do was pull the plastic tab (it said ""pull me out"" on it) to get the battery to connect. i let him take it home and we said we'd come and put it up on the weekend (2 days away), when we turned up he had been trying to open it up again because it ""wasn't working"", he had forgotten that he had brought it over and the only thing required was to put it up on the wall.# violence/angerhe get's quite angry when he gets confused and he's also been a little violent towards my nan by punching her on the arm on multiple occasions, we've spoken to him about this and told him that he can not do this, we've also spoken to my nan and told her not to wind him up. it starts of by him forgetting something and then my nan goes on at him over whatever it was and he gets angry and ends up being aggressive. since we spoke to her about it he has been fine as she has been doing what we told her of not making a fuss over it, just let it go even if it's very annoying.# repeating himselfspeaking to him a few days ago, he repeated the same story to us about 5 times within the space of 10 minutes. we don't bother saying anything instead we listen to the same story 5 times. he however isn't aware that he's told us.# recent scansover the past month he's also been having a few mri scans and memory tests to check for any changes with his brain, however he still doesn't really tell any of the family (or his wife) the results and probably forgets the results by the time he gets home.my granddad was spoken to on a 1 to 1 basis with my dad in the car when they were coming back from his mri scan and my granddad said that he didn't think he had anything wrong with his memory, my dad thought this was the perfect opportunity to talk to him and he told him straight up that he did believe that he though there ""was something going on with his memory"" but that there isn't anything to worry about and that he should just get on with life and enjoy himself. after he got home and my dad had left, he apparently broke down in tears and got upset over it all. we actually went down the next morning and already he had forgotten most of the previous day and didn't mention dad thinking he has something going on. i could tell him the upcoming winning lottery numbers though (he asks all the time if i can get him the winning lottery numbers as i am always able to help fix things for him) and within an hour he would have more than likely forgotten them.# getting lost...the biggest worry with him for us is him getting lost, he goes out in the car (doesn't tell anyone where he's going) and goes off at hours at a time, we don't know if he gets lost or what is going on.what we really kind of need is to get a tracker on his car/on his keys but we don't want to appear or be invasive for his privacy, the main reason we want a tracker is to make sure he's safe and ok, there's been many occasions over the last two years where it's 11 at night and he's not home after going down to the pub, he's not told his wife where he is and she obviously gets very worried, upset and scared. we have to go out and try and find him. he just doesn't understand and laughs at it every time.we noticed a note in the kitchen about a ""loan"" and we're not sure what that is about, he says he doesn't know what it was about either and we're obviously a little worried that he might be in trouble with money and also a bit worried that he seeing someone on the side (i wouldn't be surprised, likewise our nan wouldn't be surprised) and maybe giving her money (even though the money he has is equally shared between him and his wife)# taking control...we've already kind of taken some form of control by speaking to the pharmacy (with him being there) and getting agreeing that no changes to his tablets or how they are delivered can be made by him without one of us being there because he gets confused and has changed delivery of his tablets several times causing himself lots of stress, the staff at the pharmacy stress and causing himself to have to wait a few days without any tablets.# forgetting to do things like eating, brushing his teeth, wearing a coat... etche forgets to eat and has to be reminded by his wife constantly, if she was to pass away he would quickly get into a state and either not eat enough and become unwell or just get dirty because he forgets to brush his teeth

511bjh,back last january our uncle fell and was sent to a nursing home. he was diagnosed with wernicke-korsakoff syndrome because he was being detoxed (always a heavy drinker). since he was all alone living in a retirement community by himself my sister and i decided to get guardianship of him and transferred him to an assisted living place. it is much nicer there and they have been giving rehab so he could walk again after he fell right before he went in. when we visit him he has been confusing my sister with our mother and refers to the place as his class (he used to be a teacher before he retired). also at night he seems to suffer from sundowners syndrome. i am starting to believe he has straight up dementia and not was originally believed that he has. when cleaning up his house we found notes all over the place reminding him to do things. this might have been going on for a while prior to his accident. does anyone have a ruff idea of what stage he might be in at this point and how many more years he might be around? i am trying to learn more about the disease so i can deal with the issue better. thanks.,Recently found out 69 year old uncle has Dementia,                  does anyone have a ruff idea of what stage he might be in at this point and how many more years he might be around?      ,0

hxe40n,"to start i live in england and recently my grandfather has become extremely paranoid and has made multiple attempts to kill us aswell as many threats this seems to be due to him having damage from a stroke last year aswell as cancer in his kidney and he's displaying symptoms of alzheimers (that hasn't been diagnosed but speculated by us and his doctor).he isn't physical stong enough to hurt us via his previous attempts (strangulation being his most common so far) however he has set traps where he looks defenceless but hides weapons - luckily we spotted them before hand. he doesn't sleep much as he believes we would kill him in his sleep instead he'll make blood curdling screams for help aswell as shout abuse all throughout the day and night. this usually stops when the nurses or anyone else arrives so we taped him and showed it however that didn't do anything.most of us are sleep deprived and yet even though he barely sleeps he seems to never run out of energy.all it would take is for him to find the right moment and i believe he could really hurt someone or himself. it took 3 of us to remove his walking stick cane (which he had used to attempt to strangle my auntie while she was eating) and 2 of us to remove a butter knife (it couldn't do much but if he ever got hold of a sharper knife well that would be worrying).we've hid stuff but he has his ways - today we found him with a long strap of fabric which he said he would use to strangle us or the nurse.he has some troubles moving but he also fakes some of it - i think to try and trick us.we just want help but everyone keeps refering us to the next person and it's going around in circles. i just don't want anything to happen, any suggestions on where to go with this? am i overreacting? is there a better place to post/ask this question? his attacks have all became more common the past couple of days the screaming/lack of sleep has been going for for over a year. i understand solutions take time but i just wanted to know if there is anything out there that could help?thank you for reading!",Where to go when no one seems to help?,"        i just don't want anything to happen, any suggestions on where to go with this?       i understand solutions take time but i just wanted to know if there is anything out there that could help?thank you for reading!

xihwg,"x-postso this is a really long story, but the short version is i moved into an apartment in january and the situation with the landlord went south real quick. turns out she's senile and/or in the developing stages of dementia/alzheimer's and she's literally impossible to deal with. so after a few months of living in constant fear of being seen coming and going (she lives next door...) and sparking a confrontation that inevitably led to police coming and the entire neighborhood coming out to watch the fireworks, shit hit the fan in a big way this past monday and we bailed.so i leave work early and get to the apartment and the situation escalated from an 8 to about 100 as soon as her and her (equally out-of-her-mind) daughter see me. they call the police, say that nobody gets to take any of their stuff unless i leave (the reason why they hate me is the long part of the story) so out of deference to my friends i bail. i was told to come back and get my stuff when everybody else was done, so i enlisted a few friends and we did just that. when we were about to leave the situation went sour, police were called, i was bit twice, punched probably 20+ times by this little old lady. it was ugly. the police, obviously tired of having to deal with this crazy old woman and her bullshit, picked that exact moment to become ambivalent towards the whole situation. i was forced to take all of my property, put it back in the house, and was told that if i wanted it i'd ""just have to take her to court."" i've since been back to the police office twice and am met with at best indifference, but more commonly outright hostility at the nerve i have coming in there and thinking that i have a right to my own property. so obviously the police have no interest in helping me, and if i actually have to take my landlord to court to get my stuff back it's going to end up in a landfill before i ever see any of it again. most of it i couldn't care less about, all of my clothes have been at my girlfriend's for a while but there is some stuff with a lot of sentimental value attached to it that i'll never be able to replace and that's the stuff i really care about.reddit, what do i do?","Landlord is holding my property hostage, police couldn't care less.

susnaa,"so i replied with something similar to this in another thread on this sub but i wanted to hear if anyone else has had different results. my mother (80) passed last year from cancer. before she did, she was pretty much incapacitated from a hip replacement due to a fracture in cancer riddled bone. she was a very difficult individual all of her life and became much more so with illness. no dementia so no way to have her declared incompetent. however, she essentially refused all outside help and was demanding round the clock care to the point that my father and i didn't get more than 2 hours of sleep at a time for nearly two months outside of those times she was hospitalized.we were at the end of our ropes and truly unable to safely take care of everything she needed by the end. each time she was at the hospital we would communicate this to the doctors and social workers. and each time they sent her home anyway with nothing more than a list of services to call despite us explaining that she wouldn't accept the outside help. we tried hiring people and refusing to do all of the care while that person was available but mom would scream and refuse help form them to the point that they all felt they had to immediately hit for liability reasons.we tried eps who again just gave us lists and also pretty much said that as long as she was in the house we had to care for her if we couldn't keep other caregivers there. not that we wouldn't have cared for her just that we were trying to see if there was a way to force her to accept even a modicum of outside assistance before one or both of us had a psychotic break due to stress and sleep deprivation. the answer is that there is no way unless they are declared incompetent.the point is, pretty much every post suggests handling a difficult elder by telling the doctors, social workers or eps that they aren't safe at home like that is some magic bullet that will fix things and it's not. the hospital is not going to keep them more than a few days extra, they are not going to force them into rehab or care, and they are going to expect anyone that is resident in the same house to see to it that care is provided no matter what the situation.","""The home situation is not safe"" advice is NOT a magic bullet",                         ,0

d21zpn,"cross-posted at someone's advice from r/relationships for context, my mom used to work in entertainment when she was around my age and up until 30 or so, and was relatively well-known, so i get why she is extra cautious about certain things like making sure the blinds are down and thinking that people are staring at her or paying her extra unwanted attention - it probably has literally happened to her. she was also harassed at her last job by her (male) boss, which i'm sure fuels her reasoning for this kind of behavior...but increasingly over the last ten years or so, and especially over the last couple, she's been saying some things that i think are completely ridiculous. for example, we've been having some issues with hot water consistency in our shower recently but apparently none of the neighbors in our apartment that she's asked have had the same problem, and she's convinced that the landlord (who admittedly is slightly sketch) is tampering with our hot water in order to provoke her because he has it out for her and/or wants her attention. another example - a nice scarf we bought went missing a few years ago and she's convinced the landlord broke into our apartment and stole it. or an example not involving the landlord - she reads a lot of anti-""country x"" (preserving anonymity) news online and follows that stuff on social media, and when our wifi goes out she tells me it's because country x is trying to sabotage her (or broadly, people who are anti-country x). i think she also reads a lot of sensationalist news about robberies and murders and kidnappings and whatnot, and so is pretty paranoid anytime i leave the house, but maybe that's just a mom thing?my grandfather exhibited similar paranoia towards the end of his life (according to her, and no formal diagnosis of anything - he would occasionally tell my mom that his caretaker at the nursing home wanted to kill him), and she both acknowledges his paranoia and does not believe she's wrong about any of the things she's saying. i tell her she sounds crazy and make the comparison to my grandfather, and she obviously does not take that well and tells me that she just won't confide in me about these things going forward, which isn't what i want - i just want to shake some sense into her. i don't know what to do - like yes, country x is pretty messed up and i'm sure they do some pretty sketchy surveillance shit, but i doubt they have the capacity to fuck around with our wifi all the way in america... and yes, our landlord is kinda sketch but who the fuck breaks into an apartment just to steal a scarf and spends their time messing with one person's hot water? none of this is well-received, she has shot down every suggestion i make about a therapist (she doesn't trust strangers with her secrets and personal life), and i have no idea what to do, or how worried i should be.i should also take care to mention that all she does is talk about this stuff - she doesn't behave erratically or do anything crazy besides occasionally being moody/in a bad mood because she thinks xyz. i also suspect a lot of the country x paranoia is fueled by the amount of stuff she reads on the internet, but that doesn't really account for the landlord stuff...someone on r/relationships mentioned something about early onset dementia. in all other respects she has everything 100% together - she's the family planner, family accountant, family organizer... from a life/care-taking perspective she's probably the most capable person i know! but this paranoia is really starting to worry me.any ideas/guidance, please?",My (24F) mom (56F) is exhibiting increasingly paranoid behavior and I don't know what to do,"          i think she also reads a lot of sensationalist news about robberies and murders and kidnappings and whatnot, and so is pretty paranoid anytime i leave the house, but maybe that's just a mom thing?my grandfather exhibited similar paranoia towards the end of his life (according to her, and no formal diagnosis of anything - he would occasionally tell my mom that his caretaker at the nursing home wanted to kill him), and she both acknowledges his paranoia and does not believe she's wrong about any of the things she's saying.   i don't know what to do - like yes, country x is pretty messed up and i'm sure they do some pretty sketchy surveillance shit, but i doubt they have the capacity to fuck around with our wifi all the way in america... and yes, our landlord is kinda sketch but who the fuck breaks into an apartment just to steal a scarf and spends their time messing with one person's hot water?       but this paranoia is really starting to worry me.any ideas/guidance, please?

fqy178,"right now i'm terrified for my father, sister, and mother (they all live together) because of covid-19 and my father's stubborn refusal to exercise basic hygiene. this has been a problem long before the corona virus reared it's ugly head. but it's especially bad now because my sister has to yell at him and endure a huge fight simply to get him to wash his hands before eating dinner (he'll argue that he already washed them just an hour ago). and he complains about being ""ordered around"" when my mom and sister insist on him washing up when he returns from an outing to the doctor (thankfully, that is the only time he leaves the house because his physical condition makes going out difficult). so now i'm afraid to even go to their house because i'm pregnant and scared of catching the virus.&amp;#x200b;i had been mulling over finding a way to see if he needs to be committed due to his issues long before the covid-19 risk (i suspect that some of his behavior might be the early signs of dementia and/or other mental decline). but i wonder if i should try to get it done asap because his childish refusal to wash up regularly is putting himself and others at risk (my mother has a lung condition and is cleaning like a madwoman with ocd to compensate for my father's carelessness). and, if i did seek out resources from somewhere like adult protective services, will they be too overburdened by the covid-19 crisis to help?&amp;#x200b;i honestly don't expect anyone to have a clear answer. i just wanted to vent and see if anyone else here was struggling with an elderly relative who is refusing to adhere to basic hygiene/safety protocols in order to protect themselves and their family from this virus",Struggling with Father's hygiene issues,"            and, if i did seek out resources from somewhere like adult protective services, will they be too overburdened by the covid-19 crisis to help?&amp;#x200b;i honestly don't expect anyone to have a clear answer.

f90an4,"hello fellow carers. i have a question that up till now i have not been brave enough to ask out loud to anyone about advanced parkinson‚Äôs. i am caring alone for my father who is 19 years into parkinson‚Äôs, and recently developed associated parkinson‚Äôs dementia. it is pretty clear that he is at the advanced stage by now. it goes without saying that this is emotionally and physically just horrible.i am just wondering (please excuse any insensitivity) how long the advanced stage can last before the inevitable end? crikey i hate even writing that.....i have not posed this question on any parkinson‚Äôs forum, because i am aware there are those suffering from parkinson‚Äôs who read and post on there and so do not want to hurt or scare anyone.however, this has been playing on my mind a great deal. as much as i love my father and don‚Äôt want to lose him, i hope it‚Äôs not unkind to not wish him to be suffering much longer like this. some days he is doing ok, but other days like today, he is lost and bent double shuffling and all that comes with this bloody awful disease.",How long can Advance stage/End stage Parkinson‚Äôs last?,        it goes without saying that this is emotionally and physically just horrible.i am just wondering (please excuse any insensitivity) how long the advanced stage can last before the inevitable end?       how long can advance stage/end stage parkinson‚äôs last?,0

g1bkho,"sorry if this is the wrong place, everywhere else seemed empty and not active, figured this was my best shot. so, as the title says, i was just offered a job as a caretaker. i helped my mother take care of her parents (grandfather had alzheimer's and parkinson's and grandmother had dementia), but other than that i don't have much experience, and my possible employers know this.i'm just concerned about one thing, and it is quite silly really, but that's bathroom stuff. i never really helped out with bathroom stuff, that was all my mom, so i'm not sure how i'd handle it on the job, let alone with potential strangers. does anyone have experience in this area, taking care of their ageing parents?  does it get easier/less awkward with time? is it easy to ignore certain things while trying to help them out and maintain their dignity? just looking for some advice i guess. thanks!","I was offered a job as a Caretaker, for elderly people in their own homes.

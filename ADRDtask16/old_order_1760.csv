8a726n,in addition to the title we have a young couple that are providing day to day services for my mother so she can stay in her house. the problem is that she is now constantly convinced that my dad should be home any minute and calls me looking for him. it takes a few solid minutes of explaining that he passed away about 30 years ago and that i'm here for her. my question is...what is the best way to answer her questions? do i just keep explaining the current situation to her? is there a better option? i'm not a big reader but i'm open to suggestions on reading material regarding this situation. thanks reddit.,0
4s7paw,"i assume you all are far more educated on this than i am, i'm just trying to figure out how i should go about doing something.so my grandfather just died of cancer last night, but his wife (they still lived together) has pretty bad alzheimer's. he died right next to her and it's been about 20 hours now, but she still doesn't know. each time my mom or my dad has tried to tell her, she laughs and doesn't get it. she either thinks it's a joke or she says ""he just needs sleep.""do we just let her live in an ignorance is bliss scenario, or do we keep trying to tell her that her husband is dead? and if we do tell her, how should we go about doing that? a direct approach didn't seem very effective.",2
vrxgk6,"my grandmother is mid stage, and in the past month or two, something new that has come up, is a couple times a week she will get upset and insist she's not in her house, despite living there for 51 years. this will go on for hours, sometimes the whole day. she gets very depressed and upset over it. she remembers her address, she remembers the city, but she insists she is living in an apartment in ""a town i don't know the name of"" and goes on and on about how much she hates it there and wants to go home. telling her it is her home, and trying to get her to recognize some of her belongings doesn't help, it just makes her very mad and she starts yelling that she's not crazy. telling her she will be going home next week, and everything will be back to normal then doesn't help either. she remains depressed and upset and lamenting about wanting to go home right away. trying to redirect the conversation to another topic doesn't help either, she goes right back to talking about wanting to go home. we're not sure *what* to say to her on the days she gets like this. is this one of those things where there is nothing to do? we just have to deal with her being upset/depressed on these days?",1
pf1194,"i can't say for certain but i'm pretty sure my grandma has some form of dementia. she's 86 and doesn't have very good vision so she keeps seeing things, she says to be quiet because her mother is sleeping or that she can't go to her bed cuz her mom is there even though her mother has been dead for decades, she keeps mixing me up with my uncle and dad. she keeps seeing more kids and just all-around things that aren't real. whenever she does something like this i usually try to answer very vaguely like when she talks about her mother i just say she's not here and don't mention that she's dead. i only start arguing that she's getting something wrong when she does things like tries to go home at 12 pm when she is at the only home we have, or when she stays up at 1 am waiting for the burial of her parents. so i wanted to ask, should i keep being vague about things or should i disagree and try to explain that she's seeing things or getting them wrong?",2
3drjwd,"my grandma has alzheimers and has been declining mentally for about 5 years now. in the last couple of years or so, there have been a few occasions in which i had the chance to visit my grandparents in spain (i live in the uk) and i instead stayed at home because i had exams coming up or other things that seem very trivial now. in the last two months, i fear she has basically completely gone. she now often struggles to remember who my grandfather is and the last time i saw her, she seemed to be under the impression that i was one of her sons. obviously i don't really want to see her in her current state but i know she's not going to get better and it wouldn't be right to miss another chance to see her. basically, what i want to ask is how do i go about talking with her? do i pretend to be her son or remind her that i'm actually her grandson? if she doesn't recognise me and is afraid, do i walk away? if she talks about going home (they're moving to sheltered housing), what do i say? i've read that music can be very good for reanimating people so i'm going to burn a cd of her favourite songs and bring that with me. sorry this is so rambling, i find it difficult even to talk about it online. thanks in advance",0
tpoqy8,"my current job is taking care of an elderly couple in their home. both are 89. the wife has dementia (likely alzheimer's in my opinion, but not officially diagnosed as of yet) that has been steadily progressing in the year i've been with them. she's still pretty aware, but has moments of confusion, including a consistent belief that she is in the wrong place and wanting to go home. i have plenty of experience managing these symptoms, and if it's just me and her i'm easily able to placate or redirect her before she gets upset. the problem is her husband. he is very aware with only minor lapses in short term memory, and very headstrong, which leads to him constantly arguing with her. it's an incredibly draining cycle: wife mentions wanting to ""go home tonight,"" i overhear her and start trying to change the subject, husband interrupts me to insistently tell her that they are home, have lived here for decades, she can't drive to go anywhere anyway, etc., which greatly agitates and upsets her, and i am left to deal with the fallout as she goes to bed and cries. i enjoy caring for these two, but the worse her symptoms get the more this becomes a daily occurrence, and it's making me dread coming to work in the morning. i regularly have conversations with the husband explaining the right way to handle her, and he seems to understand at the time, but the next time she says something wrong he's right back to it. it's absolutely killing me. i know it can be hard to convince older people to change in their ways, but is there anything i can do to help this man react better to his wife's dementia?",2
rgk9zg,"hi everyone, i'm a bit torn about this so i thought maybe someone here had some helpful advice.my grandma (92) lives in a nursing home, and has dementia. she hid it for a good while, but it became apparent just how bad it is when my grandpa died last year. she thinks she is temporarily in the hospital and wants to go home, but by home she means the family farm, where she hasn't lived since she was a teen. she sometimes recognizes my dad and aunt, but often she doesn't, since she thinks they are kids. other than them i don't think she recognizes a lot of people very often.and here is my dilemma: my dad recently mentioned to me that she might be getting close to death and if i would want to visit her a last time i should do so soon. my grandma was a lovely part of my childhood and it pained me so much that i didn't get to see my grandpa before he died. but on the other hand, she will most likely have no idea who i am, but she will fake it since she has gotten used to that after hiding it for so many years. so maybe a visit will just stress her out without doing anything good for her? right now my last moment with her was at my granddads funeral where she in a clear moment marched over to me, took my hand, looked deeply into my eyes and said ""he loved you very much you know?"" which is quite lovely.so yeah, i'm torn about if i should go see her or not, thoughts and advice is appreciated",0
hiqeow,"f)so my (36f) grandmother's (84f) dementia has progressed aggressively in the last year, to the point that her short-term memory is pretty much gone and her long-term memory is also fading. in the last few months, especially, we've seen a lot of behavioral changes, such as sundowning, paranoia, and general nastiness toward her friends and nurses at her assisted living facility. i've known two other people with alzheimer's/dementia and was prepared to deal with these symptoms.but she's also demonstrating a symptom i haven't seen before- not memory *loss*, per se, but memory *shift,* regarding something pretty significant. her attitude about my grandfather has dramatically shifted in the last few months, from missing him terribly (he died in 2005) to outright resentment and sometimes hatred. she won't articulate exactly why she's changed her mind so quickly, although once she did say that she felt like he'd abandoned her when he died, which i get. and while she wouldn't tell me, she's apparently divulged some disturbing things about him to my mother that are completely out of character. this man waited on her hand and foot, and neither my mom nor i can ever remember seeing him angry, let alone violent. so, i'm wondering if she has somehow conflated something she saw on tv or read in the newspaper with her own memories and that's part of this shift? in the past, she's watched a lot of cop dramas like ncis and csi, and i suspect some of this has bled into her memories as a justification for her feelings. has anyone else seen this kind of thing happen? and if so, how did you deal with it?",2
5cgsho,"my grandma is 83 and has had early dementia for the past two years and she keeps telling us she wants to go home to her ""house in the woods."" she tells us this multiple times a day, when she's at the house she's lived in for 50+ years. nothing's changed at the house it still looks the same etc. she starts to get agitated and insists we take her home. this is really the only thing that she does besides asking the same thing over and over and it only happens early in the morning or late at night. i don't get frustrated at her, because i know she can't help it, but it does make me sad because she's like a second mom to me and has been all of my life.does anyone know why she does this and how to help? it makes me sad because i wonder why she doesn't recognize the home she's lived in for so long. thanks for any help.",1
i8dv4p,"so along with my mother and the help of an aid, i have been taking care of my grandmother for the past 4 years. the last month she has progressed very rapidly. she is currently bed ridden at home and we have to pick her up to get her to the bathroom and force any liquids we can get into her. after that she just lays down and stares with her eyes half open occasionally making a few sounds but no intelligible words until she falls asleep. does she understand me? is there any way i can make her more comfortable? are people this advanced in pain or aware of anything? we are determined to let her pass away in the house but we have no clue how long that will be.",0
27zjyu,"i think my mom might be exhibiting early signs of alzheimer's. she's 57. we have been noticing some mood changes in the last 5-10 years - mostly more aggressive behavior or being oblivious to things around her. she's become addicted to online games (angry birds and the like). she also doesn't sleep, but ends up falling asleep at work instead. and just today, while talking to my sister, she forgot her granddad's name. i only talk to her about once a month, but my sister talks to her daily (usually about my niece). my sister and i both live thousands of miles away from mom &amp; dad, so it's not an easy thing to go check up on them in person. i usually make the trip once or twice a year.the burden of taking care of my parents will inevitably fall to me, as i am more financially stable and have no children.my question is: how do i get her to recognize problems and see a dr?we've tried addressing her declining mental state the past few years, to no avail. mom is defensive and dad is overwhelmed and in denial. but something needs to be done. what were your first steps with an affected relative?",0
hjg1z2,"any advice on communicating a move?we are moving my grandma from assisted living into an adult family home on friday. i‚Äôm trying to figure out the best way to tell her friday that she is transitioning to her new home. she is very attached to her current place of residence, but can no long afford it and needs higher level of care. she is not going to want me to touch any of her things, so i‚Äôm not sure how logistically this is going to work. i tried telling her yesterday about the move, saying that i‚Äôm excited we found her a beautiful home to live in, with a couple other ladies so she will never be lonely. i gave her a lot of positive points, but she got very upset and told me i‚Äôm throwing her out with the trash and that she refuses to move. she of course remembers nothing today... i‚Äôm just quite concerned as to how to make this as best a transition for her as possible?",0
cgh5xb,"okay, i admit. this may sound weird. but my grandma has alzheimers for like 3 years now, and it's getting to the point where we soon have to put her in a nursing home. meanwhile i have to look after her sometimes since she can't be alone. but i'm struggling with talking to her and i'm not sure how to manage everything.some of the points i struggle a lot with1) her not really understanding me. we were outside watering some plants and it took a lot of time like 30-45mins to explain her that we already watered some of them.2) she hates my aunt that lives with her. my aunt usually takes care of them, since she lives in the house as well, but in a seperate apartment. she constantly bad mouthes her and tells me how much she hates her. she isn't on bad terms with her and never was, but i'm not sure what to do in these moments.3) she is really possessive sometimes. we were picking plums and she promised some to the neighbours, but she got really defensive and screamed that these are hers. i tried explaining it and showing the other bucket full of them to her but it was like she was throwing a tantrum.so, is there any advice on how to handle this? i'm kind of overwhelmed with everything.",0
4pfjsv,"recently, my 93 y.o. grandma has been waking up in the middle of the night, ringing her assistance bell, and asking me when ""the people will come to take her home."" no matter what i do (therapeutic lying, distraction, redirection, just plain 'ol explaining where she is)--about 1-2 minutes later she's back to asking when ""the people"" are coming, and does her family know where she is, etc. she's lived with us for a year and half now, but this ""i need to go home"" particularly in the middle of the night is a recent development..like 2ish months. i've tried changing her diet, keeping her more busy during the day so she's more tuckered out at night, i even took her to her doctor to make sure there wasn't any kind of underlying issue that was exacerbating/causing the increased anxiety. i feel terrible that mentally she feels like she's in a foreign place--but neither she or i can afford to keep waking up 3-4 times a night, spending an hour each time trying to make the other one understand. i'm sort of at a loss, and was wondering if anyone has any tips or tricks? or should i just keep on truckin and get used to lots of day naps?",1

5au0vr,"hey guys, i'm looking for a little advice. my grandmother is one of the most intelligent people i know, she's an accomplished lawyer, a self sufficient woman, and an all around great person. i love her dearly, but i'm becoming concerned about her cognitive abilities. she's beginning to repeat the same stories over and over, sometimes only a day apart. she often forgets her wallet, her phone, or the location of her car keys. she's even starting to forget the names of the streets she drives on every day. my accounts have all been confirmed by other people in her life. so i guess the root of my question is, am i right to be concerned. and if so, how do i bring it up to her? do i go over her head to her sons who live many states away? i'm just feeling a little lost right now, and any advice you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated.",0

muo7oq,"hi all, i would love some advice on how to approach my mother in law and father in law (if at all) about her showing dementia signs. please know that i only want to help her.my mother in law is 65 years old, and had an extremely traumatic upbringing which has undoubtedly affected her adult life, so it is hard to find the line to draw between trauma and possible dementia signs.i have known her for about 10 years and in the last 2 years i and another family member have notice a huge decline in the following areas:-telling the same story every single time we speak, dozens of times-paranoia that everyone is looking at her and speaking about her-inability to follow simple stories that were telling her- for example, stories about our day, or instructions-falling out with all of her friends-forgetting appointments and family plans -inability to sleep, constantly complaining about insomnia and waking up at 3am-increased extremely heavy alcohol consumption, regularly 2-3 bottles of wine per night and she says it‚Äôs ‚Äúto help her sleep‚Äù.things to note:i have tried to speak to my husband (her son) about this so many times and he becomes defensive, saying that i‚Äôm just being mean to her. i have spoken to my sister in law and she has noticed the same things that i have noticed. we have tried to speak to our father in law (her husband) and he just brushes it off saying that she‚Äôs doing crossword puzzles so she‚Äôll be fine. i feel like if i speak to her directly she will get extremely defensive and dismissive.so my question is, is there anything we can actually do or say to help her?! are there early intervention techniques? or do we just watch her deteriorate?",0
b2uk7d,"hello all,newbie here, and this is my story. i (25m) live with my grandmother (65f), who at the same time, is a parent to me as i have been living with her since birth. over the past five years or so, she has slowly been experiencing cognitive decline. her memory is foggy, she forgets where she places things, forgets what day/time/month/year it is (and is constantly asking me what day it is etc), and suffers from symptoms of paranoia regarding theft of possessions and things of that nature. the reason i am posting here is because, about a month ago, she remarked to me how she wanted to go see her sister (who, for context, lives 2000 miles away) and how we had already seen her that past weekend. when i told her that was not the case, she flipped and got argumentative with me, so i dropped it. i try to explain in succinct and helpful ways about things etc when she asks, but to no avail. most of our conversations either begin with her yelling at me, getting mad at me for being so ""abrasive"" towards her, or end with her telling me to shut the hell up (or bringing up past transgressions i have made against her in the past). it seems that she is extremely distrustful of me because of these past issues, and as a result, she seems to believe she is fine. however, i have talked with her sister, as well as her counselor and medication prescriber about these issues, and they agree that it is not a psychosis, but appears to be dementia. she also has trouble taking medication properly (she takes more than the prescribed amount and often runs out before she should).however, my grandmother firmly and adamantly believes that ""she is not that bad"" and that ""it's just adhd""... furthermore, a neurologist who she saw a few months ago suggested a neuropsychological examination to be done, both in order to determine what is going on, and also have a more broad picture of the underlying issues... i just do not know what to do anymore, and it's gotten to the point where her providers are asking me to look after everything for her. and remembering my own issues or appointments etc, on top of her stuff is becoming frustrating, unbearable, and exhausting... i do not have poa or anything of the sort, but her medication prescriber has mentioned to me that we should look into getting that set up.. i just don't know where to turn, what to do, or how to proceed because she fights me and her doctors at every fucking turn... because of this not knowing, i have begun to just give up on helping her and have developed an apathy towards her issues, but at the same time, i want to help her... i just don't know how... (to add, she is eligible for medicare in two months, but does not qualify for medicaid, so i don't know where i stand with long term care options, nor whether or not i can have her admitted locally for this issue if i am concerned for her safety since i don't have poa or anything)... any help?thanks",0

o746rk,"tia for sharing ideas or experience with your own situations. my 76 yr old mom has had a rapid decline and was diagnosed last month with mod-severe alz and vascular dementia. i'm her only child, have not been involved in her personal business until april but now need to manage everything. i'm her only child and just got durable poa.this is a delicate situation- she's far enough along that she can't handle these things herself (doesn't know how to use her phone any more for example), but it seems very important to her to stay involved, probably due to her being a bookkeeper by trade.when i try to involve her to be respectful, she is frustrated, needs extra time to understand, and forgets decisions we already made together. slows the whole process way down. throw on top of that a lifelong tendency to think everyone is out to swindle her, now exacerbated by dementia, and it's a mess.how do i convince her to let go of things that are too complicated for her brain to understand without her feeling alienated? i have my own small children, marriage, and career to tend to and our current method is taking way too long and creating too much frustration for both of us.advice on how to (gracefully) handle this transition? what worked or didn't work for you?thanks much.",0
8oouw4,"my grandmother has been living undiagnosed with dementia for about 3 years now. she refuses to believe shes losing her touch and i am her 34 year old grandson who lives with her and is basically a caretaker because she forgets to eat and take her medication other than that shes fairly independent with basic needs except her stubborn pride. today i had a blow up, she is forgetting one minute to the next, she thinks im belittling her by constantly having to correct her even though im simply stating ""you forget we just talked about this few mins ago"" and in her mind im making it up, she doesn't believe she was just told something or that something has just been explained and its gotten to the point where she now sees me as a bully, a bad person who isnt to be trusted. now the awful part is im going at this alone, her daughters arent interested in trying to help me, or her!! they are in denial as well because they say ""she acts just fine around me"" but they do not see the day to day, hour by hour changes that she goes through and now suddenly im the bad guy!! im afraid to say im gonna have to move out and give her up to herself or simply let her live alone for awhile. she has fallen 3x in one year, she will take her meds over and over forgetting she already took them, but ive gone and done all i can!!! i feel like once im gone, she will hate me for leaving, but if i stay she will hate me anyway so im at a loss....please tell me im not alone in this, can someone relate?",0
oof0do,"my grandmother (78) has always been known for being a bit scatterbrained and making silly remarks, and we‚Äôve always joked about it. last year, my aunt said she was more concerned about my grandmothers memory and that she was becoming more forgetful. we brushed it off as her just having a moment and the fact she is a little bit older, and that was fine. she‚Äôs perfectly lucid and has a quick, sharp wit. i saw her today and now i‚Äôm concerned- she was trying to tell a story about a family member and it took 4 or 5 attempts for her to get the story right, and that was with me asking her to clarify who she was talking about as she was getting names confused and my grandfather also intervened to correct her at one point. on the flip side, she remembered nearly every detail of something insignificant that happened 25 years ago (passing my parents car on a road in a tourist destination). she also has moments of forgetfulness in regard to her short term memory- you may speak to her and tell her you‚Äôre doing something and she‚Äôll completely forget until you remind her and will be like ‚Äúoh yeah‚Äù, and she often confuses details about stories. this is the first time where i am wondering if there is something more than just age-related confusion. can anyone give me advice on next steps or how i should approach this? i‚Äôm going to speak to my mother about it of course, but not sure what else i could do. there‚Äôs no other dementia in the family, apart from an aunt who is 105, so i don‚Äôt have much experience with this‚Ä¶.",0

7pl1gf,"today i received a message that my great-grandma was taken to hospital. my great-grandma is in her early 90s. i'm not sure when or if it was diagnosed but i think she has alzheimer‚Äôs, in which she started showing symptoms for when she was around 86, maybe earlier. in hindsight it's clear to see why but i believe she started showing symptoms of dementia when she started to accuse my uncle and my cousin (his son) of stealing from her, which she adamantly believed happened. this may have coinsided with some home renovation carried out by the council, i'm not sure if anything was actually stolen but she seriously believed my uncle and cousin did it which led to friction and upset. fast forward a year or so later to the next time i saw her and it was clear that her memory was detiorating, she remembered me but she seemed struggled to remember the last time she saw my nan (her ex-daughter-in-law which visited her the day or week before). as i left in the car (with my mother and aunty) i was upset as it was starting to set in that the grandma i loved dearly was starting to fade away, doubled with the news that my mum told me in the car that she also accused her of stealing several items.these accusations have upset my mum deeply and she has not seen my grandma since (i have since learn that accusing people of stealing happens regularly in those diagnosed with alzheimer‚Äôs and told my mum that it wasn't my grandma talking).fast forward another 2 or 3 year later to last september and i went to see her with my nan, which was the first time i saw my grandma since the prior visit (i was conflicted to whether i should go to see my grandma anymore or not her and at the time i didn't know accusing family of stealing was connected to her illness). although i was expecting her memory to have worsened i thought she may she have still remembered me. but it wasn't until she asked who i was, who my mother is and how i was related to her did my heart drop. i had to contain my emotion as i was on the verge of crying infront of her and my nan.i haven't seen her since and i am constantly filled with regrets and emotions...would she still have remembered me if i saw her more often? i can't but help thinking that in her time of need i abandoned her and left her without a reason to why i stopped visiting her. what makes it even harder is that i can't even apologise for what happened and tell her that i'm sorry.",1

""just wanted to let you know i'm going to go cook some food"" ""where is whole foods again?

k0ixvl,"hi all. i've got grandparents living in florida in their own house (ie not any kind of assisted living community) and i just found out today that my grandmother has been diagnosed with alzheimer's. i'll give some quick context to our situation and would love to hear the thoughts/advice of this community.even getting to this point has been difficult -- my grandmother is extremely stubborn and independent, so while we were aware she had been slowly losing her faculties for some time, it took a concerted effort to get to the point of a diagnosis because of a combination of her own stubbornness and her long-time doctor's complacency. my grandfather is still sharp as a tack but wheelchair bound, so he is not in a position to care for both of them.it's clear they need to have more around-the-clock care, but the problem is that my grandmother will never agree to that. she insists there is nothing wrong (i could get into all the examples of how that is not true, but just trust me when i say she needs better help). the problem is she still has some level of lucidity, so we can't force her to do things she doesn't want to do (keep appointments, etc). it is important to mention that most of the family lives in pa, so while we've been trying to help care for things, it's simply not going to be possible for us to give her the level of care she needs. one of my uncles lives close by there and visits often, but he is simply wholly unprepared to deal with how complex the situation has become. obviously i don't think the right thing to do is to wait until she has an accident or hurts my grandfather to take more decisive action. what should we do in this 'in-between' period where she is lucid enough to have her own agency, but will inevitably be in a potentially dangerous situation soon? are there resources we can work with?thanks for reading and appreciate any guidance in advance.",1

b8v3uj,"bit of a tricky situation. my grandma lived with her son, my uncle, and he was her full time carer. she was very dependent on him. sadly, he died last week after a short illness, totally unexpectedly, and now we're all a bit stuck.basically, every few hours she forgets what's happened and asks where he is. if we don't tell her the truth, she gets very anxious because she can tell something is wrong (because we get sad!). if we tell her, she gets very upset very briefly and then literally spends hours asking over and over again who will live with her now, who will move in with her, why can't we move in with her, and it is exhausting and frustrating. we're all grieving my uncle whilst caring for her, taking it in turns to spend days and nights here until we have a care plan put in place, and we're just knackered. is there a better way for us to be dealing with this? is telling her the truth the best thing?",1

r19i54,"my father was admitted to a long term care facility for a fall last year (he is still completely wheel chair bound), and during care for the fall he has had progressing dementia. he is pretty lucid and appropriate most of the time, but it‚Äôs becoming more obvious that he is not going to be able to come home. his facility called me yesterday and told me he has been holding hands daily with another memory care patient for a few weeks now. he is still married to my mother and she visits him daily. my mother has not really accepted that his dementia has changed him. the facility does not know whether to tell my mom, because they know she will be very upset. they have told him that if my mom sees it she will be upset, but he is still doing it. is it my place to talk to my dad about it? should i tell my mother? i never thought about having to deal with something like this. thanks for any advice.",0

seg66o,"i lived with a sweet old couple for a couple months a little while ago. the husband has dementia and his wife was taking care of him.she used to tell me stories about her husband - his success, intelligence, and general business acumen. i could feel the heart break behind her words as her husband had clearly deteriorated over the years to resemble less and less of the person she described..getting alzheimers/dementia honestly terrifies me. as far as i know, it doesn‚Äôt run in my family from my dad‚Äôs side.but my mum was estranged from her family at birth, and i don‚Äôt know if it runs in her family.i‚Äôm 34. is there something i can start doing now to lessen the risks of getting it later?",0

9eig2u,"i am suspecting my mother is experiencing signs of dementia on top of mental illness she's had her whole life that she also refuses to acknowledge. it's getting to a point where i cannot do anything right by her and any sort of interaction and relationship is too stressful for both parties. i am thinking for her (and my own) health and mental well-being i should separate myself from her.what do you think?she's got this bug in her bonnet that i suddenly hate old people like her. i have no idea where this has come from, it's like paranoia on steroids and her own personal vendetta against me (and the world) that has come up.she keeps making bizarre jabs at me, like ""oh young people like you have no patience for us oldies"".... huh? what? i ask for clarification on what she means and what i did to cause her to say that, because honestly if i made her feel that way i'd feel like a piece of shit (and do anyway) so would apologies and make amends... but she couldn't even articulate why she said it and why she believed it. she just dug in her heels that it's obviously how i think because it's ""how all young people these days are"", and couldn't tell me why and how i was displaying that, and that any protest i had toward her about the subject meant that she was right by disrespecting her opinion, and her as my mother.wat. i'm quickly realizing i am not dealing with a sane person, now whether this is mental illness or dementia or a combination i'm just not sure. one thing i know is, getting her to even acknowledge it, or to get any help is never going to happen. my dad is a huge enabler of her, to the point where even if he can see i am being gaslighted and manipulated by her, he will just side with her anyway. she genuinely thinks i'm an awful person, and i feel like crap about it, and there's nothing i can do to change her mind and it's bringing me down mentally and emotionally, and even physically now.how am i supposed to get her help, if she and my dad refuses to acknowledge it. am i supposed to just give up on our relationship entirely and allow her to think these awful horrible things about me?",0

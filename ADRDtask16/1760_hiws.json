        "he just doesn't understand and laughs at it every time.we noticed a note in the kitchen about a \"loan\" and we're not sure what that is about, he says he doesn't know what it was about either and we're obviously a little worried that he might be in trouble with money and also a bit worried that he seeing someone on the side (i wouldn't be surprised, likewise our nan wouldn't be surprised) and maybe giving her money (even though the money he has is equally shared between him and his wife)# taking control...we've already kind of taken some form of control by speaking to the pharmacy (with him being there) and getting agreeing that no changes to his tablets or how they are delivered can be made by him without one of us being there because he gets confused and has changed delivery of his tablets several times causing himself lots of stress, the staff at the pharmacy stress and causing himself to have to wait a few days without any tablets.# forgetting to do things like eating, brushing his teeth, wearing a coat... etche forgets to eat and has to be reminded by his wife constantly, if she was to pass away he would quickly get into a state and either not eat enough and become unwell or just get dirty because he forgets to brush his teeth (his wife reminds him every day), he forgets to put underwear on (his wife reminds him every day) and he forgets to go out with a coat on even though it's supposed to rain later on.# what next?this is all of our first experience with someone with dementia/alzheimer (we're pretty sure it's vascular dementia) and really don't know what to do so any help and advise would be very much welcome and appreciated."

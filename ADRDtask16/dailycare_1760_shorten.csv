eurz96,"however, there are a few things at my parent's place that really need fixing, and we can't seem to get him to agree to accept outside help.does anyone else have any experience with something like this? my father has always been an extremely capable man; he has always done his own (major and minor) building work, plumbing, electrical work, car maintenance, you name it. a few years ago, he was diagnosed with dementia. in general, he's still pretty good, but it's starting to take a real toll on his concentration and reasoning abilities. unfortunately, he's still trying to do complex diy projects (think electrical wiring and heating), and i'm seriously worried that he's going to do something dangerous due to his lack of concentration or otherwise. my parents have been without electricity for days at a time, due to him wiring something up wrong. at the time it was clear to me that he'd got no idea what was wrong, and that he doesn't have the capacity to think through the problem logically.the impossible part with this is that my father won't accept that his reasoning ability is deteriorated; he thinks that he is still capable of doing the work, and that it just takes him longer than it used to; this is definitely not the case, if you try talking to him about it it's clear that it's all jumbled in his head.if i or my mother suggest getting professionals (e.g. electrician, heating engineers) in to help, he gets very angry (and is extremely stubborn; people have said that we just need to ""lay down the law"", there's an approximately 0% chance of that working). i can sometimes reason with him and get him to agree to some things, but it's equally likely that he'll change his mind later on and just refuse. unfortunately i think a lot of it comes down to personality; the same ""i can do anything i set my mind to, never give up"" attitude that made him so incredibly capable previously, have made it seem like getting outside help is ""giving up"", and he's totally set against it.we've tried diverting him away towards other jobs that don't require as much concentration (he was quite happy in the summer making a fruit cage to keep the birds off the raspberries). however, there are a few things at my parent's place that really need fixing, and we can't seem to get him to agree to accept outside help.does anyone else have any experience with something like this?","however, there are a few things at my parent's place that really need fixing, and we can't seem to get him to agree to accept outside help.does anyone else have any experience with something like this?"

e758f2,"i was hoping some of you could share activities that you find to be engaging with your loved ones? hi everyone,my grandma with dementia had a fairly sour marriage to say the least for most of her life, so she often gets stressed or worried about things from her past. doing an engaging activity is key to starting her day off right, keeping her brain active on positive things, and keeping worrying at bay for some time. however, finding activities she would enjoy and engage in has been a struggle. she can't understand what she reads anymore, she has a hard time understanding crafts you put in front of her, and she doesn't follow along well with tv. i've tried a plethora of things that could trigger happy memories from her past, but she wasn't a big hobbyist so i'm running out of ideas. for some examples of what we've tried and where she's at: i've had her bake a pie with me and let her mix things, knead dough, and roll out one of the pie crusts. she didn't exactly enjoy being put to work but it did take her mind off things and the instructions were basic enough that she could follow along well. caused a bit of frustration at first but she kind of enjoyed it halfway through. she loooves loves loves listening to elvis, i can put him on for a good hour before she gets bored and she goes to town with foot tapping in her recliner. i was hoping some of you could share activities that you find to be engaging with your loved ones? we'd be more than happy to try just about anything.thank you for taking the time to read this",i was hoping some of you could share activities that you find to be engaging with your loved ones?

ds7k0d,"or any good alternatives? so i've been looking around and because the insurance industry completely underestimated the high cost and high number of seniors living with chronic conditions (like alzheimer's , parkinson's etc) so their actuarial tables were flawed, and they took a huge losses financially ,.so to resolve this most just left the market (don't write ltc policies anymore) and the remaining ones offer stingy coverage options (most ltc policies have a coverage cap around 5 years) with no rate cap on what you pay in premium prices. keep that in mind when you consider a skilled nursing facility costs average around $400/day ~ $12000/month . that's why the ltc market is very limited ,because someone with a chronic disease and no other major health issues could live 5-10 years needing a high-level of care. no insurance company wants to be out $1mln in payouts. folks that currently have ltc plans are facing rising premiums every year like 20-30% increases.so i've looked everywhere and it seemsbasically the middle class is screwed. or any good alternatives?",or any good alternatives?

8wrs55,"any suggestions would be very welcome. my grandma was diagnosed with dementia only a couple of months ago, although we are suspecting she has probably had it for upwards of five years. within the past few weeks, her symptoms have really dramatically worsened to the point where she is straight up hallucinating things that aren‘t there as well as experiencing worsening cognitive decline.common delusions/hallucinations and other manifestations of her symptoms include:- having conversations with herself- having conversations with people who aren‘t there- misidentification of objects (imagining that my handbag was my dog and saying that his leg was broken)- thinking that it is night when it is day- constantly thinking that we are getting evicted from our house (even though we own it) and trying to pack her belongings- trying to give our dog away by calling up family members and asking if they will take him- saying that i have abused our dog and broken his leg and that we need to take him to the vet (my dog is happy and healthy and he jumps and runs and is very active)- worrying because my grandpa or mum is dying in some way and the police and ambulance need to be called- saying that indian men are outside trying to break into our house to steal our cupboards (the specificity and absurdity of this one absolutely kills me)- getting changed into her sunday‘s best at 2am and putting on her makeup saying we need to be somewhere- saying that someone is cutting a tree down outside- threatening to kill herself and saying that suicide is the only option anymore (she has been saying this for about fifteen years though, none of our family members or psychologists who have seen her think she is very serious about this)we have been struggling substantially over the past few weeks.

inhke3,"any tips?# i recently became the full-time caregiver to my dad, who has parkinson's and dementia. therefore, since he can't hold his bladder for longer than two hours, we've had to start using briefs at night (attends). now we both sleep continuously throughout the night--i tried doing the ""waking up every two hours"" thing, but i was constantly tired and couldn't function during the day.this was doing the trick for a few weeks. but, for whatever reason, he's been urinating extra heavy at night recently. it soaks through his entire brief, pants, and underpad. he's drenched in urine when i wake up in the morning, and i don't like that at all.of course, he gets a shower immediately. i apply a thick layer of barrier cream to his butt before bed (currently using calmoseptine), and i also try to limit the amount of fluids he gets in the evening. i'm super worried about skin breakdown. any tips?#",any tips?#

hxe40n,am i overreacting? to start i live in england and recently my grandfather has become extremely paranoid and has made multiple attempts to kill us aswell as many threats this seems to be due to him having damage from a stroke last year aswell as cancer in his kidney and he's displaying symptoms of alzheimers (that hasn't been diagnosed but speculated by us and his doctor).he isn't physical stong enough to hurt us via his previous attempts (strangulation being his most common so far) however he has set traps where he looks defenceless but hides weapons - luckily we spotted them before hand. he doesn't sleep much as he believes we would kill him in his sleep instead he'll make blood curdling screams for help aswell as shout abuse all throughout the day and night. this usually stops when the nurses or anyone else arrives so we taped him and showed it however that didn't do anything.most of us are sleep deprived and yet even though he barely sleeps he seems to never run out of energy.all it would take is for him to find the right moment and i believe he could really hurt someone or himself. am i overreacting? his attacks have all became more common the past couple of days the screaming/lack of sleep has been going for for over a year.,am i overreacting?

4kkp3r,"things to say/not to say?have any of you tried to maintain a relationship while simultaneously being a caregiver for a parent? i've been dating a girl who lives with and cares for her mother, who has the early signs of alzheimer's. we've been dating for about year, and i'm absolutely in love with this girl.some background on the mom: she is definitely forgetful, but not as much as i would have thought when i first heard that she has alzheimer's. i guess the biggest struggle with the mom is that she doesn't ever want to do _anything_. we try encouraging her to get out of the house and enjoy life and keep exercising her mind, but it is always like twisting her arm to get her to do anything. things to say/not to say?have any of you tried to maintain a relationship while simultaneously being a caregiver for a parent?",things to say/not to say?have any of you tried to maintain a relationship while simultaneously being a caregiver for a parent?

vrxgk6,"my grandmother is mid stage, and in the past month or two, something new that has come up, is a couple times a week she will get upset and insist she's not in her house, despite living there for 51 years. this will go on for hours, sometimes the whole day. she gets very depressed and upset over it. she remembers her address, she remembers the city, but she insists she is living in an apartment in ""a town i don't know the name of"" and goes on and on about how much she hates it there and wants to go home. telling her it is her home, and trying to get her to recognize some of her belongings doesn't help, it just makes her very mad and she starts yelling that she's not crazy. telling her she will be going home next week, and everything will be back to normal then doesn't help either. she remains depressed and upset and lamenting about wanting to go home right away. trying to redirect the conversation to another topic doesn't help either, she goes right back to talking about wanting to go home. we're not sure *what* to say to her on the days she gets like this. is this one of those things where there is nothing to do? we just have to deal with her being upset/depressed on these days?",,1
pf1194,"i can't say for certain but i'm pretty sure my grandma has some form of dementia. she's 86 and doesn't have very good vision so she keeps seeing things, she says to be quiet because her mother is sleeping or that she can't go to her bed cuz her mom is there even though her mother has been dead for decades, she keeps mixing me up with my uncle and dad. she keeps seeing more kids and just all-around things that aren't real. whenever she does something like this i usually try to answer very vaguely like when she talks about her mother i just say she's not here and don't mention that she's dead. i only start arguing that she's getting something wrong when she does things like tries to go home at 12 pm when she is at the only home we have, or when she stays up at 1 am waiting for the burial of her parents. so i wanted to ask, should i keep being vague about things or should i disagree and try to explain that she's seeing things or getting them wrong?",,2
rgk9zg,"so maybe a visit will just stress her out without doing anything good for her? hi everyone, i'm a bit torn about this so i thought maybe someone here had some helpful advice.my grandma (92) lives in a nursing home, and has dementia. she hid it for a good while, but it became apparent just how bad it is when my grandpa died last year. she thinks she is temporarily in the hospital and wants to go home, but by home she means the family farm, where she hasn't lived since she was a teen. she sometimes recognizes my dad and aunt, but often she doesn't, since she thinks they are kids. other than them i don't think she recognizes a lot of people very often.and here is my dilemma: my dad recently mentioned to me that she might be getting close to death and if i would want to visit her a last time i should do so soon. my grandma was a lovely part of my childhood and it pained me so much that i didn't get to see my grandpa before he died. but on the other hand, she will most likely have no idea who i am, but she will fake it since she has gotten used to that after hiding it for so many years. so maybe a visit will just stress her out without doing anything good for her? right now my last moment with her was at my granddads funeral where she in a clear moment marched over to me, took my hand, looked deeply into my eyes and said ""he loved you very much you know?"" which is quite lovely.so yeah, i'm torn about if i should go see her or not, thoughts and advice is appreciated",so maybe a visit will just stress her out without doing anything good for her?,0
3drjwd,"my grandma has alzheimers and has been declining mentally for about 5 years now. in the last couple of years or so, there have been a few occasions in which i had the chance to visit my grandparents in spain (i live in the uk) and i instead stayed at home because i had exams coming up or other things that seem very trivial now. in the last two months, i fear she has basically completely gone. she now often struggles to remember who my grandfather is and the last time i saw her, she seemed to be under the impression that i was one of her sons. obviously i don't really want to see her in her current state but i know she's not going to get better and it wouldn't be right to miss another chance to see her. basically, what i want to ask is how do i go about talking with her? do i pretend to be her son or remind her that i'm actually her grandson? if she doesn't recognise me and is afraid, do i walk away? if she talks about going home (they're moving to sheltered housing), what do i say? i've read that music can be very good for reanimating people so i'm going to burn a cd of her favourite songs and bring that with me. sorry this is so rambling, i find it difficult even to talk about it online. thanks in advance",,0

hiqeow,"f)so my (36f) grandmother's (84f) dementia has progressed aggressively in the last year, to the point that her short-term memory is pretty much gone and her long-term memory is also fading. in the last few months, especially, we've seen a lot of behavioral changes, such as sundowning, paranoia, and general nastiness toward her friends and nurses at her assisted living facility. i've known two other people with alzheimer's/dementia and was prepared to deal with these symptoms.but she's also demonstrating a symptom i haven't seen before- not memory *loss*, per se, but memory *shift,* regarding something pretty significant. her attitude about my grandfather has dramatically shifted in the last few months, from missing him terribly (he died in 2005) to outright resentment and sometimes hatred. she won't articulate exactly why she's changed her mind so quickly, although once she did say that she felt like he'd abandoned her when he died, which i get. and while she wouldn't tell me, she's apparently divulged some disturbing things about him to my mother that are completely out of character. this man waited on her hand and foot, and neither my mom nor i can ever remember seeing him angry, let alone violent. so, i'm wondering if she has somehow conflated something she saw on tv or read in the newspaper with her own memories and that's part of this shift? in the past, she's watched a lot of cop dramas like ncis and csi, and i suspect some of this has bled into her memories as a justification for her feelings. has anyone else seen this kind of thing happen? and if so, how did you deal with it?",,2

7pl1gf,"today i received a message that my great-grandma was taken to hospital. my great-grandma is in her early 90s. i'm not sure when or if it was diagnosed but i think she has alzheimer‚Äôs, in which she started showing symptoms for when she was around 86, maybe earlier. in hindsight it's clear to see why but i believe she started showing symptoms of dementia when she started to accuse my uncle and my cousin (his son) of stealing from her, which she adamantly believed happened. this may have coinsided with some home renovation carried out by the council, i'm not sure if anything was actually stolen but she seriously believed my uncle and cousin did it which led to friction and upset. fast forward a year or so later to the next time i saw her and it was clear that her memory was detiorating, she remembered me but she seemed struggled to remember the last time she saw my nan (her ex-daughter-in-law which visited her the day or week before). as i left in the car (with my mother and aunty) i was upset as it was starting to set in that the grandma i loved dearly was starting to fade away, doubled with the news that my mum told me in the car that she also accused her of stealing several items.these accusations have upset my mum deeply and she has not seen my grandma since (i have since learn that accusing people of stealing happens regularly in those diagnosed with alzheimer‚Äôs and told my mum that it wasn't my grandma talking).fast forward another 2 or 3 year later to last september and i went to see her with my nan, which was the first time i saw my grandma since the prior visit (i was conflicted to whether i should go to see my grandma anymore or not her and at the time i didn't know accusing family of stealing was connected to her illness). although i was expecting her memory to have worsened i thought she may she have still remembered me. but it wasn't until she asked who i was, who my mother is and how i was related to her did my heart drop. i had to contain my emotion as i was on the verge of crying infront of her and my nan.i haven't seen her since and i am constantly filled with regrets and emotions...would she still have remembered me if i saw her more often? i can't but help thinking that in her time of need i abandoned her and left her without a reason to why i stopped visiting her. what makes it even harder is that i can't even apologise for what happened and tell her that i'm sorry.",,1

""just wanted to let you know i'm going to go cook some food"" ""where is whole foods again?

5ap7k2,"hi all, this year has been pretty tough on my family and my grandmother has had to leave her family home (where she was living alone) for a care home due to her deteriorating dementia. she‚Äôs not *bad* - that is to say she still recognises me and others ‚Äì but her mind isn‚Äôt what it was. this christmas will be her first in the home and i won‚Äôt be able to see her due to distances ‚Äì but i want to get her something all the same. here‚Äôs my question: i was thinking of making her set of photographs in a short book format with headings marking who each family member is. she could look through at pictures of us and remember our names, who we are etc. i‚Äôm worried however that since we‚Äôll be having christmas day elsewhere without her, it might be a reminder that we‚Äôre *not there with her*. i don‚Äôt want to upset her like that. my partner has pointed out she probably won‚Äôt make that connection, but i‚Äôm still worried. do you guys know if this kind of thing might be helpful / good for her, or a hindrance at all?",,0

9eig2u,"i am suspecting my mother is experiencing signs of dementia on top of mental illness she's had her whole life that she also refuses to acknowledge. it's getting to a point where i cannot do anything right by her and any sort of interaction and relationship is too stressful for both parties. i am thinking for her (and my own) health and mental well-being i should separate myself from her.what do you think?she's got this bug in her bonnet that i suddenly hate old people like her. i have no idea where this has come from, it's like paranoia on steroids and her own personal vendetta against me (and the world) that has come up.she keeps making bizarre jabs at me, like ""oh young people like you have no patience for us oldies"".... huh? what? i ask for clarification on what she means and what i did to cause her to say that, because honestly if i made her feel that way i'd feel like a piece of shit (and do anyway) so would apologies and make amends... but she couldn't even articulate why she said it and why she believed it. she just dug in her heels that it's obviously how i think because it's ""how all young people these days are"", and couldn't tell me why and how i was displaying that, and that any protest i had toward her about the subject meant that she was right by disrespecting her opinion, and her as my mother.wat. i'm quickly realizing i am not dealing with a sane person, now whether this is mental illness or dementia or a combination i'm just not sure. one thing i know is, getting her to even acknowledge it, or to get any help is never going to happen. my dad is a huge enabler of her, to the point where even if he can see i am being gaslighted and manipulated by her, he will just side with her anyway. she genuinely thinks i'm an awful person, and i feel like crap about it, and there's nothing i can do to change her mind and it's bringing me down mentally and emotionally, and even physically now.how am i supposed to get her help, if she and my dad refuses to acknowledge it. am i supposed to just give up on our relationship entirely and allow her to think these awful horrible things about me?",,0

rgk9zg,"so maybe a visit will just stress her out without doing anything good for her? hi everyone, i'm a bit torn about this so i thought maybe someone here had some helpful advice.my grandma (92) lives in a nursing home, and has dementia. she hid it for a good while, but it became apparent just how bad it is when my grandpa died last year. she thinks she is temporarily in the hospital and wants to go home, but by home she means the family farm, where she hasn't lived since she was a teen. she sometimes recognizes my dad and aunt, but often she doesn't, since she thinks they are kids. other than them i don't think she recognizes a lot of people very often.and here is my dilemma: my dad recently mentioned to me that she might be getting close to death and if i would want to visit her a last time i should do so soon. my grandma was a lovely part of my childhood and it pained me so much that i didn't get to see my grandpa before he died. but on the other hand, she will most likely have no idea who i am, but she will fake it since she has gotten used to that after hiding it for so many years. so maybe a visit will just stress her out without doing anything good for her? right now my last moment with her was at my granddads funeral where she in a clear moment marched over to me, took my hand, looked deeply into my eyes and said ""he loved you very much you know?"" which is quite lovely.so yeah, i'm torn about if i should go see her or not, thoughts and advice is appreciated",so maybe a visit will just stress her out without doing anything good for her?,0

(forgive me for any ignorance here) after taking prescribed meds, she returned to normal.9 months has passed and i am finding her repeating herself and retelling me stories she only told me 10-15 min ago.i'll be honest i'm scared of the fact that i'm not sure what to do. do i tell her she's repeating herself? i feel like if i did she would freak out, stress would skyrocket and it might deteriorate? it's just me and her and its going to be brutally tough putting everything on hold to look after her but such is life and i'm game for whatever i have to do. i just want to make sure i'm not doing anything detrimental due to my own ignorance in this topic.thank you all in advance for reading.peace and love to all of you.",how do you approach this?,1

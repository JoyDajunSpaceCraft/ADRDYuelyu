kdpwnv,"does anyone have any idea? my mother is experiencing a very strange symptom and many doctors across many different fields (her general practitioner, gynecology, nephrology, endocrinology, cardiology) have not been able to give any explanation of any kind. she also just had a colonoscopy which revealed nothing.my mother is 72 with pretty advanced alzheitmer's /dementia. she also has some moderate kidney problems i think around 45% functionality. her alzheimer's presents itself as some of the craziest lunacy many doctors have ever seen - extremely frequent hallucinations and sudden violent bouts of terror and crying in fear.as for her unexplained symptom: roughly once or twice per day my mother will suddenly get red and hot and sweaty for about 5 minutes. i know what it sounds like - the hot flashes that happen during menopause. except there's no way it is that because i remember when my mother was going through menopause when i was 14 years old and i am 34 now. they started up about 6 months ago and seemed to occur at pretty random times, although i would say it's a little more often during the evening.¬†it does not coincide with eating - meaning that she is not having a reaction to anything that we give her because it will frequently happen before dinner time as well as after dinner time. food does not seem to alter the occurrence of these hot flashes.i am no doctor - not by any means - but i did go to university for biology, my best guess is it sounds like a hormonal thing.",does anyone have any idea?

lu431z,"my grandmother (68) has started noticing some small memory loss issues. i've been noticing this for the last two months or so. she sometimes doesn't remember the word she's looking for, for example, she forgot about the name of brocolli. she knew though, and tried to remember it, until she got it.  she forgot recently the name of a small black object. she called it ""the black thing"", struggled a bit to find the real name, and eventually got it. she jokingly said about having alzheimer's.  i've been testing her recently in subtle ways, always asking the date and such. she never responded wrong to these kind of questions, so she doesn't seem confused about time/locations.  it's only these memory issues that have been affecting her, nothing else.should i worry about this?  p.d: if it helps to know, she has depression and has dealed with great amounts of stress before in her life, she also has diabetes.  thanks for reading!",

k0ixvl,"are there resources we can work with?thanks for reading and appreciate any guidance in advance. hi all. i've got grandparents living in florida in their own house (ie not any kind of assisted living community) and i just found out today that my grandmother has been diagnosed with alzheimer's. i'll give some quick context to our situation and would love to hear the thoughts/advice of this community.even getting to this point has been difficult -- my grandmother is extremely stubborn and independent, so while we were aware she had been slowly losing her faculties for some time, it took a concerted effort to get to the point of a diagnosis because of a combination of her own stubbornness and her long-time doctor's complacency. my grandfather is still sharp as a tack but wheelchair bound, so he is not in a position to care for both of them.it's clear they need to have more around-the-clock care, but the problem is that my grandmother will never agree to that. she insists there is nothing wrong (i could get into all the examples of how that is not true, but just trust me when i say she needs better help). the problem is she still has some level of lucidity, so we can't force her to do things she doesn't want to do (keep appointments, etc). it is important to mention that most of the family lives in pa, so while we've been trying to help care for things, it's simply not going to be possible for us to give her the level of care she needs. one of my uncles lives close by there and visits often, but he is simply wholly unprepared to deal with how complex the situation has become. are there resources we can work with?thanks for reading and appreciate any guidance in advance.",are there resources we can work with?thanks for reading and appreciate any guidance in advance.

7pl1gf,"today i received a message that my great-grandma was taken to hospital. my great-grandma is in her early 90s. i'm not sure when or if it was diagnosed but i think she has alzheimer‚Äôs, in which she started showing symptoms for when she was around 86, maybe earlier. in hindsight it's clear to see why but i believe she started showing symptoms of dementia when she started to accuse my uncle and my cousin (his son) of stealing from her, which she adamantly believed happened. this may have coinsided with some home renovation carried out by the council, i'm not sure if anything was actually stolen but she seriously believed my uncle and cousin did it which led to friction and upset. fast forward a year or so later to the next time i saw her and it was clear that her memory was detiorating, she remembered me but she seemed struggled to remember the last time she saw my nan (her ex-daughter-in-law which visited her the day or week before). as i left in the car (with my mother and aunty) i was upset as it was starting to set in that the grandma i loved dearly was starting to fade away, doubled with the news that my mum told me in the car that she also accused her of stealing several items.these accusations have upset my mum deeply and she has not seen my grandma since (i have since learn that accusing people of stealing happens regularly in those diagnosed with alzheimer‚Äôs and told my mum that it wasn't my grandma talking).fast forward another 2 or 3 year later to last september and i went to see her with my nan, which was the first time i saw my grandma since the prior visit (i was conflicted to whether i should go to see my grandma anymore or not her and at the time i didn't know accusing family of stealing was connected to her illness). although i was expecting her memory to have worsened i thought she may she have still remembered me. but it wasn't until she asked who i was, who my mother is and how i was related to her did my heart drop. i had to contain my emotion as i was on the verge of crying infront of her and my nan.i haven't seen her since and i am constantly filled with regrets and emotions...would she still have remembered me if i saw her more often? i can't but help thinking that in her time of need i abandoned her and left her without a reason to why i stopped visiting her. what makes it even harder is that i can't even apologise for what happened and tell her that i'm sorry.",
7gczlg,"there have been some interesting studies of reversing memory loss via osteocalcin- a hormone produced in the bones.osteocalcin is produced in the body via nutritional intake of **calcium + vitamin k.** *gamma-secretase cleaves amyloid precursor protein (app) to generate amyloid-beta (abeta) peptides, which aggregate in the brain in alzheimer's disease (ad). gamma-secretase also cleaves molecules that regulate osteoblast activity, such as notch and ephrinb2.....*basically, what that means is that amyloid beta plaques develop when there is a deficient supply of osteocalcin and ultimately leads to neuronal death involving an imbalance of intracellular calcium homeostasis via activation of calcium channels, intracellular calcium stores, and subsequent production of free radicals by calcium-sensitive enzymes. thoughts?",

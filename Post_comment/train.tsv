it's waist length and there are knots all the way up and at the base of her skull. i'm worried that this may be bad for her health, i don't want her getting a fungus under there. we tried soaking it with coconut oil last night and combing it, but we couldn't get all of the knots out and she refuses to help.	1
she got quite agitated, threatened to hit us, and was yelling about it. i can't think of anything else but to cut the knots out, but i think this may mean using clippers on the back of her head. her hair has been her pride and joy for her entire life and i don't want to take this from her, but i don't know what else to do, i think it will only get worse from here.	1
well as the text says we were having a normal conversation with him while my brother and i were bringing some groceries in and my grandpa started getting confrontational (he lives next door). out of nowhere he just reaches over and grabs my brother by the throat, luckily my brother had groceries in his hands so he didnt push him back or anything but managed to get out from under his grip and we ran inside.	2
he seems like hes losing the ability to do simple tasks like pour soup for himself, or vote independently. he still drives every day to see his friends once a day, but thats it. the other day we were driving together and he backed his car into the guardrail.... he shrugged it off like it was nothing.	2

my nana has been showing signs of alzheimer's. my great grand-mother was also affected by alzheimer's; however, she was older than my nana is now. my nana has been divorced and my papaw is remarried to my mamaw (all these familial terms, lol). she has never hated my mamaw, maybe not liked, but never hated, though she now is certain that my mamaw and papaw got married immediately after my nana and papaw got a divorce and it burns her up. she genuinely believes it with her whole heart. to make matters worse, my nana was the one cheating on my papaw!	2

my dad has untreated bipolar disorder and ocd, as well as mild/moderate dementia. most of the bipolar stuff has mellowed quite a bit. apparently that is typical.  he does still feel restless and likes to walk (not wander - he does have a goal,  he just gets lost because his spatial abilities worsened after a car accident some years ago).	1
a relative has ad. me being a biohacker and really inspired by david sinclairs book, ordered some nmn for him to test.  background: nad+ booster cured ad in mice in this study: https://www.pnas.org/content/115/8/e1876 sure he is not a mouse, but he shares 92% of dna with a mouse and i figured as the disease progression is pretty bad so he doesnt have too much to lose by trying something that has not passed human trials yet.	1
nmn seems to be the most potent/least bad nad+ precursor and high dose resveratrol seems to improve nad+ boosting effects. put him on 0.5g nmn + 0.5g resveratrol per day orally, nmn in pill and resveratrol mixed in turkish yoghurt.	1

just spoke to my dad (66) on the phone. he had forgotten that we actually talked recently, just about 2 weeks ago if that, which wasnt encouraging. he said he has a cat scan on monday and will know more at that point, but its possible hes in the early stages of alzheimers.	2
he has a long-term girlfriend and they live together but arent married. i worry about the implications of a long and difficult illness on the horizon. i dont have the resources to care for a parent - i have a ton of debt and, unfortunately, decided to pursue a degree that doesnt leave you with a lot of stable employment options upon graduation.	2

my mother has been diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's, and i know a lot about the disease, but nothing about how she is able to support herself while living with it in her later stages. if you guys don't mind, i'll list some of my questions below (we are in ohio for reference).	1
how would she be able to support herself when she is no longer able to work? she has no retirement or savings, and disability will not let you file and make a livable wage at the same time. 	1

all four of my grandparents have had or have the disease so i know it will only get worse. i was looking for folks who know what its like to lose loved ones in this way.  i was so frustrated scrolling through the alzheimersgroup seeing that stupid garfield comic thinking it was the right subreddit.	2
just got off the phone with my grandmother who, for the first time, didnt recognize me right away.  all four of my grandparents have had or have the disease so i know it will only get worse. i was looking for folks who know what its like to lose loved ones in this way.	2
i was so frustrated scrolling through the alzheimersgroup seeing that stupid garfield comic thinking it was the right subreddit.  glad i eventually came across this sub	2
title really says it all... my dad (69) is now in a state where he's unable to function on his own, forgets who people are, does weird stuff, and all the usual alzheimer-y stuff. my mum (66) is the one taking care of him, essentially babysitting him 24/7, and she's mentally and emotionally exhausted.	2
every time i call her, i can tell that she's been crying recently. it breaks my heart and i have no idea what to say or do to somehow make it better for her. so if anyone has any experience with this, i'd really appreciate some advice	2
his alzheimers has made his already abusive behavior increasingly more frequent.  my mom, sister and i,  mostly mom, were the victims of his rage throughout our lives. there were good times but the pain of my almost 60 years is still very real.	2
my sister visits at least once a week but it always includes him yelling. he barely sleeps.  his doctor is not attentive to his needs. although i love him because he is my father my fear is i visit.  he becomes abusive and i can handle that,  but then leaving the staff and more importantly the other residents with his rage.	2
my goal was to visit her every saturday from the moment i found out she was in the nursing home. this is a rant/somewhat need advice(?) one, i feel like crap because ive visited a total of 1 time.	2
im such a crappy granddaughter for this.  two, i think the second time i was going to visit her, i was promised by older brother that he would take me and his son to see her at 10:30 am. i drove to his home at 10:30, got there at 10:45 & his car was still there.	2
he wasnt awake and when i asked him about it, he said he wasnt going to go. i think i felt crushed at that moment, i kinda lost it and i havent seen him since. now that thanksgiving is coming up, i have to see him, but i want to see my grandma because its a holiday and because i love her, but i want my brother to go with me.	2
why is it so hard for me to go see her? why am i being such a pos granddaughter and already doing it? why wont my brother see her at all?	2
she fainted on the toilet and told me something hurt so i panicked and called an ambulance. we were in the hospital from 7pm to 4am. which, honestly, is the shortest hospital visit i've ever been on.	2
i turns out that she was just pushing too hard and made herself faint.  anyway.... that was fun. i 'm going to go commit suicide via coffee and donuts now	2
shes in the mid/late stages at this point. while my brother visits her every other week, i havent been since late june when she told me leave; she still regularly talks about how ive stolen her money and put her in the home, and how she doesnt belong there. when we put her in the assisted living community i made the decision that if shes still going to be angry at me spending holidays with her are out of the question.	2
as we head into the end of the year, we are hopefully surrounded by people we love and cherish. while this may not always be the case, i hope all of you find some peace and love with family and friends.  i'm very thankful that all of you reading this have managed to find this sub, and that you share your experiences, frustrations, and triumphs with everyone.	2

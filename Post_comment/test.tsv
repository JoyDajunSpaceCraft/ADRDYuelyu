over a year ago, spouse was diagnosed with stage iv colon cancer.	0
he's had numerous surgeries, 6 months of chemo, two more hospital stays, a stay in a nursing home, home health care, blood transfusions, the works.	0
i sold our farm, moved us to an area nearer to hospitals.	0
i used up all my leave to take him to the medical services.	0
i sold my beloved car and bought a more comfortable van.	0
i researched cancer and fill out forms.	0
i take care of the bills and paperwork, taxes, rx and keeping his family informed.	0
i am his only caregiver and the only breadwinner.	0
his cancer has exploded and he only has about 5 months left.	0
incredibly, he wants more treatment!	0
i am exhausted, burnt out and desperately need closure.	0
he sits at home and watches tv all day.	0
the fact that his spouse is staggering with exhaustion and sick from anger doesn't register with him.	0
he has no pension, no benefits except from my job and basically contributes nothing but always wants something.	0
he's forever ordering rubbish from amazon and running up credit card bills.	0
he refuses to see the misery he's created.	0
my life is wrecked and will not get peace until after he passes.	0
oh, and he's rude to his doctors, too.	0
i cry with anger and exhaustion and he's say  'i'm glad you love me so much and grieve for my passing '.	0
which is of course, totally wrong.	0
i'm crying because i'm exhausted and am no longer grieving, just needing him to get on with it.	0
thanks for letting me vent.	0

hello!	0
my name is ann.	0
my team and me are working on a 3-headed electric toothbrush which effectively cleans teeth without any complicated movements needed.	0
we plan to adapt it for people with special needs and eldery health issues.	0
toothbrush concept:  1. it cleans teeth without any efforts and complicated proper movements, because the toothbrush has 3 heads, that cover the tooth from all sides at the right angle and with the right pressure.	0
you just need to move it from tooth to tooth.	0
2. since the brush cleans immediately 3 sides of the tooth, it cleans much faster.	0
if you have any info about what should we take into account to make the toothbrush as effective as possible for people with special needs, please, click on the link below to answer some questions.	0
i would highly appreciate if you could help us.	0

hey all.	0
to make a long story short, after a string of traumatic events (a car wreck involving head-trauma, great grandmother's death, and my aunt's death) my nana has been showing signs of alzheimer's.	0
my great grand-mother was also affected by alzheimer's; however, she was older than my nana is now.	0
my nana has been divorced and my papaw is remarried to my mamaw (all these familial terms, lol).	0
she has never hated my mamaw, maybe not liked, but never hated, though she now is certain that my mamaw and papaw got married immediately after my nana and papaw got a divorce and it burns her up.	0
she genuinely believes it with her whole heart.	0
to make matters worse, my nana was the one cheating on my papaw!	0
so there's that.	0
i would argue that my nana is still in touch with our reality to whatever extent, but our timelines and belief of how events played out is so different.	0
how the hell do you deal with something like this?	0
do you play into it, knowing it's not the truth?	0
just ignore it?	0
arguing only upsets her.	0
hey everyone, i'm 22 and new here.	0
my grammy is about stage 5-6, and my family (me, my husband, and our two young kids) have just moved back to my hometown so i can be the caretaker for my grandparents, mostly my grammy who is 82. she lives at home with my grandfather, they've been married 60+ years and up until this point he's been able to do most everything for her himself.	0
i come over everyday now, about 6-7 hours a day, to help with meals, housework, activities etc.	0
but i'm at a bit of a loss!	0
my grammy was an avid quilter, loved to crochet, scrapbook, make cards... but i can't get her to do anything!	0
she isn't interested at all in any of those things or even anything in that area.	0
she just wants to sit in her chair.	0
occasionally she'll read her guideposts, or watch the price is right, but i'm really struggling getting her to do things.	0
i don't want to push her too hard as she can get very testy, but i know it would be good for her to engage in an activity of some sort.	0
any thoughts?	0
i'll just quickly share my experience and advice and then a resource.	0
five years ago my family and i began noticing signs that my mother was having difficulty completing everyday tasks.	0
initially, we looked at these things she was doing as quirky, elderly silliness.	0
at the time, she was picking up my kids from school every day and they would notice that she seemed off and her driving was becoming a little more aggressive, she'd show up to school later and later, she had strange cuts on her hands and face, and one time she forgot they were in the car and went home instead of our house.	0
i decided to change our routine and i began picking up the kids.	0
all good, right?	0
nope.	0
basically, now that the kids weren't seeing her every day, we were no longer getting those all too important progress reports from them.	0
we got busy with our lives, and we only spoke to her on the phone, and other some minor confusion, she seemed fine during those calls.	0
fast forward two weeks and her neighbor is calling us saying she is at their house telling them that there are people staying at her house, so she needs to move in with them.	0
we arrive to find her covered in bruises, unwashed, empty refrigerator, and untouched prescription bottles.	0
those final years of her life were up and down and full of resentment.	0
she seemed angry with me, and frankly, i can't blame her.	0
so, now that my father-in-law has had some minor memory issues and one fall, we have had to have some difficult conversations, but i won't wait this time.	0
i took several online assessments, like this one, as soon as i started to feel like something was off.	0
be proactive, get help from professionals, and take care of yourself!	0
my 71 year old mother has been dealing with alzheimer's for many years.	0
i've been bathing her about a year now.	0
dad turns off gas and locks doors ( supplying details to give a frame of reference ).	0
she often talks about going home to check on her parents (gone for 20 years) or kids (i'm her youngest at 34 years old) or whatever.	0
she yells at my dad to take her home all the while saying their current home  is actually her house her dad got for her (it isn't).	0
we are managing, but what's best to say to her?	0
when she pleads to me to pick her up and take her home?	0
most if the time, i can change the topic and she forgets eventually, but sometimes she gets fixated.	0
do i go pick her up and drive around?	0
do i gently remind her she is home?	0
do i just listen?	0
what's best in your experiences?	0
my grandma is 78 and in the 5th stage - she is conversational but mostly confused and if she's not at home she doesn't know where she is.	0
she has a history of depression and mood swings and currently takes seroquel and aricept.	0
lately she has been very unpredictable and upsets very easily, often walking out on her own out of anger (my grandfather follows her).	0
she constantly threatens to take off and find a job for herself, spending hours yelling about it.	0
my grandfather is her sole caretaker right now, all other family are too far and/or work full time and cannot be there daily.	0
it is very difficult for him (he is 85) and he is finding it exhausting.	0
when she is at home she constantly wants to go out, even right after coming home, and when she is out she wants to go home.	0
it is very sad for my grandpa as he says he can still take care of her and she can still shower/go to the bathroom by herself, but i know it is becoming unbearable especially with her typical mood swings + sundowning.	0
she needs to be watched around the clock and he doesn't have the energy for that, now that he's taken on all the chores and cooking and cleaning.	0
right now, i think an in-home caretaker would make sense but i want to hear your opinions.	0
was there a breaking point when you decided you needed to hire a caretaker or decided to move them to a care home?	0
i am most concerned about the wandering at the moment, and giving my grandpa some respite from the daily housework.	0
a friend of mine is currently living with her in laws, her mil is 52 with early onset alzheimer's, it has progressed a lot in the past year since being diagnosed.	0
mil cannot work but is receiving ssdi.	0
is it possible to find a memory care living facility for her that her husband could also be with her?	0
i feel like it's not common in people as young as them, since neither are seniors.	0
but they're still very much in love and attached and cannot live apart, but she of course needs help and care that the family cannot provide themselves.	0
if anyone has any advice regarding this i'd appreciate it.	0
ive been in here for a while now, and i really appreciate the support ive gotten from you all.	0
seriously i love you all.	0
but i feel id really benefit from one person with whom i can share thoughts, feelings, and experiences with.	0
if you feel you can be that person for met feel free to message me.	0
thank you.	0
my grandmother, whose (likely) dementia has been worsening at an increased pace for the last two or so years, but she was always able to talk herself out of a diagnosis when at the doctors, and my grandfather was in denial about all of it.	0
she now hasnt been to a doctor in over a year for any reason because she doesnt like to leave the house.	0
lately she has been alternating between confusing my grandpa for her abusive step father or not know who he is entirely.	0
she would call my dad at all hours of the day and night to tell him there is a man in their house, she didnt feel safe, and wanted to go home.	0
my dad is always able to calm her down, so although stressful for all involved, my grandpa was still not convinced she needed medical intervention.	0
she oftentimes thinks people are breaking into the house, someone is stealing their money, or spying on them.	0
my grandma walks hunched over with a cane.	0
she can barely get around their small home on a good day.	0
she hasnt driven anywhere in 7 or so years.	0
my grandpa has breathing problems and tires out easily, and often naps.	0
today, for the first time, my grandma left the house while he was sleeping.	0
it is 30 and freezing rain here today, but she decided to go for a walk.	0
a neighbor saw her down the street and took her back home.	0
grandpa called my dad, who came over and had a hard talk about taking her to the doctor.	0
so, on monday they will call and make an appointment with her gp.	0
what sort of questions should we ask in order to get the full picture and to help my grandpa understand it a little bit better?	0
i know this isnt going to be easy on either of them, but we want to try to make things as painless as possible.	0
thanks	0
its been nine years now since my mom was diagnosed.	0
since then the woman she once was is completely gone.	0
sometimes i find myself thinking back to how she was when i was little and that woman seems like a complete stranger.	0
i cant believe how long ago those days were now.	0
every now and then when i think about that i just want someone to hold me.	0
someone to tell me that shes ok and that shell be in a better place soon.	0
i feel like im reaching out for someone thats not there.	0
its really hard.	0
i know other people are going through the same thing, but thats not really a comfort.	0
recently someone gave me another spiritual perspective on the situation and that gave me a temporary more positive outlook on it all, but now here am, back having these negative thoughts.	0
to everyone else going through this, im with you.	0
this sucks, but were all in this together.	0
my dad has early onset alzheimers, diagnosis was about 10 years ago.	0
he lives at home with my mom as primary caregiver and is still fairly independent although is starting to have some sporadic incontinence issues and difficultly remembering key life information.	0
they were recently given some options for treatment of some cardiac issues that he has and id really like some resources to help my mom (with me supporting her) navigate the decision making process.	0
is anyone aware of such resources?	0
she is connected with a social worker who she will talk with, but i was wondering if there were other books, blogs, sites that she and i could read to help understand the choices.	0
we have reached a point where mom is so confused she forgets where money is and then goes to the bank for more.	0
yesterday she took out several thousand dollars and hid it somewhere, which she won't tell me where because she is starting to not trust anyone.	0
so it's time to make her accounts inaccessible, i just don't know how to do it and still have her ss and pension checks go into them.	0
how did you guys do it?	0
i am her poa so that's not a problem.	0
we are taking my grandma to a care home residence tomorrow.	0
what are some suggestions you can offer me to make the transition easier for her and my grandfather?	0
we are afraid she'll realize we are leaving her there since she has some lucid moments when she gets a grasp about what's going on.	0
is there any way we can make it so she feels comfortable being there ?	0
this is a big step for us, and just want to make things go easy  for everyone .	0
i've been living with my grandfather for 4 months as his caregiver.	0
when i moved in he would take 1 or 2 showers per week, but now i'm lucky if i get him to take one once every 2 weeks.	0
i'm sure this is a common problem in this community (i'm very new at this lol), and was wondering if anyone had success with certain strategies.	0
mine is that i don't let him know how bad he smells but i will make comments like  'man what a beautiful night for a nice hot shower huh? '	0
and he always likes the idea of a shower, but getting him in there is difficult.	0
it's getting embarrassing to take him out in public	0
hi all, i'm a social worker and supporting a family dealing with early onset alzheimer's disease.	0
the kids range from 30-15 in age and i'm struggling to find good books, links, and groups for them to connect with.	0
any ideas?	0
thanks for the help!	0
hey everybody, it's me again.	0
this was my last post in case anybody is wondering.	0
it was really nice feeling supported from everyone, this sub has really become a source of comfort, advice, and knowledge for me.	0
i wanted to give a bit of an update.	0
incontinence started earlier than my predictions, with the first recorded instance happening last night.	0
i don't know if it was a full-blown accident, as it seems more like she didn't follow bathroom hygiene for a while and maybe it built up to the point of being visible?	0
i don't know, and it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things.	0
mil was walking around and had a large spot on the back of her pants that i pointed out to bf.	0
he tried to talk to her about it, but it ended up with her denying and him losing his patience.	0
she eventually took a bath and we swapped out the pants.	0
bf was exhausted and he's been in shock pretty much all night.	0
he doesn't want to believe that this is happening and wants to believe this is a one-off and that she still has another 6+ months before having to worry about continence issues.	0
bf is poa, and is feeling overwhelmed, saying he didn't realize that poa meant doing so much.	0
i think last night was a huge eye-opener as even he realizes that fighting with his mom every day to change her underwear is a lot.	0
he's been really sad about this latest step, understandably so.	0
i've tried bringing him to the sub, but he says he's not ready for all that, although he appreciates it when i read some of your posts and helpful responses out loud for him.	0
we talked it over for a while, and he messaged his sister and we're having a small family meeting tonight after work.	0
according to him, she hasn't been telling him all the awful details that have been happening when she takes mil out once a week.	0
i'm not sure about this, because sil and i have talked about it multiple times.	0
he says he was doubting both of our stories because he didn't see it, it hasn't happened to him, and that we were alone when it was happening.	0
i pointed out that he's the one in the family that's famous for having a temper and also that he is a man and his mother has been getting increasingly sexist in the last year or so and that may be affecting the way she addresses him.	0
we also talked about our approaches to care.	0
he admitted that he had been feeling like i was being a wicked witch and a bit of a dictator with trying to establish care.	0
he also said i was being mean to his mom.	0
i asked for clarification and explained that i keep my tone neutral and use easy to understand words when i'm asking her to do something because any other tone elicits an outburst from her as she really doesn't like authority, or me for that matter.	0
he did acknowledge that i've never yelled at her, or sworn at her, or anything like that and that he didn't know that was why i was keeping voice low and that maybe he had misinterpreted what i was doing.	0
bf apologized to me for being mean to me when he's realizing that me being  'cold & clinical ' is simply trying to talk to him about where we are in the process and how to make his mother's quality of life better.	0
he has been a bit frazzled and has never really had a routine, so it's been a constant struggle establishing one.	0
for instance, last night, dinner wasn't even on the table until 11pm!	0
granted, the accident was a huge factor, but we're just all over the place schedule-wise.	0
i sat down with him last night and wrote out a schedule of care that she would be expected to get if she was in a hospital, or a nursing home.	0
i told him i was willing to help as long as we could argue that the quality of her life with us would be higher than she would be getting in a home.	0
i also wrote down a list of symptoms to bring up on their next dr visit in february.	0
i'm hoping that after tonight's meeting, we can really start in earnest to find placement for mil, or at least some sort of respite.	0
i wrote this as a reminder to myself that even when i stumble and fall, i am still a dementia warrior, broken, bruised, but warring.	0
oh you kings and queens of dementia	0
slowly working my way out of a very un-holiday like gloom.	0
happy new year?	0
maybe?	0
at least i finally had the energy to write.	0
'happy holidays!	0
ho, ho, ho... ' aw, screw it.	0
im taking my dad to a nuero appt tomorrow.	0
he was diagnosed with early stage alzheimers last august.	0
he was told not to drive then.	0
he has continued to drive, saying hes fine.	0
tbh, im not sure if its time to pull his license or not.	0
i dont drive with him much.	0
when i do, hes ok. the last six months have been horrendous.	0
three weeks after my dads diagnosis my normally stable step-mom had a full psychotic break and has been way off ever since.	0
she tells us stories about him and his driving, but we arent sure if they are true.	0
shes so manic and demanding that we cant really tell the extent of his problems.	0
weve really been focused on her issues way more lately as she has needed a lot more help.	0
she was the one that ran things for the two of them and now she cant balance her checkbook or follow a recipe.	0
heres whats has got me worried: - he has said, many times that if he cant drive his life is over.	0
its his freedom and once he loses that his life will be over.	0
- he has always been a struggle to deal with.	0
hes quite anti-social, prone to depression.	0
he doesnt do anything but sit at home and watch youtube videos and drive to a local drive thru for a diet pepsi most days.	0
and my step-mom sends him to the grocery store every few days.	0
- my step-mom hasnt been driving much since her break.	0
shes very uncomfortable behind the wheel.	0
- i live 45 mins away.	0
my sister is closer.	0
about 5 mins away.	0
i know there are services available to take them places like the grocery store, but we arent sure they will use them.	0
ultimately im scared im going to see my father give up tomorrow.	0
ive heard so many stories of people that decline terribly after they cant drive anymore.	0
im pretty sure the neurologist is going to really tell him to stop and its going to hit like a ton of bricks.	0
my paternal grandfather passed away a few months ago after a brief but intense period of living with alzheimer's.	0
he never sought treatment, and passed away from a bad fall.	0
since it runs in the family, i'm concerned about my father.	0
he has become increasingly forgetful, agitated, and confused.	0
he has type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and cholesterol, and a history of dvt, all of which he consistently takes medication for.	0
he has a bmi around 40 and does not exercise or eat healthfully.	0
he has not yet seen a doctor; my mother and i are preparing to speak with him tonight.	0
he is generally resistant to speaking to medical professionals about what he considers to be  'mental ' issues, and i don't think he thinks it's a problem, just a natural effect of aging.	0
what would be the best way to approach the conversation with him?	0
his symptoms are becoming more alarming each day, and i'm fearful that without early intervention and a major change in lifestyle, his prognosis will not be good.	0
any advice about where to start and how to navigate this moving forward would be sincerely appreciated.	0
thank you.	0
i hate to post such a sensational headline, but it really is true.	0
only bernie sanders will make sure medicare for all is enacted.	0
alzheimers research is in an exciting time, and everyone should be allowed to be cured of this disease not just the rich.	0
hi everyone,  i come here as both a caregiver to my father and as a mental health professional who has been focusing on the impact of dementia particularly a parent's cognitive decline on adult child caregivers and their siblings.	0
i am a phd candidate at the university of louisiana monroe, and writing my dissertation on sibling relationships in the context of caring for parents with dementia.	0
in particular, i am looking to explore how a parent's cognitive decline affects sibling dynamics.	0
i have been granted irb approval, and am looking to interview adults via skype who meet the following criteria: -identify as primary caregivers (or coordinate care) of parents with dementia (or any clinically significant cognitive decline) -have at least one sibling.	0
i will provide additional study details and informed consent release to any interested participants.	0
if interested, please email me at sieberd@warhawks.ulm.edu	0
he started taking seroquel at 25mg in june, then we had to increase to 50mg in september-ish after assaulted some caregivers and became agitated to the point of requiring restraints while in the hospital, and now...his symptoms have been getting steadily worse over the past two weeks or so.	0
we've been living with him for a few months.	0
friday night after getting his 50mg dose in the evening, around 4am he started pounding on our bedroom door, yelling and screaming, and attacked me - hit me (though not very effectively) with a metal basket, deeply scratched/gouged my arm with his nails, and left a few bruises.	0
when he got up the next morning i was sure to give him 25mg with breakfast to try to keep him calm throughout the day as it seems like he's been waking up with hallucinations and paranoia, vs. his usual sundowning.	0
he was still agitated and threatening by that afternoon and we had to give him 75mg in the evening to get him to calm down.	0
this morning i had to hide his 25mg seroquel in his cereal because he was so suspicious and paranoid of me.	0
&#x200b; i had already talked to his care team about increasing his dosage the morning before he attacked me.	0
i was thinking he needed to go to the extended release version but now i'm wondering if he needs something more heavy hitting entirely.	0
&#x200b; i am planning to attend a caregiver support group either tuesday or thursday, possibly both, depending on when i can meet with his care team.	0
i am still shaken up from the friday night incident.	0
ughhhh, i'm just very angry about the whole thing.	0
i've been fighting with my bf for a while now about getting his mother onto a waitlist for a nursing home knowing that it'll be about 2 years before she gets placed.	0
he has refused to and is now saying she doesn't have the low-income insurance that she needs to get onto the waitlist.	0
i'm frustrated because he isn't doing anything to get his mom the proper care that she needs and it's going to get way worse before it gets better.	0
we live in a 2 bedroom apartment and the bedrooms and the bathroom is on the second floor.	0
she's gained a lot of weight in the last year and is having trouble getting off the couch and the stairs are making her tired.	0
i don't think she has much time left before she is unable to navigate them.	0
she is also complaining of problems with her bowels constantly, of having diarrhea, which i suspect is her articulating that she is getting close to losing continence.	0
bf is convinced that isn't the case and that it's simply her diet.	0
she is also getting increasingly aggressive.	0
she is irritable and angry with both me and my bf's sister.	0
she yells, swears and threatens violence.	0
she also hurls a lot of racist statements my way (i'm asian).	0
his sister and i are on the same page regarding her care and needs and it's frustrating that bf can't see it that way.	0
his biggest problem is that he doesn't want her to feel afraid and that's why he's resistant to her going anywhere.	0
i understand his fear, but i feel that she is going to be afraid regardless and that it would be better to get her acclimated to a new environment sooner so that she has a chance to recognize her surroundings.	0
i worked as a nursing assistant to get through school and it's been really frustrating.	0
i've worked in nursing homes and they're not as bad as people make them out to be.	0
yes, they're not home, i get it, but they're not jails.	0
i've been trying to help him navigate the waters but he's been resistant to any help.	0
when she was first placed on her meds, i mentioned that she should be on an antidepressant because of her behavior and to help her sleep.	0
he eventually decided to take her off of it without telling anybody because he felt that i was too pill-happy and trying to overmedicate her.	0
that led to a solid 2 months of her crying constantly, being angry with everybody and just having a really rough time before he realized that she really needed the meds.	0
i'm worried that she's going to need assistance toileting, and bathing soon and she won't let him help because he's a boy, and she's violent towards me.	0
it's unrealistic to expect his sister to drive over constantly to help because mil is violent towards her as well.	0
i feel like he is setting us up for failure because by the time she really really needs help, we won't be able to get help when we need it.	0
he told me yesterday that he'd rather the two of them move into a studio apartment and he can just deal with her so that she can die in her own bed.	0
i'm really tempted to let him do it, but that would be a catastrophe, he has a very low patience threshold, constantly loses his temper, and isn't able to give any sort of structure to her life.	0
i'm just feeling like i'm watching a very slow-moving trainwreck and i'm tied to the rails.	0
hi, i am a high school student in need of some information for a project i am doing.	0
with this project i will be writing and essay about the neurological effects of alzheimer's disease, as well as how the psychology of family members is affected when taking care of loved ones with alzheimer's.	0
i do not have any family members or friends to interview about this topic, but would love some feedback.	0
i know that this can sometimes be a difficult topic to discuss, so please don't feel pressured, any responses are appreciated!	0

hello to everyone.	0
i just found this reddit and i just felt the need to post.	0
about six months ago, my 80 year old father was diagnosed with alzheimer's.	0
we had noticed that he was forgetting when he was, and more importantly, this man who always balanced his checkbook to the penny had suddenly racked up tons of debt and had collectors calling him.	0
shortly after the diagnosis, he was mostly ago, until about two months ago.	0
he started falling constantly, wanted to go  'home ' (where this home was, we never knew) and was hallucinating people.	0
it turns out he developed a uti on top of this, which made matters worse.	0
they thankfully were able to clear that up, but it seems that the uti made him progress faster than any of us expected.	0
we thought maybe we could do assisted living, but it turned out he needed more care than that.	0
so after a lot of talk and discussion, we made the choice to place him in memory care faculty.	0
today was his move in day, and after spending about two months in an absolutely horrible wreck of a nursing care facility, he seemed much happier in the new place.	0
he has his own room now and lots of people he can interact with.	0
i know we made the right decision as no-one in the family could give him the proper care he needed, but i'm still a wreck.	0
i know i shouldn't feel this way, but i feel horribly guilty about having to place him there.	0
i have no idea why i'm having these feelings.	0
i also am a wreck just knowing that he's slowly going to slip away and one day, he's just going to be a shell, i guess placing him there just kinda of confirmed it for me.	0
is this normal?	0
has anyone else gone through this?	0
i guess i just needed to let it out.	0
thank you for listening.	0
i recently learned i have a very rare psen2 mutation in rs63750110, also known as c.1316a>c, d439a or asp439ala.	0
my grandmother had ad with symptoms in her early 60s and died in her early 70s her father also.	0
however because my father is in his 70s now and without symptoms, i dont qualify for the dominantly inherited ad study.	0
given the rarity of the mutation (<20 cases ever known) id like to help researchers learn more.	0
are there any suggestions on how i might find someone who researches rare mutation in psen?	0
thanks for any advice.	0
hi folks.	0
i'm really struggling with what to do next and would love to hear from you all.	0
this community has brought me a lot of comfort the past few months although this is my first post.	0
my mom's alzheimer's diagnosis was made aware to me early in 2019, and i have been watching her slowly decline further the past 6 months or so.	0
i'm an only child who lives out of state (bout a 2 hour plane ride from her) and am her poa for medical and health, and trustee of her trust, so all decisions go to me.	0
when did you find it was the right time to move your loved one to full time care?	0
i am not willing to become a full time care giver to my mom.	0
we did not have a good relationship before her diagnosis and i have basically spent my adult life trying to recover from childhood trauma.	0
i feel dragged back in to the dysfunction and abuse to manage her care, but have been diligent with liaising with all of her doctors, and doing my best to ensure she's getting the best care possible, implementing solutions like hiring housecleaning, homecare visits several times a week, getting pillpack, etc.	0
she's getting worse and worse and conversations are just cyclical like the same 30 seconds on repeat.	0
she sits at home and watches tv, although recently she has even taken to just sitting, without even watching tv.	0
i'm really worried she's only speeding her decline as she has very little social life and basically only interacts with her boyfriend (himself a 77 year old who does not seem to grasp the concept of this disease and how she might look the same but she is not capable of making decisions, etc.).	0
i have notes from 2 of her doctors right now (neuro and endocrinology) that state she is not capable of making decisions for herself and should move to assisted living.	0
she refuses to accept this, and keeps telling me it's 10 years too soon to move.	0
obviously, i will take her doctors' advice over her own opinion but i just don't know how to execute the move.	0
if you talk to her she says that she's  'completely fine ' and has no health issues (she has multiple issues in addition to alzheimer's).	0
i guess i'm just looking to learn from you all how you executed a move for your loved one.	0
i've toured 7 or so of memory care communities and the representatives always tell me that nobody wants to move or thinks it's their time to move.	0
how did you do it and how did your loved one respond?	0
i personally think that social engagement will be really good for her, but am struggling knowing she will be very upset, and that i will likely have to separate her from her dog, who she loves very much.	0
thanks for reading and thanks for your help.	0
greetings, &#x200b; my grandma who has been showing symptoms for the past 10 years or so (getting progressively worse) always feels the need to apologize for her actions/rambling/symptoms/forgetfulness.	0
&#x200b; it really breaks my heart, because i always let her know it doesn't bother me and i always try to brighten her mood by making some jokes about it (i've always had a joking relationship with her).	0
&#x200b; i'm kind of at a loss, because she has always been the type of person who is apologetic and feels like she is always a burden, even before her symptoms.	0
i've never really had experience being around a family member with alzheimer's, outside of my great grandmother (her mother), albeit i was never really around for it.	0
&#x200b; i feel helpless, and i just want to communicate that her symptoms don't bother or annoy me.	0
she's always been a sweet and caring person and i hate to see her have to apologize for something she has no control over.	0
&#x200b; &#x200b; regards, &#x200b; a grandma's boy	0
hello r/alzheimers, memory loss sucks.	0
if you know of any person or family that suffers from dementia/alzhiemers and you live in the greater philadelphia area, please read and share this post.	0
im working to enroll participants in the continuation of a clinical trial which explores a non-invasive approach to the treatment of dementia/alzhiemers.	0
in collaboration with texas a&m universitys dept.	0
of neurosurgery, the quietmind foundation is enlisting individuals between the ages of 50 and 85 years who are experiencing memory problems and have been independently diagnosed with early to mid-stage dementia to participate in this trial.	0
after two successfully completed trials, this expanded trial takes place in elkins park, pa and only requires 3 visits to the location.	0
each visit is also eligible to compensate for time and travel.	0
if you know anyone that might benefit from this treatment and would like to participate please feel free to send me a message or click to learn more:https://www.quietmindfdn.org/trials.html.	0
so my dad's memory has gone to shit.	0
he is always repeating himself and never remembers things.	0
he's in his early sixties and i'm thinking he has early onset alzheimers or dementia.	0
he refuses to see a doctor about it.	0
has anyone had simliar experiences?	0
hi everyone.	0
we lost my grandma to alzheimers last december and now my grandpa is progressing into mid/late stage alzheimers as well.	0
he is extremely bored all the time and i want to find things for him to do.	0
right now he pretty much just watches tv.	0
the problem is we have gotten him word searches (his favorite pre-alz), easy puzzles, simple games, etc but he refuses to use them.	0
he is very stubborn and still lucid a lot of the time, so things that are too childish like busy boxes offend him.	0
he is also still struggling a lot with not being able to drive.	0
i feel helpless because every time we talk he brings up the fact that he is so bored and cant do anything.	0
does anyone have any ideas how i can help?	0
i live on the other side of the country so just visiting more isnt currently an option.	0
(background info: he is about to be 87,  formerly a mechanic and handy man, mid-late stage alz, and lives in a small nursing home with round the clock care.)	0
just sitting with my emotions today and going through pictures and feeling still so much disgust at this disease.	0
i hate it so much and i wish no one else had to watch their loved one go through it.	0
big hugs to all of you in reddit land..., hope today is a good day for you wherever you are.	0
needing help with my wife(69) who was diagnose last january with ad.	0
since the end of october she has had difficulty recognizing me as her husband and confusing me with someone with the same name and very similar (in her mind).	0
it does seem to come and go but often when she doesn't recognize me she wonders where i am and where i've been.	0
yesterday it kind of came to a head when she confronted me (she knew who i was) with where i've been.	0
she also thinks she's not living in her home where we've lived for almost 35 years.	0
how have some of you handled this type of thing?	0
is it possible to ask her to identify something on she and i would know for her to understand who i am?	0
very frustrating and any help or advice is appreciated.	0
thanks in advance.	0
hi all, what do you guys do to keep an alzheimers person busy/interested/occupied?	0
i know my family member does not seems phased my tv or music anymore.	0
also a lot of things you give her she wants to eat.	0
i try to talk with her.	0
i wish there was something i could give her to play with.	0
i'm not sure if i am describing this best but any idears would be great.	0
my late mother had alzheimer's for 10 years and at the time i thought i would feel little more than relief when she finally died, and that i'd already done my grieving when she lost the last vestiges of her personality; i even felt guilty about my callousness on the subject.	0
however when she died the grief hit like a brick.	0
it was like the last 10 years didn't happen, and i thought about the person she used to be and all the things i missed about her, which was something i almost never did while she was still alive.	0
it was a confusing, disjointed type of grief too, because the painful memories were from so long ago.	0
hi, im not sure if this is the right place to ask.	0
ive been taking care of my grandma for the last 4 months.	0
her alzheimers gets a little bit worse everyday, but so far weve managed.	0
today i noticed she doesnt remember who i am anymore, that hurts like nothing else i felt before, but my main concern right now is that i cant make her to take her pills.	0
i think maybe she doesnt trust me since i am now a stranger.	0
(?)	0
any advice would be great.	0
happy new year everyone.	0
honestly a bit more of a  'just want someone to hear me '    visited my parents for christmas and my grandma in her assisted living home.	0
i haven't for a year as the last time i did she didn't remember who i was, and it tore my heart to shreds.	0
toughened my nerves and promised myself i would go see her this year, and it hurt just as much if not more.	0
she remembered me a bit this time, but would instantly forget, but would say how i was quite a nice young man.	0
i got a hug this time but it was during a  ' not sure who you are ' moment.	0
my dad is also starting to show signs, at first i thought i was just paranoid but just in the last six months my mom has agreed he's slipping and it scares her.	0
it scares me too and to put it lightly i've been mentally exhausted since the end of the summer.	0
i'm an only child and the concern and worry about my dad becoming like how my grandma is, and the possibility that my mom may also, since it's her mom in the home, along with them having me later in life and being generally older (my dad is pushing 70 while i'm 24) doesn't help.	0
trying to cope and figure these things out but it's stressful.	0
i've loved being an only child but at 24 i really wish i had a sibling who could help with this and not leave it all to me.	0
been with my wife since i was 19 and had an overall happy marriage until this dreadful thing hit.	0
recently (last 6 months) i've become really friendly with another woman and we enjoy each other's company and are both keen to progress our  'friendship ' within the constraints of my domestic situation.	0
i trust her implicitly.	0
i fully intend to be there for my wife but for the first time in a couple of years i feel genuinely alive again.	0
i've told my adult children about it and although they don't want details, they are fine with it and want me to find a little happiness along the way, but whilst being discrete and respectful.	0
i'm not after permissions and validation from anyone just wanted to gather peoples thoughts on the matter, as my loneliness was starting to hurt.	0
thanks for reading.	0
reggie	0
our specific details are below, but tl,dr: i would love to hear from others about ways that youve gotten your stubborn loved ones to accept in-home & companion care services.	0
what worked well?	0
what totally failed?	0
what recommendations do you have for getting them to accept the new normal?	0
our mom is entering middle stage alzheimers.	0
shes still highly mobile and thats our biggest concern.	0
she has gotten lost on walks, lost her keys on walks, got in a car with strangers that stopped (and asked her to buy them groceries), and neighbors told us they witnessed her nearly cause an accident jay-walking across the busy road a block from her house.	0
my brother lives nearby, but they have three young kids, his wife is in school, and hes got a demanding job  they help out as much as they can, but coming by daily to go on long walks simply isnt an option.	0
we want to get her companion care to accompany her on walks and errands.	0
as rapidly as we can, we want to also add homemaker care: she needs help/supervision in the kitchen, her never-stellar housekeeping skills are vastly diminished, and shes quit doing laundry because she doesnt want to waste water.	0
i suspect shell be needing personal care within a year or so  shes showing signs that incontinence is approaching.	0
it is important to get her acclimated as quickly as possible.	0
she has so far been very resistant to outside help.	0
for example, she lost her license a year ago & we arranged for a family friend that shes known for 20yrs, who works as a lyft driver to be her on-call ride.	0
she only uses him for one ride a week and the rest of the time she expects someone to offer to pick her up, shell sometimes ask for a ride, or she just wont go.	0
she rejects any assistance that feels outside of family or church  the church folks really only give her rides to church activities.	0
we have so far erred on the side of trying to respect her desire for independence even though thats resulted in a lot of wasted time and money on services shes rejected.	0
but we are past the point where shes able to make good decisions for herself, so this one isnt optional.	0
we anticipate shell resist this too & were trying to think of ways to help her accept that this is the new normal without resorting to command and control tactics.	0
suggestions on how to play it?	0
my grandma had alzheimer's or some form of dementia, i'm not sure if it was ever confirmed but i did unfortunately watch her mind deteriorate and run into cycles of having the came conversations over and over again.	0
i was wondering when would be an appropriate time/ age where i should try and get ahead of any symptoms and try to have an mri or speak to my doctor about it.	0
just learn i need to use parental controls on the tv.	0
my mom has alzheimers, my stepfather is able to care for in their home and i try to support them both.	0
my stepfather called me upset that their cable bill was $60 more than normal.	0
when he called, he was told they upgrade plans.	0
he argued with them and they took off the charges.	0
i followed up to see why they were upgraded to the next package.	0
the cable clerk explained that if you click on a channel not in your plan, the system prop asks if you'd like to upgrade by clicking again.	0
this is what happened and between my mom and my stepfather, who struggles with the tv remote, i'm surprised it hasn't happened before.	0
the clerk explained i could fix the upgrade prop with parental control options.	0
please check your tv, this is such an easy mistake for those with alzheimers (and even without)!	0
hi everyone,  im looking for some advice.	0
my grandma who has dementia/alzheimers ( not exactly sure)  lives with my grandpa alone together.	0
he is her main caregiver, although she doesnt recognize that he is her husband ( she thinks they were married at some point but not now ) and that she isnt in her home.	0
she will try and walk out the door to walk and find her house.	0
my mother and i dont live with them but we are close, we use a ring doorbell to see when she tries to leave and go over to help intervene although grandpa is usually able to handle it.	0
my fear is that one day nobody will notice that shes left and we wont be able to find her.	0
the thing is that she always takes her purse with her, does anyone know of a gps tracker that doesnt need to be charged too often and works well, maybe that is compatible with an app.	0
all suggestions are welcome.	0
thanks in advance!	0
i was just wondering if this is a thing or if there's something else she's picking up on.	0
i have a pit-boxer mix and am visiting my family for the holidays.	0
my dad (73) has been diagnosed with alzheimer's....he's of course very forgetful but also prone to making weird faces and howling...creepy laughter..etc.	0
but when he walks into the room even not doing any of that my dog goes ballistic and barks and growls.	0
dad never displays any hostility towards her she just acts like she's on full defense mode when he's around.	0
is that something that anyone else experiences?	0
thanks in advance!	0
my grandma has been dealing with alzheimer's disease for about 5 years.	0
for the last year shes been in stage 5, she still had full sphincter control, she knew when to go to the toilet.	0
but two nights ago she woke up wet.	0
i'm assuming she's stage 6 now  she's pretty far down , she's completely dependent on my grandfather.	0
they're both 79 and i can see how it's consuming him.	0
she still eats and talks a lot , but lately  none of it makes any sort of sense.	0
i'm afraid of having to put her in a place to help my grandfather take a break for once , because she'll feel abandoned  and will probably be angry at my grandfather	0
so a couple weeks ago i made a post venting about the rough weekend i had with my mom.	0
well,  we went to the doctor and he changed one of her meds.	0
she was on lyrica for diabetic leg pain.	0
he changed it over to gabapentin.	0
after a rough couple of days with the new meds,  she is doing so much better.	0
anxiety is down.	0
pain is down.	0
she isn't acting out nearly as much and even she does its a whole lot easier to redirect her.	0
we also have a respite nurse coming once a week for now.	0
getting away for some alone time is a huge help for me.	0
thank you all for the support and kind words.	0
it means so damn much to me!	0
my sister is 80 with worsening dementia.	0
she's being well cared for in a group home near me, and i see her at least once a week.	0
she remembers me, but not much else of the last 30 years.	0
i'm bringing her to my house tomorrow for christmas lunch, as i have for the past two years.	0
before that, after our parents and her husband had passed, she would cook christmas dinner and i would spend the afternoon at her house.	0
when i talked to her today she said this would be the first year she had never made dinner, and she was stressed because she didn't have any presents.	0
she also started to cry because they were having a christmas party at the home, and she didn't know anybody.	0
first, she's lived there for a year and a half.	0
second she used to be a very social, outgoing person.	0
she didn't mind meeting and talking to new people.	0
i understand all the changes.	0
i'm getting used to it.	0
but i'm worried about what will happen when i try to take her home tomorrow.	0
once again, she'll be upset that i'm not taking her  'home, ' because she will once again be certain she has never been to the group home.	0
i don't call her or see her as much as i used to since she's been in the home, because it always ends in tears.	0
sometimes the home calls me because she's convinced that she's being held hostage and she's angry because they won't let her go.	0
these things pass relatively quickly.	0
there's some drama for about a half hour, and then they manage to redirect her and she forgets.	0
but i feel so bad for her, wanting to go home.	0
of course she doesn't understand that this is most likely the last home she will live in.	0
anyway, just kind of needed to vent that.	0
thanks for listening, and blessings and happy holidays to you and yours.	0
my mom forgets about gift cards so they never get used, and the place she lives feeds her more than she could ever eat so food is no good.	0
we just spent 2 years liquidating and estate selling most of her stuff so i don't want to get her clutter.	0
i have spent months trying to think of something and i'm having trouble coming up with anything.	0
so what did you get your loved one with ad?	0
we think my mom has alzheimer's.	0
she doesn't have a diagnosis but she's showing all the early signs, so we had her move in with us in march.	0
most days are fine, but yesterday we got into a big fight.	0
she picked up on an annoyed tone in my voice after she did something small but annoying that she wouldn't have done before her memory loss.	0
she started yelling at me and i started yelling back.	0
it got ugly.	0
i don't know if i should have her keep living here.	0
she gets on my and my husband's nerves, and it's been getting worse recently.	0
we feel like she doesn't always appreciate what we do for her (provide her a free place to live with virtually no expenses), and she gets really oversensitive at times so i feel like i have to walk on eggshells to not offend her.	0
we are expecting our first child in june and i know this situation is only going to become more stressful once we have a baby and we're not getting as much sleep.	0
i know this isn't as heavy as some of the stuff posted here, but i just needed to vent.	0
yesterday at breakfast i was casually told that my grandad has alzheimer's.	0
he's in his 80's so it's not a huge shock, but it still sucks.	0
he's always been forgetful, but i guess i just didn't realise how much.	0
he has a beach that he likes to drive down to, but it's a fair way away and recently he got so lost on his way home that the police actually had to be called because my grandma just didn't know where he was.	0
i believe he arrived home at about 9pm.	0
now he probably won't be able to drive down to the beach anymore (he still has to get a test to see if he can drive, but the area he's allowed to will probably be limited) and i just feel rea sad for him.	0
he's such a great guy.	0
he also has hearing loss, but he refuses to get hearing aids.	0
i'm visiting my grandparents' place for christmas, i got here today and really realised how forgetful he is.	0
and on top of that i'm not even sure he knows he has alzheimer's.	0
anyway, well done if you're reading this far, i really just needed to vent.	0
have a wonderful day!	0
my father's partner has had some kind of dementia for awhile.	0
i saw signs at least a year ago.	0
now she gets lost on a 2 mile drive to the supermarket.	0
she can't remember many events or activities, stays in the apartment all the time, repeats things often.	0
can't remember my dad was in the hospital for 2 months about 3 months ago.	0
my dad has later stage parkinson's.	0
he can't argue with her about her mental state or get her to understand she has something going on.	0
he doesn't have the energy and when he tries to talk to her she stresses him out so much his parkinsons goes into hyperdrive.	0
she absolutely denies a single thing wrong.	0
her son talked to her and said maybe her hearing needs to be checked.	0
she went to a doc with a prior conversation about the concerns by her son to the doc.	0
he ordered an mri but she refuses to move forward.	0
'you all are crazy, there is nothing wrong ' anyway.	0
i am not sure if it's so necessary to get a diagnosis but i worry because she is with dad all the time.	0
she had alzheimers for the past 5ish years and the decline has been fast and heartbreaking to watch.	0
she lost so much weight.	0
there was a time where she would scream in agony all day.	0
she couldnt do anything for herself and towards the end she even forgot how to eat, drink water, walk.	0
even though it has been five years, it feels like it all happened so fast.	0
i remember one day she was telling my dad how she had been driving her car and somehow ended up in the middle of nowhere.	0
and at the time, no one thought anything of it really.	0
but after that, things subtly and gradually got worse.	0
she would forget how to use a tv remote, forget where things were.	0
and eventually she got diagnosed and i still didnt really take it seriously.	0
all old people forget stuff.	0
but it just got worse and worse.	0
she started to forget who my grandad was and would be aggressive towards him, she started having seizures... its like my grandma was 3 different people.	0
theres the grandma i grew up with who was an intelligent, streetwise, quick witted lady who was the centre of our family, the glue that held us all together.	0
then there is her as the alzheimers was in the early stage, the goofy, adorable, silly grandma who always thought our front step was a huge drop when it was actually tiny and giggled at silly nursery rhymes.	0
then there was her at the late stage, an unrecognisable shell.	0
she spent the last year of her life sat in a chair, a far off glassy look in her eye, being completely reliant on other people.	0
i had started university by then and so i wasnt around much.	0
but if im being honest, i didnt visit her enough.	0
my grandad and my aunt and my cousins all had a role in taking care of her and when i was there, i felt like a spare part, useless.	0
i was only close to my grandma, i wasnt close to any of them and im a quiet person by nature, so i wouldnt ever really have much to say.	0
when i was there i felt so out of place...its so odd to feel that way when surrounded by family.	0
as if the situation wasnt depressing enough.	0
not to mention it simply caused me so much pain to watch her suffer the way she did, to see her dignity taken away as people helped her use the bathroom, to see her slipping away.	0
sometimes she would sit and just sob in agony.	0
and that broke me completely.	0
i think i mourned her death long before it happened.	0
shed been gone a long time, her physical body just had to catch up.	0
im angry that this disease exists and there are so many scumbags who will continue to roam the earth in perfect health while my beautiful grandma wont.	0
i am trying to hold onto the precious memories i have with her before this disease got her.	0
i never want to forget the songs she would sing to me, the sound of her laugh, the way she would always tell me my eyes are bigger than my belly when i couldnt finish my dinner, her beautiful smile, the way she smelt when she would hug me, the way she could fix anything, the stories she told me, the way she would always say goodnight, god bless and remember those three little words: i love you as she tucked me into bed.	0
no one will ever be able to fathom how much i loved her and how much i still do.	0
i would give anything to hug my grandma one last time.	0
i hope that one day i will get to do just that.	0
goodnight god bless grandma, remember those three little words: i love you.	0
mum lives with me, i'm trying my best but i work during the day and she doesn't eat until i get home and make dinner.	0
recently been diagnosed with alzheimers and apparently we should be eligible for attendance allowance (and possibly other benefits when that's been granted).	0
could anyone recommend where i should be looking to get someone to visit for half an hour each day around lunchtime to give her some food please?	0
okay so with xmas coming up my moms side of the family is doing a huuge (37 people) get together at my grandparents house.	0
they definitely have enough room for us all but there is one issue.	0
my grandpa.	0
for a few years now my grandpa has been suffering from alzheimer's.	0
he has his good and bad days, but whenever there is a large crowd he just kinda shuts down.	0
is there anything i could do to help him feel more comfortable or help him in anyway?	0
so my  mom is basically my grandmas caregiver.	0
she manages her money and takes care of her.	0
so today my mother her my grandma talking to her sister who lives far away.	0
she was telling her sister that my mom does not feed her,thats shes hungry,she(my mom) has took my card.	0
all of this is a lie.	0
my mother has been busting her butt trying to take care of her.	0
my mom fixes all of her food.	0
there are days that my mom tries and begs to make her eat something but she tells my mom shes not hungry.	0
my mon brings her plates of food everytime she cooks.	0
another problem, she has been faking that her back is hurting.	0
she leans over when someone is around but my mom has seen her walking normally during the night (my mom has a monitor in her room).	0
my mom and grandma live in the same yard so its not like shes being left alone for long periods of time.	0
my uncle who is a alcoholic and is basically deaf without his hearing aid.	0
she sits around watching tv looking for things to order.	0
she has ordered alot of stuff by calling.	0
she has promised alot of people that shell give them money and gets mad when my mom tells her that she doesnt have the money to be giving away to people.	0
my uncle is taking advantage of her illness by asking for money.	0
my mom and i try to get her to go places all the time.	0
ive asked her to go for a ride amd will say ill go next week.	0
it comes to that week she puts it off.	0
she wont even walking on the car porch or sit in the living room.	0
my main problem is thats shes telling people that shes not being fed when my mom buys or cook her food every single day i know this isnt the place to look for professional help but i want to know what you guys suggest.	0
i told my mom we may have to put her in the nursing home.	0
if she keeps telling people shes not being fed this could possibly get my mother in trouble.	0
something has to be done.	0
i posted on here a little while ago for support and man did i get it.	0
i love you all.	0
were all going through something horrific in life, but weve all got each other to confide in.	0
today, i just watched harry potter with my mom.	0
when i was young she used to read the books to me.	0
now, whether or not she realizes what happening, it comforts me to watch the movies with her.	0
my mother was diagnosed with alzheimers around ten years ago.	0
shes is late stage now, cant walk or talk or manage solid foods.	0
yesterday she was the most alert ive seen her recently.	0
she made prolonged eye contact with me and looked puzzled.	0
after i talked to her for a minute or so her expression cleared and she struggled to smile.	0
it affected me more than i thought it could have.	0
it was such a precious moment.	0
i thought shed never recognise me again.	0
maybe its wishful thinking on my part, but i choose to believe that even if she didnt know exactly who i was, she was happy to see the face of someone she loved.	0
i (20f) think my (65m) father has alzheimer's, but im not quite sure so i've come here to ask what y'all think about this.	0
i have already told him that we need to go to the doctor and even though he's stubborn about that i think he will go sometime this week.	0
at around 18:00 he calls me downstairs and tells me that he's  'losing his memory '.	0
i pressed him further and he told me that he  'forgot a conversation ' he had with a family friend that came by to our house today.	0
so i sat there consoling him for an hour.	0
he told he never felt like that before, but couldn't remember certain things between 13:00 and 17:00. things were  'blurry ' and  'scattered '.	0
he could remember yesterday and the days before well though apparently.	0
i was asleep and i thought he was too, but at midnight he calls me downstairs to the kitchen.	0
i asked him what's wrong and he said he can't remember things.	0
he asked me questions he already asked before today and i acted as if i haven't already heard them.	0
he reiterated that this is the first time he felt like this.	0
i sat there and told him that things are going to be okay along with other affirmations.	0
we both went to bed and now i'm typing this up... if anyone has any input that would be great.	0
thank you!	0
she suffered a massive stroke about 6 hours ago.	0
she is on seizure medication, is intubated, and is currently unresponsive.	0
if she is unable to breathe on her own in 48 hours, we are going to honor her end-of-life wishes and remove all life-saving measures.	0
i knew this day was coming, but i'm not ready to say goodbye.	0
hi all, i want to preface by saying i realize there is a faq and that a lot of the problems i might depict in this post are common, but i want to tell a little of my family's story in hopes to get feedback and connect with anyone who has dealt with a similar situation.	0
my father developed dementia and later alzheimers about 5 years ago after i took him to the hospital to be detoxed from alcohol.	0
his alcoholism had gotten so out of hand it was my last resort to try and save him.	0
this unfortunately set off a chain of events that lead to his dementia and alzheimers.	0
he was about 64 years old when this happened and recently retired (forced to due to the alcoholism).	0
my mother is 11 years his junior and is his primary care taker.	0
i live a few hours away, my only other sibling is my brother who lives in the same city as them with his wife and children.	0
my mother has alcoholic tendencies as well and uses it as a crutch to de stress, along with smoking cigarettes.	0
she has anxiety and depression, and sees a therapist (irregularly) to try and alleviate.	0
she takes an anti depressant and i believe that is all.	0
i am extremely concerned about my mothers well being.	0
she is under a great amount of stress dealing with my father, who is fairly far along in his alzheimers progression.	0
we are surprised when he forms a complete sentence or thought, wears diapers that he uses, and my mother helps him bathe.	0
unfortunately, he stays at home alone for the 5 hours in the morning / afternoon that my mother is at work.	0
he is able to feed himself with whats in the kitchen and watches tv/naps while she is away.	0
she has a camera installed on her phone that she uses to watch him while shes at work because its difficult getting him to answer the phone.	0
as you all are aware, in care home or elderly care homes are all very expensive.	0
we are not wealthy, but firmly lower middle class.	0
i don't make a lot of money, my brother and his wife make decent money but have a child and one on the way.	0
they live near by and help when needed but we are all a bit at a loss of what to do and how to help my mom.	0
she is so stressed out constantly, understandbly so since she has to work part time and take care of my father when shes home, rarely getting time for herself.	0
at the moment, we don't really have the funds to put my father in a care facility or anything like that.	0
we may be able to afford it by some way of a small inheritance me and my brother will receive from my father's mother who recently passed, though i fear it is not quite enough to sustain him for the long term there.	0
essentially, my mother is forced to watch my father deteriorate slowly as she sacrifices her life and happiness for him.	0
i have guilt about living far away from them but i had been living in the same city as them for several years and felt stuck and depressed.	0
i moved away for myself and to start my own life (i am 28), as i feel my father and mother wouldn't have wanted me to sacrifice my life to take care of them, though i do second guess this decision all the time and wish i could do more for them.	0
me and my family have reached a plateau the past couple of years where my mother takes care of him, but i feel she is close to a breaking point mentally.	0
she is so anxious, stressed, depressed, talks about how she is lonely, isolated, wants to date, etc.	0
she is committed to caring for my father however and is steadfast in that.	0
she gets frustrated and isn't perfect but she believes it is her duty to help him.	0
partly i just wanted to tell our story, but i also would accept any advice in way of programs or financial aid or anything that could help me and our family out.	0
my father gets worse everyday, it would break my heart to put him somewhere but i do feel sometimes that it would help my mom immensely to be relieved from that duty and stress.	0
thank you for reading, and god speed to anybody out there dealing with this condition.	0
it is the darkest part of my life, has changed who i am as a person, and in some ways helps me appreciate life for what it is - a temporary experience.	0
love and peace to you all.	0
hi all!	0
my grandma is starting to lose her memory (and i believe was told that she is developing alzheimers, but i'm not sure).	0
anyway, what do i do?	0
should i correct her?	0
she never says she doesn't remember things, she just says things that are untrue with regards to recent, current events, and often forgets the year.	0
for instance she thought she was 75 and not 86. she thought my brother was turning 17. he was 21. she says she didn't vote when she did.	0
it was the week after the election.	0
she said she hasn't been to the special exhibition at a museum.	0
my mother took her there the week before.	0
i always just let the moment pass and agree with her, i.e.	0
'yes, it's a very interesting exhibition, you should go, i know you like that sort of stuff.'	0
my mum on the other hand is like: ' remember we went last week?	0
we went together and you said xyz.'	0
which approach is correct?	0
she means a lot to me, and it pains me to see this happening to her.	0
this is a terrible disease.	0
the only plus side i see is that it's happening so late in life and that she had 86 good years.	0
:)	0
my dad is in late stage alzheimer's and recently has started acting out.	0
his doctor is ready to prescribe depakote.	0
does anyone have any experience with a loved one using this medication for agitation?	0
thank you for any input.	0
5 years ago my grandmother was diagnosed with dementia, and roughly 2 years ago, alzheimer's was tacked on.	0
it's been quite the journey to get to where we are now with her.	0
there's been multiple home moves, many doctors/specialists appointments, and a lot of family meetings with my mum and her siblings.	0
my mum is currently off work, and has spent the most time making sure my grandma is well taken care of.	0
none of her 3 siblings make the effort as, and i quote,  'what do you want me to do about it??	0
i have my own life to think about ' my mum goes multiple times a week with my grandpa, and knows how to effectively redirect my grandma when she's on a  'thr nurses are hitting me/my husband's sleeping with other women/he's beating me too ' line of thought.	0
these nurses are an absolute god send, and my grandpa has never laid a hand on her, nor would he ever.	0
they don't even live together, as my grandma is in a wonderful ltc facility and grandpa is on the wait list to get in the same place.	0
anyways, my issue is this.. my aunts and uncles all want to take my grandma out of the home for a big family get together (where grandma will recognize maybe 4 people) and i believe this to be a horrid idea.	0
not only because of how big (and confusing) our family is, but how badly she will lose her marbles when they have to take her back in.	0
she has fought nurses screaming  'help me [my mum]!!	0
'when my mum has taken my grandpa to see her, and they were leaving to bring grandpa home.	0
my grandma thought she was going with them, and it was heartbreaking just to hear about.	0
i think it's selfish of my aunt, and detrimental to my grandma's mental health to bring her out for a few hours.	0
i have made it known how i feel, and that i won't be a part of it.	0
my mum is disappointed that i won't be coming, but i have nothing nice to say to a lot of my extended family, and i refuse to watch my aunt try to guilt my mum into bringing my grandma back (which my mum has already said no to.	0
but who respects no, right?)	0
am i the bad guy for refusing to go, and making it known that i think they're selfish ?	0
i'm sorry this is long and all jumbled up, i'm overwhelmed and don't have anyone to talk to about any of this.	0
mom's been pretty deep in alzheimer's for a while now.	0
at the beginning of this year she could sign her name pretty competently, now i'm not sure that she could hold a pen, let alone read, and she certainly can't sign her name.	0
my dad's the primary caregiver, and i'm the backup.	0
i had to give her a bath for the first time recently, which was upsetting, but it's hard to stop and consider your own emotions when there's a bone thin woman in the bathtub crying because she's cold.	0
my sister's been pretty great, we've had serious conversations about moms decline, she's visiting frequently and making sure that she spends time with mom.	0
my brother on the other hand has been frustrating to say the least.	0
everytime he visits he's got his girlfriend in tow, he doesn't prioritize his family, he runs off and does touristy things with his girlfriend, and gets drunk and parties.	0
he hasn't made time for the serious shitty conversations, and i can't express to him how frustrated i am because i haven't been alone with him in two years cause his girlfriend's always there.	0
in the family group chat he always turns himself into the victim cause we're mean to him because we're frustrated with him and he doesn't have the emotional intelligence to figure that out, so i just confronted him about it, and he said he's gonna visit more this year, and i responded that's great and all but im beginning to doubt she'll last another year.	0
which is true, but maybe a little too mean.	0
i'm just upset cause really the time to have made an effort has passed but im also afraid that i hurt him cause he hasn't responded.	0
do alzheimers patients experience a deterioration in language skills of their secondary tounge?	0
if they do remember both languages, are they aware they are speaking different languages?	0
in reading these threads, i always wonder about the timeline of events leading up to a persons diagnosis.	0
for instance, my mothers journey would look like this: 2014: father gets leukemia, mom has trouble visiting him in the city.	0
later, my nephew is born and she seems somewhat apathetic.	0
hes born in the city as well, and she gets lost trying to visit.	0
we chalk it up to her being a nervous driver.	0
she is 64.	0
2015: gets lost going to mcdonalds in the dark... a drive shes made dozens of times before in an area shes lived in for 30 years.	0
we chalk it up to cataracts, which she has removed later in early 2016.	0
2016: my aunt is placed in assisted living with advanced alzheimers in august.	0
i knew she wasnt quite right, but i had no clue it had gotten so bad because mom had never indicated as much.	0
driving back from the hospital alone, mom ends up on the wrong side of the road and enters an army base.	0
shes pulled over by a half dozen cops.	0
at this point im in denial, but i urge her to get a mental health exam.	0
she gets a referral from the doctor, but between my aunt and life, nothing ever comes of it.	0
2017: mom continues to slip.	0
shes still independent but she no longer understands how to gas up a car, she refuses to cook, and shes been escorted home several times in the dark from church.	0
i tell her she cant go out at night anymore.	0
in october, she cant remember when her next drs appointment is, so instead of calling, she drives there and ends up lost.	0
the dr drops her off, leaving me to find her car, which she cant remember where she left.	0
2018: i start receiving late notices in the beginning of the year.	0
shes writing the checks but the written amounts dont match the numerical amounts.	0
when leaving to go to target shes gone for hours at a time.	0
target is 2 minutes away.	0
when questioned about why shes been gone so long, she gets defensive.	0
i have a panic attack every time she leaves.	0
i ask her to let me know where shes going but she rarely does.	0
i force her to go to the drs for another referral, where the dr clearly states that she has dementia.	0
im stunned that he didnt think it was important to tell her family that.	0
in april we have our first neurologist appointment.	0
in june, shes officially diagnosed with alzheimers at the age of 67. in july, my brother and i make the decision that its no longer safe for her to drive.	0
in late august, she gets angry with me for not sharing a personal pizza with her.	0
this aggression happens a couple times a month.	0
in december, my aunt passes at 73. mom wont let me help her pick out an outfit; she decides on the same black jeans she always wears and a sweatshirt.	0
from this point on, her aggression and paranoia have a marked increase.	0
in january 2019, her sense of taste change, and she starts throwing out food i make her unless its sweet or bland.	0
over the next several months, her behavior worsens, including tantrums and physical aggression.	0
her hygiene begins to suffer, and she aggressively cuts her own hair, leaving both sides patchy but the top long.	0
she refuses to let me take her to get a cut.	0
in may, my brother and i place her in an assisted living community.	0
she still speaks poorly of me, despite not having seen me since june.	0
she turned 69 in december.	0
thats about it for me.	0
what does your timeline look like?	0
so, my grandmother is possibly showing signs of alzheimers/dementia.	0
for quite a while, probably a year at least, she has made small comments about people doing things around her home.	0
about 6 months ago, she got into an argument with my mother, saying that people were coming and going from her home, and said that my stepdad was doing weird things in her home and that she didn't want him there any more (he is never there and is not doing any of the things she is saying).	0
about a month ago, that happened again, where she was gone for awhile and when my mom brought her home, she thought someone had been there.	0
my mother has told me about this things, but i had never seen it firsthand.	0
last week, grandma had a surgery, so yesterday i stayed with her for the day.	0
everything was fine all day, she seemed to be herself.	0
at some point in the evening, all of the sudden she was at her front door, then basically running from window to window looking outside.	0
when she finally sat back down, she got upset and told me that her outside light had blinked and everyone thinks she's crazy, but she's not crazy, and someone is messing with her electrical systems and she doesn't know who it is but is she could catch them she'd kill them.	0
earlier in the day, she had been telling me how mush she loves her house and will never move.	0
long story short, she is widowed and lives alone and we don't have a clue how to go about getting her help.	0
she obviously doesn't think she needs it, and i'm at a loss.	0
my mother is the one who is with her the most and is dealing with it the most.	0
my uncle, who lives in another state, thinks we just have to wait for something to actually happen that will force her to get help.	0
i'm going to look into support groups, and maybe even counseling for myself.	0
how did all of you go about getting the diagnosis?	0
hey everyone.	0
im here to look for a little support for how to best connect with my grandma (69yo) before she passes.	0
she was diagnosed with alzheimers a few years ago, but had a recent steep decline.	0
over the past few months, she has been in the hospital for erratic behavior and they think that she had several strokes while in the hospital (possibly due to psych meds, but thats another story).	0
shes now on hospice and cant talk anymore.	0
last time i saw her, she only seems to acknowledge others around her sometimes, often staring off into nothing for a while.	0
she cant feed herself or go to the bathroom by herself.	0
i live a few states away, but have been trying hard to see her at least once a month.	0
i worry every time i see her will be the last.	0
so christmas has always been very important to her.	0
i feel bad not getting her anything, but i dont know what might be appropriate for her.	0
i thought of baking her something because we did that together, but ive been told she isnt eating much.	0
i always did crafts with her, but i cant think of anything to make.	0
it doesnt have to be a gift, either, but maybe something i can do with her.	0
hi everyone, i just stumbled onto this thread/reddit/i have no idea what it is called and it's exactly what i needed.	0
it's been a long road with my dad and i have a while to go yet.	0
so thanks in advance to everyone that may  help me out with random questions.	0
recently, my dad has had big swing in his sense of taste.	0
right now he has claimed that things are too salty (when there is very little/no salt in the food) or that something tastes  'off ' (i have asked what it means, but only get that it doesn't taste good).	0
i am curious if this is something others have experienced and, if so, what did you do?	0
thanks!	0
ive been looking for someone for a while now.	0
ever since my ex and i broke up, ive been bottling up a lot of my emotions regarding my moms alzheimers.	0
she was diagnosed almost ten years ago, but it was a few years ago when it really hit me.	0
when her caretaker dropped her off with me and told her i was there if she needed anything and she responded who?	0
that word was like a dagger to my heart.	0
its been suggested before that i seek out a forum like this but i dont know if itd help but lately ive been feeling more and more upset about the whole thing so i thought id reach out.	0
so quick nondescript info: my mom is late-night 60's just diagnosed wit with early onset alzheimers.	0
me: late-ish 30s, two kids who are nearing 10. so before i get to deep in, my mom has an amazing support  system around her.	0
since her diagnosis, everyone has really answered the call (really hoping it stays consistent with some of my siblings).	0
anyways, i'm looking for advice, when is the right time to start talking to my bearing 10-year-olds.	0
i'm not sure that they'd really notice anything at this point, but i can only assume its a matter of time before the see changes.	0
i dont want to over inform them, i dont want to scare them, and i don't want them to think they need to act differently (they absolutely love spending time with nana, especially since she is about 2 hours away and we cant see her as much as we'd like).	0
i guess i'm just looking for advice.	0
this is all scary to me and i feel like i'm lying to my kids and but i want to try and make the best of a horrendous situation.	0
any thoughts?	0
the home had a holiday party where my dad is.	0
new meds have him chill.	0
it was a lovely evening.	0
i have a 90 minute drive to see him.	0
cried all the way home.	0
mixed emotions but it's all good.	0
poured a bourbon as soon i got home.	0
it is not a solution but maybe it could make a different in the life of many.	0

my grandad (82) has early onset dementia.	0
hes had a few falls that have hospitalised him, leaving him weak, with swollen feet (his heart isnt pumping so fluid doesnt move) and with delirium due to infections.	0
he came out of hospital after the first fall in august and he was home for a little while but then he had a really bad infection, which caused another fall 3 weeks ago and he went back into hospital, a week ago he was transferred to the rehab hospital so he can get better with physio as he is incredibly weak.	0
when he was in the big hospital, he had such bad delirium and he could barely even feed himself.	0
he went through a really dark period where he was saying he didnt want to go on and everything is so much effort.	0
now hes in the physio hospital and its a lot closer to home so we can visit him more but he seems to have just given up.	0
i mean - he doesnt seem to do a thing in the hospital, just sit and stare at this tiny tv.	0
he keeps saying he is gonna just home for a few days because he gets confused about where he is.	0
he gets angry when we try to help him... like i mentioned that his new electric chair arrived and that if he works really hard in physio then hell get home to it soon.	0
he snapped at me which hes never done.	0
anyway - my point.	0
im scared that being in hospital is going to hasten his dementia to deteriorate faster.	0
and im scared he isnt going to ever come out and he wont be here for much longer.	0
hes... really lost.	0
:(	0
my grandfather is currently in the early stages of alzheimers.	0
he is still living in a home with my grandmother, but we would like to purchase him something similar to a fitbit just in case.	0
he currently wears a fitbit daily and charges it nightly.	0
i am looking at an apple watch with a data plan, but didnt know if there were better options.	0
he does not ever carry his phone with him so we need something outside of just phone tracking	0
i'm just at a complete loss right now.	0
my mil ate a week's worth of groceries in 2 days.	0
she then proceeded to eat my personal groceries as well, so well over $100 in less than half a week.	0
i'm not making enough money for all of this, and the next few weeks are now probably going to be rice & beans to stretch it out.	0
my partner is trying, but it's been like feeding a black hole, she sneaks down in the middle of the night and cleans the place out.	0
i'm just at a complete loss right now.	0

either way, are there any locks that you'd recommend?	0
we've decided to lock all of the cupboards and the fridge, leaving her snack cabinet open with her food for the day.	0
she is in the late stages of alzheimers, and every night she asks me  'have you ever been here before? '	0
and i say of course and explain to her that we are still in the town we have lived in for over half a decade, which just confuses her and then she will ask again in a minute or two.	0
my question is what can i do to make her realize that she is home?	0
my mom has early stage alzheimers and has already been the victim of one scammer.	0
i need something that will automatically send any unknown, untrusted numbers to voicemail.	0
ive found the sentry product online but it seems too easy to get around by pressing 0 and then calling back.	0
theres no reason for my mom to pick up a call from an unknown caller at this point.	0
any ideas?	0
i've said he doesn't (which is the truth).	0
but then she insists he does.	0
i ask how she knows and she just says that she knows he is with her.	0
she has said it to me and to my stepdad in person.	0
i know i am not supposed to argue or disagree, but i can't fathom just saying  'oh well, ' when she says stuff like that.	0
my dad has untreated bipolar disorder and ocd, as well as mild/moderate dementia.	0
most of the bipolar stuff has mellowed quite a bit.	0
apparently that is typical.	0
he does still feel restless and likes to walk (not wander - he does have a goal,  he just gets lost because his spatial abilities worsened after a car accident some years ago).	0
but the hypomania of before isnt really present.	0
he does live on his own and gets lonely, and is depressed as a result.	0
however, when hes around people, hes in a good mood.	0
he just wants that all the time, thats the problem.	0
hes too willful to comply with a schedule for a day program, hed rather go where he wants to go (im in touch with him through the day to help him back if he gets lost).	0
i live 1-1.5 hours away, am trying to move closer to him, that isnt happening immediately.	0
maybe in six months if all goes well.	0
i see him once every week or so, he has psws.	0
he just saw a psychiatrist who wants to give him seroquel for the depression.	0
because an ssri could trigger mania, ok fair enough.	0
except  i just read that seniors with dementia should specifically not be given seroquel?	0
theres a risk of death because of heart problems?	0
(which he already has.)	0
he was given haldol, another antipsychotic, in hospital recently -  and that was a nightmare, had tons of hallucinations and delusions, which is unusual for him.	0
seroquel could make him drowsy - if hes out walking and falls, his condition would be worse...  im inclined to not get this drug for him, and my so and mom (his ex wife) agree... thoughts?	0
my sister went to a medium last week and ever since than i have been thinking about my grandfather, george, who passed away from alzheimers in october of 2010. it's not like i dont think of him all the time, but the moment she told me about her experience he became top of mind.	0
it took many years to heal from his death and i just wanted to wish those who are going through this moment in their life a very happy holiday season.	0
cherish every moment with your loved ones.	0
cheers, chris	0
out of state family refused to listen so i sent them some test results -- &#x200b; after watching my mom struggle trying to convince my aunt, uncle, and grandfather that my grandmother needed to have her driver's license taken away, i did some research and found this interesting assessment online--share with anyone who needs help deciding what to do!	0
https://www.qzzr.com/c/quiz/474188/self-sufficiency-assessmen	0
i guess i just need to vent to someone.	0
my mom was diagnosed about 3 years ago.	0
she also has diabetes.	0
im trying to keep her home as long as i can.	0
friday evening when i was getting her to bed, she was upset because i woke her up from the recliner to go to bed.	0
her feet swell and if i put the foot rest up,  she tends to slide out.	0
saturday morning all hell broke loose.	0
im worthless,  she hates me,  she's leaving,  why don't i just die and leave her alone,  throwing things,  hitting me,  you name it.	0
she refused meds and meals.	0
i did finally get an ensure into her before bed.	0
this morning more of the same.	0
i finally lost my shit and told her if she wanted to leave at least let me get her shoes and coat on.	0
i told her i would contact police and she could go to a home.	0
im done,  i can't take any more.	0
she sat back down,  i ugly cried in the bathroom for about an hour.	0
when i calmed down and came back out,  she asks what's for supper,  why am i crying,  she loves me .	0
i'm trying ro get her on medicaid so i can be a paid caregiver and also so we can afford daycare or respite care a couple days a week.	0
im the only one to take care of her.	0
i know most of this it's the disease talking.	0
but holy shit.	0
im so emotionally empty right now.	0
thanks for listening.	0
im feeling a little better now	0
long story short, my grandmother is in the end stages.	0
she cannot move, is barely conscious at any time, and has lost her ability to swallow.	0
i told my mom i thought grandma is in pain and that a nurse i spoke with said we need to ask them about palliative care.	0
my mom told me she talked to another nurse, the main nurse, let's call her janet.	0
janet said she learned in nursing school that as the terminal condition worsens, my grandma's brain will release endorphins to ease her pain.	0
i call bs.	0
that doesn't happen with other terminal pain.	0
she can't communicate her pain, but i feel it when i see her.	0
my mom and i had a conversation like this:  me: if she may be suffering pain, it would be kinder to let them start the morphine, even if it hastens her passing.	0
mom: but once you start the morphine, it will eventually kill her.	0
me: isn't it more cruel to deny her possible relief?	0
mom: you don't know that, and i'm not having this conversation right now  she bought the thing about magical endorphins while grandma starves to death wholesale.	0
so did everybody else.	0
i can't stand to be around them right now.	0
it is unbearable cruelty to force her to exist like this when palliative care is an option.	0
i understand they don't want to let go but she's not going to get better.	0
we have to let her go.	0
am i being the bad guy here?	0
my mom seems to think i'm heartless.	0
i can't do anything in this situation anyway and it's really depressing me.	0
my family finally got my grandma, who is suffering from alzheimer's, into a care home after she fell and broke her hip while she was home alone.	0
she's been in there since april of this year and i've only gone to see her 3 or 4 times.	0
it's so selfish, but it's so hard to make myself go see her.	0
i hate seeing here in a home that isn't the home i grew up in while she's surrounded by stranger and nurses.	0
not to mention she isn't the grandma i grew up with anymore.	0
my whole childhood i wanted nothing more than to go over to my grandma's every single weekend, she was my best friend.	0
i have so many amazing childhood memories with her and now she's just a shell of what i remember.	0
how do i get over this?	0
i feel so selfish and sad and i know that once she passes i'll regret not seeing her more.	0
like i said, i just can't bring myself to go visit her.	0
it's so depressing seeing her in the state that she's in right now, and i can't even talk with her privately because she's surrounded by the other residents.	0
any advice is welcome.	0
my mil is showing very obvious signs of some form of dementia, but her doctor is not interested in pursuing any real diagnosis.	0
my fil hasnt pushed for it either.	0
theyre both really stubborn and are just managing life as if nothing is all that different.	0
the doctor eventually admitted that yes, its likely dementia and when my fil asked what he should do about it, he was told to read about it on the internet and see what others do.	0
implying that its only a matter of minor lifestyle changes.	0
my husband is really frustrated.	0
he is an only child and we live in the us.	0
the parents are in the netherlands.	0
my question is- how is alzheimers diagnosed vs other forms of dementia?	0
and does it matter?	0
meaning, is there any different treatment that should be administered?	0
i saw one last year with two women talking about a husbands early onset and subsequent death.	0
it was from a website that promotes general health i think.	0
it was about how he really seized the day.	0
hi, my grandfather has alzheimers, and lately, he's been overfeeding his dog to an alarming degree.	0
the dog, princess, is quite old and already very overweight.	0
one single bag of treats is supposed to last at least a month and a half.	0
last week, he fed her two entire bags.	0
my grandmother has tried telling him that he can't do that, but he's just not understanding (which, of course, is not his fault).	0
hiding the treat bags won't do any good, as he'll just drive to the store and buy more on his own.	0
princess isn't in the greatest health and we're all worried about the effects that my grandfather overfeeding her will have, but there isn't much we can do to stop him from doing it.	0
does anybody have any ideas as to how we should go about handling this?	0
thank you	0
aside from regularly shoplifting spring onions in his top pocket (poking up and hitting his cheek) , my dad has outdone himself this week when he used wd40 as a moisturising hand cream.	0
i shouldn't laugh but it's hilarious.	0
whats one piece of advice youd give to someone whos parents or loved one has been recently diagnosed?	0
this isnt necessarily advice but id recommend writing down or video recording them telling their life stories.	0
ask the random questions youd love to know or might want to know in the future.	0
dad's (90) facility is having a holiday party for the residents and family.	0
nice thing to do, however, this past weekend he tried to escape twice resulting in the facility placing a ankle monitor on him.	0
my father's alzheimers has him being very verbally abusive.	0
my fear is on this visit he will disrupt what should be an enjoyable visit for the other families.	0
anxiety level already increasing.	0
my kids have pointed it out for a couple years and we often laugh about her forgetfulness.	0
i have always believed it was a simple age thing - we all forget our keys, our cell phones etc.	0
or what we went down stairs for... this weekend for the first time i felt embarrassed for-my wife.	0
a family friend that weve known for 30 years, who we always socialize with mentioned something about being left handed.	0
my wife acted surprised and said no way!	0
im left handed too!	0
i mean, we all know whos left handed in the family - it shouldnt be a surprise.	0
so the question becomes when does forgetfulness become a serious issue that needs medical attention.	0
also at mid50s are there any treatments that could help?	0
how did you find out your loved one had dementia/alzheimers?	0
what were the early signs?	0
how old were they?	0
you?	0
suppose someone has a mutation in a gene implicated in the prevention of beta-amyloid plaque thereby increasing their chance of ad.	0
if they are never diagnosed with ad, are they still more likely to develop conditions related to synaptic plaque and lewey bodies?	0
ftdementia etc thanks	0
curious if anyone has any insight into this particular mutation.	0
a family member has this mutation, and their grandparent had ad.	0
any thoughts?	0
thanks in advance!	0
my dad (59m) was officially diagnosed with alzheimers a few months ago.	0
he had memory problems that were noticeable for 1-2 years before.	0
i (33f) was married to a man for 3 years.	0
together for about 4 1/2.	0
he has 3 children (20f, 14f, 13m) who we were the primary caregivers of the younger two.	0
these kids were for all intents and purposes my parents grandchildren.	0
they called him opa.	0
we lived locally and saw them regularly.	0
my ex husband and i have been divorced for almost 2 years.	0
my step daughter (14f) text me to ask how my dad was doing on thanksgiving.	0
i told my dad because i thought it would make him feel loved.	0
i could tell when i told him there was no recognition.	0
i tried to clarify dad, m, d daughter.	0
still no recognition.	0
how do you tell people how he is doing without saying well today he couldnt remember who you are.	0
its just so heartbreaking.	0
my father hasnt been diagnosed with alzheimers yet, only dementia.	0
he lives with me and i take care of him financially and everything else on my single income.	0
i will be relocating for work, selling my house, and moving away against his wishes.	0
my sister had originally agreed to take on his care on the east coast (im in ca) since theyre better off financially, have dual income, 2 teenager children, etc.	0
great!	0
im 30 and single working 60+ hours a week and barely scraping by!	0
i have no social life, no significant other and definitely no time to find one.	0
and who would want to start a relationship with someone in this situation?	0
she just spent a week with him and suddenly says she cant do it.	0
she needs to take care of her marriage and her family and cant contribute financially anything.	0
he gets $1,100 from social security and thats it.	0
he gets medicare and medical-cal but those wont take care of his ltc.	0
i feel so stranded and out of options.	0
my strenuous relationship with my sister is out the window and im frantic to try and find any and all resources as we move forward because, no matter what, im moving and wont be able to afford the time or financial burden to take proper care of him.	0
in ca, you can be required by law to cover your parents financial and health care needs but how can i be required to go bankrupt to take care of my dad?	0
hi; my dad has early onset alz (diagnosed at 56, 5 years ago) and is still in the moderate stages.	0
does anyone have suggestions for a simple toy or activity my family could give him for the holidays?	0
hes still very aware of/embarrassed by his forgetfulness and challenges so i want to find something that isnt too obviously designed for children, like some of the alz toys ive seen.	0
we have an alexa system for him to listen to music and podcasts, but hes had a lot of nervous energy lately and needs something to do with his hands.	0
thanks in advance	0
i took my dad to a memory specialist last week and she thinks he has moderate alzheimer's disease.	0
i knew he was having memory problems but since he lost his wife (my mom) a 7 weeks ago and has been doing a lot worse.	0
what are my options?	0
i live about 50 miles away, and can't see him every day.	0
he won't allow me to hire help and doesn't seem interested in moving to an assisted.	0
this is going to sound awful but i don't want to spend any more time with my dad then i have to.	0
he was abusive to me when i lived with him and has shown very little interest in me my entire life.	0
i am very uncomfortable when we are together.	0
i take medication for anxiety and literally tremble after every visit and it is causing my ibs which had been gone for years to return.	0
i just want to stay home and mourn my mom in peace.	0
my dad has a lot of money is there a service he or i can pay to take care of him.	0
what happens to people who do not have family?	0
i know this sounds bad maybe i just need to vent a little my father has called me more in the last 7 weeks than in the last 25 years.	0
it just doesn't seem fair that he can treat me like crap my entire life and now that he is alone i am suppose to take care of him.	0
i do love him and want him safe and as happy as possible but i don't like him and when he was in his right mind he sure didn't seem to like me.	0
a relative has ad.	0
me being a biohacker and really inspired by david sinclairs book, ordered some nmn for him to test.	0
background: nad+ booster cured ad in mice in this study: https://www.pnas.org/content/115/8/e1876 sure he is not a mouse, but he shares 92% of dna with a mouse and i figured as the disease progression is pretty bad so he doesnt have too much to lose by trying something that has not passed human trials yet.	0
nmn seems to be the most potent/least bad nad+ precursor and high dose resveratrol seems to improve nad+ boosting effects.	0
put him on 0.5g nmn + 0.5g resveratrol per day orally, nmn in pill and resveratrol mixed in turkish yoghurt.	0
(will not post any links, dont want to make any money on this, but be aware that the supplement industry is full of products with questionable contents).	0
no other major lifestyle changes, its hard to teach old dogs new tricks.	0
3 weeks later i get a report back.	0
after about 2 weeks he noticed greatly increased energy levels and mental clarity, memory seems to be improved.	0
4 weeks later at the doctor he passed the memory and numbers test, not sure if this was better than before, but he seemed proud of this.	0
partner reports noticing much improved memory, he still struggles to remember events from the months before, but new things seem to stick better.	0
just wanted to share this promising result.	0
anyone else doing nmn for ad?	0
he was diagnosed a few years ago and has progressively gotten worse, he would always talk about the old days but mix it up with some current events, now it seems he doesn't remember anything but the past.	0
i talk with him daily and he repeats himself a lot, sometimes the same thing every 20 seconds for 5 minutes.	0
when he does this i don't interject, i let him repeat himself.	0
is this the right thing to do?	0
i feel like it is but i'm not sure.	0
hey - i'm not really sure what i'm doing, but i need some help and am not really sure where to go or who to reach out to.	0
my mother was diagnosed with alzheimer's about a month ago by her pcp.	0
i went to the appointment with her for support, as we feared she may have alzheimer's already (it took her father several years ago).	0
the doctor put her on some medications, but they ended up not working out for her (they caused a syncopal episode).	0
my mom lives with my father about an hour away from me.	0
i'm 33, married, and an only child.	0
i guess... does anyone have resources or some kind of guidebook on how to deal with a parent having this disease?	0
a book recommendation or.. anything?	0
i know that's probably asking a lot, but i feel totally lost and alone here.	0
i don't know when symptoms require intervention, what to look out for, and what steps to take as things progress.	0
the doctor didn't say if her symptoms were mild, moderate, severe, etc, but it sounds like maybe he should have?	0
she seems coherent most of the time, but just does or says things that don't make sense now and then, so i'm hoping her case is still mild.	0
i'm getting worried about her hurting herself in her home, especially after thanksgiving when she nearly burned herself in the kitchen.	0
she gets very upset if the topic of alzheimer's is brought up, the same thing with my father.	0
i think they want to continue on like nothing is going on, but i feel we should be taking a more proactive approach on how to handle this?	0
for example, my father told me yesterday that my mom had had a couple checks bounce (she's in charge of their finances and that kind of thing never happens).	0
we know something needs to be done, but are just not sure what, and are trying to be very delicate with anything we do or say as to not upset her more.	0
sorry if this is a bit rambly, i'm just a bit upset and confused after the holiday.	0
any insight is appreciated.	0
i really don't know what to do.	0
as we head into the end of the year, we are hopefully surrounded by people we love and cherish.	0
while this may not always be the case, i hope all of you find some peace and love with family and friends.	0
i'm very thankful that all of you reading this have managed to find this sub, and that you share your experiences, frustrations, and triumphs with everyone.	0
be safe, all of you!	0
happy thanksgiving!	0
i just saw a post about this on the personal finance sub.	0
https://www.cdss.ca.gov/in-home-supportive-services it looks like if you meet qualifications, the state can pay you, primary caregiver, to take care of your loved one at home.	0
i just found out about it and dunno anything about it but maybe it will help a financially strapped caregiver here.	0
maybe theres even similar programs in other states.	0
i have not heard about such a thing until today.	0
sorry if you guys already knew about stuff like this but i didn't and i was dealing with alz in my fam a long time.	0
anyway happy tg folks.	0
take care.	0
we moved mom into assisted living back in late may, and boy, its been a big relief for me.	0
as her main caregiver, i was the main recipient of her paranoia, delusions, and abuse.	0
shes in the mid/late stages at this point.	0
while my brother visits her every other week, i havent been since late june when she told me leave; she still regularly talks about how ive stolen her money and put her in the home, and how she doesnt belong there.	0
when we put her in the assisted living community i made the decision that if shes still going to be angry at me spending holidays with her are out of the question.	0
she made my last several (before entering assisted living) holidays/birthdays kinda miserable and im just not willing to endure that again, especially when were going to spend all day at my brothers in-laws.	0
still, it makes me sad thinking about her without her family.	0
i compromised many years during the holidays, making sure we could all be together, and its hard to accept that, for now, she wont be a part of that.	0
i wish, for just a day, she could understand what was happening to her, so we could enjoy some time together as a family.	0
my stepfather has had a diagnosis for moving in on 15 years now and has a marked decline over the last year.	0
he is recently starting to speak in gibberish occasionally and has had caretakers coming in while mother mother is at work since last spring.	0
mother mother tends to live in a bit of denial and thinks that she still has a while to go before he will need a nursing home, i think she probably has about 6 months before he really should have more care than she can afford or be able to give him.	0
is there anything that needs to be done prior to getting someone placed in a nursing home or is it just a when you need it you go right in and they get you set up?	0
there is only one option within an hour of where my parents live so they won't need to make any decisions about where, it's just more of a how, and how to finance thing.	0
as the alzheimer's progresses my fil will struggle more to look after mil.	0
we don't want to separate them, he wouldn't want to live in a care home anyway.	0
what's the alternative?	0
a live in carer?	0
how do we go about finding one (based in uk)?	0
is there anything else we should look into?	0
she fainted on the toilet and told me something hurt so i panicked and called an ambulance.	0
we were in the hospital from 7pm to 4am.	0
which, honestly, is the shortest hospital visit i've ever been on.	0
they ran a bunch of uncomfortable tests and gave her fluids.	0
i turns out that she was just pushing too hard and made herself faint.	0
anyway.... that was fun.	0
i 'm going to go commit suicide via coffee and donuts now.	0
... sometimes the littlest of moments can turn it around.	0
have to...	0
i think i posted a month ago about my grandma (68).	0
my goal was to visit her every saturday from the moment i found out she was in the nursing home.	0
this is a rant/somewhat need advice(?)	0
one, i feel like crap because ive visited a total of 1 time.	0
its been a month or maybe 5 weeks.	0
im such a crappy granddaughter for this.	0
two, i think the second time i was going to visit her, i was promised by older brother that he would take me and his son to see her at 10:30 am.	0
i drove to his home at 10:30, got there at 10:45 & his car was still there.	0
i knocked like a billion times and his wife answered and said you deal with him.	0
he wasnt awake and when i asked him about it, he said he wasnt going to go.	0
i think i felt crushed at that moment, i kinda lost it and i havent seen him since.	0
now that thanksgiving is coming up, i have to see him, but i want to see my grandma because its a holiday and because i love her, but i want my brother to go with me.	0
im just upset with myself, my brother, and this whole situation.	0
why is it so hard for me to go see her?	0
why am i being such a pos granddaughter and already doing it?	0
why wont my brother see her at all?	0
my 90 year old father has been in a facility for about 2 months.	0
his alzheimers has made his already abusive behavior increasingly more frequent.	0
my mom, sister and i,  mostly mom, were the victims of his rage throughout our lives.	0
there were good times but the pain of my almost 60 years is still very real.	0
mom has visited once and he immediately became verbally abusive.	0
my sister visits at least once a week but it always includes him yelling.	0
he barely sleeps.	0
his doctor is not attentive to his needs.	0
although i love him because he is my father my fear is i visit.	0
he becomes abusive and i can handle that,  but then leaving the staff and more importantly the other residents with his rage.	0
i feel quilty not visiting but i'm trying to find peace too.	0
i hope none of you dementia caregivers can relate to this post, but i'm guessing some of you will.	0
my ugliest truth there are some caregiver truths i just don't wanna know.	0
hi!	0
id like to know what are the most effective method for preventing alzheimers progress... i know aerobic exercise, just like walking, is very effective for slowing alzheimers progress, but what else can we do?	0
my mother is in an early stage (between 3 or 4, in a 7-scale), and id like to do everything i can to slow progress... shes been in stage 3-4 for a year, now.	0
ive read that some people can stay up to 4 years before progressing...	0
title really says it all... my dad (69) is now in a state where he's unable to function on his own, forgets who people are, does weird stuff, and all the usual alzheimer-y stuff.	0
my mum (66) is the one taking care of him, essentially babysitting him 24/7, and she's mentally and emotionally exhausted.	0
every time i call her, i can tell that she's been crying recently.	0
it breaks my heart and i have no idea what to say or do to somehow make it better for her.	0
so if anyone has any experience with this, i'd really appreciate some advice... :(	0
my mother has been diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's, and i know a lot about the disease, but nothing about how she is able to support herself while living with it in her later stages.	0
if you guys don't mind, i'll list some of my questions below (we are in ohio for reference).	0
how would she be able to support herself when she is no longer able to work?	0
she has no retirement or savings, and disability will not let you file and make a livable wage at the same time.	0
she didn't recognize me for the first time while visiting.	0
how could i help her from suffering through that scare again?	0
what could i do to help her?	0
the internet hasn't given me many options, if there are any.	0
just got off the phone with my grandmother who, for the first time, didnt recognize me right away.	0
all four of my grandparents have had or have the disease so i know it will only get worse.	0
i was looking for folks who know what its like to lose loved ones in this way.	0
i was so frustrated scrolling through the alzheimersgroup seeing that stupid garfield comic thinking it was the right subreddit.	0
glad i eventually came across this sub	0
i'm my mother's caregiver,  going on the second year now,  and i'm really starting to get burned out.	0
i need a day off or something!	0
her counselor told me to look into respite care,  but if i'm reading this correctly,  medicare only pays for 95% of up to 5 days of respite care,  and only after they qualify for hospice care.	0
i don't think my mother is as the point where she's ready for hospice; her health is relatively good considering,  and she still knows who i am.	0
we can't afford several hundred dollars a day out of pocket for respite care at a nursing home.	0
i'm trying to look for an adult day care,  but i'm not sure that there even is one in my area.	0
my family doesn't really want to help.	0
they've let her come over or taken her out for a couple of hours, i think twice, but maybe three times since the spring of 2018.  i know open enrollment is now.	0
are there any options you guys have found that offer any kind of respite care, or other care that would be beneficial?	0
i went to look into long-term care insurance until i realized that an alzheimer's diagnosis makes a person ineligible, which seems dumb,  but i guess it makes sense in that they're a business trying to make money.	0
it just sucks.	0
is there something obvious that i'm missing?	0
how do you guys get a break?	0
i don't know that i can go for years and years without ever having a day off.	0
any help or advice would be appreciated.	0
thank you	0
hello all well-read people.	0
does anyone know how one can get their hands on anti-beta-amyloid drugs that are being used in trials against alzheimer's?	0
according to sources like these, taking anti-beta-amyloid drugs at an early age can prevent alzheimers's.	0
i am 29 years old and very interested in lowering my chances of alzheimer's even by single % points.	0
alzheimer's runs in my family.	0
three generations of us cant figure out how to convince my 86 year old great nana (late stage) to take a bath.	0
she needs one in the worse way.	0
shes lived with us for months and has yet to take one.	0
shes getting smelly but either cant smell anything or doesnt care or doesnt know that its her.	0
she gets so upset whenever we bring it up.	0
its not like we can force her.	0
please... how can any of us convince her?	0
any ideas at all?	0
my partner and i have been discussing marriage for awhile, thinking it may be best to plan it sooner rather than later because his mom is deteriorating fast.	0
fast forward to yesterday when we took mil out for pancakes for  'sunday funday ' and she made a joke about how we're not married yet and that i should just toss him back and find another fish that's less trouble.	0
so we mentioned that we were actually thinking about getting married in a few months.	0
she asked us  'what church? '	0
neither of us are religious, we said no church, we're having an outdoor ceremony.	0
she starts in on how i'm leading bf down a wrong path towards hell because she'd never raise her son like that.	0
we're like  'okayyyyyy ' and change the subject.	0
she then starts wanting to know who will be the moh & bestman, so bf says his best friend of 20+ years, and i say, my brother, which is true, i've already asked him and he said yes ' she then gets upset that i didn't pick her to be my moh.... she's decided she doesn't want to be  'mother of the groom ' because bf sucks.	0
she wants to be moh, so she can plan the party!	0
i think we may have missed our window for a wedding with zero behavior issues, i think we'll just have to elope!	0
my father is 72 years old and just successfully finished chemotherapy for throat cancer and was officially declared cancer free.	0
due to other health difficulties (balance issues, anxiety, etc.	0
), he's been in a rehab facility for the better part of the last year.	0
we've noticed of late that he's also concurrently started to display symptoms of confusion as to where he is, what he's eaten, etc.	0
he had a colonoscopy a few weeks ago and after that it seems things have gone south.	0
he's been in and out of reality - thinking he was in a bakery baking cakes a few weeks ago and then over the last 24 hours he's been confused and thinking he's in chicago on business.	0
it just seems to be a complete break with reality.	0
my question for this community - i've read that at times anesthesia can exacerbate alzheimer's/dementia symptoms, but it being a few weeks post-anesthesia, would that still be the case?	0
have folks had loved ones who just take weeks to bounce back?	0
i've had doctors tell me he has exhibited early signs of dementia, but the rate at which this happened (1-2 months at most) has me confused and questioning if there's something else up.	0
he's had utis before and i know that can cause those kind of reality breaks, but it doesn't seem he has one now based on what his home is saying.	0
i appreciate any insights that folks have.	0
i lost my dad do alzheimers in 2018. he was pretty young as he was in his mid 50s and was diagnosed around 5-6 years ago.	0
i honestly have trouble remembering the times when he wasnt sick and we could go on family vacations and stuff as they feel so distant.	0
on nights like these i really miss him being shuffling around and eating random snacks or just messing around the house.	0
i miss when he would wake me up because he couldnt figure out how to change the chanel and get help.	0
i miss him making me late for work because he wouldnt let me leave because he wanted to be with me.	0
i just miss having him around even if it wasnt him 100%.	0
it just sucks because when youre taking care of them you just want things to be normal but then when they pass you realize that normal now is never seeing them again :(.	0
i love you dad miss you every day	0
&#x200b; processing img 4g9be3b8bbz31...	0
firstly i want to say that its been comforting reading about everyones experiences knowing that we are not alone alongside our loved ones during this all.	0
earlier this year my mil was diagnosed with early onset at the age of 63. she had been showing some symptoms for a while before (mostly memory, repeating conversations etc) but since her diagnosis it seems to be progressing much quicker than we thought.	0
from initial research, it seemed the average life expectancy would be 5-10 years.	0
we are now at the point maybe 8 months later where she isnt able to take care of herself (dressing, remembering to eat, completing daily tasks) and as of this week can no longer contain her bowel movements at times.	0
im interested to hear from those who are ahead of us in this journey - from your experience, how long did you have / or are having with your loved one while they were losing themselves but still with us?	0
(and i do know every person is different... i guess i just feel that it seems this is going rather quickly and couldnt imagine her losing more of herself just as fast as we have this year.)	0
man im crying writing this.	0
my grandfathers gum disease has come back to bite him and is contributing to his alzheimers.	0
im wondering whether giving him lsd or psilocybin would help him retrieve memories.	0
he really wants to remember first person memories with his wife.	0
but he reaches a mental impasse.	0
hes 92.	0
my mother, 82, was recently diagnosed with alzheimer's, though has been showing increasing memory problems for several years and has been on a steeper downhill slide the last four months.	0
she's currently living in the  'independent living ' area in an excellent retirement community where the residents and staff know her and care about her.	0
later this week we are moving her to a new facility where she will be in assisted living, with memory care available when she needs it.	0
i'm her son, 64, and i am her agent under her power of attorney, which was authorized by the written opinion of her doctor.	0
my mom has a very controlling personality.	0
for the most part, she has used her powers for good, planning carefully for her future.	0
she has long term care insurance and enough money in her investments to last her for many, many years.	0
but now, of course, she's resisting my taking control of her finances (she has forgotten many times to pay bills, her rent, etc) and is absolutely against moving.	0
her current facility has been doing what they can within their legal power (we are in washington, where there are strict laws governing what the differences are between independent and assisted living) to keep her safe while we find new housing, but there is really no choice now that we have a new home for her.	0
she has to move.	0
we've talked about it many times over the past few weeks.	0
as expected, every conversation about her moving is the same conversation, because she can't remember what we've talked about in the past.	0
she continually surprised by the fact that she can't stay where she is (they can't provide the level of care she needs).	0
she asks over and over about the new rent, and where the money is coming from, why she has to move when she's happy where she is.	0
her arguments and questions are always the same.	0
it's almost like a script, and have no idea how to get ahead of it, if i even can.	0
i tell her over and over -- sometimes several times in the same conversation -- where the money is coming from, that it's hers, and it's being used exclusively for her (though, to be honest, i've been a co-signer on her bank accounts for over a decade, long before dementia was an issue for her...so i could legally use it for anything i want, but morally...no, it's hers).	0
as much as i am able i keep my patience, answer her questions and explain the circumstances as if it's the first time i'm hearing her questions and giving her the answers.	0
i dread the next week, as we pack and move, and the weeks after as she gets used to her new home (or doesn't, as the case may be).	0
i love my mom, and i hate having to defy her.	0
i'm afraid of her taking a walk in the next few days and getting lost, as she has a couple times lately (not seriously lost...not yet).	0
since she's in independent living at the moment, the staff can't legally stop her from leaving.	0
but i'm afraid she'll get it into her head to walk away as a deliberate act against the control i've had to take over her life.	0
or she could write me a letter revoking the power of attorney, which is one of the provisions of the poa.	0
i doubt she'll remember she can do that (though i've reminded her of it a couple of times), or won't be able to think through the decision and the act to do it.	0
and if somehow she does, with the new lease having been signed and move-out notices given, i have no idea what i would need to do next.	0
i know this is probably an old story.	0
everyone's alzheimer's journey is different, they tell me, but the broad strokes are much the same.	0
and i know in my head what i'm doing is right for her.	0
but she also makes me doubt it.	0
i'm a pretty empathetic person, but i have a hard time empathizing with her, seeing things through her eyes, because her memory problems are foreign to me, especially since she's been so logical and thought so correctly for my whole life.	0
i wish i could feel i'm doing things right.	0
i know i'm doing the best i can.	0
no one among her friends or family is opposing my decisions except my mom, but i'm also the only one making decisions.	0
so i had to vent.	0
i moved away from my family for college and ended staying thousands of miles away to start my career.	0
my family called to inform me that my 83 year old grandmother who i'm very close with had a sudden change in her mental state.	0
she's has been getting slightly forgetful in the last few years, but she's recently called the police 4+ times claiming there was a break in and things were stolen.	0
all the items were found in odd places in her house, so now she's convinced someone broke in and moved them.	0
i dropped everything and flew to her to make sure she was safe and assess the situation.	0
she's normal most of the time, but gets bouts of paranoia and delusions.	0
i took her to her primary to check for a possible uti and to address her oxybutinyn perscriptions (side effects can be hallucinations and delusions).	0
doctor wrote off my concerns about the meds, claiming he also takes them and they are fine.	0
i had to fight to get the urine testing for a possible uti, which was supposedly negative.	0
he excused himself quickly to see other patients.	0
i discreetly spoke to the ma's (i hate to belittle my sweet grandmother) about her delusions, they seemed concerned and wrote down my concerns and said the doctor would call me later.	0
he indeed called and told me that those were reasons to be concerned, but followed up with  'i understand your concern, but not sure how i'm supposed to fit in here? '	0
im not a doctor!	0
i assumed these were things her doctor should be aware of and perhaps would like to monitor or even refer me to a neurologist.	0
he offered no advice other than  'put her in a home '.	0
please tell me there are more constructive, helpful doctor's out there!	0
i have no idea if she has dementia, alzheimer's, or some other issue causing this.	0
i have put my day to day life on hold to help my grandma (which i am very happy to do if she needs me) but i can't come to a solution if i don't even know what exactly or roughly what i'm dealing with.	0
this is the hardest thing i have ever dealt with.	0
i cry every time i talk about her symptoms to anyone, it breaks my heart to know my grandma is scared and confused.	0
any advice is greatly appreciated.	0
i took over for my grandma about a year or two ago.	0
i'm wondering about medicare.	0
she only has four or five prescriptions and the occasional checkup or diagnostic test.	0
what would be the best plan for her?	0
my father has become more aggressive as his dementia increases.	0
he has threatened a number of fellow patients and recently punched one.	0
the nursing home wants us to pay for 24 hour aides or to to move him.	0
24 hour aids is more than triple the cost and not realistic.	0
what can we do?	0
the monster - easymess i thought i'd pass along this new song that an artist i know, easymess, he wrote and performed based on his own family's experience with alzheimer's, i've seen this performed and numerous people in the audiences cannot help but be touched  (read, crying) by the powerful imagery,  feelings and sincerity in it when performed live.	0
just thought reddit should be aware that this amazing song and singer exists in london.	0
he will be performing it live tonight at the jago in hackney.	0
follow easymess on the usual social media thingies.	0
mom fell out of bed sunday and was admitted to the hospital.	0
hospitalist says he thinks palliative care would be a good option at this point and he doesn't think she will last another year.	0
i have my meeting with hospice in 45 minutes.	0
i'm nervous they will say she has not declined enough for them to step in.	0
there is no quality of life left, there is no dignity in dying, she is deteriorating quickly but is still ambulatory, able to use the bathroom on her own and eats well.	0
hoping for deterioration and palliative care so she is at peace is a weird thing to wish for.	0
i don't feel comfortable with the feelings i have because to me it goes against everything society tells you you should feel when a loved one is dying, alzheimer's is a different monster though, my mom expressed her wished to commit suicide if she ever got an alz diagnosis, but was too far into the disease when she did get the diagnosis.	0
i think about her wishes not to live like that every time i see her.	0
the pain of knowing that and seeing her live like this is awful, i feel guilty about it for some reason.	0
not really any point to this post other than to get it out of my head i guess.	0
i hope the meeting with hospice goes as well as it can go.	0
my grandmother is on memantine.	0
she needs help operating some appliances, forgets people she hasn't seen in many years, forgets how to write her name (things like that).	0
any opinions on if memantine is the right choice?	0
is there something else that might help?	0
hello!	0
i was asked about whether we'd had any news about mil's hair, so figured i'd write a post.	0
here is the story : https://www.reddit.com/r/alzheimers/comments/dsyokq/tips_for_taking_care_of_matted_hair_im_at_my_wits/ &#x200b; i think that will be our next move if this knot still won't move.	0
i'm not really looking forward to it because i know it's going to make her very angry at the moment, but it may help with the knots moving forward.	0
i think the sooner the better because if we keep having to comb her hair, she's going to get violent.	0
i try to pick my battles, but i am worried about her skin integrity there and also about well-meaning strangers calling dhs because she looks severely neglected.	0
it's been tough because she's in a stage i've been calling the  'negative nellies '.	0
nothing is going right and there is an opposite response to everything we say.	0
i never start the conversation about the hair, i've been waiting for her to come to us, which she'll do multiple times to complain about her hair.	0
so i offer to comb it and style it, and then she'll get super angry that we're even touching it.	0
she's still very capable of independent adls, except for combing her own hair and that's less about her dexterity and more about not being in the mood for it.	0
i was talking about it with a friend who mentioned that one of those trendy  'undercuts ' may work because we could cut the knot out close to her skull, and then the rest of her hair would cover the patch and she may not notice.	0
i think that will be our next move if this knot still won't move.	0
i'm not really looking forward to it because i know it's going to make her very angry in the moment, but it may help with the knots moving forward.	0

alzheimer's doesn't run in my family, it gallops.	0
i only missed passing by 3 questions, but, yeah, didn't pass.	0
my kids and hubby were not surprised.	0
i was.	0
i know what the test looks like.	0
i watched my mom take it a few times.	0
i tried really hard but things that made sense in my head didn't translate to paper.	0
anyway, let the journey begin, or should i say, continue.	0
my (33f) dad (59m) is in the early stages of alzheimers.	0
my mom is not working so she is with him almost all the time.	0
i regularly visit my parents on the weekend, sometimes for friday night and sometimes both nights.	0
if my mom isnt there (she sometimes has commitments out of town) i usually dont go.	0
its gotten to the point where he is not a danger to himself or others, but he will forget to feed the dogs, forget to give one dog her medicine.	0
my mom asked if i would stay friday night with him to help remind him of things and give him some company.	0
i went over there with my dogs friday night, we went to dinner and had a nice time, i stayed overnight and left around 3p today.	0
i told him i would call him tonight and tomorrow morning to remind him to feed the dogs and to give them their medicine.	0
when i left he hugged me really tight and said he was lonely.	0
i feel like an awful daughter but i need some time to myself over the weekend.	0
i guess i just need some confirmation that im not a terrible daughter for leaving today.	0
my mom will be back tomorrow.	0
hi all,  i'm 42 years old with a wife and two kids, smart and college educated, but terrified of getting alzheimer's.	0
my parents are 70 and don't have any signs, and i don't actually know anyone close to me who has had it, but it's literally the worst thing that could happen to me.	0
last year after i turned 41, i was talking with my wife and she was incensed that i didn't remember even talking about some topic she said we had talked about a few months prior.	0
and then i started thinking about how i sometimes miss our exit when we're driving together because i'm not paying attention.	0
and how i'm always misplacing things.	0
and i had just gotten a fitbit and it showed that i only get like 38 minutes of deep sleep a night.	0
and back when our first child was born 10 years earlier, we did the attachment parenting thing and during the week my wife asked me to get up when our daughter cried, which then progressed to me basically rocking her all night long and me getting practically zero sleep for about 7 months, and i'm worried i did permanent damage to my brain... anyway i made an appointment with a doctor for early onset dementia even though i know i sounded crazy.	0
she gave me a ridiculously simple test which was obviously not designed for early cases, and had an mri run--of course they found my brain was perfectly healthy.	0
i do everything else i can think of to keep my brain healthy--exercise, my diet is great, fish oil, coq10 etc.	0
except nothing i've tried has improved my deep sleep... so i've had adhd all my life, i was diagnosed as an adult, i probably have some anxiety, and i know that i've always misplaced things or my mind has wandered during conversations... so the rational part of me knows this, but then i'm just always looking for signs that i'm getting worse.	0
it's like i'm a hypochondriac for alzheimer's.	0
the other day i was at the gym and a song came on, and i was upset that i couldn't remember who it was by.	0
it was on the tip of my tongue.	0
i've heard it many times, and the group is one of my wife's favorites.	0
i was thinking about it the rest of my workout and on the drive home, and then later that night i finally remembered it--florence and the machine.	0
but this tip of my tongue episode really bothered me... maybe this is a midlife crisis, but do people grow out of them and get used to the fact that you're getting older?	0
i've also decided that i'm not going to go out with a disease like this.	0
that means that if i'm ever diagnosed with dementia that i'll probably have a small window of opportunity to take action before i'll be too confused to do anything about it.	0
and i hate contemplating things like this--like should i go buy a gun now and take lessons just so i have it when the time comes...   but i'm just wondering are there others here who are freaked out about getting this too?	0
maybe people who know it runs in your family?	0
how do you deal with that?	0
the thing is, i may be a hypochondriac now, but the risk keeps going up the older i get.	0
if i make it to 85, there's a 50% chance that i'd be right....	0
just spoke to my dad (66) on the phone.	0
he had forgotten that we actually talked recently, just about 2 weeks ago if that, which wasnt encouraging.	0
he said he has a cat scan on monday and will know more at that point, but its possible hes in the early stages of alzheimers.	0
this isnt all that surprising to me, we dont talk very frequently but ive definitely had to explain a few things to him multiple times - things that are pretty major, like the fact that im still in college.	0
im 26 and i live on the other side of the country.	0
he has a long-term girlfriend and they live together but arent married.	0
i worry about the implications of a long and difficult illness on the horizon.	0
i dont have the resources to care for a parent - i have a ton of debt and, unfortunately, decided to pursue a degree that doesnt leave you with a lot of stable employment options upon graduation.	0
im planning on going to graduate school in a couple of years, after which id be able to teach, but thats so far out that who knows what his situation will look like by then.	0
i guess im just feeling guilty and uncertain.	0
i have so much of my own life to figure out still.	0
my dad and i have had a rocky relationship at times over the years - he and my mom divorced when i was 9. frankly, sometimes he can be an insufferable jerk, but at the same time i still value his support and input when i get it because, well, hes my dad.	0
i feel like i owe him something, in a way, even if its just trying to maintain a healthier relationship while we still can because thats really all i have to give.	0
please excuse me, there wasnt really a major point to all this.	0
im just wondering if anybody has some advice to share.	0
my parents were 36 and 40 when they had me, and i dont really feel prepared to approach this situation at this point in my life.	0
late last year my boyfriend's mother was diagnosed with dementia.	0
early onset alzheimer's runs in her family.	0
she is still relatively with it, as she recognizes most people and can talk about her day.	0
last week she had a stroke.	0
her memory took a hit.	0
she's having trouble recalling certain words and her delusions are worse.	0
she still recognizes us, but it frustrates her when she doesn't remember details or who else visited her that day.	0
she's still convinced she'll get better one day.	0
she's retired, but her husband is not, so she spends most days alone with a few people coming to check on her or give her medications.	0
boyfriend and i visit every other day to make sure she takes her pills and eats.	0
she ideally needs 24/7 care, but it's not financially possible right now.	0
she told us that during the day, she has nothing to think about.	0
she spends most of her time watching tv, and she's starting to have trouble remembering how to make it play what she wants.	0
she used to be interested in arts and crafts, but it was always socially.	0
i don't know if her fine motor skills are intact.	0
i'm worried if she doesn't have anything to do she won't improve at all or she'll decline faster.	0
i plan to cook with her next time we see her.	0
she lit up when i suggested it and went to find some recipes.	0
otherwise i'm not sure what we could do.	0
i really want something that encourages her mind to work.	0
tdlr: if anyone has advice on activities we can give a woman with early onset alzheimer's, to do alone or with us, it would be greatly appreciated.	0
or any advice at all on how to support my boyfriend and his family through this difficult time, resources, ect.	0
thanks in advance.	0
hello all,  my father was asked by his neurologist to not drive any more this past august.	0
he disagrees with this and feels his driving is fine.	0
im on the fence.	0
he scares me a bit, but ive definitely been with worse drivers.	0
the language in my dads after visit report says, please do not drive.	0
if youd like a formal drivers test, the dmv is free.	0
i have two questions: - i have heard that because he has this diagnosis and recommendation in his medical record, if he got in an accident, they could be sued and lose everything.	0
is this true?	0
it would be a good argument for him to stop driving.	0
how do i get a dmv test scheduled?	0
ive called, searched their website, stopped in.	0
no one has any idea what im talking about.	0
i want to schedule him for a drivers test to make sure hes safe.	0
they tell me he isnt due for a test for a few years.	0
(we live in wisconsin)  note: hes willing to take a dmv test.	0
he wants to prove that hes safe.	0
my mil went to visit a relative for a few weeks so that partner and i could get respite.	0
unfortunately, her hair never got combed or brushed and is now matted.	0
it's waist length and there are knots all the way up and at the base of her skull.	0
i'm worried that this may be bad for her health, i don't want her getting a fungus under there.	0
we tried soaking it with coconut oil last night and combing it, but we couldn't get all of the knots out and she refuses to help.	0
she got quite agitated, threatened to hit us, and was yelling about it.	0
i can't think of anything else but to cut the knots out, but i think this may mean using clippers on the back of her head.	0
her hair has been her pride and joy for her entire life and i don't want to take this from her, but i don't know what else to do, i think it will only get worse from here.	0
any tips, either on getting tangles out or how to go about cutting it?	0
she's adamant that she won't have her hair cut.	0
well as the text says we were having a normal conversation with him while my brother and i were bringing some groceries in and my grandpa started getting confrontational (he lives next door).	0
out of nowhere he just reaches over and grabs my brother by the throat, luckily my brother had groceries in his hands so he didnt push him back or anything but managed to get out from under his grip and we ran inside.	0
were working on my dad getting poa (hes an only child and my grandpas only family in the picture).	0
its really starting to feel like its time to put him in some sort of memory care facility or something.	0
ugh.	0
not a good day, hope everyone else is having a better day!	0
my mum, on 8th year of alz, is usually on the bed or wheelchair.she rarely walks and if she does, it requires multiple ppl.	0
are there any exercises to strengthen her legs or i should just aim to have her walk a little more each day?	0
one of the hardest aspects of caregiving that i've experienced, has been feeling pretty invisible.	0
my father began to show mild signs of slipping cognitively several years ago which gave me a sense of panic about what was to come.	0
friends, co-workers, and distant relatives didn't understand it and would dispense platitudes such as  'you're lucky you still have him, ' or  'appreciate him for who he is. '	0
i do not have children and while i'm at an age where i should be concerned with being a father and experiencing the known stress of parents my age, i was consumed with getting all of my father's affairs in order, and eventually pursuing a higher level of care for him.	0
we have established rituals for losing a loved one, but i have found that there's no playbook for how to cope with the sense of loss around experiencing a loved one's cognitive decline.	0
as a counseling professional and researcher, i am committed to advocating for caregivers and facilitating dialogue in families around coping with the sense of loss around the cognitive decline of a loved one.	0
perhaps the most meaningful experience i had as a clinician and in my own journey as a caregiver had been a support group i ran for adult caregivers of parents with alzheimer's.	0
i was privileged to hear about how this condition has a profound effect on family dynamics; namely how it creates rifts in a family, but also brings siblings closer.	0
but was was most poignant and empowering for me to hear was the profound sense of purpose in life that some caregivers began to experience when taking on this role.	0
these experiences led me to pursue a phd in marriage and family therapy at the university of louisiana monroe, where i am writing my dissertation on sibling relationships in the context of dementia care.	0
i recently got approval to begin my study, and am looking for participants to interview around their relationships with siblings and experiences as caregivers.	0
if you are interested in participating, i'd love to hear about your experiences.	0
my expectation is that my study will create an effective framework for clinicians do discuss the emotional aspects of caregiving in a family therapy setting.	0
please feel free to comment here if you're interested in participating, and i'll provide more information.	0
i understand and respect the sensitive nature of what is discussed in this forum, and got permission from one of the admins before posting this.	0

my dad used to be a phd professor, where research and teaching was his life.	0
now my dads losing it a little bit and hes not himself.	0
he seems like hes losing the ability to do simple tasks like pour soup for himself, or vote independently.	0
he still drives every day to see his friends once a day, but thats it.	0
the other day we were driving together and he backed his car into the guardrail.... he shrugged it off like it was nothing.	0
this is not the dad i knew growing up!!	0
if i did that when i was 16 he would be soooo mad and freak out.	0
today i started being a little short with him and i feel incredibly guilty.	0
we were at the supermarket and i started talking to him like he were a young child.	0
he picked up on it and got pissed.	0
he just wanted to buy so many cakes... we didnt need all that.	0
sorry to rant, just a tough day and its honestly bittersweet.	0
im happy my father is still here and hes still functioning, but seeing his slow cognitive decline is like a sad thing to take in... just scared i guess.	0
i also feel sad when i empathize for him... i think he must know to an extent whats happening to him or like hes not as sharp as he used to be.	0
i think even worse... he feels lonely.	0
also, im sorry if anyone else feels this way.	0
hope they find a cure for this thing soon.	0
as an only child of my widowed mother who has mild to moderate alzheimers i am the sole family member  available to be at her beck and call .	0
my relationship with my mum is not a mother son one but me as an adult helping care for a manipulative self centred woman who if i dont jump to her demands she huffs and i feel awful then.	0
i've 5 young kids and a full time job and then she brings looking something or tells me to call.	0
i just want to walk away and forget my responsibility for her but then the guilt would set in .	0
does anyone else fell like this or am i being too self centred ?	0
basically, my 84 year old grandmother is wearing my mother down.	0
we live in the same house, which is split.	0
my grandma has a basic apartment to herself as she is still able to manage herself to a degree.	0
her memory for things has greatly declined, and yesterday she pretty much forgot who her eldest daughter was when my mother (second of 4 siblings) reminded my grandma.	0
regarding my post.	0
she insists that she continues to have a phone.	0
demands a cell phone or a landline.	0
we have gone through quite a few of each.	0
a flip phone with basic tech to big buttoned land lines.	0
she cannot grasp how technology works anymore.	0
she comes out and gets angry, throws fits saying how she wants a land line  'you have a land line grandma ', how she doesn't understand after we explain it both verbally and in written form.	0
we write extremely legible and simple instructions, that she never follows.	0
after these confrontations my mom is in tears of frustration and sadness.	0
there's more to my grandma's fading world, but right now my focus is on tech.	0
could anyone who has experienced similar suggest anything with a voice command option?	0
has alexa or an echo worked, something that requires no pushing of buttons as she has a light touch and claims to press buttons but ends up turning the phone off in the end.	0
any help would be greatly appreciated.	0

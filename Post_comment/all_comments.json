My mother has a tendency to ditch anything she doesn't like the look of, and if your grandma is getting out, you need to figure out what she always takes, and how toy attach a tracker to that.",

        "text": "Howdy, and welcome (although sorry you're here!).\nI can't speak towards being in a similar situation with my parents; however, I'm going through the nursing home thing with my wife. She's 39 and has pretty aggressive MS. She's been pretty much bedridden for about five years now. \nObviously, this is not where we planned on being. We've been struggling and making adjustments to our lives to accommodate her progression, but it's gotten too difficult: although I only work about 1.5 miles away from home, she still can't be left alone for any amount of time. So we have aides with her during the day - but they're through an agency, making barely above minimum wage, and not exactly medical professionals. Their level of care varies from really good to pretty terrible - they've repeatedly screwed up the (numerous) medicines my wife has to take, she's had some falls in the hoyer lift (which I can't criticize them too much for, as I've also dropped her from it).\nBut with the advancement of the disease, I just don't feel it's safe for her at home any longer. Last month I made the decision to bring up the nursing home topic. Obviously, she is/was completely devastated. She's not even 40, but facing life in the nursing home. I did my research and found an amazing home - it's about 30 minutes away (the only real downside other than being a nursing home), but it's a beautiful place with top-notch care. We talked about it (a lot), and then went for a tour. The place is great, and our hope is that after a couple years there: A) they will engage her in physical/occupational therapy that will improve her condition, and B) in that time I will be able to make home improvements so we can sell this shithole of a house we bought - a fixer-upper we bought right before the market crashed, thinking we'd have time to get it in great shape together, only to lose our shirts and sanity to this goddamned money pit... Erm... where was I? Oh - fix up this house and maybe buy a condo that could be set up for caregiving.\nI hate this disease, I hate this house, and I pretty much hate life right now.\nBut to your original point (sorry, lost myself in a self-pitying tirade there!): I absolutely understand about it feeling like \"the end,\" and the resentment you're going to experience. \nRealistically, a nursing home is going to provide the level of care and attention you cannot (well, if you find a good one, obviously). While a child absolutely has a duty to a parent, the greater responsibility is the parents' towards the child: it's hard-coded into nature that a parent sacrifices for their child. Some(often)times that is absolutely horrible, but it's what it is. If your mother were able to look at the situation objectively, she would agree. Put yourself in her position: if your daughter were taking care of you, wouldn't you want to make it easier on her and do what you can to allow her to take care of HER child? Your mother is doubtless frustrated, scared and depressed (and rightfully so, of course). This is going to cloud her judgement and make the situation more difficult, but you have to put aside your guilt and base your decision on what is going to be best for YOUR child (and, really, your mother): you cannot continue in this situation. Not only will your mother's care suffer, but you will both begin to resent the other, your daughter will resent YOU/your lack of attention, and I'm sure this is hard on your husband as well.\nI'm so, so sorry that you are in this situation. But I think you know this is for the best - there's just a ton of guilt and feeling like your failing your mother that you have to deal with. Not only would I suggest going forward with nursing care for your mother, but look into counseling for yourself - this is going to be hard to deal with, and having someone \"outside\" the situation to talk with would also be a big help.\nSoooooo... I hope this helps? Stay strong, and we're here for you any time (even if we're not always the quickest to respond!)!",

        "text": "I came here because I was feeling sorry for myself, having given up my career to care for my 88-year-old mother (who has Parkinson's disease and a genetic vision impairment) for 6 years largely alone, without respite or a support group.  \nAnd then I read your story and kwip's and . . . wow . . . you two ARE AMAZING!!!\nSo many of the things you said resonated with me, SiaMaya, especially the husband lost to the shadows and the feeling of just wanting it to end and then feeling guilty.  I think these are feelings that anyone would inevitably have under the circumstances you've described, so please just accept them as natural and don't be hard on yourself for them!  \nBecause my mother is older than yours, my sister (who lives out-of-state and deigns to speak to our mother on the phone for 5 minutes once a week) has for the past four years aggressively tried to place her in a nursing home.  About four years ago, mother agreed to stay in a nursing home temporarily while she was getting some physical therapy and she called me every day of that 6-week period, begging me to get her out of there.  \nNow, as my mother's condition continues to decline and her needs increase, the question has come up with more frequency, both in my mind and expressed by my husband, and the memory of those calls is one of the barriers.  We have a fine nursing home in our town, but I know that I could never have my mother begging me to get her out of there and ignore her pleas; it would be torturous for me.  As a result, I applaud the fact that you're talking openly with your mother about it and referring to \"we\" when it comes to the journey ahead of you.  I really think that, if it's at all possible, getting her on board and facing the decision as a family is key.  And since you have small children, I think discussing this with your mother in the broader context of \"family\" may be helpful to you; they are also her grandchildren and it seems likely that she would want the best for them and be willing to make reasonable sacrifces to ensure their wellbeing.  \nI sometimes worry that the natural feelings of frustration, etc., that you outlined may color the decision of when to transition my mother.  I value myself as a person, love my husband and other family members as well as my mother, and realize that there are no guarantees with respect to my own lifespan or theirs.  In order to find the appropriate balance between mother's needs and the needs of the others that I love, I try to objectively ask myself whether, as her situation currently stands and given the limitations of what I can provide to her in the way of care, my mother is \"better off\" in her current situation or in a nursing home.  Our family's value system is such that we don't necessarily value quantity of life over its quality so her happiness -- as well as mine and my husband's -- are factors that weigh heavily into the determination of where she would be \"better off.\"  By measuring it this way I think that when the answer is that she would be \"better off\" in a nursing home, we will be confident that we are making the right choice.\nAs you proceed on your journey to find an acceptable \"home\" for your mother, you may want to check out the automated Philips Medication Dispenser at http://www.managemypills.com to help keep track of the tons of medication you mentioned.  This has been a real Godsend for us -- and I have no relationship whatsoever to the company! -- and found it super easy to install so, even if you only use it for a couple of months, it may help you find a little extra time in your already incredibly busy day.  You can load 10 days' worth of medication into it and it will automatically dispense medication up to 6 times through the day on a schedule that you set up.  My mother, for example, takes 1 pill at 7:00 am, 2 pills at 8:00 am, yet another pill at 9:00 am, pills at 1:00 pm, at 5:00 pm and at 9:00 pm because that's the time schedule that works for her medication.  The machine could at least in theory be set up at your mother's bedside and all she would have to do is push a rather large button -- the machine calls out nicely whenever \"It's time to take your medicine\" -- for the cup with the appropriate medication to come out at the appropriate time.  The cost is about $90 a month and it's well worth it to us because it means that I only have to think about medication once every 10 days when I load the machine!\nI'm so sorry you're faced with this challenging situation, but I know you're moving forward thoughtfully and carefully and that your decisions will therefore be wise.

I am so grateful to have other people to talk to about this and hope that we can be a sounding board for you as well anytime you need it. It is so hard to walk this path alone.\nIt must be so difficult for you to face this decision knowing your mom is not on board with it at all. I can not even imagine how much that must add to the guilt and burden you must be feeling. This is not an easy decision to make. It is easy to feel that we are letting them down somehow, after they spent so much time and energy bringing us into this world and caring for us for so long.\nFor my family, there is no other option than to talk about it openly. My mom raised me alone and it was just us for my entire childhood. I feel a strong sense of loyalty to her and I truly want what is best for her. However, I am beginning to realize that my biggest priority in life right now has to be my own child. I owe her exactly what my mother gave me, and we have talked about this and mom understands and agrees with that. I'm afraid I'm not able to be the best mother to my daughter right now with all of the stresses and demands that come with caregiving. It's been one of the big reasons we've begun this discussion. It's difficult to be thinking about this so early - she is \"only\" 69. Cancer sucks. The treatment worked in putting the cancer in remission, but it totally destroyed her body and immune system in the process. It's sad. I wish we had more years of her being healthy. She seems like a pale shadow of the person she used to be. I am already grieving her in many ways.\nI am also exhausted, burnt out, stressed out, overwhelmed, frustrated, depressed, anxious. I definitely need some therapy and help on my own, but I also think that working full time and trying to be a full time caregiver as well as a mom to a toddler is just stretching me way too thin. I just simply and honestly explained everything to my mom and that I feel I am at the limit of what I can handle at this point. I think being open and honest about all that really helped her be able to move forward with thinking about changing our situation. You are right - discussing it in the context of how it is affecting the entire family has really helped her gain some perspective on the situation outside of her own experience.\nWe actually visited her doctor today, and he told her in no uncertain terms that she needs to be move. We have some concerns about the air quality in our house (it's older) and she is having a lot of trouble breathing. There's also a concern that she is sick so often because she lives with a germ factory (toddler in daycare). So that has really helped us get the ball rolling as well....if we have to move, then it makes sense to go ahead and make the move to assisted living so that everyone can get what they need.\nI think you are coming at your own decision in a logical, rational, and compassionate manner. It's not an easy thing to do. I hope that, when the time comes, you are able to find a place for your mom that she also finds acceptable and can be happy living out her remaining years.\nThanks so much for the recommendation on that dispenser - it sounds wonderful! We definitely struggle with helping her to remember everything so an alarm and automated dispenser would be a lifesaver. That's a steep price tag for my budget, but I will definitely look into it.\nAnyway, I just really appreciate your response, and for you listening to my rambling :) It's amazing how much it helps to just be able to talk things out with other people that have some idea of what you are going through. My husband is sweet and kind and supportive, but he doesn't totally \"get\" what I am going through on both a physical and emotional level. It's good to know we aren't alone. I'm extremely thankful for reddit, as funny as it sounds. You guys have been so kind.",

The sheriff or a deputy will fit her with a bracelet or anklet that is difficult to remove. It has a GPS in it, and if she wanders the police will be able to locate her. \nI use Pocket Finder. It's a bit chunky, about the size of the palm of your hand. Does your loved one habitually carry a certain item, like keys, or a purse? My loved one wanders too, but always brings her purse. If so, you might be able to find a way to hide or secure it to that item. Like this incident you described, it's not a foolproof strategy because they might not bring it- but it's an idea. I charge it twice weekly, and re-sew it into the lining of her purse each time. There are different power settings- to save battery, you can put it in airplane mode and just activate to tracking mode when you need to locate her. It is VERY accurate., quick and user friendly. I have used it three times to find my loved one. I think it was like $130 to buy the device, and $13/mo for a service plan. Worth it. We will keep it until my loved one is immobile/bed bound.\nAt this stage in the disease, please be aware that all sharp items should be locked up safely. Scissors, knives, garage and garden tools- someone with dementia who isn't thinking clearly could injure themselves or someone else. If she has the Project Lifesaver anklet, you'll need to make sure she can't remove it.",

My loved one has gotten agitated and physical with me twice. I made myself a \"three strikes\" deal- if she lays a hand on me ever again, I'm done and out. I think sometimes it's hard to admit when we, as caregivers, are in over our head. I actually stepped way back and now only see my LO 1-2x/week, and it's been a huge relief to my mental and physical health. Maybe your FIL needs to make a similar deal, draw some sort of line- he does not have to live with physical abuse, whether the abuser is of sound mind or not. She can't necessarily help or control how she's behaving, but he doesn't have to suffer as well. There have been many, many instances in which the person with dementia and/or the caregiver have both suffered serious physical harm, as a result of agitation/violence, stress, and an unsafe environment. I think sometimes the best, kindest thing to do is admit when it's too much. For what it's worth, the top reasons for someone to be placed in memory care are: agitation & violence, wandering and incontinence. \nIf her behavior has changed or gotten much worse quickly, it is absolutely worth getting her checked for a UTI. UTIs are common with dementia because they tend to not wipe properly, and the infection can wreak all sorts of havoc. It's a very well known connection to behavioral disturbances and violence in dementia. It can really add a lot of confusion and paranoia, and sudden behavioral changes. It might also just be how the disease will progress for her. \nI know you said they don't have health insurance right now, but it's past the time for medication. He can call 911 or bring her to the emergency room if it gets bad, and they will have to treat her. If he refuses to bring her home, then they have no option other than to keep her, or they can send her to a geriatric psychiatric unit which will stabilize her with medication. If they are having financial difficulty, she might be eligible for Medicaid, which is actually a good thing with dementia. Medicaid covers the cost of long term care in a nursing home/memory care facility. \nThere's no easy answers.

        "text": "Honestly, this all sounds like typical dementia behavior. \n\n\nLock your bedroom doors, closets where you put important things, etc. Usd paper plates and plastic forks. Who cares if she takes them? Sometime when she's out of the house, go in with a garbage bag for the paper/plastic, and find any real dishware she might have taken. \n\n\nThis is typical dementia. Of course she's repeating questions. Her brain can't hold new information. If you're about to lose your cool, get up and walk away, or excuse yourself \"to the bathroom\" for a few minutes. \n\n\nGet double bolted locks, so she can't get out without a key. There are also cheap alarms you can stick onto the door, so it will chime when it opens. \n\n\nBefore she leaves the bathroom, go in with her. Hand her the soap, turn on the water, and demonstrate what to do. It's the same thing with showering- not only do they forget they haven't showered, but they might also forget HOW to do it, and their brain often plays tricks on them- the water coming from shower head can look scary, it might feel cold even though it's warm, they might be afraid of slipping or think the bath water is deep even though it's quite shallow. If nothing else, use nice scented anti bacterial lotion, and try saying \"hold out your hands\" and when she does, put some on and demonstrate rubbing it in. Get Lysol spray and Lysol wipes, and just do a quick wipe down of door handles, sink handles, etc.\n\n\nI don't think you should be her caregiver either. I'm not trying to be harsh, but you don't sound compassionate or understanding. Maybe it's compassion fatigue & you're just burned out, but maybe this just isn't something you should do. Not everyone should be a caregiver. It sure doesn't come naturally to me. I get it- I'm 23 and caring for my grandmother, she's exactly like what you've described and worse. This disease is a bitch, and caring for someone with it is extremely hard. I wouldn't judge or blame you for not wanting to do it. You're still young, and probably missing out on a lot of opportunities. I'm still in my early 20s, but for several years I was living like an 80 year old, and I regret a lot of missed opportunities and the ability to be young & spontaneous. I was with my grandma 24/7, but was struggling physically (migraines getting worse, gaining weight, very depressed) and couldn't afford to not work. Now I'm with her only on weekends (her aide is Monday-Friday) and it's been great for me. There's a light at the end of the tunnel, I promise you. <3 \nIt's important to understand that she isn't doing these things on purpose- yeah, maybe some of it is due to her personality and habits before the dementia. But she has a brain disease. Her brain is literally dying. Think about how scary that must be for her. Even in my grandmother's more advanced stage, she KNOWS something is wrong, although she won't admit it outright. She is incapable of thinking logically or rationally like you and I do. The brain chemistry changes- they lose taste perception, temperature perception... Sometimes the only thing that truly tastes \"good\" to them would be disgusting for us. \nI understand your frustration with the daily chaos, I really do. It's exhausting. In the past hour, I've \"made dinner\" twice because she refused to eat the first time, I've persuaded her that she doesn't need to get dressed to go to the doctor (it's 8 pm), helped her pick out 5 outfits for wherever she's convinced she needs to go, snuck the dog out to pee (she refuses to let the dog out), dodged tons of questions about dead family members (ps- don't say they're dead. Tell a white lie. Mine is \"your parents are safe in Florida, with your sister\"), brought her in from outside twice, mashed meds in some ice cream because she refuses to take them... It never ends. Unless you feel a calling to care for someone, it's a daily grind and a chore. It became easier for me when I started looking at it as a job, not as caring for my family member. I see her more as my patient than family, and that helps me cope. \nCheck out aplaceformom, your local Alzheimer's association, and other caregiver support resources. I'm not sure if it's national, but there's an awesome one near me called care2caregivers that has been a wealth of information for me. Call your local agency of aging, or even adult protective services for your county- they should be able to point you in the direction of finding a home, getting on a wait list, and figuring out how to pay. If Mom doesn't agree to make a change, then move out and let her figure it out for yourself. It won't take long for her to see reality. Stay with a friend or family member ( going from place to place for a few nights each, if possible). Talk to someone at your school to see if they have any temporary/emergency housing. \n((Big Hugs)) \nps. If you ever feel like you're about to lose it, and are a danger to yourself or others- WALK AWAY. Go sit outside, go for a walk around the block, lock yourself in the bathroom, whatever you have to do to stay safe. And while you're figuring out the more long term arrangements, get on Craigslist, care.com, see if any aides at the day center want extra hours, ask through word of mouth... Find someone to supervise her, even if all they do is make sure she doesn't walk away! Your health (mental and physical) is important too!!",

I'm guessing that you want to tell your grandma to 'think', and have that happen, which it's not. Do as another has suggested, and seek help/assistance from the state, as well as looking to 'A Place for Mom'. Your grandma's wandering is an accident waiting to happen, and there are probably other at-risk things going on, maybe involving electricity and things that catch fire, for which you can't reasonably be expected to catch all of them unless the only thing you're doing is focusing your attention on her when it's \"your shift\", which, again, isn't fair to you. An assisted care living facility sounds like the most viable option.",

If being her caregiver for 3-4 hours a day is having this kind of effect on you, you need to make it stop. You don't have to deal with this, it's your choice whether to stay or go. Stay with a friend or relative while you figure things out. Anything will be better than this.\nNot everyone is made out to be a caregiver. Later stage dementia patients are very difficult to handle, they can do harm to themselves or even others if not handled the right way. You're not handling this the right way, you're either too stressed/burned out or not properly trained to handle it. Without the proper tools you're likely even escalating situations instead of winding them down.\nMy advice, move out and get help.",

        "text": "First of all, I am so sorry for the situation you have been given.  My dad has dementia and we recently found a place for him nearby but it is pretty expensive.  Is there any savings or anything that she personally has or is there any money available for a care facility?  If so, I've used www.caring.com andA Place for Mom to find facilities. You will need to look at \"memory care\" or alzheimer's facilities and ask for those that have locked doors or alarms that go off when doors are opened.  They should be able to help you find something even if there isn't much money available.  I think there may be state funded nursing homes (?) but I am not sure.  Overall, i think I liked caring.com better in terms of customer service.  They seemed more genuine and they didn't constantly call me and bug me.  There will be some of that of course...\nHave you asked the day care facility if they know any place?  Being local, they might have a better idea of good places.\nMy dad is at a place that is a national chain, called Brookdale.  It is pretty good and cheaper than a few others that are supposed to be good but its still a lot of money.  I don't know how memory care works everywhere but make sure the price is all inclusive.  If its a place that charges by how much they have to do to help your grandmother then beware and be careful.  (For ADLs or Activities of Daily Living). It should be a place that can do everything she might need and not charge more or less.  I don't know how nursing homes differ from memory care.  I know that insurance generally won't cover much.\nI was hoping to have my dad live with my family but just staying here for a week before he moved to the facility showed me that it was impossible.  I can't believe you have been saddled with her care while going to school.  \nIf it is too expensive to put her in a care facility, maybe you can look into hiring a caregiver for when she isn't at the day care facility?  I don't know what the major companies charge (like Home Instead) but you can ask at the day care to see if they know any reliable and honest smaller businesses that do care giver services.  When my mom had hip surgery and needed temporary help, she hired someone that was recommended by the other retirees in her community.  It was just a lady who is an RN and had some people who worked for her.  I couldn't tell how above board it was but they were honest workers.  Caring.com can probably help you with that too.\nI wish you luck!  Please try to talk to someone in the meantime - councilor at school?  Breath.  And find something that takes the edge off like listen to music with a headphone in one ear while dealing with her. \nOh!  Also, some senior centers give away food to seniors.  You might be able to collect some for her.  Some churches have senior programs too.  Our local Methodist church has meals during the week and I think they may also hand out food but not sure.  They also have an alzheimers support group but that involves you having time to go - so not sure that will help, but perhaps you could go once to ask if anyone knows of a facility??",

Poor hygiene, name calling, and asking the same question over and over are all part of the process. You have to help her use the bathroom, brush her teeth, and bathe her because it sounds like she is beyond understanding how to do those things.\nBeing a caregiver for someone with dementia is very stressful. It sounds like you may be dealing with more than you can handle. I think the other commenters here gave excellent advice.

( side note most parents if they hear their child say I might kill myself, will instantly jump in to help, don't know your parents though)\nAnyway I'm no expert I have similar experiences though my grandmother went through this same thing and she was a very religious southern Pentecostal. I have been almost shoved out of a vehicle on the freeway, and had a knife to my throat all while I was a child due to this disease. It fucking sucks. I don't even remember my grandmother as the loving person she was anymore because of the last years. It was terrible, I feel for you more though because I was young I didn't deal with the hygiene or care my mom did. \nTwo things I wanted to say, First I worked for the last year in a dementia facility and have grown a way better of an understanding of the disease. It's frustrating, but shit imagine what they are going through, fuck they are tortured every second with a disease they can't comprehend cause it's eating their fucking brain. I've sat with grown ass men and women who were fucking incredible in their life times, that can't do anything and cry on your shoulder because they can't fix themselves. It's terrible on their side, I'm not trying to downplay your side at all, I'm just saying a lot of their frustration that comes out isn't you personally, it's them and they feel it.\nSecondly however, you are 21. You need to instantly stand up for yourself and focus on you. You are the most important thing in your life and fuck the perfect age to rock out whatever the fuck you wanted. Shit this life experience alone will help you so much in the future.\nI hope this made sense sorry if it didn't I was drinking and on mobile, this just hit close to home",

Asso. or your counties Council on Aging should be able to help you (I mean your mother) find a facility. Your Grandma needs to be in a facility. You should not be taking care of your grandma. I realize your mom is tired and stressed also, but if she cannot get dinner fix before 9 pm when she has a mother with Alz. waiting to be fed, she does not need to be taking care of your grandma either.\nFirst, your mother should be trying to get your grandma into a facility with a little help from you. Not the other way around. Second, if your mother makes excuses not to put your grandma into a facility, puts it off, or tries to put this responsibility totally on you....well I'm probably overstepping when I say this but, if I were you, I would flat out tell your mother that you would not be available anymore in the afternoon's to take care of your grandma. Period. Come up with a good excuse like I will be studying at the Library or with friends or a study group or whatever you can come up with. I would stick to my guns no matter how guilty she tries to make you feel. I would make sure I was not at home during those hours anymore. This will force your mother to do something about your grandmother. Right now she does not have to because she has you. The only other thing I can think of would be for you to get a part time job and move into an apartment with other roommates. I know you are young, and putting your foot down and sticking to your guns, no matter what (like guilt and religious jargon), and making big moves can be scary, but if your mother does not change this situation, you need to find a way out. You are to young for this. You need to get your education. \nOne other thing, go talk to a counselor at school. Pour your heart out. Let the counselor see how stressed you are and how destructive this situation is for you. Maybe they will be able to help you convenience your mother that this is a very bad situation for you to be in.\nI'm surprised the day care has not said something about your grandma's behavior and hygiene. \nI'm starting to believe the real problem is your mother, not your grandma.",

Frame it in a life-planning sense, talk about wills, DNR orders and \"what happens if you're memory issues should get worse\"? Her spouse is much younger so that helps but will also be very hard on him if her dementia worsens and she lives another 20 years.\nHopefully it prompts her to go see a neurologist and/or geriatric doc, find someone that specializes in dementia and go from there.

I started to read a lot of very positive comments about the technique and found a free app called \"Journey\" that could be used. So I started. Interesting that after only a couple of weeks, I'm beginning to look forward to each day sitting with a coffee before my wife awakes, and just babbling to noone.\nOne of the bits of advice was to include a comment about what I am grateful for....hello...grateful? Actually, I have a lot to be grateful for, and thinking about it and writing it down and then rereading it a few days later is helpful. Actually does lift the spirit. So look into journaling....it's free, easy to do, helps to get some focus on your feelings, and lots of people swear that it helps.\nAnother item that might help is to read the recent commencement speech by Sheryl Sandberg.

Another great question, we are actually wanting to design our own large wireless charging pad. We have several smart features we hope to implement. One is having large charging coils to allow for large charging zones. Our hope is that the person can simply have this charging pad where they would normally put their shoes and just place their shoes on their. Our aim is to have the insoles charging inside the shoes.\nWe don't want to break the persons routine so we try and consider this every aspect of our design.\nI hope this answers your questions if not I can clarify ",

        "text": "Firstly, I am so sorry you are struggling with this. I am a dementia specialist carer completing a degree in Dementia Studies in the UK, I will try to answer your questions as thoroughly as I can.\nPlease excuse the wall of text, I'm on my phone. \nProgression: It's likely that due to her vascular dementia she is continuing to have what are known as TIA'S, which is a \"transient ischemic attack.\" This is basically a mini stroke and could be behind the quick deterioration. Alzheimers disease progresses steadily instead of in steps. A vascular dementia will be like going down in steps, and can happen over a few days or a few years. \nDiagnosis: whilst this is not the nicest fact, it's true. The only way to 100% diagnose a dementia is via an autopsy of the brain. When a doctor diagnoses a dementia, it is not set in stone. So far the vascular dementia diagnosis sounds accurate, so does the alzheimers disease. You mentioned she also talks to people that aren't there, do you mean she is talking to a person and mistaking them for someone else or talking to an empty space? If it's the latter, it is possible she has a lewy body dementia also. This can cause hallucinations and symptoms like Parkinsons disease. There are around 500 different types of Dementia. It is unfortunately very difficult to diagnose.\nMedication: most medications are also available in a liquid form, and if not then in a soluble form so they dissolve in water. You can also get medication that dissolves in the mouth, speak to your mum's regular doctor about switching to liquid or soluble medication. If it's pain relief, you can get transdermal patches (usually either fentanyl or buprenorphine). These are basically plasters that stay on for between 3-7 days and release a certain hourly dose of pain relief that is absorbed through the skin.\nHer mood: with dementia one of the most difficult things is often that the person cannot express themselves anymore. Think of your mum like an iceberg (weird but hear me out) what you see is what is above the surface  (crying or being angry) and that's her way of communicating to you that something is wrong. Below the surface, that's where the problem is and unfortunately you can't see it. It could be something like needing the toilet, pain, feeling sick, shoes being too tight, discomfort, not hearing well, not seeing well, things being in the wrong place, frustration as she doesn't know what to do, she's tired. It's mostly about trial and error. It could be that she is experiencing depression as this is unfortunately very common in people living with a dementia, especially alzheimers disease. Medication like fluoxitine or citalopram (which are available in liquid form) can help.\nStages of dementia: the link is not very accurate. Everyone's experience of Dementia is intrinsic to them, no one else will experience it the same way. Generally stages are referred to as \"early\", \"middle\" or \"late\".\nDizziness: if by bathroom you mean urinating, she may have a urinary tract infection. If you mean pooing, she could be constipated. If she is just getting dizzy when she stands, it could be an issue with her blood pressure. It could also be none of those and something else entirely.\nHow can you make her feel better: you will know this better than anyone else. Try things that your mum liked in the past, or really anything at all. Again it's a bit of trial and error. You may not always be able to make her feel better. It's also important to focus on what she can do, not what she can't do. If she is able to eat with her fingers instead of cutlery then great, that means she can eat independently and will give her that little bit of confidence. Try and encourage her to do as much as she can.  Try to go along with her reality. If in that moment she believes you are her brother, try not to tell her otherwise. I know it's very upsetting :(\nCoping: there is no one way to cope with this. I live in the UK, and we have a couple of organisations that can help on the Internet.  Try www.alzheimers.org.uk or www.dementiafriends.org.uk. Both of these have forums and people to talk to who are going through similar things as you. \nIf you have any more questions please feel free to message me and ask. If I don't know the answer I can try and point you towards organisations that do. Most importantly, remember to take care of yourself. It is extremely hard being a carer for a family member and you need to make sure you are the number one priority.",

        "text": "Let me start by saying thank you to your advices. Some of the things you said I didn't know where possible (or just forgot) and were extremely helpful. \nAbout the diagnosis portion:\n - She has talked to dead people but rarely. Looking back, they happened when she out right refused to sleep for 48 hours and sometimes after she takes the quetiapine (she really tries to fight the urge to sleep ... it usually takes at least 3/4 hours to make her sleep with 25mg of quetiapine). But she confuses people all the time and I never contradict her, even when she can't say words I just complete her thoughts with random words like ... \"thing\", \"them\", \"him\", \"her\", etc.\nAbout the liquid medicine. I completely forgot about it. I'll talk to her physician. \nAbout the mood. I almost understand her behaviour like science. I can tell when she needs to pee, I can tell when she starts getting too agitated and then starts crying non stop (usually a few hours after citalopram) so I give her plidex, a medicine with 3.5mg of diazepam. It usually calms her down but it doesn't work all the time and I am really afraid of giving her too much medicine, because I know it can worsen her condition.\nAbout the bathroom. Probably too much information given in the original text. I just meant to say that she barely walks to and from the bathroom. Today she walked a lot more than she usually does and she did it until her legs were shaking (it's really difficult to tell when she's tired ... I said she walked a lot more but it must have added up to 1 or 2 blocks, which is not much).\nAbout the dizziness. It started in 2002/2003 (I was 14) when all of a sudden she stood up from the couch looking like she was agonizing and she \"drunk walked\" (body pressed against a wall) until she reached the bathroom and started puking. She put her head on the sink, spread her legs and put her butt on the wall (very thin bathroom) or else she would fall. I attribute that episode to the beginning of her condition, I truly believe that this is the moment she had her first micro infartion. She went to doctors but they all said: \"you're fiiiine .. you're gonna outlive us all\" and all that \"jazz\". Some of them treated her for vertigo. She suspected it wasn't vertigo, but like all doctors, if there isn't anything showing on THEIR OWN exams, then it's nothing. She did the next MRI many years later when I forced her to and by then the damage was already done.\nAbout making feel better. The thing about doing things she liked is that the only thing she did was work, drink some mate with her mother while watching TV and she can't watch TV anymore because she confuses reality and TV. Fortunately I always aggree with her reality and I go along with everything. Probably the only thing I was doing right. The only thing I can make her do is hug her and kiss her a lot, because it's the only way we can communicate, but it's really difficult for me, I'm not a very touchy person, I don't like being affectionate, I wasn't even affectionate as a child, but I can't complain. That's one f the few moments she feels well. What kills me are the 5 minutes she's completely lucid she says that she wants to die or asks me to kill her.\nAbout coping. This is my first attempt at coping. I tried talking with her brother, but he's kinda closed up and the rest of the people don't really understand. As much as they may love their grandparents, when it happens to a parent or parental figure it's so much worst. When my grandmother had it I prepared myself and was able to get over it really fast, but now that it's happening to my mother I'm breaking down.\nAbout being a carer. I am while I'm here. It kills me but I can't leave my job to take care of her and I can't take my job closer to her, so I'll have to worry whenever I'm away and stay by her side when I'm not working.\nAgain thank you for your help. Saying these things actually made me feel better and understand it a bit more, even though I couldn't give much information and also pardon my english. It's not rusty, I use it every day for my job, but it isn't my first language and I find it difficult to express myself sometimes. ",

        "text": "I work in nursing homes. I deal with dementia a lot.  \nPeople with dementia tend to have plateaus and then they decline and then they plateau again for a bit. Especially when there's a big change in what's happening or you take them out of their usual Comfort setting it can trigger a decline.  There's been a bit of research in transfer trauma.  There's a reason old people don't like change. \nWhat I can say about coping is that with family members of those affected by dementia this is really where the grieving process start to happen. Your mother is no longer who she was. You may have glimpses of the past ohlf what what she wants was.  But there will be no recovery. It does not get better it's really about prolonging the life and keeping the affected as comfortable as possible.  \nWhenever you are dealing with behavior the best thing you can do is meet her where she is. If she is looking for her mother do not tell her her mother is dead. Tell her that Mom is at the store or someone else is watching Mom for a bit and she gets to relax depending on what time her mind is at.  I'm a firm believer that reorienting is one of the worst things you can do because it causes the person to relive that grief every time.\nDon't push yourself too hard and know where you're at your limits. You can't be a good caretaker when you're tired.  If you need help get help. Whether it be an in-home aide to help you or seeing a therapist about the stress level.\nI wish you the best.  I hope this helps you.  If you ever have any questions about a particular Behavior or something like that feel free to inbox me.  I work in Recreation.",

It almost sounds like she may be regularly having little ones.  Is the medication she is on available in any other form besides pills?  Perhaps her caregivers could give her injections or something.\nI don't really think there is much you can do to make her feel better, to be honest.  I know that you desperately want to, but she is likely past the point where she could be easily soothed or treated for particular issues.  Is there any kind of sedative or anxiety reducing medication in her treatment regimen?  ",

As a can/caregiver in my 30s let me share a couple of points:\n1) whether you, I, or anyone else likes it, your father is still in control of his own life. He does not want to have people making decisions for him, period. So everyone who lives him will have to respect his wishes even if they disagree. This will help reduce the abusive behaviors due to his stroke.\n2) Doctors will likely only sedate him because there's no miracle medication that fixes personality disorders beyond phtcotropics and I assure you, that those aren't a good answer so, let your dad do as he wants with his own medical care. Quit trying to control the doctors understanding.\nI know that what I'm telling you is a hard thing to hear. But I've seen this go both ways. And one day, the people who love you will be worried about you as an old lady.... Would you want everyone (seemingly) to randomly take over your entire being?

By the time I got an alert ID probably already know grandma was missing.\nDementia is hard to nail down but going in the direction of strait monitering is better. The less reliant the device is on patient input the better because that would capture a wider range of patients on the cognitive impairment spectrum. Wireless baby moniters work well in a lot of these instances because there is no input from the patient. Moniters work great, but won't tell me where grandma went when she escaped. Luckily for me grandma usually ended up at the same place, but that is rarely the case with dementia patients. \nMy sister in law recently was part of a search for an elderly patient that escaped their house one night. All the neighbors searched for 3 days, and the police eventually started just looking for a body. A day laborer stumbled on her in an orchard about a half mile from her house and called the police. Every night she was out the temp dropped down into the 30's. No one knows how she survived given how sick and frail she normally was. A strait up tracker that was always attached to her would have alerted everyone to her exact location and prevented such an arduous search. \nIf you can create the tracker I described, you would not only capture consumers who care for elderly wandering patients, but also a ton of parents of special needs children with cognitive impairments, parents of toddlers, or just parents who are paranoid.

        "text": "First one, some patients are non verbal. My grandmother when she got to the non verbal phase would chew on the insides of her cheeks, fidget profusely or other non verbal queues to suggest to me she needed aid in some way, whether it be a dirty diaper or a cramping muscle or whatever else. A baby monitor would catch this most of the time. Most moniters have a button I could press to let me speak to her like a walkie talkie to let her know I was coming.\nThe second thing: baby proofing doors can prevent a lot of escapes but not all, but again who care about a blanket text, I watched granny like a hawk but she was sneaky as fuck. I should clarify, she had 24 hour live in caregivers (me being the main one) and she still managed to escape. She'd wait until I threw a load into the dryer or went to make a bed, or go to the bathroom (with the door open even) and make her move. I'd notice the minute I'd walk back into the room where she was sitting which, no joke, I would never leave her more than 3 minutes. Grandma was super quick when she wanted to be. Once out of the house, even a couple seconds ahead of me she would essentially disappear. Again, I am fortunate that she would usually end up in the same place, but most patients aren't like that.  \nI'm going to tell you right now, don't bother with cell phones. They can be chewed on, flushed, peed on, etc. They are impossible to wash, and are useless unless on the patient, which I can just about guarantee, 90% of the time a patient escapes with nothing more than the clothes on their backs and where they are going is the important information, not that they have left an area because a patient can be astonishingly fast when they want to be. This isn't just 'simple app stuff' you need to design here. There's a zillion apps, and they all have a major flaw, a phone can be destroyed by the patient. Trust me, if you want to do this right you need to essentially make a consumer version of those ankle bracelets they put on chronic drunk drivers. Putting something on a phone like this would be mostly useless. Think of a dementia patient like a giant 2 year old. Would you expect a 2 year old to not destroy a phone if for no other reason than to satisfy curiosity? Also, there were times in the day I wouldn't want anything phone like near grandma because she would stick a lot of things in her mouth. I'd be afraid she'd bite down on it mid sundowning fit. \nIt needs to attach to the patient in some way at all times for it to even be mildly effective.\nThe thing you need to understand about dementia is that there are a lot of times a patient is perfectly coherent. That's why you want it to be tamper proof. It's the times they are suddenly incoherent that is the problem because those moments happen randomly throughout the day and night with zero warning.",

But there are inexpensive Android wearables out there that have more-or-less the complete cell phone experience, with 3G and GPS radios.  It might be as simple as building a simple watch face on the front-end and adding some monitoring software that runs behind it.  To be determined...\nThanks again for your comments. =]  They really highlight the fact that it's hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution.",

After that, find a neurologist who specializes in dementia.  Honestly, the meds that are currently available show little efficacy in most patients, but you can try them.  A clinical trial could offer some home.  Finally, dementia patients don't know they are doing anything wrong with their outbursts and they can't learn, so scolding them is meaningless.  Even if you sit them down and they agree to everything half an hour later it will be as if the conversation never happened; to them, it didn't.  This is why so many dementia patients end up in a care facility.  Most homes are utterly unequipped to deal with them.  If possible, get him to designate a POA so you have the legal ability to make decisions for him.  Bring in a caregiver to give your grandmother/mother a break in her duties.  It is unbelievably exhausting to care for even the most compliant dementia patient.  It is, in effect, caring for a toddler with the body and legal rights of an adult.  ",

(even though she's had operations/replacements) and he is able to help her with all of that. He certainly does take on the role of having to take care of her, a lot more than most couples.\nWe've tried to encourage her to age concern \"events?\" but she just like him is very stubborn and she feels that it's for really old people and doesn't want to \"be one of them\" but we're all confident that she'd enjoy it and it would do her good, part of the reason we want her to go is so he can have a break... but saying that she also cares for him by getting him to eat, reminding him of everything, in her case she is all there mentally but not there physically, where as for him it's the opposite way round.\nIf we said to him that we're going to take him to the hospital or have a discussion with him over it he would get frustrated, angry and upset; let alone mention power of attorney.

        "text": "Disclaimer: I'm not a pro. I just have a grandma with moderate-severe stage Alzheimer's Disease and so, I'll be speaking from my experience.\nFirst, you need a proper diagnosis. Certain types of dementias are treatable, others are not - the only way to know is to get a diagnosis, preferably by consulting several neurologists and psychiatrists. [Here's] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1307463/pdf/westjmed00154-0073.pdf) a list of reversible and irreversible dementias. The document is a bit old, but it'll help you understand (just like it helped me) that dementia is a symptom of a disease, and you need to know what you're dealing with in the case of your dad/grandpa.\nSecond, form what I have seen in my grandma, your grandpa's symptoms sound quite similar to hers: see them here She hasn't been aggressive, though, but this could be due to her personal character. She has always been a bit stubborn, for example, and has gotten even more so in the past 2-3 years.\nUsually, with Alzheimer's you can see a physical shrinkage of the patient's brain over time. I don't have my grandma's MRI scans handy, but there was clearly more water in her most recent brain scan compared to one take 2 years ago; the density of some of her brain parts has diminished too. So, archive his scans and make sure to bring them to your physician/s for progression checkup.\nKeep in mind that if your grandpa has irreversible dementia he will be unlearning things day-by-day, from more complicated tasks like driving to simple ones like feeding oneself and going to the bathroom; so there will come a day when you'll need someone who will take care of him 24/7. Hence, start thinking about getting an at-home caregiver or a residential care for elderly with dementia right now. Begin to research this issue, plan your finances and start discussing this with your nan. A good, trained caregiver will be your godsend. Having her/him in your lives will ease up the psychological damage that you will go though during the last years of your loved one with dementia.\nIn the future, please consider lying therapeutically and abstain from fixing your grandpa's storyline. I know it hurts you to hear him say something about having recently seen or spoken to a deceased relative, but he doesn't remember any of it, so reminding him of a death of a loved one will make him upset all over again. Whenever my grandma talks about wanting to see her dad who died in the 1950s, we just straight up lie to her that he is on a vacation and will be back in a few weeks. Same goes for telling him about his diagnosis, but this is my personal view. \nI don't know which state/country you live in but reach out to your local Dementia organization. They can provide you with lots of very useful advice and support and remind you that you are not alone. \nIf I can be of any additional support, please pm me. Good luck to you and I hope your grandpa's condition is reversible. \nEdit: Apologies for the typos. I'm writing this on my phone.",

        "text": "Hi,\nThat's part of the problem, he's very private, stubborn and the sort who would stay in denial for a long time, he would also get angry, frustrated and upset if we spoke to him about it and wouldn't let any of us come to the doctors with him so we can't ask the important questions; let alone get anything done. He's all there mentally, it's just his memory that's the problem.\nMy granddads children (even my father) are all hesitant to step in and sit him down and talk about it partly I assume because they don't want him to actually have dementia (don't we all want that?) and because of how he will react to it. I've been trying to push my father at least to step in or at least speak to the other siblings to try and get them all to agree on something. It's not really for me or my mother for example to step in as we can't do much being non-immediate family.\nAs far as our medical knowledge goes (we have a very healthy amount between us) it certainly looks like vascular dementia, he's had 3-4 MRI scans over the last 3-4 years and they haven't said anything yet, I fully expect the results of his most recent set of tests to come back saying that he definitely has dementia and I can see something happening on the medical side. He's always drunk a fair amount of alcohol, probably a little too much on a regular basis throughout the years but not to an alcoholic degree, he still has a few beers here and there but only really 1 or 2 on a night to the pub for example because he just can't handle his beer anymore.\nYou mention the unable to recognize people in photos, my Granddad is terrible for this. He struggles sometimes to even realize that some pictures are his wife (granted she does look a bit different) but he very rarely manages to recognize any of his children in any pictures unless the picture is within the last 15 years.\nMy granddad also mentions that he \"saw this lovely [insert dog breed] down the town a few days ago\", it's the same story every time, likewise he keeps telling us about all of his mischievous doings back when he was a young man. When 10 years ago none of these would ever be mentioned.\nWe've been getting photos out a lot whenever they come round, likewise we have made them photo calendars, buy them some old school music just to try and help with his memory.\nIn the UK, the doctors can just bring up their notes on the computer and the MRI scans will be available for any doctor that sees him to see.\nWe haven't noticed him unlearning things so to speak, just confusion with anything technical (I can understand that) and forgetting to do things. \nI spoke with my mother today and an agreement she has with my Nan is after her other knee is replaced (later this month) she is willing to go to a few age concern meetings/events (for tea and biscuits) to see how it is there but part of the agreement is that she'll only go if my mum goes along with her for a few sessions because she's obviously and understandably anxious about it.\nAhh, we already lie and abstain to help with his stories, we know he's confused and forgets and there's no point getting in an argument with him over something silly, we just as bad as it sounds, nod and smile. The only reason my Dad mentioned to him about he thinks something is going on (memory/brain wise) is because my Granddad started the conversation and it was the first and more than likely only good opportunity to speak to him about it, in private, without his wife (she'd chip in with comments which wouldn't help)\nYour advice, story and help is much appreciated. No need to apologise for typos :)\nEdit: Apologies for the typos. I'm writing this on my phone.",

        "text": "Hi, sorry for a rather later reply, but here we go:\nFrom what you have written, I am getting an impression that your grandpa's progression into the disorder/disease according to this outline is either in stage 3 or 4. The outline is a bit general and may not fit every person's symptoms but its translation was given to us by my grandma's physician.\nHave a look at https://www.dementiauk.org/ for support. I don't know where exactly you are in the UK, but here in Aberdeen we have http://www.alzscot.org/ chapter and although I'm not originally from the UK and my grandma isn't being treated in Scotland, I have been visiting them for some moral support since last year and they have been extremely helpful. So have a look online for a local chapter and do give them a call even if you don't have anything to say and just need a bit of encouragement that you are doing all that you can. Also, I don't know if the NHS covers elderly care but maybe it would be worth calling the NHS and asking them about palliative care for elderly with dementia? I'm sure there must be some sort of help out there.\nYes, get your Nan on board as soon as she feels better. If possible, have your grandpa's GP or physician talk about his diagnosis to her, so she fully understands the severity of the situation. Then, inform the rest of the family and start working on a plan for your grandpa. The sooner you agree on one and get everything ready, the less anxiety you will feel and the more opportunity you will have to spend quality time with your grandpa before his condition gets really bad. \nI can understand your father and his, to some extend, unwillingness to accept his father's (possible) diagnosis and move on with it. My dad has been struggling too. His mom (my grandma) has been a strong and independent woman all his life and brought up 7 kids all on her own, gave them very good education and took care of their kids when they couldn't. To see her now struggling with tying her laces and making tea is heartbreaking. So my mom and I have become my dad's counsellors and we try to support him when he feels sad and upset. If your dad has been showing signs of sadness and anxiety because of his dad's health problems, and he isn't willing to share them with you, then maybe it'd be worth to talk to him about seeing a counsellor?\nHope it works out for you!",

        "text": "Hi, Thank you for your reply, very very late from me.\nI had a look at that website and we believe he's actually stage 4, but not too far away from being stage 5. Over the last few months it's been getting quite noticeable.\nSo, he had to go back in to the hospital to get the results for his scans and the way we decided to deal with it was instead of any of his children or his wife go with him one of the grandsons went in with him as he tends to be more accepting around us we think it's because he doesn't feel as embarrassed which I can certainly understand but none of us judge him or anything we're all very understanding people.\nThey confirmed to him that he has dementia-alzheimers and vascular dementia as we expected and he took it surprisingly well, he didn't get upset or anything but the hospital were amazing and made it sound not as bad as it sounds. The hospital gave us some telephone numbers and we were asked to organise a meeting with a lady from age concern / dementia uk.\nThe lady went to my Granddad's place a few days ago and they (Granddad, Nan, their daughter in law and the Age Concern/Dementia UK lady) discussed a bunch of things, she suggested a series of things that should be done such as a joint power of attorney, getting attendance allowance for my Mum & Dad as they go down a lot and help them with all sorts of things from decorating, cleaning, sorting their tablets, taking them to the hospital/doctors... etc). Again he surprised us and was all okay with it. We think it's because it's confirmed now so he can't be in denial anymore because you would understandable deny it, I certainly would!\nWe're going to organise another meeting with the lady again but this time without my Granddad being there because there were a lot of things that weren't brought up that are a concern including things like in the last two weeks he's only showed twice and if this was brought up in front of him he would definitely get angry.\nMy Nan, unfortunately is rather useless she is the sort of person who won't step up to the plate and take control. He's always been the one in control of things. She's also really not good with knowing details because she nags at him and she also is very sneaky and uses his obvious forgetfulness to get things that she wants even though she doesn't need it. I'll can't think of an example right now but everyone notices it.\nThe family have already spoken without Nan & Granddad being around about it as we were all confident that is what was wrong and had been trying our best with no experience with it before. We've already for the last year or so been spending more time with them because we all had thoughts that it might be dementia creeping in and in hindsight we now notice even more occasions were we're thinking \"oh maybe that was dementia starting...\". Today for example my Nan & Granddad, Uncle & Aunt, Mum & Dad are all going out for a meal and to the theater for a show :)\nAs for my Dad, he hasn't shown any signs of sadness or anxiety. We'd notice it if he was because it's normally very easy to spot. We're just getting on with it, kind of shrugging it off and keep everything normal but now trying to put things in place now that we have a diagnosis.\nSorry for such a huge reply again but thank you for being a wonderful help, we really appreciate it.",

Secondly, your father needs to apply for legal conservator of his money, or POA, or guardianship. OR he needs to be placed in a memory care facility because legitimately elderly people cannot care for other elderly people. Especially if he is already hitting his wife. There are several meds that help lessen symptoms such as anger and aggression. They do not help the disease itself but they will mitigate symptoms so that you all don't want to kill each other. Have his license taken away. Driving is not advisable. You can easily change this to just a govt issued ID. If he cannot be trusted to stay at home or to be civil around his wife you may need to consider having someone move in to help care for them. Or like I said, a memory care facility. Neither are cheap. In the states memory care places range from $4,000-$6,000 and up per MONTH. This entire thing is scary and horribly stressful but it needs to be done, the sooner the better. By the time I made it home to help my dad he was hiding knives under his bed and living on hostess snack cakes and not paying the mortgage. It was bad. ",

She's the sort of lady who would frustrate even the most sane so I can kind of understand my Granddad but we are all well aware and in agreement that he can't hit, we've told her if he does it again to tell us and we'll have to sit down with him and talk about it with him present as it's unacceptable and will NOT be tolerated.\nDo you know of any legal means for us to either put a tracker on his car or on his keys (I would put one on his phone but he uses old school phones) just so we know where he is for his safety and our peace of mind.

This behavior 1. is dangerous for the individual with Dementia and 2. dangerous for the children. She is mostly \"harmless\" but any unwanted touching- let alone of children- is sexual abuse. It is not as if these are grown adults who work for a nursing care facility. These are bystanders who are children. There is a lot of legal action that can be taken out on both your work place and the facility this lady lives in. If you are still worried, a possibility could be an anonymous tip.\nEither way, both this lady and the children you work with need protection. This type of behavior would not be allowed if she was at a skilled nursing facility. Because she is displaying these dangerous behaviors, she needs a more appropriate placement at a facility that can address these behaviors. It is not the lady doing these things, it is the disease..So please dont feel guilty, it would be for the best of her and the children.  ",

I have had a few residents in my experience with the same symptoms and behaviors that you describe and they can be very alarming and off putting to people who don't have the proper background knowledge of dementia. Said people will not be able to tell that she is harmless. \nFirst thing's first, report the assisted living facility to the state and tell them everything that you told us. Proper precautions should have been taken to keep this woman within the confines of the facility. Every time she is \"out and about\" without supervision it is considered an elopement. Try to recall how many times you've seen this woman outside without a worker from the facility. They obviously need to have a fire lit up from under their asses because it is one thing if she had gotten out once. From what you described there have been many numerous occasions where this has happened. As a CNA who works in a memory care building, I am absolutely appalled and disgusted that this amount of negligence has gone unreported and unpunished. It sounds as if they may let her out willingly or they are too incompetent to take care of this woman. Her behaviors are her own. She cannot control what she is doing and I'm glad to see you can understand that. \nSo call the state and report the facility. This patient's wellbeing and life are at risk if she has escaped so many times and it is pure negligence. As a compassionate person, I love all my residents and can't imagine being a family member of this woman and finding out the information you have given us. It literally has me feeling sick because of how negligent this facility must be. I beg you. \nAfter you've called and reported the facility to the state, they will come and investigate the facility. If they contact you to ask questions please help them in any way you can. \nIn the meantime, you need to call the facility and let them know that if you see this woman outside the facility unsupervised again, you will be calling the police for the sake of your children (not that she would/could purposefully harm them) and for the wellbeing of this woman. Do not tell them that you contacted the state.  ",

        "text": "I can't speak in terms that I have a loved one showing signs of a cognitive decline or with dementia, but I am a CNA who has the pleasure to work in a specially designed lock down building dedicated to dementia only residents. \nThe best thing you can do is get the required tests done to produce a proper diagnosis. The underlying problem is pinning where your mother is at in the progression of her possible dementia. Based on the information you provided, she is already displaying some very obvious signs of some type of dementia, but until she is tested, it's hard to pinpoint exactly how well her cognitive functions are still performing. If she's at the point where she's forgetting things on a daily basis your first course of action is to find a specialized doctor who can help with diagnosing her. Then if she gets to the point where she is no longer able to provide her own simple care, you need to see what you can do about either becoming her durable power of attorney, or finding/appointing someone who can take that position. That way, you can be the one to decide what precautions are to be taken for her wellbeing since she is no longer able to do so herself. For example, my resident's durable power of attorney is their son and/or daughter. They can decide a number of things including whether or not to recessutate them in the event that they go into heart faliure, etc. \nYou always want to keep an open mind and be as patient as you can with her. Most people don't understand that dementia isn't simply just dementia. It is a broad spectrum that has numerous different types that all cause different behaviors and affect the brain/body differently. \n  If she is still at the point where you can have a conversation with her about getting tested, and she can remember the conversation 2-3 days later, you have different options. \n  If she is at the point where she can not tell you whether or not she agrees to get the testing done, you'll have to explore other options in getting her tested and getting a proper diagnosis. \nI can't stress this enough, but, for future reference: If she progresses to the point where she has been diagnosed with some form of dementia, had known it in the past, but no longer can remember or do the the simplest of cognitive functions, she more than likely needs to be in the professional care of someone like me either at a nursing home or have a home health care worker who can help her with those things. I honestly believe that her being in a nursing home would be the better decision because she is way more at risk of endangering herself or others in her own home because of all the things that become hazards, stairs and the kitchen area to name a few. \nIf it ever gets to that point, the cruelest thing you can do is to constantly remind her that she has dementia. That also means constantly reminding her of deceased relatives, parents, etc. They have to relive that pain every time they're reminded.\n  If she gets to the point where her mind is very far gone, let her live in her world as she sees it. I've always said that it's our job to live in their world, not the other way around. \n  If it comes to that point and she lives in a nursing facility, make sure she gets the care she needs and deserves, you both have that right. \n  And if she every asks her why she's there and you've exhausted every other redirection that you can, don't tell her that it's dementia. Tell her that she lives in a retirement community with other people like her where they're well taken care of. \n  If she remembers the dementia, never call it that unless she does so herself. Adress it as a \"problem with memory\" and remind her that it's common among the elderly. I have always found that this helps. \n  I have a resident who we count as highly independent in the sense that she remembers how to eat, she can carry out a full conversation even though she forgets the majority of what you tell her in an average of 3-5 minutes. It takes a lot of patience and you really have to be a special fit to work in that environment but I honestly can't think of anything I'd enjoy more. She frequently asks why she's with us and she's one of our residents who you can be pretty forward with. I tell her that she has a problem with often forgetting things. She asks if she's crazy and I constantly remind her that she's no more crazy than me. \nI hope this answer helps you and your mother. Always be patient with her, that's one of the best things you can do.",

The recommendation was based on nothing they could articulate, and from their feeble explanations I sensed that it was more for their benefit than my mom's to have her family out of their way. We were ultimately not comfortable with not supervising her care in those early days and in a place she was unfamiliar with. Mom called us incessantly for the first few weeks as well, which was heartbreaking. It made me realize how often she was thinking of us (all day, sometimes in the middle of the night). I felt as though the only times she could have some peace was when we were there for her in person or answering those calls to reassure her.

Does he happen to be a veteran?  If so, there are programs that can be of assistance using that avenue as well.  Good luck! \nEdited to add some additional thoughts: It is crucial that he makes it to his physical therapy appointments.  I know you mention that he's missed them, but he's got to get there.  For my dad, who has limited mobility, we set up Uber and Lyft on his phone for him to request rides to his appointments.  The prices to transport him are extremely reasonable (about $6 for a 2.5 mile drive).  Also, next time, do not hesitate to call EMS to help him off the floor.  They are trained to do those types of things.  If it makes you feel uncomfortable to call 911, just call the local non-emergency number.

When she pushes the button, the camera send an email, which can be a phone text message.\nTotal cost about $100 one time cost, without any monthly fee. \nThey also make motion detectors, door open and other transmitters besides the push button.\nWe keep a tablet watching the camera feed, so when we walk to the kitchen, we can look in.

If you look at the photo of the back, there is a little green connector that if the 2 in wires are connected it sets off an alarm. Inside the software of the camera, you can setup an email to be sent. Most cell phones have an email address to send a text to, For example, 5551234567@txt.att.net. \nThen I use a dxr-701 & remote, which you push the button on the DXR, then the button on the remote to program.\ntwo wired need to go from the DXR to the green connector on the camera. Old phone wire or ethernet cable is a single stand of copper and is easiest to use.\nthe dxr also needs a 12 volt power supply. It doesn't matter what end it has, because it will get cut off and screwed down on the dxr.\nThe camera can also be fitted with a motion detector and the camera programmed for hours the alarm is active, so sleepwalking can be detected and notified.\nFiguring out what to buy was the hard part, anyone who can strip a wire and setup email can do it. \nI'll be glad to help all i can.

I'm not sure if my mother is aware of it or not, but I will pass the info along to her.\nBoth my parents of recently taken charge of her bank accounts so that they can pay all her bills online (there was some worry that she would begin to overpay them). \nMy mother has attended all neuro appointments that my Grandmother has been dragged to (not literally of course, but close enough). Her mental decline is well documented, however, as I said the progression of her Dementia has been very gradual. \nWe did manage to take steps like getting her driver's license revoked - lots of hoops to jump through for that, amazingly, given her age and disease. \nMy parent's are both recently retired (my Mother worked for decades as a ARNP, caring for others, and now when she is trying to enjoy life she has been left to care for her mother - who is by far the worst \"patient\" she has ever encountered). Since they are now on a fixed budget themselves they are hesitant to spend any of their own money on my Grandmother's expense. My grandmother has more than enough money to take care of things, however, her personality is such that she does not wish to spend money on anything but expensive luxuries.\nHopefully, the fact that my parent's have taken control of her accounts, will help this issue. However, the current worry is that if money is spent on assisted care (like a nurse/health worker doing in house visits), or assistance based tech (security cams, WiFi, emergency alert devices), not only will she not use them, but she will find a way to retaliate (as in she won't answer the phone, etc.). \nAs her last neuro appointment (December) actually showed some improvement (at that point she was correctly taking Exelon), we didn't have enough to show she was not capable of living on her own. Again, there is some concern that if we don't have the proper amount of evidence and we take her to court (to gain full control over her), then she will find a way to cut us off (communication, financially, etc.), which will undoubtedly make the situation a 100 times worse. Though her ability to rationalize things is mostly gone, she has still found ways to manipulate things when she wants something - in a way it is fascinating how this disease targets certain parts of the brain before others.\nThe best way to describe the situation is that we are in a game of Capture the Flag, currently sitting in No Man's Land, inching toward the line at which we will need to make a play for the opposition's flag (taking her to court). \nI'm sorry to hear about your Dad - this disease certainly sucks!!",

She got angry with my mother over that and threatened to cut off communication, which would have ultimately made things much, much worse.\nThe second visit they did go into her house briefly (amazingly my Grandmother let them in), but they didn't find anything that overly concerned them.

At this point the alarm scares him and almost ensures a fall.  It could alert me in the next room and I would be aware he is trying to walk and not scare him.   The same with incontinence alarms.  It beeps and wakes him, he is then scared disoriented and wet.  If it would alert me I can change him without waking him most of the time and if I do wake him it is in a less jarring way.

I wish it was more simplified so she can use it without help but I don't think that's ever going to happen.  I was considering trying to spread awareness that something like this would help, or try to patent something, but I'm not really an inventor or developer, just a tinkerer.\nI call it the 'Happy Tablet'.  So basically old photos, videos and the ability to facetime people makes her happy, and if she's happy then I'm happy!",

We use ~~and~~ an app called When I Work for that but there are many comparable apps out there. We also rely heavily on checklists for regular daily tasks and even though we use paper ones, I could see that being easily done on a tablet as well.\nWill you talk about any adaptive technology that enables communication from the person who's being cared for? I'm a very active part in dictating the care that I need and the way that I want to live my life and I think that it's so stressful to be a caregiver that sometimes it's hard for people to remember the wants of the person being cared for - we all get so wrapped up in the needs.\nHere's a very small and simple example: I can't type on a phone very easily so being able to text doctors, email insurance companies and coordinate caregivers from my computer is key. If I'm not feeling well enough to talk I can type and show it to someone. There's a whole rabbit hole of adaptive technology as well that I'm not sure you want to go down, but I wonder if you might just bring into your talk ways that technology can be used to welcome the person being cared for into the process of caregiving",

The bladder gets used to not being emptied and begins to stop reporting its fullness properly.

We had financial POA for years, and I managed to get things straightened out and even got her approved for Medicaid which got her some home care and eventually covered her nursing home costs. Her condition has definitely worsened over the years, mostly because my husband\u2019s enabling sister has Medical Proxy, and won\u2019t let them give her any neuro-psych meds or be seen by that doctor.

Still, my husband\u2019s sister swears it\u2019s not the dementia and that she\u2019s just unhappy in the nursing home. \nSo, out of the blue, his sister has a lawyer draw up a new POA that put her in charge, and their mom told us (after whispering that she\u2019s not supposed to tell us) that his sister is working on getting an apartment for the two of them to live in together. Oh...did I mention that his sister has MS and is disabled and needs daily care herself?\nYeah, so basically it\u2019s a shit show, and we have no power to do anything anymore, and now his mother tells us to f-ck off when we talk to her on the phone and tells my husband I\u2019m a b-tch and he never should have married me. We had a very good relationship for many years (I\u2019ve been with my husband 18 years.) Now she blames me for everything that goes wrong.\nThe only advice I have for you, is to think about getting guardianship of your MIL. Bring whatever evidence you have to court that your husband\u2019s brothers are neglecting her needs. Or, you can do what we have done, which is to let them have their dysfunctional mess, and get your own therapy to deal with the pain of watching it all happen. If your husband\u2019s family is anything like my husband\u2019s family, they will find a way to ruin you if you try to take control. For us, it was too big of a chance to take. It is extremely painful, though, for my husband and I to watch, and we try to offer whatever comfort we can to her that she will accept. \nYou could also call adult protective services anonymously, but you\u2019ll have to weigh that with the possibility that they might know it was you because of your previous action with her driver\u2019s license.\nWhatever you choose, know that I am with you in spirit, and wishing for the peace and safety of all of the family members involved.",

Before the dementia, she was kind and generous and if she gossiped some, she also tried to speak well of others and build relationships. Looking back, we can kind of see where the paranoia kicked in with various conflicts with extended family, communication breaking down, etc. \nWe have been going back and forth between calling APS and petitioning for guardianship. Guardianship is hard for us because we'd have to move her to a facility in our town, and that would effectively cut her off from the rest of her family, friends, and everyone she ever knew. That's not something we want to do to her. APS is a hard choice for us because we feel responsible for her, so it's like we're calling APS on ourselves, you know? Like, if we feel so concerned about her wellbeing, then we should go to court and do what is needed to take care of her. But then we come full circle to the problem of moving her away from the rest of the family. I'm also not sure APS would be at all helpful. In the past few years, I've tried getting help from child protective services twice for children I know that are being neglected, and CPS did nothing. Thank you for the support.",

It\u2019s different than CPS.\nWe had the same concern about moving my MIL closer to us (and also my FIL who is mostly recovered from a stroke but lives in a different nursing home.) It\u2019s a difficult decision to weigh the pros against the cons. Just make sure you\u2019re not opening yourself up to the threat of violence against you from other family members. \nAre there some kind of assets/inheritance that are involved, that is making the rage brother be so protective?

He's been preoccupied with ownership of minor, nearly worthless belongings on the property, like an old fishing boat that's probably not even worth $1000. But when she passes he's likely to inherit several hundred thousand dollars. There's lots of odd concern by both of the local brothers about her not being able to afford care, etc., as if she is poor, or as if her only asset is the house. She is quite well off, though. I think for some reason they trusted us to talk about finances, but did not discuss it with the others. Possibly because we have done well for ourselves and never asked them for financial help.",

I would really encourage you to seek support from your community of faith. Do you have a youth minister or pastor you can talk to about what is going on and how you're feeling?  Advice I can give you from my experience - do what you can to take care of your own emotional and spiritual wellbeing (listen to music you love, journal, yoga, go for walks, etc.). But the most import thing piece of advice I can give you is this - if indeed your dad does have some form of dementia, you need to understand now that his personality may change or certain personality characteristics may become more exaggerated (this has been my experience). IF this happens be quick to forgive and liberal with your grace and patience. ",

        "text": "Hi.  \nI completely understand and resonate with the things you're going through because of the dementia in your family.  I have gone through a similar ordeal, and it took me a great while to find peace with myself and how to handle the dementia with my father, which has torn apart his life and much of our family.\nThe most important discovery for me was understanding that none of this is my father's fault and most of the fears, aggravation, embarrassment, frustrations, disappointments, and so-forth are directly under my control.  Moreover, I realized that I was letting the issues this generated within myself and our family negatively affect my relationship with and how I treated my father.\nI could write about this much more at length, but I just want to point out a few things, even though they may be trite by some standards (it's hard to know where anyone is when it comes to how we view dementia, especially when it is within our close family) and sorry if I am too abrupt or frank:\n1. Don't care what your boyfriends think.  Why should what someone else thinks about your father having dementia affect you in any way?  As it is, most people don't understand and make light of dementia as much as people do the same with, say, misunderstood mental illness.  People can think of those with Dementia (as well as the family for the changes they make to accommodate it) as just plain weird.\n\nThat's just people reacting to anything different in a negative manner, and there is a lot of people that will tell you what you \"should\" do.  \nA true friend (to you, your family, and your Dad) would jump right in with a positive attitude even if it is a little awkward at first.  Sometimes people reflect off of our attitudes as well -- in other words, my advice is to not worry about what people think and they will get strength from you to be your friend.  If not, then forget them anyway.\n2. Not visiting your grandparents because the place smells like urine.  I don't want to be too forward here, but this does hit me at home a little bit, with my father being in a nursing home where I constantly have to smell many similar things, if not worse, on a regular basis.\n\nWhy not visit your grandparents because you're uncomfortable?  Think of how they feel being in a place like that.  Nursing homes can be awful places, especially for those that cannot help with their own personal grooming and other habits, as they also lose their voice to make changes.    \nI don't know what your grandparent's situation is in terms of possibly taking them outside, or opening a window for a while, etc.  Whatever their status is, visiting would make their lives better, which makes it more about them -- which, in turn, does come back to make it about you and feeling good for helping someone else out.\n3. Enjoy what you have now.  My father is not the same person he was a few years ago.  It took me a long time to figure out that the real person is still in there, with the same feelings, plus a whole lot more -- he is much more like a child and needs to be taken care of as such.  However, that has allowed me to form a new relationship.  In many ways, our roles have reversed and I act like his parent -- he calls me his father every once in a while.  Sometimes he thinks I'm his brother, or my brother.  However, even when he does mistake me for someone else, it is clear the feeling of family and that a \"I like this person being here\" mentality is still there.  Just because he may forget who I am doesn't diminish the value of our relationship, or my desire to help him have a higher quality of life.\n\n4. Constantly look for new avenues.  We often hear a lot of stories about people with dementia -- screaming, agitation, blank stares, etc.  This does happen and, in many cases, there is not much you can do about it as it is a genuine cognitive breakdown.  However, it's amazing what little changes can do.  For example, there is one case where a women was completely upset and agitated when her family changed her clothes.  Well, you have to change someone's clothes, so what could they do?  it took a while, but they realized it was because it was different clothes.   As soon as they realized that they just needed a few separate sets of the same exact clothes, everything was fine.   In my Dad's case, he was getting very upset at staff in the nursing home.  I like the staff in this nursing home, but they do need much better training.  I finally realized it was because they were pulling a curtain behind him unannounced, which triggered him (this is classic Dementia behavior, by the way).    Once I was able to convince the staff to not walk behind my father without announcing themselves, things were much better.\n\n5. Listen. The issue with the people walking behind my father was one of 50+ things we discovered over time (like making sure the tv stayed on CNN at all times, or leaving the light on, or closing the curtains, etc. etc.).  This is the way it is with Dementia, and the smallest thing (like a stuffed animal, for some) can make a night-and-day difference in how they feel and how they relate to others.  Some of it is obvious (look up triggers for dementia, for example), while others take a lot of listening.\n\n6. It's their universe; learn how to listen.  This was probably the hardest part of understanding that I was placing my view of the way things should be on my father, which was simultaneously not helping him and causing me to be upset and frustrated.  Things that seemed painfully obvious wouldn't work.  I needed to learn to listen and understand how he relates to his world (a subject that needs a lot more writing space).  Once I did that, things became much easier.  I've been much more at peace with things, and my father has a much better quality of life.\n\nDon't get me wrong -- his life is still awful and Dementia is such a scourge.  However, is life is 10 times better with the efforts in understanding what works for him and letting go of any expectations on who and what he should be that we once had.\nAnyway, I just thought I'd throw some thoughts out there.  I guess my basic message is that, while Dementia is horrible and a strain on the family, there are ways to deal with it that can make it so much better for many with Dementia, and much easier on the family taking care of them.\nI think the idea (from other people) of a support group is great!  Being able to talk to others with the same situation makes our seem so much easier to handle -- and definitely a little less lost.",

Check with your phone company to see what kind of deals you can get for adding a flip phone and if there are extra charges for using the locator app.   Because the phones are on my account, I could see when my father called 911 and check in on him (he forgot to pay his electric bill and the power was off - I took over paying that account as a result).

        "text": "Trying to find your own way in life has been greatly detoured by your mother's illness, You are of the age where what you want for yourself is perfectly normal; to be independent, working and still be a responsible family member. The fact that you have come to realize this (a bit later than you might have liked) does not mean you cannot still attain it.\nYou are in a very difficult and challenging situation. Dealing with a loved one's dementia is a draining, exhausting and ultimately tragic experience. There is help available and I would strongly advise you to insist to your father that it be utilized. He cannot realistically expect you to continue maintaining the home and caring for your mother to the exclusion of your own future. I would make every effort to assure him that you are not deserting him but rather you are hoping to make life easier and safer for everyone concerned. You are not abdicating responsibility. Rather, you are trying to prove yourself as an adult. As your mother's condition worsens, being better prepared to deal with it will in itself offer some peace of mind. \nThere are many services available for families dealing with dementia. Some is dependent on where you live and your family's (your parents) financial situation. This can have a large bearing on what help they may qualify for. Not knowing these things, I can offer suggestions of help available where I live (US, state PA) but I am not sure if it will be applicable to your area. A few include:\nThe Dept. of Aging (by county) offers caregiver support, Alzheimer's Association includes care consultations, support groups, educational materials, etc., and mental health counseling for help in dealing with the stress and anxiety you are experiencing.\nYou indicate you have made some headway towards attaining a college degree. If so, you have accrued valuable credits. Talk to the school counselors and explain your situation. They may be able to offer resources and advice that can help you move forward.\nI don't know your family dynamics but the situation you face will surely strain them even further and likely cause a further breakdown. Someone has to be in charge and that may willingly or not be you. Doing your research and being knowledgeable and dependable will better position you within your family and earn their respect. Organize your life to best reflect your position as a caregiver as well as valuing your own hopes and dreams for your future. Believe me, you will be needed for a long time, even if you bring in outside help. But don't make that your entire identity. It is only part of who you are. I hope I have helped even a little and good luck to you. I wish you the very best.",

Please take a moment, even if it's just the two of you, to acknowledge your having made it through these past years successfully.  This next step isn't going to be easy, no matter how it goes down.  You may not be able to achieve all that you want in one step, especially since good facilities, even if you can find one, often have waiting lists. I'm in MN and have never heard of a place which could take and care for a pair of people with this level of difference in needs.  I'd start with finding a place for your mom, even temporarily, (maybe to a rehab facility) which will allow her the best quality of life for where she is now.   I understand that is hard to think about separating them, but it won't be easier for your brother to adjust when your mom suddenly passes, (assuming she goes first).  It will help him to have a new routine in place, and you and your sister will be better able to focus your energies productively to help each of them in these next years.  You don't have to think about this separation as permanent, but it is unrealistic, in my opinion, to insist on not moving until you have the \"right\" place.  There are many group homes for adults with Downs, and you can search online by county.  Once he is settled, you can start looking for a dementia group home or facility close to him for Mom.

It's even worse to move them after the parent has died, because they don't understand why mom/dad isn't there. It's a no-fun decision, but the down's syndrome kid needs to be moved to a home for that.\nI used to live in CA, now I live in WI, and I'll say that finding homes for elder care in WI is much, much easier than it was in SoCal. I live in Madison, and have relatives here in a elder care facility, and one in a place between here and Milwaukee. \nFinding a facility requires leg work. Your friend will have to find assisted living places in his/her area, see if they will take mom (maybe son?), visit and tour several, and make a decision. \nThere is a service called: A Place for Mom, but I found it unhelpful. \nAlso, regarding the down's syndrome man, do move him. Help him and the mom Skype. Maybe video record mom having a one way conversation with down syndrome man so he can watch it every day. \nGood luck.",

We put it on a lanyard and my Grandad wears it around his neck, then he won't remove it. You can also put it on a keyring and attach it to their keys if they're more likely to go wandering and take their keys but not wear a lanyard. Or a keyring and attach it to their wallet if they always seem to remember their wallet. We found by putting the lanyard on my Grandad part of the daily routine he got used to just having it on and forgot to take it off when he went wandering. \nWe liked this one because it was easy to set up, has no monthly charges or hidden fees and works like a mobile phone so we can reach him as long as he is somewhere with signal. \nYou can customise it to do loads of different stuff for you but this is the sort of stuff it can do. \n\n\nIf they press the large silver SOS button in the middle it will call and/or text their first emergency contact. The text will say 'Help me' and will provide their co-ordinates and also a direct Google maps link to their location. The call will ring through and if you answer it, you can talk to them like a normal phone even though they aren't pressing the silver button anymore. If the first contact doesn't answer, then it rings the second emergency contact. If the second doesn't answer it rings the third. As it's set like a mobile phone it always rings from the same number so I always know it's my grandad calling so to answer that call. Even if he has the tracker round his neck, or in his lap, the microphone is really clear too. \n\n\nThe GPS co ordinations have been super accurate so far. \n\n\nIt does need charging most nights but we just charge it when he's asleep and put it on him in the morning. \n\n\nWe can top it up easily online using debit card, there's no hidden charges. \n\n\nIt has fall detection, so if it detects a fall it will call the emergency contacts automatically without him needing to press the SOS button (this can be disabled) \n\n\nYou can set it so that if the tracker goes outside of certain locations it alerts the emergency contacts via call or text so you know the person with the tracker has gone wandering \n\n\nIt is small and discreet for him \n\n\nIf we call the number of the tracker it answers automatically (he doesn't have to press anything) and we can chat with him, and check he's ok, at no cost at all. This is the best thing. \n\n",

I have a hard enough time tracking my medications, thankfully now every four hours for Sinement due to DBS, but other meds are every six hours (I can eat those with foods), but tracking water is a challenge.  Bottled water is expensive, so I like your idea of the jug of water but still hard to keep track to remember to fill that.  \nMy wife often will ask what I had for lunch. Somedays I just get sidetracked and forget to eat.\nIn a way having a scale that automatically measures the weight of the jug would help in tracking and reminding him to have a glass of water.   Our Parkinson's workout coach always reminds us \"1 oz for every two pounds of body weight\".  I'm at 240# at 6'3\" but 120z of water just seems too much. Yet I can drink four 22 oz bottle of water without much thought.\nOh, Parkinson's also plays havoc on our bladder.  Both loss of control, and not being able to empty it.  I've learned it is easy to empty more of my bladder sitting down than standing, but that takes time!  Other times my bladder lets loose without warning, yes there are Pads for that, but my not drinking water before running errands or long drives, less of an issue.   I realize not good.  ",

I see you around a lot and know your username well enough, so it's always nice to hear what you have to say, so I appreciate you taking the time. \nCognitive issues are certainly a (major) part of the problem here, and memory as well. He's been through DBS surgeries and recovering from the final one for the second side. Prior to DBS surgery he needed a neuropsych evaluation and was diagnosed with mild cognitive dysfunction. So it definitely is a factor and we are aware of it, but it is difficult. But the worst is that he becomes very stubborn and refuses to accept some things, even if they are right in front of him. This may also be a result of the cognitive issues, but the tendency towards stubbornness makes all of our lives more difficult and is something we are slowly trying to work on. Though it's hard to know exactly how to work on it, sometimes.\nWe've taken steps in order to combat that, such as leaving simple instructions, notes, to-do lists, etc. The water jug is ~2 quart (~64 fl.oz.) pitcher which we use and keep on the kitchen counter so that it's always in view when he's around the house and eating, and he can see how he's managing his water. We just fill it every night and record how much is left - no worry about keeping it filled, if he needs more beyond 64 fl.oz. then he can drink from the brita or bottled water, or whatever he chooses. It's mostly just to get him over that minimum goal and keep him aware of it.\nThere's also a chart on the fridge to show how much water (from the juge/pitcher) he's drank (drunk?) during the week, and in larger letters at the top it reads, \"/u/half-wizard's father's Water Progress: at least 2 quarts/day\" where we record how much water he's had over the week. We also have \"drink more water\" on his Daily Routine / To-Do List, and we often remind him.\nBut for example, as of 1pm my time today, he'd drunk less than 10fl.oz. of liquid, so I told him that he should work on drinking more water, to which he replied, \"I've been drinking lots of water.\" I then turned to the counter beside me and pointed at the almost-full jug of water, to which he then replied similarly, \"Well, I've had a lot of water.\" Well, no, he hadn't, and it was plain to see, but he wouldn't accept it and kind of brushed off my request to drink more.\nAnd I think that's the heart of the problem, and the bulk of the trouble. We're trying to deal with it, but it can be difficult. Hence why I turned here. I certainly appreciate your insight.\n> My wife often will ask what I had for lunch. Somedays I just get sidetracked and forget to eat.\nTo be fair, I do that often enough, myself! lol :-x So I can hold that one against him. \nGenerally, for him though, it's rarely that he forgets to eat, but more often that he focuses on eating lots of carbs. We've taken steps to address that as well (reminders, ease of access of pre-made foods that aren't carbs, etc.), but the \"stubbornness\" / cognitive issues does trip us up.\n>  I've learned it is easy to empty more of my bladder sitting down than standing, but that takes time!\nDefinitely. I read that somewhere, maybe from another post you'd made, or someone else or somewhere else. But we've been encouraging him to sit more, which can be helpful, but he doesn't always remember.\nIn general, though, the days he drinks more water are the days he tends to have the least amount of trouble urinating.",

When I've spoken to their doctors about similar issues they've told me, generally speaking, that as long as they know the consequences of disregarding the restrictions -and in my grandmothers case usually refusing to eat anything healthy- then leave them to it. \nYou can also try Gatorade or similar if he is not responding to water. Ensure and other nutritional drinks could be an option as well. My grandfather is on a strict water intake but he gets incredibly bored with plain water. Adding in some fruit juice/tea/gatorade or other flavoring helps it become palatable. \nCould it also be he just doesn't think about taking a drink? He may not feel thirsty so he just doesn't think of it? Maybe set a timer to remind him to take a drink a few times an hour or if someone is home with him bring him a smaller cup (8 oz or less) of water a couple times an hour and have him take a drink then. Possibly bring him a few grapes or a small piece watermelon or other fruit at the same time and try to encourage him to take a bite or two. You'll get a little more nutrition and fluid into him and may also help encourage thirst. \nYou are right that you can't force feed him but if you feel that he isn't mentally sound to make these decisions for himself speak with his physicians directly, they may suggest a feeding tube if he is fairly (of his own accord) malnourished. To that end, pointing out to my grandmother that a feeding tube might be necessary if she won't eat something healthy each day does help. It's not mean or a threat it's just a reminder of the reality of the situation. We've only had to remind her a few times but if there are memory issues you are dealing with it may have to be a frequent conversation. \nAside from all of that, take a breath. You are doing all that you can do. It's extremely difficult taking care of an adult who has their own ideas about what is right/enough and add in any memory issues or extreme stubbornness and it can all feel impossible. Remind yourself- as much as you remind him to drink water and eat right- that you are doing the best you can and that is all you can do. \n<3 ",

        "text": "\"Food fights\" were among the most heated and frustrating when I provided caregiving for my father.  The first few years we were caring for him we were actively trying to keep him healthy and avoid suffering.  The stubborn insistence on dietary and fluid control made sense to me, his caregiver.  What was I doing if I just facilitated or tolerated insufficient or indulgent food & drink choices?  Caregiving is always an emotional roller coaster where regular rules don't apply.  A patient may be dealing with something they don't want to share with you...urinating may be getting increasingly difficult...so they choose not to hydrate.  They may find it humiliating and exhausting they are being micromanaged by their child.  This is a critical juncture where their remaining autonomy is important.  Yes, their choices may backfire on them and even cause you more work and suffering.  Perfection is the enemy of the good.  Don't aim too high.  Find accommodations where you can.   Bless you for caring so much, and for wading through the turbulent waters of caregiving for one's own parent.  Role reversal is one of the trickiest components of it.  I often used this thought to calm myself.  \"Would I be mad at a toddler for not eating their veggies and drinking their milk?\"  No, just concerned.  I would also work to find creative ways to get the desired result.",

More slurred, or softer or lower or raspy or mumbled?  He might be losing control of his throat muscles.  That affects speech but also how we swallow.  Could be he is slightly choking when he swallows water, so he tries to avoid it.  If you see any of those signs, take him to a speech therapist who can retrain those muscles to work together.\nIs your Dad still able to use the toilet on his own?  Some people avoid drinking water if they're afraid they won't make it to the toilet in time.\nHe might just not be able to remember to drink water or eat the right foods.  But rather than admitting it, he says stuff like \"I thought we were done with that.\"\nAnother possibility is that Parkinson's plays with the autonomic systems, so he might not be feeling thirsty or hungry, even if he is.\nTalk to his doctor.  Maybe he needs a caregiver to come in and be with him while you're at work, to make sure he's getting nutrients.\nAnother thought--if he's topped up on meds before he eats, then he might eat more because he feels like it's easier to move.\nDoes he like soup?  That's an easy way to get veggies and water in at the same time.  Ensure tastes good and is water and protein together--another benefit is that it's very easy to drink so it doesn't take much energy.\nAre you aware of the interactions between protein and l-dopa medications?\nhttp://www.livewellwithparkinsons.com/index.php/strategies-for-living-well/protein-ldopa",

        "text": "Goodness that\u2019s a lot to handle at 22, and your family certainly seems to have a lot going on as well. \nSo here are my thoughts and hopefully other people will be even more helpful. First, you don\u2019t know your dad has Alzheimer\u2019s. He could have any number of cognitive issues, particularly one triggered by alcoholism. Second, even if he does have early onset Alzheimer\u2019s  it doesn\u2019t mean you have a genetic risk for it. Sometimes terrible things just happen.  \nThe question of a genetic test is one many people struggle with. So I can only answer for myself. Personally, if I took a genetic test and it showed a genetic predisposition I would try to use that information to do all the things that have been shown to forestall the disease like cutting out sugar and taking up a second language (for instance).  \nIn terms of your family, I think a good first step would be to contact the local chapter of the Alzheimer\u2019s association. You can call the 24 hour helpline at https://www.alz.org/ and they can put you in contact. One of the nice things is you can meet to talk to a social worker and they can lay out some possibilities. After that you\u2019ll want to talk to an attorney to create a financial plan and get documents in order. You\u2019ll have a much better idea of where you stand after that. Hopefully, you can work out a plan where this will not become your full burden and responsibility.",

        "text": "The genetic component of early onset Alzheimer's is really misunderstood. If your dad doesn't have a first degree relative with early onset Alzheimer's, then his case is unlikely to be of the familial type (at least, one of the currently identified familial types). It could be some sporadic type, or associated with a gene not yet identified, or alcohol related, or who knows what. \nThat said, diagnosing Alzheimer's based off of one MOCA assessment would be pretty difficult to do. Hopefully the doctors did a lot more testing than that, because there are other, more likely causes of early onset dementia besides Alzheimer's. In my mother's case, she had repeated neuropsychologist testing over a couple of years, several MRIs, and finally a PET scan (which pointed toward Alzheimer's and pointed away from frontotemporal dementia). \nMy mom's case sounds a lot like your dad's. Early onset (though she was in her 40's), history of alcohol use, fired from her long-time job, then problems trying to keep a job after that, several minor car accidents, etc. She's now 59, in the late stages of the disease and in a nursing home. It's bleak.\nI'm lucky to have worked for years in dementia research, with some of the leading researchers in the country. I had the opportunity to talk in-depth with a genetic counselor within our neurology department to discussed genetic testing. Because my mom's Alzheimer's is not likely to be familial (she has no first degree relatives with early onset Alzheimer's), genetic testing would not offer me much. \nVery simply, testing \"positive\" for the APOE allele associated with Alzheimer's doesn't mean I will get Alzheimer's, and testing \"negative\" doesn't mean I won't get the disease. Unless your family carries one of the few rare identified familial genes for EFAD, genetic testing won't help you sleep better at night either way. And if your family carried one of those genes, you'd probably know about several relatives who had early onset symptoms. \nIn the end, for other reasons I did the 23andme ancestry & health testing, which actually does tell you your APOE status. However, I'd recommend speaking to a genetic counselor or at least reading a LOT about what that means before looking into that option, because it's definitely not a test that will tell you if you will get the disease or not. \nSorry, that was really long and rambling, but I felt compelled to respond because your situation sounds a lot like mine. I am my mom's only family to speak of, and have arranged all of her medical care, tests, financial stuff, and care for the last ~10 years. Please let me know if I can help to answer any questions about all of this. For now, maybe start with:\n\nHelp your father apply for disability. This may require more extensive testing to prove he is disabled, but those tests will be helpful anyway.\nHave you dad assign power of attorney and fill out advanced directives for his health care wishes.\nConsider asking his doctor to evaluate if he is still safe to drive. If he's had 4-6 accidents, he's probably not safe.\nThorough neuropsych evaluation (way beyond a MOCA)- this will help to measure your dad's progress/decline over time, will speak to his ability to drive safely, and may help him build a case for disability.\n",

        "text": "The best initial advice I can give you is don't panic. Alzheimer's takes a long time to progress. Also, take care of yourself and finish your transition. You can't take care of anyone without first taking care of yourself.\nYou make a great living at 22. I have a similar income and I'm also the sole breadwinner. My mother started having symptoms around 58 with a similar downward spiral. She's now 64 almost 65 and lives with me full time, and isn't able to do much on her own.\nIt's best to start looking into your options now. Find your local chapter for Area Agency for Aging and Disability, they are the gatekeepers for many of the assistance programs. Also after the testing is complete, get as much documentation together from doctors, former employers, and start a claim for SSD/SSI. Early On-Set Alzheimer's qualifies for a compassionate allowance from the SSA and can be processed more quickly, but don't be surprised by a denial. SSD will can get him Mediciad and Calif9rnia has expanded those services. Your brother would also qualify as a dependent for support in that situation. Your mom likely needs to look for work if she isn't already. You shouldn't be expected to bear the burden alone. \nMost neurologists will likely take your dad off the meds and place him on a Keto diet to see if there is contributing factors from either source, but only if it is ALZ. The best way to confirm is an MRI and Spinal Fluid analysis.\nCheck with your employer about assistance for legal fees and caregiver relief options. Most of the tech companies in your area do that. Also see if there is a legal aid society to help with any financial issues, forgiveness processes on debts. \nThis will likely dent your plans for your startup, but it doesn't have to be a life sentence. Keep your head up and take it a day at a time. ",

        "text": "It's incredibly frustrating,  but there won't be any easy answers.  A lot of this will depend on evaluations over time and determining the extent of changes in his cognitive abilities as well as MRI results.  I'm more familiar with frontal temporal dementia and the genetic implications.  My mother passed away from this.  If she carried the genetic marker, I would have had a 25% likelihood of developing it too. The  neuropsychiatrist took a blood sample from my mom to see if the gene was even there.  However, I chose to have him throw out the sample and cancel the test and not know.  It would have been too easy to label any odd behavior as an indication that I might be developing it.  Even without the genetic testing,  I'm still anxious a lot of the time.  I think you just need to prepare for the future and this would be true  regardless.  If dementia doesn't get you,  there are multiple other diseases that might.  There are no guarantees in life.  \nAs far as your Dad is concerned,  I agree that you need to get some things in place - a financial and a medical POA,   a plan for the future.  Do talk to your local Alzheimer's organization.  They have many resources.  If your Dad is eligible for VA benefits,  check that out now.  It can take months to get them started.  Make sure you're talking to the right kind of doctor(s) and that they are the type of people who will patiently answer your questions.  Get those meds evaluated.  That just sounds like a lot of stuff and I agree... those would cognitively impair anybody. \nFinally, live your life.  If this is dementia, you can't change the outcome.  It is very easy to take on so much responsibility,  you sacrifice your own needs and wants.  Your family should sit down as a group and collaborate.  I know you're worried about the implications. There are counselors who work with adult children of dementia sufferers,  frequently licensed counseling social workers.  I started working with one several months ago and its helped me clarify a lot and make decisions based on what was in my best interests.\nWhatever you learn,  good luck.  You sound like a very competent,  caring individual.  Its unfair of life to saddle you with so much to worry about at your age.  Just remember,  you can't take care of anybody else unless you're  ok.  So don't forget to take care of yourself,  too.",

They didn't have \"booths\" so much as little tables with privacy guards on them, but they showed us to one that was far away from everyone else. I talked my mom through her voting, while being very careful not to indicate a preference. Many local races she said \"I don't know.\" She did, as it turns out, have a very strong opinion on who she wanted for president (Same candidate in both primary and general) and one of the local legislative candidates was someone she'd taught in Sunday School so she was pretty adamant about that. I filled her ballot in for her.\n&#x200B;\nThis year .... no. She can't do it -- even by absentee she lacks the ability to indicate a valid preference, and she was never uber-partisan so we couldn't even predict who she might vote for if she could understand it.

You need to have a frank discussion with your mom. Tell her the situation isn't working, and you and your wife need your own space, either that or she has to allow her space to be your space.

They don't need my rent so I can swing by a few times a week and do meal prep for them, take mom shopping, and clean. You could move out and give your mom some sort of allowance, but realistically if it's going to be just her, then she needs to find an appropriately sized/priced home or deal with the risks of roommates.\nLife is tough all the way through mommy.

Nature intends for baby birds to leave the nest, so do so.\nOptions for your mom include a 55+ apartment where the average age is about 70 so she'll have lots of socializing she can do. No, it may not be what she wants, but, right now, it's not what you want, so you figure out what really matters. BTW, your wife might ask you to choose between her and your mom, and you better know what you want!\nUnfortunately, we often have to let things fall apart for our elderly parents before they realize they can't keep living like they used to. The generation over 70 never really had to care for their aging parents because back then, people died mostly before they were 80. So, the over 70 generation thinks they'll die still owning their home, and their death will take a few weeks at most.\nRead Atul Gawande's Being Mortal if you haven't already. Wise knowledge is you don't move in with your parents, nor have them move in with you.\nHow it will unfold with your mom is she might get some tenants after you leave, and they'll make her miserable (be sure the tenants sign a lease because evictions take months even with a lease, longer if without - search r/legaladvice for more on that). After the tenant fiasco, she'll have some other crisis (health, bank repossessing the home, etc) that will force her to move. It's much better if she can decide on her own to move before that happens, so be sure to inform her of her future before it falls apart. The over-70 crowd in general doesn't believe they are over 50, and live in denial that things are changing.\nSource: Read some of my replies here an here, this isn't my first rodeo, and the one I'm in now is ongoing. \nedit: typos , and will ad, in 2018 and beyond, I'd say you have an obligation to help her stay safe with food, clothing, shelter, and medicine, but you don't have to pay for a level of living that isn't financially tenable (if she's living beyond her means, she needs to change how she's living, send her to r/PersonalFinance for that). She is still responsible for how she manages her possessions (her home) and if she screws it up, then she screws it up. If you've warned her, that's, sadly, often all you can do.

        "text": "I think the narcissistic behavior should be mentioned more when speaking about symptoms of dementia, especially the FTD. In our case, my father is a retired neurosurgeon so he had that element of arrogance (you want confidence in a surgeon!) But note try telling him he has dementia. Here's a brain surgeon!  He knows better.\n My poor mother's health rapidly declined in her final two years and she passed away at age 71 the year. Everyday there was something about his health that had to be addressed. To be fair he's got severe arthritis and has had almost 10 surgeries for ankles, neck, back and replacement hips.\nBut he also is very OCD and knows so much that the slightest sniffle had to be addressed immediately.  Calling and bugging his doctor friends got ridiculous and embarrassing. \nMy sisters blame my father for my mother's death bc he was so selfish. Mom couldn't leave him alone for the last two years of her life. She did tell me before she died that she felt guilty bc she didn't recognize the dementia earlier. We thought he was at just being a selfish asshole. \nHe wasted a lot of his savings, but we are still able to afford in home care. For now. His dementia seems to be slowly progressing and his family lived well into their 80's. I can't even fathom trying to address moving him into a home eventually, but we are lucky that a memory care assisted living center is being built close to his home. \nHe's gotten sweeter in the last few years, but still doesn't get that he has it and occasionally tries to override decisions bc he's a doctor. \nWe recently had to put vitamin C's in an accessible cupboard for him that resemble his pain pills bc he was insistent that he could self medicate. He goes to that cabinet at least ten times a day. The doctor says it just goes straight through him and is luckily safe. That was a very difficult aspect of his care bc he'd forget we'd given it to him and argue about it. \nI'm actually surprised at how much he has willingly given up. Driving for at least four years. Still had to hide car keys though bc he'd try and sneak off to the liquor store, but other than that, he's dialed back a bit on the narcissism. \nIt should've been a huge flag to us though. \nI hope you reach out to his friends.  We've found that people will come and take him to movies or out for meals when we contact them and it makes him so happy.  Even friends he hadn't been close to before this all started. \nGood luck and check back here occasionally. It's not a hugely busy sub but there is support here and some good ideas for care.\nStay strong. I wish you well. ",

I actually have a decent amount of experience, training and knowledge working with dementia and Alzheimer's patients but hadn't heard of FTD until I started with this patient. This by far has been one of the most gutwrenching, devestating jobs I've ever had and I have a lot of patience for people especially with neurological diseases. But this is an entirely different beast. I've told my friends and family many times, this disease just keeps finding new ways to break my heart.\nMy boss (his 44 year old son) and I have literally just sat and cried so many times before (tearing up thinking about that). He's somewhat in a similar position as you. Very little family input so all of the responsibility, including taking over his father's business, falls on his shoulders.  He actually does have an older brother but he lives almost 4 hours away and it seems \"can't be bothered to help.\" I won't go into a tangent that I could about him.\nAnyway, not sure I have a lot of advice. But I would preach self-care for sure. As caregivers that is shoved down our throats because there is a HUGE chance of burnout. Enlist help, if not from family, then see what his insurance covers. Look into respite care.  There's actually a lot of resources and support out there. And I'm happy to talk and help if possible. Hang in there. ",

        "text": "You need help. You are in a situation that you can't handle alone. \nMy Mom (94) began showing signs of dementia at age 85. She is in her final stages of dementia. She is currently in the memory care unit at a nursing home. She is receiving excellent care there. She is no longer lucid, and is unable to care for herself at all. \nHere are some things that worked for my sister and me. I encourage you to do likewise: \n1) I contacted a local Alzheimer's support group. I went to several meetings and found out about local resources for help. \n2) I went to a nursing home with a memory facility, and spoke to some nurses there. They helped me and informed me of resources available for help. \n3) My sister and I drew up all of the legal documents for my mom that are needed for eldercare and end-of-life situations. In my state (Texas), there are five or six:  \n\n\na will, listing my sister and me as co-executors\n\n\na legal power of attorney, allowing us to make legal decisions on Mom's behalf; \n\n\na medical power of attorney, allowing us to make medical decisions on Mom's behalf; \n\n\na HIPPA form, allowing doctors to inform us as to Mom's medical condition and test results; \n\n\na do-not-resuscitate form (DNR, also called Physician's directive), informing medical  personnel what to do in case Mom cannot be resuscitated; \n\n\nAdditionally, there is a \"Guardianship in case of incapacitation\" form, which makes the children legally responsible for the elderly parent. We decided not to execute this document, because it would make us responsible for all Mom's actions, such as, if she had an accident and hurt someone, we could be held liable. We decided that the Power of Attorney and Medical Power of Attorney gave us the authority that we need, so we decided not to do the guardianship form. It seemed that the downside outweighed any advantages.\nWe had all these documents drawn up by a lawyer, and we met with a mobile notary and had Mom sign them all, while she still had cognitive ability to do so. \nEnsure that you have multiple signed, notary-stamped originals of all documents. We executed 3 signed copies of each form. Some government agencies will not accept photocopies, they require an original document. \n4) During all of our searching for financial aid and resources, we found that there was a special program available to the elderly surviving veterans and spouses. My father was in WWII for three months, but that qualified my Mom for $1,100 / month assistance benefit. I applied for it and was turned down. Then I found a specialist in applying for military aid, and he reworded my application and re-submitted it and it was approved. \nThis is the beauty of networking with support groups and nursing homes. They can help discover assistance programs that you never knew about. \n5) We became co-signers on Mom's bank accounts. This has helped in handling her financial matters. We also tracked down all of her insurance and other accounts, and ensured that her Medicare supplemental was adequate and up-to-date. We found all of her bank accounts, and consolidated it all to one account. \n6) Do not give your father any money. If you do, then the money you give him may be determined to be \"income,\" and he may be turned down for charity or assistance later on because of the \"income\" you have given him. He needs to completely deplete his own financial resources, then apply for charity or assistance, then, after that, if money is still needed, you can help him out. \n7) In the earlier stages of her decline, we hired a home senior care person to come in and sit with Mom several hours a day, and to cook meals for her at her home (www.homeinstead.com). They were wonderful. Eventually Mom declined to a point that she needed 24/7 care, so we put her into the nursing home. \nIf your father is already showing substantial decline at age 63, you might look into both Social Security Retirement benefits and also Social Security disability benefits. \nHope this helps!

I also can\u2019t really tell if she has Alzheimer\u2019s with frontal symptoms or straight out FTD because she does have all the behavioral stuff that goes with FTD. The neurologist doesn\u2019t know either. I\u2019m just going with FTD because it makes the most sense. Anyway, the best bit of advice I can give you as someone who is similarly situated is that you need to hire help. I had a real struggle to get my mom to accept a \u201chousekeeper,\u201d but ultimately it has been a lifesaver because I\u2019m not responsible for every detail of her dysfunctional life and she can still live with my dad at home. I did take away her car. Like your dad, she was basically a safe driver. But I felt that her lack of ability to plan or deal with changes and her impulsiveness could set her up for becoming flustered in an unexpected situation. You\u2019ll know hopefully when the right time to take the car away is. Feel free to DM me anytime. This is a really hard thing to cope with.",

I too am a business owner and operator of a consultant group and  work with a few companies in leadership roles. However  I am not married but do have a LTR with no children. I too am my fathers only relative who can manage and care for his affairs.  I am currently in the process of gaining guardianship, which has been difficult due to my fathers reluctance and non-acceptance of his failing state.\nI just want you to know you are not alone, and that people like you and I are forced into this position and in many ways can have closure for the ways our fathers behavior may have impacted us. What i use to think was narcissism was really just early stages of degeneration. What i use to think was embarrassing shameful behavior was just an early sign of devolution. In some ways, although this feels like the worst time of my life (business is not doing to well and financially insecure), in many ways i feel the most sense of relief.  My only worry now is that my father is safe, i can manage his affairs, I can maintain my relationship and stay a float financially. On top of this I am calculating how I can try and prevent or stall this disease from consuming me, if it does.\nAnyways, if you ever want to be a pen pal, i'm here. Good luck with everything.

And it's hard caring for a loved one who then lashes out randomly. It stops you seeing him as him but rather as this person with dementia, it will make it harder for people to cherish the memories they have of him before his dementia. \nMedication can sometimes help to keep people settled, possibly look into that? \nDistraction can sometimes work, a cup of tea, watching a nice film, getting out photo albums but sometimes it doesn't. What works one day to help calm him possibly won't work the next day. Dementia is a day by day learning curve as I'm sure you know! \nObviously you want to stick to your grandmas wishes, but by putting him in a home doesn't mean you're not looking after him. You want to look after him, but is it in yours and his best interests? You can still visit, where I work families are allowed to decorate the rooms, bring in old furniture. \nThreats of murder and suicide are common with dementia but are also still to be taken seriously. \nThinking of you and your family, this is such a hard situation to be in.

She always hated photos (of herself) but I think she might not remember that any more.  We have got a whiteboard for the carers and us to write on - we were hoping that she could read it to understand what is happening each day but sadly her concept of time is shot and reading comprehension is low.  Still, its a good call to bring that too.",

My husband and BIL called me to come over and help as she was being stubborn and argumentative and even violent in her resistance. When I got there she was covered in her own excrement, wearing her underwear, and yelling/screaming/punching back at her boys. I redirected her via distraction. I got her dressed and into the car and by then she'd completely forgotten where we were going, or so it seemed. As we drove she suddenly got it in her head we were taking her out for lunch. (We did not tell her we were taking her to lunch). She got all excited about it and chattered away for the 30 minute drive. \nWe got to the home and she still thought we were going there for lunch and she was still upbeat. Hubby went in ahead to let them know we were there (weren't sure we were at the right building) leaving me with MIL in the car for a few minutes. \nIt was at that time that MIL got completely lucid, and told me that she knew this was the memory care unit. And she told me, \"Please, I am going to object, fight, yell scream.... but don't let the boys falter. I know I need to be here. It's become really scary to be at home alone. My memory is just not that good anymore.\" She made me promise over and over again. \nThen hubby came back, and we got her out of the car, and by the time we entered the unit, she wasn't lucid and yes she fought, yelled, screamed. \nBut I kept my word. The brothers didn't believe me but it really did happen. \nShe wound up in that home for about 5 years, we visited her frequently, until she passed from cancer. Before the cancer she was safe, sound, healthy and well cared for, beyond what we could provide. \nI should also add she had a dog she loved. That winter before admittance, her memory was so bad, she let the dog out to pee in a snowstorm. The dog was found days later frozen to death. That was one of the turning points when we realized it was time. In later years she didn't remember her beloved dog at all, even though we shared pictures. ",

Might try to tell him the house is getting worked on and he has to stay there for awhile. It's going to be a shitshow and we all know that won't go over well. We're also going to tell him he works there and has to help out, as he's always loved being helpful and maybe that'll be something he'd accept. \nHe won't be able to just up and leave when he gets upset. Doors to the outside are kept locked. The way the place wants us to do it is to drop him off and just let them do their thing. We're not supposed to come back to visit for at least 10 days. It's a really nice($10k/month..) place so they have a lot of good methods to help people adapt(as well as possible) to the new living situation.

My sister is my mother's Health Care Proxy and she handles all the details of my mother's health with various doctors. If your mother is willing to go to an elder lawyer and sign these documents, it will help you tremendously. Use an elder law specialist.\nMy mother lives in an assisted living complex that also has independent living, which is what she thinks she is. Technically this is correct, as we are not paying extra for nursing assistance because my sister is able to attend to her once a week and prepare pill boxes and test blood. The city she lives in has limited nursing homes, which is where she will go if her physical limitations overtook the abilities of the nurses at the complex. There is also a special memory care unit where dementia patients are separated, but again if their physical needs went over a certain level they would be asked to leave to a nursing home.\nWhat I'm saying is that your mom's living situation will depend on what's available in her location. You will have to research what is local and how they work, what they cost, etc. Be careful what you sign in terms of guaranteeing payment. I signed one for my mother as POA for paying the assisted living place with her money, but won't sign one for a nursing home which I know will require filing for Medicaid once her money is spent down. I don't want to guarantee personally paying $13,000/month at a nursing home!\nFirst, though, she will need a nursing evaluation to determine her level of care needs, which I assume she has since she qualifies for home services. It probably needs to be updated. Can you replace the bad help?  Can you hire a nurse to come once a week and fill a pill box that separates pills into am/pm? If her level of care is requiring more then she might qualify for more help.\nThe easiest way to keep up with her doctor appointments is for you or your sister to take control. Speak to her doctors and get the necessary forms signed by your mom, hire elderly transport services for her appointments and remind her a lot!\nAt some point, we all have to go against our parents wishes to remain independent when it becomes clear they are a danger to themselves and/or others. I've had to do it with my dad and the time is coming when I will have to again for my mom. It's hard but ultimately it's the most loving thing to do.\nEdit: the article in the first paragraph pertains to Orange County, CA",

Paratransit operations that I know of have door-to-door service, wheelchair accessible vehicles among other things. \n\n\nInsurance. Its great that your in-laws have good insurance, but is it possible for her to get her own?

For things like the pulse-ox alarm, try requesting medical equipment or supplies through one of the home health aides or workers. As much as I hate to say it, sometimes those companies are more 'financially motivated' to help you.  You might also broach the topic of a 'sitter' through either the home health nurse or directly through your mom's insurance (if she has it).

You need to know it will not be your fault if your mom dies. She clearly has multiple, serious health issues and no matter what you do, she will die at some point. Does she have a medical POA and/or a DNR? Do you know what her wishes are?  Is she happy?

With dialysis and such a low room-air (unassisted) oxygen level, I, like some of the others here, am surprised hospice hasn't been mentioned yet. I can say that the amount of care and the quality of care definitely improve at that level, although in at least one situation I had to fire a hospice company and hire another - the difference between them being like night and day.  \nBut her removing the oxygen cannula at night - is it discomfort? Or dementia? Or are you not sure?  There are pads that can go over the ears to make the tubing more comfortable there, I think usually supplied by the oxygen supplier? There is a way (can probably be found online) of draping the tubing in the back instead of the front.  I've read that wrapping soft medical tape around the tubing on the face can help. For any dryness (which is always a big gripe), you can use KY (or any water based lubricant) in the nose and beeswax on the lips.  A lot of people suggest putting mittens on the person's hands, even taping them at the wrists. I've seen this work but, in my case, with a family member who had dementia, it just drove her crazy and made things worse. We finally just  decided if she removed the oxygen and something.....happened as a result, it was meant to be that way.  That sounds callous, but it was in fact a very emotional, heart-rending decision. \nTo be honest, I'm amazed that someone with oxygen in the 60s, even when sleeping and on room air (ie, unassisted) is not in the hospital.  \nI pray you find a way to get some good sleep, as it is vitally important to your well-being while living in such a stressful situation.

        "text": "You have my sympathy - I have been going through similar things for the past 5 years or so. Fortunately my sister and I are tag teaming everything because it is a LOT of work.\nI have to say that it sounds like your moms showing signs of some type of cognitive decline or dementia. That she is worried is what you need to respect about her the most. Dementia is a brain disease that can affect spacial relations (driving and particularly parking), memory, and reasoning (buying extra stuff, no longer being able to organize, not having the attention span to go through the mail, etc).\nIf your mom is amenable, make a list of things that concern her and accompany her to her primary care if she has one. If not, you can make a list of your own and email it to the doctor prior to her appointment. She will likely go through a short cognitive test and if needed will be referred to a neurologist for more in-depth testing. There are medications that can somewhat improve conditions and slow the decline and they work better in the earlier stages of dementia, different medications for different types of cognitive issues, so it's important to get a good diagnosis. Our personal experience is that it takes months to get on their schedule so start now.\nThere are other possible causes of these symptoms too but only professionals could diagnose so please take her symptoms seriously, especially because any anxiety she has will only make them worse.\nIf it is a dementia, most are very slow moving fortunately. It is a whole world that you have to learn about to navigate, and if so I would suggest seeing an Elder Law Attorney (certified) to help your parents plan ahead while your mom can participate. Planning for the end game is dreary, but you have to do it to protect your father if he outlives your mom, and provide the best possible care for your mom if the other way around. There are lots of options for getting care in the home, adult day cares, etc. so nursing homes are only at the very end if at all, and you want to make sure they have a cash flow for care without spending everything, especially if Medicaid is involved.\nAnd \"The Car Keys\" - the bain of all children taking care of older parents! There is no good time and no good way to take them away. It's a final admission of no longer being independent and it's so hard.\nI would focus on getting her a good diagnosis first and other things will fall into place. And please, remember to practice self care. Helping your older parents can and has given many caregivers health problems of their own. There are tons of closed support groups on facebook too!  Good luck!",

If she can get comfortable with it now, then she won't feel as helpless when the time comes for her keys to be put aside.  \nYou need to take care of yourself, too. 2x per day is a lot for you to be at their house. If you can get it down to once per day, then they can call you in the morning so that you can help them in the afternoon, or they can call you in the afternoon so you know exactly what they need help with the next morning - you'd still be checking on them 2x per day, but not in person.  \nThen, you might be able to work on their house during your daily visits. One massive push for organization is intimidating and massive - so instead, look at one corner of one room. Decide what needs to happen, talk to them about it in your daily phone call so it isn't a big surprise or upheaval. It's a small thing, it's manageable. Every room might have 4 to 8 sections that need to be looked at - but that's a few months of smaller projects. Not a single enormous chunk of time that is impossible to find.  \nGet on their HIPAA forms at their dr's offices. If her memory is slipping and she doesn't want to talk to you - you can't trust her to remember her prognoses or diagnoses and communicate them to you or your Dad accurately. You'll need to get it directly from the Dr. You might not be able to make it to the appointments, but you can get on the forms to get the information for yourself.  \nGive her a GPS necklace, maybe one of the ones that has the button she can use to call for help - directed to your phone. Then you don't have to rely on her being near her car to be able to find her. Your Dad can have a bracelet or something in his wallet.  \nDo they have a neighbor that you can trust to check on them if you're unable to make it over to their house? Next door or down the street?\nDo they have a neighbor with a kid who could be paid to come over and do simple chores - like helping move small furniture out of the house, or mowing the lawn, or changing a lightbulb, or even driving somewhere? It isn't only you - there are other people in the world.  \nAnd finally - have my sympathies. I am in something of the same situation as you, except it's my in-laws. And they live 3 hours away. I think we finally have an interim living situation so we can get their house sold, but just cleaning out their 10K square foot, ex-marina, stuffed house with a 3K sq foot carport, and multiple vehicles and boats on the property that aren't in running condition - it's stressful just to consider. I could probably get some anti-anxiety meds for the heart palpitations I swear start up any time I think about it.  ",

It really doesn't matter what the purpose is: it could be an important job, singing at religious services, crocheting hats for infants. Whatever makes them feel valued and purposeful is healthy.\nYou mom obviously places a huge importance on her job and has worked physical jobs using her hands. Working is best for her. What types of jobs do you think are available for someone who is 70? How many 70 year olds are working in your company or your siblings companies? You have a big chip about Walmart, but they employ many older people when others will not.\nShe went through an interview and they saw her ability level. I am guessing they have a balance between younger people doing the heavier lifting and older people setting up displays. But if the job turns out to be too much for her, then she will either leave or let go and that will be a learning experience she has to absorb to plan her next move. If she can't drive at night then she loses the job. If she can't concentrate and put things together then she loses the job. If you truly feel like she is in danger of physically hurting herself then you should go watch the orientation and see how the labor is split and get a manager contact.\nIt would be nice if you and your sister were supportive of her trying to navigate getting older instead of telling her what she should feel like at her age. My sister and I had to learn that - what we think is right for them is just our thoughts, they are actually living being older and we can only guess what that is like. We have had to move my mother from Assisted Living to an Apartment only to move her back 3 months later in order for her to finally settle in her mind she isn't independent any more. It's tough.\nIf you think she is having some cognitive decline then its a good thing for her to face reality. It's also a good thing your sister is moving in because she can help steer things in the right direction. If this job is beyond her then maybe she can find meaning in another way, otherwise she will stress over this and actually worsen her symptoms.",

Like she said she worked at a textbook company in Knoxville 15 years ago the other night at dinner in front of extended family. This company is in New Jersey and she worked there well over 25years ago. We  corrected here but she stubbornly refused we were right until a couple minutes later. This has been happening more frequently as the past 2 years have gone by. She's increasingly loopy and out of words/content when she starts saying something or making a point. Sometimes she says things that are just completely wrong that were her own personal experiences we all know about. When we correct her it's like she doesn't even hear it and just keeps going on like you agreed.\n&#x200B;\nHer grandpa had alzheimer's and I'm afraid this disease is taking her at the young age of 65. It's eating me up inside, and my dad has acknowledged a couple times that he suspects she may have it. I told him it would kill me to see her go like that. It's too heavy a subject for us (my brother and dad) to really talk about or consider. How do you talk about that, and behind someone's back? It just feels wrong.\n&#x200B;\nShe's so stubborn, she's not gonna go to the doc for it, none of us have even mentioned we think she may have it to her. She's always been very, very stubborn and it would not lead to anything good. I think it would be perceived as an attack.\n&#x200B;\nHow can we achieve steps 2-5? Also, can we REALLY know until it's too late?\n&#x200B;\nI'm scared, and as time goes on I fear that this is the reality. I spend as much time with her as I can these days and we have a wonderful relationship that never really existed before. I try to cherish that. Also, I hate speculating, it just feels wrong to me.

I also notice this \"absentness\" before she leaves work and when she first comes home.

I even frustratingly say \"We talked about this yesterday\" and I don't know why I do that, it's just a way of expressing my concern I guess. She actually does seem to make a point of drinking a lot of water.\nBoth my parents have high blood pressure and mine is always above 140/90, so I made an appointment to see the family doc in a couple weeks about that.

In order for the GP to tell you things your mum would have to have you come to the appointments with her/give consent, but your best bet is getting power of attorney for both finances and personal care. That way you are in charge and they can tell you everything. I don't know why they would have said to abstain for 18 months, that seems excessive. As far as I'm aware an alcoholic with liver disease is eligible for a transplant after 6 months sober for example. You really do need that diagnosis to proceed with certain things so I would contact the GP, express your concerns and see if they can expedite things. Even without the POA you can tell them things, they just can't reveal a patient's history. I hope that is relevant.",

Discuss with the GP how you mum has been in the last 6-12 months. The GP should do some ' Mental status tests\u2019  and evaluate your Mum (Mild Moderate Etc) and diagnose Alzheimer's, or due to her strokes Vascular dementia. \nThis happened with our Mum, the GP advised that she stop driving, my mum started to get VERY anxious and did not want to me left alone and continued to be VERY forgetful. She was a shadow of her former self very quickly. \nWe went back to the GP again recently and said that we would like an official \nmedical diagnoses,  Alzheimer\u2019s has a wide spectrum. So in order to medicate correctly we needed to know what she had exactly in order to do so. My mum was given Mirap (antidepressants) and it has completely changed how she was a few months ago, eating well again, much more confident and a lot less \u2018confused\u2019 she may even be allowed to drive again.  We have told her that they are her new \u2018Sleeping\u2019 tables and because of this she can not have anymore alcohol ever again (In fairness she did like to have a drink or 3) but she has stopped from this point on. \nSo GP referred for MRI and results came back with Vascular dementia (cant remember the exact name). After MRI we quickly met with a consultant Psychiatrist, who gave us more details and clearer view of outcomes etc.\nWe know this is not a cure and never will be. We hope just to manage the next few years with her to be as best they can and well, hope for the best really. \nSo in short, and on my limited knowledge, get a proper medical diagnoses and don't give up until you get it, then work with her GP for the best medication for her needs. Also, she must stop drinking Full Stop.",

You'll get free 12 second cloud storage.  So the camera sees motion, you get an alert on your phone, hit the notification and the app starts up and plays a 12 second vid of the motion.  If you put a 32GB micro SD card in (about $8) it will also record a 1 minute video on the card and you can connect from anywhere and watch that.  Sometimes dad will pause at the door and the 12 seconds ends so I'll connect to the cam and watch the 1 minute or the live to see what's happening right at that moment.\nAlso have the ability to set a detection box.  So I can draw a box around the cat feeder and only motion in the box will trigger it.  Used that yesterday to see if the auto feeders were working.\nThere is a pretty good series of videos on youtube by the company themselves going over all the features.

We had a social worker and aides come in to help my FIL.\nRegarding the tracker, you might be able to get some that go in or on her shoes. We're considering this for my own mother. If she's still driving, make sure there's a tracker with the car, but on her body somehow would be better.\nI'm sorry you're dealing with this. It's a truly horrible oddessy.

My mother has Life Alert, which I believe is the company name, and she has a central unit in her living room, which is a big box with a very big red button she can hit for help. She also has a bracelette with a button, and a necklace. She doesn't use the necklace because just knocking it on stuff would call for help occasionally, but the bracelette doesn't seem as senistive and she wears it all times. And it has served her well on at least two occasions. You can talk to whatever company your grandfather uses, and maybe they can set up more of the stationary boxes, like one in every room. But other than that I would suggest really trying to stress to him that whatever is wearable needs to be worn at all time. It seems to be what is working best for my mother. good luck:)",

She also has the Alexa Show device now that allows her to call and video call anyone with her voice.  I can drop in on her anytime and see her room even if she doesn't answer it verbally. It has been incredibly helpful. One thing to think about is that  even with all these devices seniors often forget what to do when they fall or need help.  My mom forgets sometimes the way to answer Alexa or even the fact that she can use her voice to get a call or help.  That can be hard to help.  The life alert and med alert pendants are great as others have mentioned especially when they react based on the fall motion so no action on the senior is needed to indicate they need help.  So finding a way to make sure they have it on is key and can be tough if they don't want to wear it. I know they have ones work on the hip in addition to the typical pendant style. The other thing people do is have a big sign on the wall that says what to do if I fall that reminds them what their options are if they fall when they are alone.  Hope you can find something that works for him:)",

I also showed him the walkie-talkie feature so he can use that in pinch too. He already knows Siri from his phone so I made sure he got a lesson on how to activate that too.

You can even set up his phone to do the same thing I think without having to get a watch.\nBut the apple series 4 is special in that it's the only watch I know of that can can detect falls and send out an alert to you and emergency services.  I posted on the Google sub asking if there was a Google watch that did the same thing but no, it doesnt seem like it based on the responses I got.\nThe watch needs to be paired with an iPhone that is 5s or above if you get the GPS only version. Or a 6 or above if you get the cellular version.  The good thing about the cell version is that if he forgets to bring his iPhone with him, you'll still be able to see where he is at any time.  With the GPS version, you have to wait till he gets within a WiFi area to see where he's gone IF he forgot to bring his phone.\nThe bad thing about thr cellular version is you have to pay more money per month for the cell service.\nI'm getting my dad the WiFi version since I'm cheap and it's unlikely my dad will forget to bring his phone (its habit for him I think).  Well see if I'm right about that though.",

You can be really far away from her then and it would still work but then you'll have to pay the monthly cell service.  Also, the smart watches can receive calls, calls from your phone if you sync to the watch.  I'm not 100% sure you can turn off the calls.

If it's your grandfather and he doesn't have his own iPhone, if you go with a watch, you will definitely need the cellular option and to get cell service cause I assume the iPhone won't be within range of the watch all the time.\nAnother option besides a watch is to sign up with a paid alert system.  It's  typically more expensive than getting cell service for a watch.  But some of the devices can also detect falls similar to the iphone.  And if your grandfather has health issues, he can push a button and there will be a person on the other line that talks him through what to do and will send emergency services.  Your watch can call emergency services too but you wont have a special person on the other end talking him through things.",

I will admit that a combination of bad experiences with dosage and contraindicated combinations has made him understandably wary. I mean, it was pretty bad, there was such poor consideration for their existing medications that they\u2019d get pretty messed up from the conflicting effects. Now he takes them all to his pharmacist to double check before starting anything new. \nThat said, I had to let go of his tweaking a long time ago. I have no leverage. With my mom it different because her issues are primarily psychiatric in nature, so in her case they had to hide her meds and have them measured and administered to her on a daily basis. It was a battle but she accidentally ODed once and that scared my dad straight to take over. \nSo like the other poster mentioned, it might be some event scaring him straight, unfortunately, or a nurse coming in and administering it through a home health agency if he qualifies.

After watching how my mom was treated in \"intensive care\" wing of a for-profit complex before she passed, I basically said to their faces \"I wouldn't put a dog under your care, much less my father.\"\nThat said, for sleep issues, you definitely want to clear interactions with pharmacist or doc, but here's what I take for my own insomnia: melatonin, 10 mg (max dose); theanine (derived from green tea); tryptophan (the stuff in turkey that makes you doze after Thanksgiving dinner); and Valerian root\u2026 all of the above natural supplements. Plus 1/2 dose sleeping pill, not the ones with diphenhydramine HCl (basically an antihistamine which sometimes gets me wired), but rather with doxylamine succinate (full dose makes me groggy next day). \nYeah, on call means on call. Waving knives is pretty serious, as is your sleep deprivation. Me being the pest I am, would be on the phone next day to track down that person's supervisor and ask WTF is y'all's problem?

Doing it day after day, and in this case with little sleep, is devastatingly hard.

He does seem to wear it but it's going to take a lot of practice to get him to wear it while showering like I want him to.\nThe problem with both of these is that the devices need to be charged so your dad would have to remember to charge them.  Also both require a service charge or phone service charge.\nI found this too but I'm not sure if the business is good so they won't go belly up or not.  Plus it's service charge is quite expensive too.  The benefit of this is that you can get a power charger attachment that let's it run for 2 weeks without having to charge battery.

        "text": "I'm so sorry the two of you are going through this.  I have been where you are.  My husband was a Type 1 diabetic (diagnosed in his teens) and started to have more and more complications in his 30s and early 40s.  By 2014 he had had two strokes (the first in 2005), a heart attack, numerous falls, peripheral neuropathy which left him in near constant pain, multiple eye surgeries which left him with no peripheral vision and an inability to drive, Meniere's disease which causes hearing loss and vertigo, and was in early stages of kidney failure, and totally dependent on catheters.   He also had early onset dementia and the second stroke affected his personality (that was worse than the physical effects).  \nAs his complications worsened, he talked about wanting to die a lot, and not wanting to be a burden, etc.  He did agree to go to talk with a counselor, but didn't end up talking much. \nHe tried to kill himself in 2015 by overdosing on Valium (which he had for when he got bouts of vertigo) and insulin.  He nearly died and was angry when he didn't.  He was in-patient in the psychiatric unit of the local hospital for a week to make sure that he was no longer a danger to himself.   I found his suicide note the day I picked him up from the hospital to come home.  I don't know why, but he had left it in \"his\" drawer in our bathroom vanity.  He started on anti-depressants and they helped a bit with his mood, but he still talked about wanting to be free of the constant pain and complications.  As with your boyfriend's condition, nothing he had was immediately terminal.  Terminal is awful, but prolonged suffering for who knows how long is too.  \nAs others have suggested, I recommend that you and your boyfriend talk with a lawyer or his primary doctor, and have an Advance Directive drawn up if he doesn't have one already.  We did that after my husband's suicide attempt and it seemed to give him some peace.  We gave a copy to his primary care doctor who went over it and discussed it with him to make sure that everyone was clear about his wishes. \nMy husband ended up in the hospital in April 2017, after having extremely high blood sugars for days, and not being able to keep anything down.  He agreed to let me call 911, but later in the hospital was furious at me, saying he didn't remember agreeing to it and that he never wanted to  go to the hospital again.  He said his biggest fear was dying in the hospital (or in the ambulance on the way), alone/surrounded by strangers.   \nHe died at home at the end of April, about three weeks after he was discharged from the hospital.  Apparently his kidney function deteriorated extremely quickly.  I woke up the night he died because his breathing was loud and labored.  His glucose monitor also showed that his blood sugar was very low.   He was semi-conscious and stopped me when I \nreached for the phone on the bedside table.  I held him for a few minutes, talking to him and crying, still planning on calling 911.   He died in my arms before I could.  It was heartbreaking, but I am glad he was at home, with me and not in a hospital surrounded by strangers.  \nLet your boyfriend dictate what he wants and have it in writing and witnessed.  I believe, legally, any adult has the right to deny any kind of treatment (that includes stopping taking medications, etc.), and to request comfort care.  I was my husband's caregiver for more than 10 years and I know how  hard  it is to watch the person you love suffer and how frustrating it is when there is really nothing that can be done medically to \"cure\" the person or to substantially improve their quality of life.    \nWith regard to the noise discomfort, what about noise cancelling headphones?  Would that help?  When my husband had his first stroke, he lost the ability to talk.  We used note cards with simple words/phrases to help us communicate.  Sign language--your own or ASL could be helpful too.     \nYou've probably done things like shower chairs, chairs in convenient places for support. \nMy husband initially balked at the idea of a walker, but I ordered one anyway (he already had a cane from rehab from the 1st  stroke), and he did use it around the house and came to appreciate that it was available if/when he needed  it.  As you know, falls can be  dangerous for both of you.  I don't know about you, but it was challenging getting my husband back up on his feet sometimes.  I'm 5'4\" and he was nearly 6'!\nI wish I had some wonderful words of wisdom.  Others have suggested looking into more direct caregiver support and I second that too.  I went to see a counselor myself for a few  months when I started feeling like I needed someone to talk to.  It helped.\nI hope the best for both of you...the best it can be, for as long as it can be.",

I understand that it is not physically or financially possible.\nThat being said, the Agency on Aging should be able to point you in the direction of a caregiver to assist you who is paid for by the state. Also, you may qualify for a stipend to take care of him. I honestly think that your best course of action would be getting some help though. I can understand how overwhelmed you feel because I took care of my ex's mom for 7 years after she had a spinal cord injury and the difference between your boyfriend and her is that that woman was never grateful not once. I can count on one hand the number of times she ever said Thank you to me for what I was doing for her.\nAnyway, I wish I could give you more advice than that but just try not to take it to heart when he does yell, understand that he is in quite a bit of pain and sometimes when people have chronic pain it is hard to control their reactions to other people. Chronic pain is a very difficult thing to live with and it can cause you to lash out at the people that you are closest to. I'm sure you already know this though, I just felt like it Bears repeating.

There\u2019s no issue or non-issue of withholding or stopping treatment or care because, he isn\u2019t receiving any as there is none available for this condition. The only respite he has ever gotten was from ambien for his insomnia but his tolerance peaked and that was the end of that. There is no way to medically make him comfortable or alleviate symptoms. Opiates and other obvious suspects do absolutely nothing for this illness. There is not really any current doctor overseeing his care because all his former physicians basically said there is nothing else they can do at this point as there is nothing left in their arsenal for these patients. It\u2019s just me and him and his immediate family. The medical establishment knows and can do nothing; half the doctors have never even heard of what he has (ME/CFS).

It\u2019s a dangerous message and it\u2019s never handled with care, and it can\u2019t be because they\u2019re all movies made and acted by able bodied people.\nYou do you, but remember that bad messages about disability are being perpetuated.",

Because this will be important for her to have when he gets to the point where he can't make any decisions, and the house absolutely needs to be sold.  Sounds like she has access to his banking so that he can continue to pay bills. That's all good, but make sure she has that POA.\nHe has already decided to live with you, so, if he wants, he can sell the house. However, another way around this might be to investigate on your own, what memory care facilities are open, how much they cost, and what they offer. Talk to others who have gone through a similar situation, and go look at the places they sent their loved ones. Once you have the costs, this will be info you can share with him that will point to the necessity of selling. As far as the daughter, you will have to get an attorney or a restraining order forbidding her to live in the house. It's called a move out order. If you have evidence (documentation -bank records) that she's taken money, that's valuable info for the judge.  Also, document what happens, and the dates when she's texted or called him and harassed him about the house.\nRead up on Adult Protective Services.  It's good to know what they can do before you make that call.  Has he made ANY statements to you about being afraid of his daughter?   If you do, then write down what happened and when. Chances are, they'll call you back to determine whether or not there's enough evidence to begin an investigation, or if your mother has everything under control.\nAs far as the doctor, he needs to get a neuro-cognitive workup. Your mother should also be signed in for being the person allowed to ask for information and talk to the doctors for him.  Is he on private insurance now?  Does he need a referral, or can he just go to a neurologist?  Read through his policy and find out whether he has an HMO, PPO and how his plan works. If he doesn't have ANY insurance, then he can just go, though it'll all be out of pocket. He can, at any point, apply for Medicaid without the SSD.\nAnyone can call the county and request a social worker to come out and make an evaluation of his mental and physical condition at any point.",

He does not have the mental faculty to know that he needs to sell his house, some days he insists that he never had any strokes and that he's fine. \nThe problem is it doesn't matter how much we talk to him, his recall period is only about six hours so all he can remember is that his daughter is living in his house and that we're trying to sell it, so when she calls him and tells him that, he thinks we're trying to do it out of malice.\nHe's not afraid of his daughter, he legitimately wants to give her a place to stay but he can't understand what's going on because he thinks he's only been staying with us a few days when he's been here over 6 months.\nAs for insurance, he's on the low income version of Medicaid rn so we can afford doctor visits, but they won't cover longterm care unless he has less than 9k in assets. \nI'll see about having a social worker out but the problem is that someone just sitting down and talking to him can't really see the extent of the problem. He can carry on a normal conversation without many problems, maybe a little confusion, the issue is that he won't remember any of it later. Basically his symptoms are similar to anterograde amnesia. His PCD agrees that it's vascular dementia, but the specialist he was referred to is hemming and hawing and saying that he just has some \"memory issues\" and she can't recommend disability.",

When a meta-analysis says a certain type of treatment is inconclusive the skeptic reads that as conclusively against.  \nOn the other hand if the explanation produces poor results time and again (say the amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease) then the reverse is done--the failed results must be caused by something because the hypothesis has to be correct--wrong dose, given too late, wrong form of amyloid.  Thus \"positive\" results are rejected because they don't square with what one believes, and negative results are rejected because they do not fit the hypothesis that many Alzheimer's researchers have based their carreers upon.  And thus no progress is made.\nThis anonymous quote puts it nicely:\n[Clinical trials with over-the-counter supplements have concentrated either on items which suppress inflammation, or on antioxidants which scavenge oxygen derived free radicals. Most of these items have proved to be worthless in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Similarly most drugs used to treat Alzheimer's disease do little to slow the deterioration, but instead offer a mild temporary symptom relief. However, evidence has been accumulating that the primary driver of Alzheimer's disease is a nitrogen derived free radical called peroxynitrite, which may mediate both amyloid and tau accumulation as well as their toxicity. Excellent results have been obtained with peroxynitrite scavengers, with reversals of Alzheimer's disease in human clinical trials being repeatedly demonstrated. IMHO, the only thing which may be preventing the abolition of Alzheimer's disease is the mental inertia of scientists, as well as the bureaucrats who fund them. Unfortunately, most bureaucrats keep throwing money into repeatedly testing discredited interventions, while ignoring successful ones. Common sense is anything but...]",

Either amyloid does its damage in the prodromal stages of the disease (10,20 years before symptom onset), or it is simply a byproduct of other pathogenic processes (inflammation, infection, diminished proteostastic mechanisms)  [please don't post a bunch of random abstracts to try and say that peroxynitration is involved in all of these processes].  To wit - Amyloid is most likely heavily involved in disease, we are just unable to therapeutically target it.  The clinical trials do not \"prove\" that amyloid is not involved in disease - they do seem to prove that  it is not a good therapeutic target to treat the disease.\nMany researchers have also based their careers on the hypothesis that antioxidants can treat alzheimer's. These large scale trials have also failed.\nWhen I read that meta-analyses of evidence around a hypothesis is inconclusive, I certainly don't dismiss it out of hand.  But the stuff you continually post and try to connect is really scientifically weak.  You try to connect poorly done clinical trials to cherry-picked in vitro studies to support your hypothesis when they really have nothing to do with each other.  And you post these piece by piece in a haphazard fashion which makes the evidence chain really hard to follow, instead of collating them into one cogent review citing 150-200 papers.  \nAgain, my problem with you is not the discussion of alternative theories of Alzheimer's, or even that you are an amateur scientist. My problem is that you discuss your relatively fringe theory as basically settled fact to a lay-patient population using jargon-filled posts to legitimize yourself while promoting unproven and potentially harmful herbal remedies.\nI would love it if Alzheimer's could be effectively treated with aromatherapy, or CBD, or essential oils, or anything else that is readily available. Unfortunately that is not the case.\nUsing an anonymous quote that sounds like you wrote it to support yourself?  Jesus.  I googled it and you posted it almost a decade ago on another forum (that you were probably asked to leave).",

        "text": "Well at least I have been upgraded to holding a relatively fringe theory since you have already acknowledged that \"many researchers have also based their careers on the hypothesis that antioxidants can treat alzheimer's.\"\nAs far as I know there has only been one large scale clinical trial testing antioxidants for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and it was fraught with many problems.\nOne major mistake was to assume that because genetic mutations led to amyloid that amyloid had to be the cause of Alzheimer's disease, but those same genetic mutations led to oxidative stress first.  And amyloid is certainly not the only thing that can cause oxidative stress in the brain.  Plus those other factors lead to amyloid in the first place.\nhttps://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2014/375968/\nSo the problem was not that anti-amyloid drugs were given too late, the problem was that they focused on only one trigger for the disease (in this respect Dr. Dale Bredesen is far ahead most of the \"rock stars\" of Alzheimer's disease).\nThe quote is not mine.  I know little about the person who wrote it other than that he is Canadian and is an amateur scientist who carefully reviewed the literature.  At the time, the evidence for his position was not as strong as he suggested, but the intervening years have significantly bolstered his claims.",

But the cancer would eventually end up killing her. That said, as hard as it can be to believe, she died happy. Sometimes that's the absolute best we can hope for.\nBut I think the biggest thing for us was just continuing to be there for each other. And to be honest with each other even if it felt we might hurt the other with that honestly. She was worried about becoming a burden to me. And I was worried that she'd essentially torture herself for my sake and spend her last days or weeks on earth in agony. And the crux of it for both of us was that we were worried the other might come to resent us. But we promised early on that we'd say if that was ever starting to become the case. We both also had a couple moments crying for the other and letting ourselves be reassured. \nShe knew I'd start to second guess myself after a while too and even left me a card to drive home just how wonderful she felt her life had been during her final months and giving me credit for it. \nObviously one can't always extrapolate between two different situations. But I think our strategy just came down to understanding that we were still the same team we'd always been. How we were there for each other in practical terms was constantly changing to account for her condition. But we were both doing things for each other right up till the end. And most of all being there for each other emotionally in a way I'd never imagined. It was hard, but it wasn't hardship. If that makes much sense. \nThough she also told me something very early on as well. She said there'd be plenty of time to mourn her once she was dead. But at the moment she was still alive. And she wanted to keep spending that remaining time really living life with me. And amazingly, we did. \nJust remember that you're not in this alone. And she's not in it alone. You have each other and that can make all the difference.",

I just thought that lacking intellectually was basically the definition of intellectual disability. That being said, I read the story about Kevin and yes she does display some of that kind of behavior but not quite that severe. There were a few things that I identified with as far as her but she's not that severe in everything.\nShe cooks her own food but she cooks everything on high heat and I've told her several times that not everything needs to be cooked on high. She does this even with fried eggs. I've told her that she's going to set her kitchen on fire and possibly burn her house down and it's like she doesn't learn from past mistakes. She's even gotten mad at me when I've had to remind her several times not to do that. She's even said, well I guess I'm stupid then. I've told her that I never said that she was stupid, I was merely reminding her not to do something that could cause her injury.\nI just find it odd that someone would not connect the dots like hey, I canceled my card so that's why auto-pay didn't work. Most people would know to update their payment method as soon as they got their new card. Okay maybe she forgot about it this one time but I just couldn't understand why she couldn't put two and two together about why the payment didn't go through. I asked her if she forgot that she canceled her card and she hesitated like she was afraid to answer me. She finally basically admitted that no she hadn't forgotten but that she didn't put it together that that's why her payment didn't work.\nI've had to explain things to her that should be common sense to most people and she knows basically nothing of the real world. Things that are common knowledge to most people, she knows nothing about. She is severely lacking in common sense and does not take care of her hygiene properly. One time I gently asked her when the last time she took a shower was and she told me that it was 2 days ago but I know it was longer than that because I had been at her house every day for two weeks and she never changed clothes. \nI know it sounds like I'm being mean but I am genuinely concerned about her well-being. She has family up in New York but honestly they don't really seem to care that much about her. They hardly ever call her. I'm about ready to go into her phone and text her brother to let him know what's going on because I think she needs to be in either a group home setting or in Assisted Living of some other type.",

(Note, I am not a trained medical professional and I do not have the power to diagnose anything). \nIf her family isn't willing to help, you may have to step up and attend doctors appointments with her to see what can be done. Ask her if she was in special ed at all in school (how to bring it up is best left to you- you know if she would be offended or not.) \nAlso, ask her what she wants to do. Ask her if this is going to be a problem for her if you take a few steps back, and if she would want some other assistance.

I've heard that when you have auditory processing disorder that you can have a hard time following verbal instructions.\nBut I have also wondered if she has autism as well.

Being dyslexic just means that you see letters and numbers backwards. She does have a habit of mixing up numbers. Like for example if I was to tell her to write the number 71 she would write it as 17.\nShe cannot manage her money that well and it's basically become me paying her bills for her because she can't budget her money.

Lack of common sense wouldnt technically be a developmental disability but a mental health issue undiagnosed can cause some of the issues you described. Or if she is taking a medication for a health issue it can interfere with her mental capacity (e.g. diabetes meds). Likewise an undiagnosed health issue (e.g. thyroid) can cause mental confusion. \nFirst step would be to get things ruled out by her doctor like a health issue.

The original plan was to have a longer engagement so that he could finish his master's program. But since we saw mom declining, we wanted her to be able to enjoy our wedding and express herself, so we chose to have it that same year. Even though we've been together since 2009, we entered into \"married life\" at such a rough time with mom that I feel like we haven't been able to really experience it.\nI visited twice in August and twice at the beginning of September. My last visit was just about a month ago, and I purposely wanted to put more time and space between the visits because we still had so much friction.

We're in San Diego, CA. The first year, I went with her to every class and was her cornerman! When she seemed to be more independent, I stopped joining her for the class and only dropped her off/picked her up. Since I worked 10 hour night shifts, I welcomed the opportunity to not have to stay during classes so I could take a nap in the car or take the hour and a half for \"me time.\" And then we hired the private caregiver to take her and be her cornerman that third year. Mom actually LOVED the boxing. It was one of the hardest things for her to say goodbye to. There's one in the same county as her assisted living home, but in Los Angeles traffic, it'd be ridiculous getting her there with her med schedule working on time, etc. Luckily, the home has daily exercise classes that mom attends. It's not as high intensity as Rock Steady, but she says it still works her out.\nIt's great to hear how active you are! Absolutely keep it up!

I got a free coupon for time in one of those isolation float tanks which was already a little more new-age than my comfort zone. When I went there, they were pushing a freebie light show thing. I thought it was stupid and said no, I don't want that but the guy talked me into just trying it. I sat in what looked like a dentist's chair and they put something like a virtual reality head gear thing on me. It had a slide show built into it, just regular pieces of standard art from art history books that they cycled through, which I found a bit boring since I was an art major in college - it was all stuff I already knew anyway. I was belligerent and not into it.\nAfter that, the guy came back and asked if I saw anything weird. Me: Nope, not all all, just the regular slides. Him: what do you mean? Me: There was just the art slides - I didn't see anything.\nSo it turns out there was no art, no slides, just flashing (LED?) lights that tapped into something that was firing off in my brain, and I hallucinated the art slides - but it was so damn real. I'm not a person who's ever done drugs, but that's the closest I've come to experiencing an alternate reality like being in some CIA LSD experiment.\nI thought it might be worth mentioning because my response was not a typical placebo response and it was the opposite of confirmation bias - I went in thinking the whole thing was absolute bullshit, and was still busy telling them so during the debrief.",

Whatever phone you choose, make sure her contact list is limited to only a few numbers:  the people & numbers she would most need.\nUpdated thoughts:   Does she know how to use Siri? (if you're using iPhones) I believe you can set it so all your grandmother has to do is raise the phone and say, Hey Siri, call Sally and it makes the call for her. ...\nThe sad reality is that her condition will progress, and she won't be able to figure out what to do with objects like phones, no matter how simplified. Even light switches and toothbrushes become puzzling to someone with Alzheimer's, so they need more and more help. Her frustration is understandable, because sometimes during those moments, she knows something is wrong but can't do anything about it. Other times, she doesn't get frustrated, but YOU will, because she doesn't realize anything's wrong and it's a skill she knew just a few hours ago -- like using her toothbrush to brush her hair or not remembering how to put on a shirt. \nWhen she gets frustrated, maybe you can agree with her that it's frustrating and redirect her attention to a different solution: \"How about if I sit with you and help you make the calls you need to make? I can come by every morning or evening and we'll do that together.\" And maybe her friend and sister can agree to call her more regularly, so she has less need to call them (I'm assuming they know about her condition and that she may need some help?)",

Obviously they would need to have their phone with them but so far she's been pretty good about having it on her when she leaves the house. It's a pretty easy set up. We have been ok with the free version so far. The free version allows you to set up two alerts so we get notifications when she leaves or arrives at her home. Though it does have a bit of a delay. I don't know if the paid version is any faster.\nWe are still interested in having something else as a safety net. Maybe something that pairs with her phone that would alert her and us if she left the house without one or the other?",

I used her concerns about someone breaking in to offer to take some things that might get stolen and place them in \"a safety deposit box.\"  This strategy worked to get one of her guns out of the house.  I also used an auto theft in the neighborhood to convince her to let me put a gps tracker on her car (so we could find it if stolen, when really it was to make sure we could find her if she got lost).  I also convinced her to let me put security cameras in the house.  These were ones that I could see using an app on my phone.  That way, I could check everyday to make sure that she hadn't fallen, and I could also watch anyone coming into the house (since they become vulnerable to scammers).  Also, when she started having trouble with food, I ordered Meals on Wheels and had other food delivery services.  I live several hours away, so these technological options helped a lot.\nAlso, their personality and their openness to assistance changes across time (at least that was true for my relative - not sure if that's true for everyone).  Some people who are unfriendly before dementia can become sweet after dementia.  They usually become more child-like and open to being nurtured and \"parented.\"   \nThere are some things I just let go of, particularly if it's not a safety issue.  That helped me somewhat.   And then it also helped to think of these issues as intellectual problems to solve, so I used my mind rather than feel anxious about it.  \nThe other thing I would say is that whatever deep childhood wounds one has, they can be triggered by this experience.  But I think it has been an opportunity for me to face those and grow stronger.  I also have come to admire her courage and see her in a very different light than I used to.\nBut also, I would say that it's okay to feel pity for yourself and pity for them.

Your Dad probably navigates the same old worn paths that he's familiar with and has liked to walk for years. \nAs long as he's doing his usual walk thing and not wandering off aimlessly, and you at least have a simple incoming flip phone line he can easily answer, that's all you can really do for now.\nAll of my best wishes to you and your Mom and Dad.",

She's the only one that takes the watch off him and the only one that puts it back on him.  The watch is waterproof so he can shower with it.  It will detect falls and also monitor heart rate for irregular heart beats (though apple doesn't say it will detect heart attacks or anything) - and then send you or your mom an alert.  You can use apples find my friends to locate him with your phone.\njiobit- Does he always wear the same jacket or belt?  If so, You can put this device in a pocket he doesn't usually use or attach it to his belt.  He should never be the one that is responsible for charging it or moving it in any way that way he doesn't misplace it somewhere.  The battery lasts 3 days to a week so your mom can just be the one who charges it at a set time and then put it back right afterward.

        "text": "Hi OP. I'm also in the UK and your family sounds a lot like mine in many ways, including parents being a tight unit with few or no close friends or social group. My mum started to show symptoms when she was in her late 50s. She is now 66 and it took us a while to learn coping skills etc. \nThe first thing is to take her her GP. It's important to go with her and have a list of the things you've noticed as you have here. The GP needs to refer to a memory clinic for memory tests and scans that can confirm whther it is dementia and, if so, what kind. Once they diagnose what is happening they will put you in touch with different resources. The Alzheimer's Society are excellent and will do home visits, offer advice and tips and help with planning. There are also numerous Carer's charities depending on where you are in the UK who can give you excellent advice and support. There are also courses and groups specifically for early/premature onset. My mum went to a 6 week course with other people in the same situation  and now goes to a fortnightly 'sensory activity' group for people who are young onset. \nMy mum also lost all passion and enthusiasm, but she seems to be getting it back with some prompting. She loves to look at art magazines, have poetry read to her, go to galleries and museums, wander around the shops, watch David Attenborough documentaries and play jenga. Stimulation is important.\nWe narrowed it down to a focus on three things: keeping her safe, keeping her healthy, and keeping her happy. Doing that can help you stay patient. I struggle with things have to be done in a certain way and it helps me to ask myself, does this really matter? If something doesn't negatively affect her health, happiness or safety i just let it go now. You want to wash every single bauble with shampoo before you put them on the tree - sure, go for it. \nAnyway, GP and contact the Alzheimer's society, they should be able to put you in touch with other resources, even if the diagnosis is not Alzheimer's. \nTry not to panic and catastrophise too much. Take it a day at a time, talk as a family (we have boozy 'strategy meetings') and be as patient and accepting as you can (it takes practice), but don't beat yourself up when you are not! Good luck, and if I can help in any way, let me know",

The Alexa echo in kitchen allows us to drop in on them without them answering (it beeps and takes 15 seconds to focus) so they know you are dropping in. And we are able to tell them to put phone on hook. Also nice to let them talk to us and grandkids via video with them not having to do anything to activate it. We also use the video to watch them take their pills.  The volume is loud enough that they can hear us from their bedroom even though it\u2019s in kitchen. \nGoogle has something too but you can\u2019t just \u201cdrop in\u201d.  They\u2019d have to \u201canswer\u201d the call...which may be difficult. \nTile mates - used Tile mates in all their keys to find them if they lose them in apt.  GPS trackers work for anywhere but they are expensive to buy and maintain. \nAugust smart lock - It allows us to give codes to different workers and revoke them without worrying about keys.  It also notifies our cell phones whenever someone opens, closes, locks or unlocks door.  So if it looks like they are leaving at a time when they shouldn\u2019t be, we can drop in on Alexa above and if necessary call security guard in their building. They\u2019ve  never really left apt unexpectedly but others may be worried about that.  There are many smart locks but this fits on existing interior deadbolt thumbturn. Outside stays the same and still works with keys as always. That\u2019s important because it would be hard for them to learn how to use a real smart lock. \nSmart plug - My mom was putting stuff in microwave in middle of the night that is not supposed to go in microwave.   I just bought a smart plug to disable microwave at night and repower it in morning when we know my dad is awake and can watch her.   Ideally looking for a way to control the range too since we\u2019ve had some issues with both of them forgetting stuff on the stove. But can\u2019t find any reasonably priced solution smart for something with that much power \nSafe - We put a basic safe in pantry where we can store important stuff like papers, I\u2019d, meds.  My mom was taking everything and hiding in her room. \nYou can get smart safes that can be remote controlled from afar to give others access to stuff in there without giving them a pin. But we don\u2019t need it yet. \nThere are also smart locks that can be fitted into a drawer to make the drawer like a mini safe instead of getting a separate safe.",

I\u2019m generally very self aware of my patterns but I need to figure out a way to actually want to break them and discover what I want as an individual - or is that even possible? We are where we come from and all that. \nAnyway, thanks again. Sorry about your mum. Re. The money I\u2019ve been super on top of saving and paid off all my debts.

        "text": "First of all, don't marry the guy unless you love him. If you love each other and he doesn't mind giving you money then there is absolutely no problem with your arrangement. But if this is a guy that you wouldn't date if he didn't spend lavish amounts of money on you, then you'd really be no different than a prostitute. You seem to indicate that that is not the case.\nSending your mom money is not going to magically make her a vibrant person again. If she is like old people in America, she'll probably just spend it all on garbage from QVC (literally a TV channel of infomercials) And that was my thought before I read the part about the 150 for the passport mysteriously evaporating. \nYour mom is probably depressed. And the thing about depression is that it operates by mental positive feedback loops (a positive feedback loop is when the outcome of a process increases the probability of that type of outcome) Because of that nature it is very difficult to wrangle yourself out of it, especially if you don't have a social support system. However, and I guess here lies the real kernel of your quandary, is that you have no guarantee at all that taking measures to help her will actually be effective. So you could end up uprooting your life for her, for basically no reason at all; and then, as horrible as it sounds, you'd likely end up resenting her. So given the options you've presented, you're in a double bind.\nThe only other option I see is to have an honest discussion with her. Ask her if she is happy, ask her if she is depressed. If she says she is happy and that she is not depressed (as people are wont to do out of pride) then just tell her what you think. Tell her that you think that she has become unable to do the things that she believes define her life, and that because of this, she has grown prematurely enfeebled. And tell her that you want to help, but that you can't help without knowing how to help and whether or not she'd be willing to accept your help. Directly ask her if she'd be happier if she moved in with you later on or vice versa.\nChances are that during such a conversation, she would not be immediately receptive to your concerns. But you will have at least planted the seed for her to reach out. Because unless she is the one who reaches out and says \"I need help, I think these things you've suggested doing will help me.\" then it is simply far, far too much risk for you to take on.\nThere is a huge problem with retirees in America and depression, for basically the same reasons your mom is having her problems. A lot of people define their existence by their work, and when there is no more work...well, it is as though there is no more life. I know will sound facile, but the only way to remedy this is by creating a new life for yourself. If you spend your time languishing around the house, then yeah, you'll slowly die and be miserable. But if you volunteer, or start exploring new hobbies and passions, and find new friends, then you'll thrive into old age.",

You can encourage her to seek help but if she refuses you might be better off distancing yourself/setting boundaries so you can protect yourself.

        "text": "Your Mother's financial issues are only tangentially related to her social issues - those are more related to her mental health. It's more likely that her mental health is responsible for both her financial and social issues.  \ndepression, anxiety, hoarding, self-imposed isolation, failure to clean, sedentary - the financial issues are just one of the symptoms. To be sure, they don't help anything, but just throwing money at this problem isn't going to solve it. You moving there isn't going to solve it. You throwing your life at this problem isn't going to solve it. Medical care, therapy, exercise, etc. are tools to help your Mom get on top of it.   \nMy advice - don't make your life plans around your Mom. Make your plans with your Man because you love this guy and want to build a life with him. Don't presume on his resources becoming your resources - focus on your education, career, and financial independence. You can be open with him about the problems your Mom is facing and how you want to encourage her to get therapy and such, but only ask him for emotional support. Your Mom dug this hole, it's not your responsibility, and it's definitely not his. If he makes an offer, consider it, but just bailing your Mom out of this hole is not necessarily going to save her. Based on your descriptions of her behavior, she'll be in this hole no matter where she's living and how much money she has available to her - until she chooses to get/accept real help with her mental health.    \nEncourage her to get treatment. Offer to pay directly for the passport, the therapy, the whatever, but you obviously cannot trust her to use the money you hand her in the way it's intended, at this time.   \nWhen you visit her, plan to help her clean up. Don't just do it for her. Arthritis is most benefited by continued activity. If you're cleaning, she needs to be cleaning.  If she's living in squalor, and refusing to clean, she might need to have adult protective services (or whatever your variant might be, since I don't think you're in the US ) called to give her an evaluation.\nOf course there's still hope for your Mom. But she has to be the one choosing it and taking advantage of the resources that are available for her.  \nYou might also want to try to drag her to a financial advisor, because if she's on welfare and drowning in debt, and has a gov't provided housing, she might be able to get rid of her debt by declaring bankruptcy or something. She has no assets to lose, only debt.",

But she\u2019s still mentally getting worse re her standards of living. I will have a stern but loving talk with her about the hoarding and general lack of productivity and then encourage her to volunteer at a local charity shop she can walk to, and keep tabs on her social interaction/societal integration.",

We got a VTech Senior Phone System for my Grandma, and bought an alert \"pendant\" that connects to the system. \nWhen she pushes it, it automatically dials through three pre-programmed numbers you can enter until someone picks up. It puts the phones on pager automatically so you can talk with them.\nDownside is, the alert also triggers a kind of alarm that is a bit loud, and I put pendant in quotes because it is quite large to wear around the neck. We ended up tying it to my Grandma's walker. Not ideal but better than nothing.\nYears ago we did try to get her one of those life alert pendants but she never wore it. She only let us get this new one because she blacked out and had a fall and had to crawl through her house to get to a phone.",

I guess activity monitors could do the same thing with steps and sleep.\nIt depends what you are trying to guard against, very elderly patients at home alone that have fallen down.

My wife has Fibromyalgia, tendonitis, arthritis, carpal tunnel, and a few mental health issues that include PTSD, anxiety and Non-epileptic seizures. I get you. Nothing terminal. \nWe've been married 14 years now. She started having problems before our first year of marriage. I've seen some shit. \nWho is her support network? You, and her mom from what you've stated. Coordinate. Talk directly with her mom about things. Bring her into planning conversations. Make sure she is on the same page. If you need to take a break, talk with her mom to cover, and do the same for her. You and your partner may be a team, but there are more participants that you can rely on. \nFigure out who your support network is. Family and friends that you can go to and vent about situations. People you can rely on to pickup some slack here and there for things you need. \n\nMental health has such an impact on every aspect of health. When my wife's anxiety and PTSD are flaring up, her pain levels skyrocket, but the opposite isn't necessarily true. There are a couple of things I think she needs to focus on here. \nOne is her mental health, straight up. Theres a lot of facets and things here, but therapy has done wonders for my wife. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy can really help people recognize their emotions, and analyze why they're having it. \nAnother thing is positive outlook. One of the biggest 'red flags' is your partner's focus on negative things. How much pain, how bad her day was, etc. Yes, life isn't a picnic, but there has to be some good, something silly, funny or good event that happened during her day. Try bringing those events up. Not just for her, but for you too! I know its hard to focus on those things when you're down, but those little moments can really help salvage a shit day. \n\nYou guys seem to have a pretty set schedule, which is good. Now schedule some time for yourself. Block out an hour or two that is your time. Schedule things around it. Defend that time. Then, go do something you enjoy. Window shop. Play video games. Something that you enjoy and rejuvenates you and makes you feel good. This is the hardest thing to do on this list, and even I have a hard time implementing it (life, uh, gets in the way). It is so very worth it. \nFind a local support group for the issues your partner is dealing with. They can offer lots of advice and help when you need it. \nAlso look into counseling! There is a lot going on in your life, and counselors are here to help you navigate those choices you are making. \n\nI really hope this word wall has helped. I'm more than happy to answer any follow up questions you may have.",

We've done a lot of traveling when she was doing better.

If anyone failed, it was he who did. \nAnd second in line is your mom herself tbh, because when she notices her feet are swelling and she feels bad, she has to say something. You're not the only mature adult in this equation, she is or at least should be the other one and the one first in line. Things like this can not depend on you being there and noticing it; if she wants to live alone instead of in a care facility, and without helpers coming by, she has to take some responsibility for her own well-being. If she can't do that, then it's time to speak to insurance and her GP so at least a service can come and check once daily, for well-being and blood pressure and for putting together medication.\nI understand that you feel miserable and responsible, but this truly isn't on you. Granted, this was a gradual thing (but comes back to herself needing to alert you when things go awry), but the older she gets, the more the only way to be reasonably sure nothing bad ever happens would be to not only live there, but also never be absent for any length of time. That's just not feasible. You moving away only made sure that you don't fall into the gradual trap of taking on more and more of her care and not noticing when the time comes where additional care from outside is needed.\nIn a way you could see it as a blessing in disguise. Your mom isn't well right now, but it doesn't sound like it's irreversible. And what happened did alert you to the fact that it has come to the point where she needs more oversight than either of you expected. Now you can take care of that before something bad and more time-sensitive, and with more irreversible effects can happen to her.\nIt's so easy to take on the blame, and so easy when living with or close to someone that needs care to let your own needs gradually take more and more of a back seat. But you need to earn money to support an aging parent, and you need room for your own life so taking on the care can't take over your whole life and swallow you up like it often happens. You moving away was a necessity, and one that actually will give you more financial options when making decisions about care and visits moving forward, and one that somewhat protects you from the gradual swallowing up that otherwise can happen.",

Every time my mom has been hospitalized she went home with a little home healthcare help. The insurance company finally started paying a home healthcare company to come in and help her regularly to help keep her out of the hospital. Make sure the doctor at the hospital knows she will not have any help at home when she leaves there. The emergency room doctor tried to send my grandma home with a broken wrist once. She couldn't put any pressure on that arm. I asked him how she was supposed to get off the couch? The toilet? They sent her to a physical rehab facility for 2 months instead. Ask to speak to a social worker in the hospital and explain her situation. They can tell you what services are available in your area. \nIs your mom on Medicaid? Contact your local Area Agency on Aging (or the equivalent where you are) and see what services are available for her.  Do you know your mom's neighbors? Does she have friends or family who can stop in and check on her a couple times a month? Can you set up Skype chats/FaceTime with her once a week so you can lay eyes on her? \nI discovered in dealing with my mom that assisted living (at least in my area) isn't a thing unless you have thousands of dollars to spend a month. But we do have adult foster care homes that take low income seniors. The threat currently hanging over my mom is that I will put her in one of these if she doesn't step up and start taking care of her business. Her psychiatrist is insisting I stay involved in her care (I've stopped taking her to all her other appointments), so we agreed that I could 'attend' her appointments via conference call so I don't have to leave work. I just scoot into a conference room for the 20 minute call. There are many ways to help your mom that don't require you to sacrifice your future, find out what resources are available and start bringing them in. It will be time consuming initially, but it's worth it knowing you've done all you can and your are free to live your own life.",

Basically, if you are on FMLA, you wouldn't be penalized for absences related to your mother's medical condition - for the employer, this is a legal obligation.

My other brother and I had to step in, and although we were able to block a lot of it he has still manipulated her out of over $100,000 in vehicles, etc. Our family, which used to be close, is completely destroyed over this.\nHopefully your parents are mentally still with it, my mom started drinking a lot around her divorce which left her even more vulnerable and she defends my alcoholic brother even though he has significantly contributed to destroying her relationships with my dad, her sister and niece and my other sober brother and I. I wish I had some advice that if I had it to do over again it would've fixed the situation and protected my mom while still keeping our family intact, but I still don't see how I could've done it differently unless I just butted out and let him take her money and left her struggling.\nJust be cautious, maybe consider talking to a trusted financial advisor (maybe someone your parents trust too? is there a financial advisor they've had for a long time that you could talk to as well who could give some respected input?). Situations like these have destroyed many families which is maybe inevitable, but if there's a way to do it that keeps your family intact then make sure you're considering all angles and taking it slow beforehand so there's less regret down the road.

I know there's a term for this, and I don't know the term, but basically, they aren't legally competent to sign contracts and such - you would do it for them. If they're not willing to sign but they really can't make good decisions for their future, you can get it through a court. This would protect them from not just your sister, but from phone scammers and such. Then you manage the bills or put them on auto pay, and they get a card with like $200 limit that you pay off every month.\nYou could also just play hard ball and decide that you're willing to protect your parents at the cost of the relationship with your sister - and say that you will not agree to the gift of $4K. It will only be a loan, and if she doesn't pay it back, it will come out of her portion of the inheritance. If she's in real need of the money, she might finally agree. If she's not, then who cares?\nAnd then, you might want to consult with a lawyer about how to protect your parents specifically from your sister. Because financial abuse is a thing, and since they're old they might have special legal protections and you might, maybe, be able to get a legal order to prevent her from trying to go behind your back to get money from them.\nAlso, this other brother who took a loan from your parents 15 years ago and never paid it back? Make sure that's listed as a debt owed to the estate and consider legal action to get a judgement on it if he won't even pay payments toward it. If they're just using your parents as a piggy bank, then be their protector. If they care about your parents, then they should be willing to pay it back.\n&#x200B;\nEdit: (forgot to add) you can also sign over these responsibilities to a 3rd party like a financial manager who is legally obligated to act in your parent's and their estate's best interest.

I got some help for school, but nothing compared to room, board and tuition as they did, and they would not even co-sign a loan for a vespa for me so that I did not have to ride my bike 11 miles to school....  So things were uneven and probably it was because I was not particularly obedient.  Once I married and had a child they seemed to start to feel the guilt and helped me out with buying a house.  Still, the scales were totally skewed.  It's ok though because I tend to land on my feet...  Those 22 miles of bike a day were also really helpful for long term muscle building.",

        "text": "Hey there, sounds like you've got a lot going on!\nI'm not from your area, so not sure what your process is for diagnosis and stuff, but getting  support is important for her, and you. First step should be your doctor - call them and have a chat to see what they suggest. It may be you discuss it with her head on, or maybe a sneaky trip out and call at the doctors 'to pick something up' while you're out..  speaking with the doctor first will help figure out how to approach it.\nSocial services should be able to advise on what support's available in your area. Worth a chat even if it's just that for now. There may be advice and support you can use now, and it's worth knowing what help you can get if and when things get more difficult.\nGreat that you're doing her meals so she's eating healthy. Where's she getting the twinkies from? Can you just stop buying them? The main thing is her health, so if eating them is causing a risk for her diabetes, then they need to stop. If it's not causing a problem, it's probably not worth the argument. Hard to say what to do if they do need to stop - you could 'clean her room and find them' and bring it up gentley? Or offer healthier snacks for if she's getting hungry? It's not uncommon though for people with dementia to gain a sweet tooth!\nWith your child? Eek, not even a parent my self! with dementia, it's easier to try and avoid confrontation, so either let things slip if she's just being critical, or if she's telling you to do things a particular way, maybe reply 'that's a great idea, I'll try it later', or that your child's sticking to a routine for now, and hopefully it'll go forgotten?\nGood luck with things!",

So if your state has laws like California did, he can get a card and you can sign up as his Caregiver, which means you can purchase, transport, prepare, and administer, but not take any yourself.  That's usually cheaper.\nYou'll want to look up studies (Doctors like Pubmed studies, but using a pot website to find the studies themselves might be easier because some of the studies are written very med-speak-ish) to print out and bring to the doc.  This isn't to get a pot recommendation, this is to ask the doc if there's any contraindications with your husband's current meds.  To keep the doc from immediately getting all defensive, the conversation should go something like this: \"Here are husband's meds.  I've found all these studies on how Cannabinoids reduce anxiety and seizures (hand them over), so I need to know if there are any possible negative interactions between his meds and cannabis, please, before we try them.\"\nAbout Cannabis: we don't know enough about it yet.  We do know that pot has a boatload of different things in it, some of which are good, some which do harm, and some of which could go either way.  For instance, CBD is great at managing my dysmenorrhea and anxiety, but we know that THC actually accelerates HPV tumor growth.  Additionally, the first six or a dozen times you try it, you'll get bigger reactions than the twentieth and all those after that, just like alcohol.  With those things in mind, go slow with this drug.\nStart with whole leaf if you can, it'll have all the stuff that might be helpful.  Derivatives from whole leaf (edibles, tinctures, vape, etc) will have less of the chemicals that might do the job.  Just a simple pipe (tobacco pipes work fine) and microdose.  Take a few leaves (not a whole bowl, that's for bigtime smokers, not small fries like me and most noobies) and smoke 'em.  Microdosing means you're taking such a little tiny amount that there's barely any noticeable smoke, and it certainly shouldn't make you cough.  You'll feel the effects in 1-10 minutes, and then it'll wear off in 1-4 hours.  There shouldn't be much, if any, feelings of being \"high\", though it should reduce anxiety.  Like pain meds, it's not that you suddenly feel happy, it's just that the bad stuff has gone away.  If you don't feel anything after 30 minutes, take another puff.\nEdibles: edibles are usually dosed out in 5mg pieces.  That's a dose for a regular user!  If you want to start with edibles, nibble a corner.  1mg or less is usually plenty, and they'll last 4-24 hours, averaging 6-8 hours.  Take a little, wait 8 hours (yes really), and then try it again with a larger dose until you get a good reaction.  Honestly \"good reaction\" can be as simple as \"reduction of the pain/anxiety/yelling/number of seizures\".  Some folks never feel \"high\", just less awful.  \nGood luck!",

They are such a supportive group of people - extremely kind. Now all else I know is from what I've read online: https://www.guardiancarers.co.uk/care-information/feelings-being-carer. \nCarer guilt is so common and it's nothing you should be ashamed of. As much as you love your husband, you need to look after yourself too. I suggest you take some time for yourself. For me, meditation in the morning worked. (To be honest, I did not live in the same house as my grandmother, but it was still very demanding caring for her almost every day). Try to meet some friends for even one hour or speak on the phone to whoever you're close to and might understand. Also, if you feel like your husband is too dependent on you, have you given any thought to getting a carer to come in for a few hours per day? Or even per week? This would also offer you some time to focus on yourself and your health.",

Sit in a place which is comfortable for you (on the floor with your legs crossed, on the bed, etc) and breathe in and out counting to 8 with each breath in and out. Just clear your mind. Open the window and focus on what you hear outside (birds chirping, children laughing). I think it'd be a good start. \nIf you have some time to go out by yourself I suggest museum open nights. It's full of nice people and it's a nice way to socialise without any stress. You can get involved in talks and all sorts of activities there.",

Ergo, it is futile to try to reason with him. Never waste time trying to reason with the unreasonable.\n\n\nHe needs to be in a memory care live - in facility.  The sooner, the better.  His hygiene is probably going sharply down, and they know how to deal with that. It should be a locked facility for the safety of the patients, who will try to escape, usually during the night. \n\n\nIf he gets moody, and he definitely will, don't get pulled into it.

Remembering that reasoning is futile, Here's a tactic which works :  distraction. And your imagination is free here. \"Hey! I can make a fish face! Look at my fish face! Can you make a fish face?\"   Or a tender hand hold, back scratch, face caress.\n\n\nOr simply a change of scenery, as in, let's go for a walk! Whatever it takes, distract away from bad behavior.

You may have to ask some helpers to wait out of sight until he can calm down. This will occur more and more often as the dementia progresses.\n\n\nAt least one person close to him needs to see him several times a week, just to cheer him up and check on general conditions. The family needs to be kept updated on his condition. \n\n\nPlease get a lawyer to get all the papers set up, powers of attorney, will and executor, and someone needs to be on all his accounts to manage his bills.

If you're father starts crying , try to comfort and listen. Many people just want to be listened to , let him know everything will be ok and that you're there for him. Ask if hes pain or if he wants to go for a walk or to the bathroom, sometimes the freakouts could be a signal of something else he might need. If he gets angry try to redirect his attention and agree while doing so. Never engage in a physical altercation, always give him some space if you can and change the subject. If you anymore questions feel free to ask",

Dementia, sadly, is so common now that there are facilities who cater only to residents coping with dementia. My dad was very flirtatious and often inappropriate with care staff. But they are trained to manage those behaviors, which are not uncommon with this disease. I promise you that no matter how bad or embarrassing you perceive his behavior to be, caregivers have seen worse! \nMy siblings and I are all about the TEAM approach to our journey with this disease. We ask for help any time we are overwhelmed. And currently we are working with a social worker ourselves. She is helping us find resources to help our dad be the best he can be and she is also helping us manage our health/emotions. I am sure there is some sort of local 'healthy aging' agency you could look into. \nI would also say that there is no shame in asking for help and at least contemplating finding a care facility for your dad. My dad has been in one for about 3 years now. He ADORES the people who take care of him and I have seen so many residents move there quite sad and isolated at first. But they blossom with the energy and attention they receive. They join social activities and make new connections. \nSend me a pm any time if you'd like to talk more - this is really hard stuff.

Contact your local Area on Aging (every county has one).  They will send out someone to evaluate your Grandfather and then make recommendations on ways to help you guys.  They may recommend an aide come in to help, or they may recommend him going into Memory Care.  They will also help explain financial help available.\nI\u2019m glad that you\u2019re able to help your Mother cope with all of this.

Talking to others who have been in your shoes is an excellent first step toward relief.\nSome great advice has already been offered for how to enlist some experienced help outside of your family and get some respite from the stress - follow it. It\u2019s so important to carve out some time to participate in the activities that restore your own well-being so that you have the strength you\u2019ll need in the marathon ahead. \nAll of the symptoms you\u2019ve described for your Grandpa sound exactly like what we experienced with my dad in his last 4ish years. It was so very hard to see him in that state (knowing he had no control) and exhausting to always be on guard trying to protect him from hurting himself while buffering his constant inappropriate behavior toward others (especially everyone trying to care for him). My dad also had very scary paranoid delusions for a time and it was awful to think that he was living in such fear. It helped a bit to get educated on how to best communicate with a person who has dementia and finally accept that it was okay to use \u201ctherapeutic fibs\u201d to comfort & redirect his worries.\nThere did come a time when we could no longer manage caring for Dad at home. By this time, he could no longer walk on his own, was on 24/7 highflow oxygen (which he would forget to wear and then pass out), and was totally incontinent. We were fortunate to find a \u201cpersonal care home\u201d near us with just 5 other patients and a rotating staff of loving professional caregivers who could help him without being devastated by the experience (as we family members now were). This allowed us to visit daily and return home afterward with peace of mind knowing he was in great hands. We also had great daily communication with the staff so we knew what was going on throughout the day even if we weren\u2019t there physically.\nPaying for this type of care is very expensive and difficult for most families. We were fortunate to have enough savings available to afford this place for the 6 months until he passed at age 86, but our plan if he had lived beyond the savings was to spend down until he qualified for Medicaid and do the best we could with those benefits (likely requiring a move to a larger memory care facility that would accept Medicaid rates). He was also a veteran with full military benefits for service-related disability, so we had another option to pursue there (our state\u2019s nursing homes for veterans), if it came to that.\nWishing you strength & comfort.",

I can tell Google to play something on YouTube or Netflix (though I don't usually do this option) on the living room TV. It turns the tv on and starts plays video. For YouTube, I think you can tell Google to skip to the next video.\nI got it originally to help my grandmother, but she's never been big into tech and doesn't try. She knows the Google Home Mini can tell the weather, so she'll ask me to ask Google the weather etc.\nLooks like for Netflix, I had to specify what show exactly for Google to start on the TV. I just tried Hallmark movie or play Netflix, but it didn't like those commands. And it may all be connected thru my phone, so if your mother doesn't have a smart phone, I'm not sure if it'd work, but it may.

Apparently about 10% of women get really hammered by menopause, especially in terms of memory and cognitive processing. Hormone replacement can help. Using only estrogen is safer in terms of cancer. \nI'll be thinking of you and hoping for a good prognosis. If you want to talk to someone in a similar situation, please do get in touch.

Look up the doctor, \"Dr. Dale E Bredesen\" He has literally reversed cognitive decline in 100 clinical patients diagnosed, truly -- with Early Stage AD, MCI, etc. He has also published a book called, \"The End of Alzheimers\" back in 2017. (I would strongly suggest buying this book)\nHe has found the root cause of cognitive decline is lack of vitamins/minerals, healthy fats, hormone imbalances, heavy metals (if you have amalgam fillings, replace them ASAP with a   S.M.A.R.T dentist. Conventional dentists just drill them out. Amalgam is at least 50% mercury by weight, and is a known neurotoxin. S.M.A.R.T dentists use the right protocol to safely remove those fillings. Wait three months after removing, then chelate orally by using the Dr. Cutler Protocol)\n&#x200B;\nIn order to see the root cause of your memory impairment, you need testing done by a Bredesen trained specialist. If you're curious to find out more, look up this group on facebook, \"The Bredesen Protocol Unaffiliated\"\n&#x200B;\nI have genuinely talked to people on this group that were diagnosed, made lifestyle changes, and their memory was basically normal.\n&#x200B;\nYoutube Dr. Bredesen. Buy the book. Join the Unaffilated facebook page. The page is a great place to ask questions, see others' stories on improvement.\n&#x200B;\nEDIT: One last thing, the subreddit \"early onset\" the redditor placed below... Looking through it, these folks are on the right track. Supplements, sleeping at least 8 hours or more. What the Bredesen Protocol does, is compound all of this together. Dementia isn't just a one shot, fix all. You have to see what th root cause is... Whether or not you are APOE4 (which definetly contributes to early onset. If you are APOE4, going on a keto diet will be extremely beneficial) Fat is key. Especially if you're APOE4. If you wish to check your status, 23andme offers a health aspect. Even if you find you're not APOE4 on 23andme, you can grab it's raw file, and upload it to a site called Promethus - there it'll show if you're APOE3, APOE2, etc. Finding out your APOE is an important step. Different diet perhaps.\n&#x200B;\nAsking questions on the Bredesen Protocol Unaffiliated will clarify any questions you have.\nStart small. Don't panic, you got this!\n&#x200B;\n&#x200B;\n(And no, this isn't me trying to make a sale. I have a family member I've been concerned about, and have been really taking the time to look further.)",

        "text": "Gosh, that sounds rough. I'm so sorry.\nI think most people here aren't in a position to say \"yep, that's dementia.\" Reddit isn't a great diagnostic tool. However, I can say that I saw (and still sometimes see) lots of those behaviours in my own mum who struggles with vascular dementia. And yet, the rapid onset of your dad's symptoms strikes me as peculiar (hers developed over a much longer period). Also, there are loads of things (as simple as an infection that can clear up with some antibiotics) that can create those kinds of symptoms. So for now, it's tough to say. Make sure you ask lots of questions when he sees his doctors, and don't be afraid to reach out to them in confidence before or after your dad visits. Although doctors won't be able to give you info about your dad without his explicit consent, you can certainly give info to his doctors.\nOn the journey to my mum's diagnosis, and also in seeking help for care after she was diagnosed, having really detailed accounts of her symptoms was helpful. While you wait for your dad's doctors to do what they need to do, maybe you can concentrate on doing this work? You could also confirm that your dad has a POA set up so that if you and your family do need to act on his behalf, you're in a position to do so. If he doesn't have a POA set up, look into your legal options ASAP. Some things become impossible after diagnosis. I'd also suggest checking in with your mum. For every worry you have, she likely has just as many that are exacerbated by being with your dad full time. Encourage her to reach out to pals, and volunteer to hang out with your dad while she's away so she doesn't have to worry about him. If she doesn't have close friends or family she can talk to, see if you can help connect her with a support group. A lot of people feel the need to tough it through the hard stuff in life, but self care is really important, and will become exponentially so if it turns out he does have dementia. \nIt's really hard not to fret when the possibility of dementia is on the table. Of course, we are all different, but focussing on what I could do (rather than simply worrying) helped me be the best I could for my mum. I'm sure there are other things you can do, beyond what I've just suggested, so if you find yourself stuck in worry then I'd encourage you to think about how you can act.\nAnd do come back here to talk if you feel the need. Worrying and feeling alone sucks. We can all listen and offer ideas when possible. \nGood luck, and hugs.",

Going back and forth will give her expectations you may not want to fulfill - i.e. that you will always bail the situation out. Hard talks are needed. Your mother, you, your brother, and the doctor (or an intermediary like a therapist for the family or social worker) need to discuss what happens if your brother does get the trach and is total care for everything. ALS is terminal and you are right to belabour that point. Everyone in the picture of the terminally ill patient needs to be realistic (yet also positive) about the situation going forward.  \nYes, your brother can live with a trach for an indeterminate period of time. What quality of life does he desire? Is he enjoying his life currently? How about your mother, is she getting days off and does she feel comfortable with the knowledge that when it is her time to be taken care of, she may not have that nest egg nor the family caregivers (you) around her to aid her in her own ill health? What happens if you get sick or injured while you are unemployed and helping family? All of these things are important. Your therapist is right - this won't last forever. But it can go on for several years up to two decades in some cases - the trach just takes over breathing until the muscles of the body finally give up.  \nI don't think you are wishing death to your brother but I do think you are going through a grieving process of your own right now - the life that could have been had, the stress on your family, and the prospect that this could go on for years. Decide what you are willing to do for your mother and brother first, talk it over with your therapist, talk it over with them, then help your mother plan for extra assistance - stuff like another caregiver, extra tools in the home to aid her in caring for your brother, a weekly housekeeper, a respite day off.",

I know that he is the one that doesn\u2019t trust them, but it\u2019s you or your mom (or both of you) who come flying to the rescue every time he yells. These are medical professionals who have been trained for the job at hand.  Just because he had an incident doesn\u2019t mean they are all incompetent.  \nExplain to your brother that your mom can\u2019t keep doing the work that they are suppose to be doing.  She\u2019s too exhausted, mentally and physically.  Tell him that he\u2019s going to have to let them take care of him while mom rests. He\u2019s not a child. He can do it.  And that you are returning home, because you have to return to your job (or whatever). And then do it!  He won\u2019t like it at first and will probably kick up a fuss. But stick it out and he will see that they know what they\u2019re doing. That will be a major milestone for both of you.\nAnd I\u2019m not sure why you come home every time he\u2019s hospitalized.  I take that back.  I would come home, but once they were sure he was going to make it, I would go back home.  You may only be gone a day or two. Your mom has plenty of hired help to get him home and settled back in. That\u2019s their job, let them do it.\nNeither of you can continue at the pace you\u2019re going. You will start losing things, like your job, your girl, etc.  Your mom will lose her health and possibly prematurely her life.  All for something that can be changed, although it will be hard.  But it will be worth it in the end.",

Of course you love him and your mom and want to help, but you shouldn\u2019t be expected to sacrifice everything for it. Perhaps you can talk to your mom about scheduling time when you go to help her every other weekend or something. Why have you been there for weeks or months when there\u2019s your mom and a caregiver? They should be enough for the majority of the time. And some may think I sound cold saying this, but you shouldn\u2019t be expected to drop everything every time he goes to the hospital. My husband had numerous hospital stays before we moved in with his parents that they didn\u2019t travel for. There wasn\u2019t really a need for them to. I also didn\u2019t expect them to drop everything to help unless they wanted to or I was desperate, and even now his care falls on me. They mostly help by keeping an eye on our son. \nIt really sucks your brother has ALS and is going downhill. It really sucks that it\u2019s terminal. But you don\u2019t need to put your whole life on hold when he has caregivers. Help is good when you can, but live your life.",

I became very shameless having nearly lost my mom at 16, my dad at 22 and my sister becoming permanemtly disabled when I was 24.\nSome friendly tips that actually work:\n1. I ask for whatever from whoever. The worst they can say is no.\n2. Sometimes you have to make anonymous calls to your own health insurance company and throw out a \"hypothetical\" like you're \"asking for a friend\" just to get a straight answer from an actual person.\n3. Unleash your inner Karen. Threaten to sue, cry at them, whatever gets the job done.\n4. Call and hang up until you either get someone in the phone who actually cares or who gives zero f*cks and will do whatever you want no questions asked. Its kind of terrifying to know that people like the latter exist in any work place but sometimes it's what you need to get the job done.\n5. Research the corporate/head office of whatever company is giving you trouble. Usually ltmc insurances and the like are umbrellaed under a larger group. Get to that corporate headquarters and leverage that contact to get what you want. I recently did this with a NYC agency. I went to the state department who superceeds them and after 2 months of getting nowhere with the city I sent 1 email to the state department, my phone was ringing off the hook the next morning with people suddenly BEGGING to help me!! And all this while in quarantine!! People are sooooo lazy until you figure out who they're boss is....Oh, super important, email and letters or faxes are best. People get terrified when their negligence is documented in writing.\n6. PATIENT ADVOCATE!!! If you're in a hospital find this person immediately. In the US most states have this and the patient advocate is required by law to report any wrong doing by the hospital. Sometimes rehabs have them too. The hospital will bend over backwards to make you happy. Guaranteed!!\n7. Worst case scenario there is the tride and truest tactic of all: unleash the media on those mofos. Granted, it has to be life or death, basically very severe situation with potentially catastrophic consequences- but yeah, get that local newspaper, tweet, post photos and docs (obviously block out sensitive info), local news stations, whoever picks it up. My mom had to do this at my elementary school when it started to go downhill. The media attention forced the school board to investigate and one of the teachers got charged for drug possession with intent to sell. My mom and the pta just thought she was showing up drunk to work, so you never know if a story is bigger than you think it is.\nHope this helps! Caregivers for life!!! \ud83e\udd18",

(This is to say: you can work with computers, phones, tablets, laptops, etc.) Which program to use depends a bit on your level of proficiency and on the kinds of devices your mum and you have (Android, Windows, Mac, etc.). A bit of googling should get you pretty far in finding a solution. \nNon-computer devices (like radios) are trickier. I'm not aware of any way to operate these remotely. This isn't to say that options don't exist, but just that I've not seen them. Something you may want to look into are devices custom-built for folks with dementia. I've seen one-button radios and simplified tv remotes, for instance. There are great phones which you can program with the names or photos of loved ones so that using the phone is a one-button project. You'll have to do a bit of digging around because they have so much on offer, but check out the Alzheimer's society store: https://www.alzstore.com/\nAnd ... If you're able, loop your grandma and godmother into how to use these tech. The grim truth is that everything you teach your mom now is likely to fade away. Having several people who can use the tablet, for instance, saves you being on call all the time, which I'm sure you're willing to be, but it can become relentless.\nGood luck!",

I\u2019m also going to buy him an android tablet to play with and control it using the same apps which may be helpful for you since you are already getting a new tv.  Could you post which tv you choose if you find one that can do remote stuff?\nI\u2019m using the programs parsec and teamviewer.  Both free.  You can control android tablets, raspberry pis, Mac and Windows PCs with these apps.  The only thing you can\u2019t control is an iPad though you can still see the screen with teamviewer.  You can use teamviewer on your own iPad though to control her windows pc.\nI like teamviewer in that it\u2019s easier to transfer files from my pc to hers with it.  And if for some reason your pc is logged out, you can log back in.  But with parsec, it\u2019s like your computer is her computer. \nSo the things I do with the tv now that I have a pc connected to it are that I can start up Netflix and watch something with him.  I\u2019ve got a chrome browser that is set up to three pages.  The first is YouTube saved with my playlist of exercise videos I can exercise with him on.  I might karaoke with him through YouTube as well.  I\u2019ve got another page saved to my comcast xfinity stream.  And then another I\u2019m thinking about setting with some online games like wheel of fortune or something.  The last page is to my Flickr album so I can share photos and videos with him to talk about what I\u2019ve been doing.  I guess I could give him a Bluetooth gamepad and play games with him too but that might be too complicated for him.  Maybe I\u2019ll do a playlist of music videos for him too for YouTube.\nI\u2019ve got Skype setup on the pc so that it automatically answers when someone calls him so I can Skype with him so he sees me on the big screen tv.  I gave my sisters the Skype number as well.  I gave him an old junky desktop though so am going to buy a webcam for the tv or take an old cell phone and use that as a webcam.\nThe android tablet will let me play touch screen games with him.  I might use the Facebook instagames as there are so many easy games lumped there.  Not sure yet as I haven\u2019t tested this out.  In general, I find bowling games to be easy as all you have to do is flick your finger.  Soccer goalie games too.\nShe will need decent upload speeds and you will need decent download internet speeds for this if you want things to look good on your end.  Without it, since it\u2019s all playing on her devices, she can still get great visuals but I\u2019m not sure if you will have problems seeing a movie or something streaming off her pc.  Also, streaming uses a lot of data FYI though unless you are already using tons, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be too bad if you have a decent amount of data.\nAnother option if this is too tech for you is Amazon echo show or google nest hub.  Those can allow automatic video call pickups.  I prefer Facebook portal for its big screen or tv setup but it doesn\u2019t have automatic call answer so that\u2019s a fatal flaw for me.  These devices can\u2019t do nearly as much as my pc with teamviewer and parsec setup can do but it\u2019s simpler (I find teamviewer and parsec to be easy too but it does require some work).\nAs far as her chores..  there are a ton of smart household devices out there.  It\u2019s just a matter of how much control you want to take and how much money you want to spend.\nEdit:  here\u2019s a smart remote too that sound like it can control anything that uses ir input.  Not sure how well it works though as I haven\u2019t tried it.  Reviews seem mixed so I personally hesitate in using it.  \nhttps://www.amazon.com/Logitech-915-000194-Harmony-Control-Smartphone/dp/B00ZYIFXSM/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&keywords=Smart+remote+control&qid=1588425806&sr=8-8",

        "text": "First, take a deep breath. This is actually very typical in a lot of cultures and even our own years ago, in the past families usually cared for their aging parents in home. It's worked for centuries and so it will work for you if you are willing to put in the effort and it seems you are. \nNow you MUST involve a lawyer. I'm not at this point with my parents yet so others could point you in a better direction as to which type but with all the legal odds and ends you'll have to bite the bullet and get one involved. Maybe your father already has a lawyer, if so it would be really good to touch base and if nothing else discuss the situation at least. It will definitely take some of the burden and ease your mind to an extent to get with a lawyer.\nAs for the rest, it's good to play second fiddle to your father's lead. The very worst for older adults is losing freedom and autonomy. It seems like you're doing well here, you're stepping back to see what he can and can't do. You're letting him do as much for himself as possible. Even if it seems like he doesn't, he does very much appreciate this. \nIf you ever find yourself extremely frustrated and overwhelmed, just think for a moment about how it must be for him. Neither of you wanted this situation and sometimes older adults can make it worse by bucking up and being contrary. It's so very hard for them to accept that this is their new reality. He doesn't want to impose on you and your life. The frustration from that alone is enough to cause some major issues all around.\nThe best course is to just keep at it like you are now. Give him as much space as possible. You all need to settle in and become comfortable in each other's constant presence for now. After an adjustment period, if things go smoothly, you'll find it gets easier and he may be ready to find hobbies and things to take up his spare time himself. \nIn college I had a few focused classes on the aged and how the Boomer generation is going to change how we approach older adults. They're nothing like generations past, they helped create the world as we know it today. Sitting on the porch and watching the world go by isn't going to be enough. \nI also suggest getting maybe a laptop specifically for him and programming it in a such a way he can re-learn or familiarize himself again with technology. He may get a few viruses and get frustrated but this may also help alleviate some of his stress. Going from being connected to totally unplugged doesn't feel good for anyone, older folks included.",

        "text": "First of all you have done GREAT so far! Your father is very lucky to have you. \nMy mom has dementia and I've had her next to me in my condo building for a couple years now. A few things I've learned:\nGet a durable power of attorney in place NOW. I can not stress this enough. If your dad continues to push back on this then you need to be VERY assertive and tell him (in whatever words feel right to you) that he can't have it both ways, depending on you, LIVING with you, and having you take care of 100 things but won't give you the authority you need to actually do those things. \nDementia is a horrible disease and it will test your patience like nothing else. My mom is also wary of \"giving up her independence\" meanwhile she depends on me for so much, after a year or so in I had to have a couple long talks with her about needing her cooperation or I was going to back out and she could do what she wanted ON HER OWN. \nIf that sounds harsh, I don't mean for it to sound that way, but if you don't get some control of the situation now and getting that DPOA it will be MUCH harder down the road. In fact at a certain point your dad will not be competent enough to sign legal documents and then you would be looking at guardianship which is a long and expensive process.\nAfter getting the legal papers, then you have to think of long term planning. This WILL disrupt your life. That is a GIVEN. My advice is to talk to your father now about what he both wants and expects for HIS elder care needs. The sad reality is that caring for a dementia patient in a private home is rarely doable without massive burnout on the part of the caretaker. At some point if your dad lives long enough (and many do) he will likely need a memory care facility. \nWith my mom I told her I would do what I could to keep her in her own place as long as possible, and we would hire help as her needs increased. I told her that if it got to a point that she was not safe to be alone even with some hired help then we would have to find her a nice facility close by so I could visit frequently. She seems okay with this plan. \nGood luck.",

        "text": "You are off to a great start! You are in an overwhelming and difficult position, but you can and will get through this. My FIL who had dementia lived with us as well, so I understand how overwhelmed you feel. A few things to consider:\n\nYou are wise to see an attorney. It is best to see a certified Elder Law attorney if possible because they are the most knowledgeable in this area. They can likely connect you to a good real estate attorney for the sale of properties as well. If you are in a different state you should see probably consult with one where you will be living as states have different policies. \nConsider looking for a certified move manager. They also specialize in working with older adults in these situations. They will organize, pack, sell selected items, dispose of what is left, etc. If you google certified move manager you can find one in your area. \nExplore selling the home as-is. It will be much less stressful. Hopefully the proceeds from the sale of assets will give you a little bit to work with for his care.\nContact your local area agency on aging. They can connect you to any assistance and programs that may be available and are usually a wealth of information. Find your agency here:  https://eldercare.acl.gov/Public/About/Aging_Network/AAA.aspx \nContact the Alzheimer's Association for caregiver support. Programs vary by location, but they have SO MUCH available. Find your local chapter here:  https://www.alz.org/local_resources/find_your_local_chapter \nCheck with your local pharmacy about the packaging of Dad's meds. Most can put them in pill packs labeled with date and time to be taken. It will make meds management much easier for you and will be good if you are able to have help once at some point.\nConnect with a certified home care agency to see what might be available. Even if you can't afford much, a couple hours a week will allow for you to get a bit of time away. (This is so important.) Here is a questions to ask worksheet you can use:  https://polkeldercare.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Form-Home-Care-Questions.pdf \nCheck with your local police department to see if they have any programs related to dementia response. Some communities have registries that you can participate in and do well checks or can more easily locate family when someone wanders.\nMost communities have so many hidden resources. The Chamber of Commerce & City Hall are good places to gather resources and programs like Meals on Wheels will also be able to clue you in about what else might be available in your community. Some communities even have adult day care programs that would be helpful when you return to work.\n\nI hope some of this information is helpful. If you have any other questions I can help with please ask. I'm happy to help if I can.",

His wife's insurance money will come in handy once that gets settled. \n- Put his name in for an Assisted Living residence close by - you do not have to take the placement if his name comes up quickly, but some places have long waiting lists. My mother's place has Assisted Living and Memory Care in the same residence, just different floors. It seemed to be a humane set up, so they don't have to move to a whole new place if they need more services. \n- If he is still driving, it might be time to check out alternatives. Before my stepdad even started hallucinating, he would get lost and sometimes even ended up in the ditch. Finally his kids started \"borrowing\" his car for weeks at a time until he was diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia and was told not to drive. \n- Check to see if he is getting all the financial aid and services he is allowed. Many places have Senior's Social Workers that can help with that - your town/city likely has a Seniors' Center that can point you in the right direction for many things - including caregiver supports and day programs. \n- It sounds like you are doing all you can so far.

Then, day after day after day, he says \"I know you hate cooking on the grill\" or \"you're the only person I know who doesn't like steak on the grill\" - or to our adult child, \"your mom hates the grill, so maybe the next time you're here, you'd cook for me?\" WTF?\nAnd - being unwashed.

Everyone I talked to about it would shrug it off, saying that he's always been forgetful. It took losing his job and NUMEROUS talks to get him to the doctor. Even then, I had numerous doctors brush me off without a proper diagnosis. First his primary physician and then, a strongly recommended neurologist. The second neurologist brought him in for a PET scan (insurance agencies want every single test done before this, because it's pricey) and we finally received the diagnosis the week that our state went into shut down. If there's anything this journey has taught me, it's to trust your gut. You know him more than any doctor who spends 1 hour doing a simple memory test does. Find a doctor who listens and respects you. It will make all of the difference. \n&#x200B;\nIf you're curious about my journey:\n\nCall and ask primary care physician to do memory test during physical, don't receive feedback, says he's fine\nSix months later, receive concerned call from employment saying they cannot have him on a job site any longer\nCall primary physician again, do exact test but demand referral\nGet blood test immediately\nGet MRI test\nAfter waiting three months, finally get in to see a psychiatrist and wait for a 6 hour intense memory training\nAfter waiting two more months, receive feedback and spend 40 minutes talking to psychiatrist\nGet referred to Neurologist, wait at least two months for appointment\nMeanwhile, get recommended another Neurologist, get in within 1 month\nSpend 40 minutes doing very similar memory test primary physician did, get told it's nothing but a fluke and get recommended sleep study\nGo to sleep study, do take home sleep study, find out there's some minor sleeping problems\nWait a month, do an overnight sleep test. He can't sleep with the equipment on. That entire ordeal is a wash and I choose not to go forward, knowing he won't wear a sleep mask.\nFinally get an appointment with the original neurologist, get assigned another MRI, another blood test and never-done-before PET scan\nDo all three, takes about two months to fit in\nReturn for proper diagnosis, turns out the PET scan wasn't sent to neurologist, entire appointment unnecessary since neurologist can't make a diagnosis.\nDrive home, find out on drive home what the diagnosis was and cry in the car for 20 minutes.\n\nI didn't even mention issues regarding accounting, law, employment and general every day life things. It's a very challenging job, although with you being his wife, you don't have to jump through as many hoops as I have had to in order to even begin aiding with his medical journey. I chose to share this info with you because I desperately needed an outline of what to expect. I strongly recommend you find a support group near you. If not, groups on Facebook and Reddit have been extremely helpful answering questions, sharing information and giving me a place to connect and not feel alone. The neurologist sent me this book that was helpful understanding the best way to communicate with some with alzheimers: Learning to Speak Alzheimer's: A Groundbreaking Approach for Everyone Dealing with the Disease\n&#x200B;\nGood luck with you journey, and again, don't let anyone doubt yourself! Once you have a diagnosis and learn to communicate with someone with alzheimers, things will ease up. They're difficult, but you will treat him with the same leniency you would give a child. You'll feel more forgiving.",

My heart goes out to you because the lack of insight into their situation is so difficult to manage & it really can feel like, in terms of mitigation, you \"solve\" one problem, only to uncover 50 more. First off, I'm so glad that your Dad has family that clearly love him, care for him & want him to have a safe, happy quality of life. The tests that will be done, neurologically, SHOULD reveal enough to the physician, but I would also make a list with approximate dates with the type of things you've mentioned here, & give that to the Dr. (out of view if this will upset Dad) to give them a much more well rounded history of what's been going on & for how long. You could also call in advance & ask to speak to the Neurologist yourself, to give them a heads up. Not sure what the POA situation is with your Dad, but in my personal experience, it doesn't get better than it is currently, so if he's struggling with knowing if a bill is indeed a bill, it's time to look at ways protect him, & his finances, so that you know that his needs will be met, safely & it removes the responsibility & worry from him. I know this is scary & overwhelming but you're not alone. Be as calm as you can, as descriptive as you can & as persistent as you need to be to get the requisite people to pay attention & to help your Dad get the assistance with care that he 100% needs. A diagnosis opens doors. Thinking about you both. Please let us know how it goes. Xo",

She\u2019s been falling more and doesn\u2019t carry her phone around with her.  Once I strap the watch to her wrist she can make calls from anywhere, and if the watch detects a fall and you don\u2019t press a button within a certain amount of time it notifies EMS and your emergency contacts.  I work 12 hour days an hour from home, so this is essential.  You can even shower with it.  Plus I got her a red band and case, her absolute favorite color, so she is happy to wear it.\nThe only vital it monitors is heart rate I think, but you can manually enter others on your phone to track.  If you are an Android user you can probably find a similar product from Samsung or something.\nAlso, LPT:  I am an ER nurse, and talked to some paramedic friends about how they gain access to a home if the occupant is unable to get the door,like if they fall and can\u2019t get up and no one else is home.  Apparently, they normally call law enforcement to gain access.  However, and this is US/state of FL, but I would guess would work elsewhere, you can call non-emergency dispatch and leave instructions on where to find a key, so they can get inside faster and with less property damage.  (We ordered a cast iron hedgehog hide a key for the flower bed from Amazon.)",

What happens to a lot of us is that we follow the path of least resistance and it\u2019s not until we are in unbelievable emotional pain that we look around and say, \u201cHow did I get to this point?\u201d\nSo, you have the characteristics of depression and Anxiety (Fear). So do I. One of those characteristics is thinking that you are trapped and have no control over anything in your life. Well, you do!\nFind a therapist online. You need to talk to someone who will listen. Your GM is wrapped up in herself and honestly doesn\u2019t \u201csee\u201d you. \nLike every other human with anxiety issues, you have used faulty logic. You do not need a college degree for a job anymore. One of my children has a Masters and no job- actually hates what he got degree in. Go to a community college and get a vocational certification. Dental hygiene, LPN, whatever. Contrary to popular belief, your job does not have to be your passion. It can just pay the bills so you can afford to do what you want outside of work. Bake, garden, hike, whatever!\nDecide what you actually want to do- set goals. Pick one or two and WRITE DOWN the steps you will have to take to get there-Action Plan. Divide your goals into short term and long term. \nYou do not have to be your GM\u2019s live in caretaker! Slavery has been abolished! Please, please, please find a way to live your own life- whatever it may be. Your GM has had hers so far, obviously got married, had children, had her own house, etc. You are worthy! You are worthy of your own life! You are worth so much more than being an unpaid caregiver. \nMake the leap!",

Can you scrape up enough money for a doctor's appt?  I know it's expensive but the doctor could prescribe you an effective, generic anti-depressant.  There's so many helpful anti-Ds now that have lost their patents and so are cheap now.  You'll need to explain to the doctor your insurance/financial situation so they prescribe something generic and affordable.  A good anti-depressant and appropriate dose can help both your depression and anxiety.  I've taken Effexor for 20 yrs and it has really helped me manage my generalized anxiety, more so than depression even.  Once you get in a good place with your mental health, you can be in a better place to manage your gramma and her mental health and unreasonable demands. Make that doctor appointment!",

        "text": "Oh dear, so sorry to hear of the loss of your dad. For full disclosure, I am a founder of a comprehensive global medical alert and emergency ID system called iCE Angel - ID. We use two \"trigger\" points for an emergency alert: (i) app panic buttons on Apple and Android phones and watches that are good to use if your mum is conscious and able at the time; and more significantly (ii) QR codes that can be scanned with any phone by any rescuer or passer-by if your mum is unconscious or unable to self-help. \nFrom an aesthetic point of view, our panic button is an app on the phone or watch; while the QR code is given to you in two downloadable template formats (a) as an emergency ID card on a wallet-sized template that you can self-print and laminate as many as you want (I leave them in my wallet, on the back of my phone cover, on my bike, and in each of my backpacks) and (b) as emergency ID photo image to place on your phone\u2019s lockscreen. In addition, you could also (c) create your own wearable IDs by printing the QR code on anything else, for example, I\u2019ve engraved mine on an army-type dog tag. FYI, all medics worldwide are trained to look for medical alerts in wallets, wristband, necklace, and phones. \nThe two aforementioned trigger options \u2013 panic button and QR code - are independent of each other, meaning you can use either or both, but in all cases, phone numbers will automatically be exchanged between the person initiating the trigger (in this case - your mum, or her rescuer) and the emergency contact persons (in this case - you) so that a call can be initiated by either party. In all cases, you will also receive emergency text notification via various channels like email / app push message / FB messenger to ensure you SEE the emergency alert because incoming voice calls alone can too easily be missed or unanswered during our regular busy lives \u2013 whereas emergency text messages are very \u201cin your face\u201d. Once you open the alert you can also see the pinned location point of where the alert was triggered. All the above is free forever for a single user (one account, one user). \nWe have a premium upgrade option that enables the account holder (for example you) to add an administer up to four additional \u201cdependent\u201d members via your account (for example mum, grandpa, and two young kids) who are not tech-savvy enough or too young to administer their own accounts. And you are able to upload and securely store a very comprehensive \u201cRescue wallet\u201d for every member that includes insurance details, medical history, living wills, organ donor status, and other emergency records. For security and privacy, the Rescue Wallet is only ever shared with the member\u2019s nominated emergency contact person(s), and only when an alert has been triggered. It is up to the emergency contact person to then use their discretion and to when to on-share the Rescue wallet and with whom. The premium upgrade is only USD 15 per YEAR \u2013 and right now we\u2019re in the midst of a 3-month #TWOL campaign where we\u2019re giving away 100% of our revenue to several amazing organisations around the world that leverage the funds to sustain starving daily wage workers.

I'm not sure if trying to prove her how she is repeating stuff or that she has other problems is going to be helpful, since it may turn you into an antagonist in her mind. The fear of losing our faculties and not being able to decide over our own life anymore is very pronounced (and with good reason) in the elderly. \nI'd maybe try to go the route of her close friends, and ask one or two of them to sit down with you and describe what is happening when they are not around. Right now, your mom is getting reinforcement from them that isn't actually doing her any good, and it would be better if you could get them as your allies. It also can be difficult for people to accept input from their children, due to an often unwelcome reversal of the parent-child roles, but they are more ready to accept it from friends or other people similar in age and perceived authority. \nOne thing that definitely needs to be checked out is if your mom has a UTI. Especially in older people, those can lead to exactly the kind of odd behaviour you have described. That could be something you could ask one of the friends to present to your mom as their suggestion, so it doesn't hit the wall your mom has put up against input from you and others she wants to put up a strong and capable front for. The important thing is to get her to see a doctor, and if that needs to happen with conviction by proxy, so be it.",

        "text": "Just a public service announcement: UTIs are commonly diagnosed in older patients as a cause of altered mental status but this is not really an evidenced based practice. Providers frequently jump on a UTI as a cause of non specific symptoms based on results of a urinalysis or a positive urine culture, neither of which are tools that can really identify a UTi, rather they should be used to support a diagnosis of a UTI based on symptoms. The problem with this is the provider then stops looking into other causes of the altered mental status if they exist like medications or the patient gets put on unnecessary antibiotics which can cause side effects or Colonization with resistant bacteria that make real infections more difficult to treat. In a patient who is able to detail the presence of UTI symptoms (pain when urinating or urinary frequency, flank pain, among others), the absence of these almost always means it\u2019s not a UTI. I would not suggest pursuing treatment for UTIs for older patients when they aren\u2019t complaining of symptoms consistent with a UTI. -Infectious Disease pharmacist",

Blood and stool specimens were collected at baseline, after completion of the 2-month treatment, and 3 months after discontinuation of therapy. Frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were used for immune cell profiling. Stool samples were used for 16S rRNA profiling and metabolomics.\nResults:\u00a0Probiotic administration increased the abundance of several taxa known to be depleted in MS such as Lactobacillus. We found that probiotic use decreased the abundance of taxa previously associated with dysbiosis in MS, including Akkermansia and Blautia. Predictive metagenomic analysis revealed a decrease in the abundance of several KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways associated with altered gut microbiota function in MS patients, such as methane metabolism, following probiotic supplementation. At the immune level, probiotic administration induced an anti-inflammatory peripheral immune response characterized by decreased frequency of inflammatory monocytes, decreased mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD80 on classical monocytes, as well as decreased human leukocyte antigen (HLA) D related MFI on dendritic cells. Probiotic administration was also associated with decreased expression of MS risk allele HLA-DQA1 in controls. Probiotic-induced increase in abundance of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium was associated with decreased expression of MS risk allele HLA.DPB1 in controls.\nInterpretation:\u00a0Our results suggest that probiotics could have a synergistic effect with current MS therapies.

First of all, I should clarify that this is not an app for Alzheimer's patients- it is broadly an app for tracking elderly, that I hope could be applied to some segment of the elderly population with early stage Alzheimer's or Dementia. It may not do much good for an individual who requires round the clock in-person care and supervision already.\nThere were several themes in the design of Peace of Mind:\n- First, no manual data entry. As you correctly point out, many elderly individuals would not do well with self report. Those who could, would rather not. Therefore, the entire app is automatic AI-based activity and behavior recognition algorithms: no manual data entry required. Its quite possible with today's wearable sensors like accelerometers, gyroscopes, and GPS. \n- Secondly, this app is not just for making you aware of emergencies: its also tailored to allowing you to check in periodically and confirm that everything is OK. Hence the name \"Peace of Mind\". \nTo your point about carrying a smartphone at all times, I believe there are a couple form factors that might work. For example, there are some lanyard-style ways to carry phones I have seen- or a little leather pouch around the waist, for example, if the pocket is not convenient.\nThe app would regularly report location, location change, fitness history (daily steps, extended inactivity), stress, fall detection, and a host of other things. I'm happy to provide elaborations of how these things work in further detail if anyone is interested.\nIf you do decide to check out Peace of Mind, DM me and I am happy to give you gold membership for free, so you can try out the premium features (goal is not really to make money, but I had to add some monetization features because my server costs are sky high).",

        "text": "Thanks for clarifying! You've got some good ideas.\nI am trying to think of how an app like that would work for me and my situation. My dad has mild-moderate dementia, but is still fairly independent (he drives, is ok with all personal self-care such as dressing, etc.) but lives with me and I help him with a particular health issue and track all his meds, etc. He has a flip phone, though mostly it's just for habit because he rarely uses it, I think it is mostly a symbol of his \"independence\" by this point to have it clipped to his belt. I have tried many times to teach him what a smartphone is, with limited success. \nI have a gps tracker that I put in his car, and even though the battery is not great, at least it helps me be assured he is not lost. It requires a pricey yearly subscription, so if it was already built into another app that would definitely be a plus.\nI would definitely be interested in giving it a try. I could get him one of those very basic smartphones for seniors and talk to him about carrying it around for safety. He's gotten lost a few times and I know it kind of scared him so this would give us some peace of mind. \nDoes the app have a way to set medication reminders? \"Did you take your morning medicines?\" With a big yes/no button. That would be super useful.\nAnother would be to have a way for me to set a calendar with automatic reminders of upcoming medical appointments. He likes to know about what's happening in advance, so something like \"Reminder! You have an appointment with Dr. Smith tomorrow at 11:00am! Sally will be by to pick you up at 10:30am.\" With additional reminders closer to the time, say 30 minutes prior, or something.\nHow does the app measure stress levels? Can you expand on that?'\nAnyway, sure, I'll DM you. I'll give it a try.",

        "text": ">I have tried many times to teach him what a smartphone is, with limited success.\nI totally understand the struggle! If you could get him in the habit of carrying a smartphone around with him and charging it nightly, he would not need to interact with it in any other meaningful way for Peace of Mind to work. The app is very simple in its interface and really just runs in the background.\n> I would definitely be interested in giving it a try. I could get him one of those very basic smartphones for seniors and talk to him about carrying it around for safety. He's gotten lost a few times and I know it kind of scared him so this would give us some peace of mind.\nThat's great to hear! Hearing about someone interested in this (after all the world involved) is a huge morale boost for me. I'd love to keep in touch with you through the process to learn more about how your experience is going. When selecting an Android phone, please make sure it runs at least Android 7.0 or higher (almost all new phones do, but just double check). Also, Huawei on some occasions does not play well with background processes to save battery, which can be annoying. I believe Motorola phones are a good choice for this app, though it should work on almost everything.\n> Does the app have a way to set medication reminders? \"Did you take your morning medicines?\" With a big yes/no button. That would be super useful.\nAs far as medication reminders and appointments, unfortunately, no such functionality yet. I decided for this app to go with all automatic behavior monitoring, to distinguish myself from the other apps on the market (lots of them do alarms, reminders, medication, but very few are holistic behavior monitoring solutions). However, I am definitely open to expanding the app functionality in the future. I assume your yes/no button would be on the patient side of the app, encouraging them to manage their own medication, correct? Rather than reminding the caregiver to administer the medication on the caregiver app? \n> How does the app measure stress levels? Can you expand on that?'\nCurrent methods of stress assessment with wearables use heart rate variability, or galvanic skin response (usually the former, since the latter is overly noisy and requires special sensors). Since Peace of Mind is an app for phones rather than watches, in this case I do neither. Instead, I am estimating stress with several different metrics including (but not limited to) the following: - The number of times the phone screen is turned on and off recently - The number of times the device is picked up and put down recently - Any pacing behavior observed recently (transitioning from walking to idle rapidly, multiple times in the last few hours).\nIn addition to fusing this data into a single stress score that is graphed over time, I also provide a breakdown so you can observe individual metrics: fidgeting, restlessness, inactivity, etc. Of course this is by no means perfect, but my hope is that it adds another layer of actionable information into the app dashboard.\nThank you for your interest! Really appreciate your support. I'm happy to answer any other questions you may have.",

That means psychological care and medical.  \nTwo years ago I went to one of these places after I had weight loss surgery because I wasn't coping well and hurting myself due to ED and the surgery.  They had a residential program and I opted to be home since I lived two miles away.  I never have been immobile or waited on, but I have been enabled by a previous partner in the sickest way.  I contacted the staff (whom are wonderful, smart people) to see if taking on a case like this is going to be a major time investment.\nSo I figured a research-based facility would be more interested than dropping her into a care home alone (with no family) and just letting her die. \nThis is going to be terrifying for her to be removed of her enablers and she will be put on a limited diet no doubt in a home.  She'll need therapy most of all during this. \nMy step-dad and mom are super cruel to fat people and they have no compassion for this girl.

Pressing the button connects a person who will ask if everything is okay. If they can hear you, you say what's wrong, they send help. If they can't hear you (you're in the bathroom, it's too far away, etc.) they send help anyway. It's all very easy, there's nothing to charge.

It can be so difficult to get medical attention for a person who has cognitive problems, and that you've had your mom see several doctors is already an accomplishment. I know it doesn't mean much, but e-high-fives from an internet stranger. \nI don't know if I can offer specific advice as you will know your mom better than anyone. I can share my experience, though...\nI'd encourage you to think about having your mom declared incompetent. It 100% was a difficult day for me when I did as much for my mum, but it barely phased my mum. I got caught up in what it meant, but my mum just thought a rude lady came to visit and forgot all about it by the time we finished supper. In spite of my misgivings, what the declaration allowed me to do was to get my mum the care that she needed. At the end of the day, that was worth it. I don't know your mom, but I feel reasonably confident in saying that if she is resisting diagnosis and treatment now, she's not going to have a Eureka moment later on. Taking care of the legal stuff asap means that the distance between you and your mom's care gets much shorter. At the end of the day, if her care is your biggest priority, well ... It might be worth considering. (Depending on where you are in the world, there are likely other steps to getting authority to make decisions for your mom. You may wish to contact the local Alzheimer's Society for guidance on this.)\nBest wishes.",

        "text": "I actually just joined to ask for advice on this matter, but maybe I can help you with what I've found so far.\nOne thing to note, for those not aware, I purchased a life alert for my mother a few years ago,  without discussing this with her (life alert specifically asked/recommended if I had discussed this with her), and when it came in the mail, my mother was upset, and felt I was spending too much money, also felt as though she didn't need it.  She demanded I ship it back. Life alert will ship the unit, then schedule an appointment to get it set up. Because it wasn't set up, (3 year contract fulfilled), they allowed me to ship it back and only pay the nominal fee you agree to when it gets set up, as any company typically does.\nDiscuss this with your loved one before proceeding.\nI went down the rabbit hole of trying to find a solution, and they all seem to offer 8 out of 10 options, with it staggered between some offering some solutions, and others offering other solutions, but no-one offering and all-in-one solution.\nSome offer bulky watches that are not water proof, some offer lanyards that don't have a microphone, some offer all of the above, be require a specific carrier.\nThe big deal is the middle man. You may pay 40 dollars a month for a lanyard connected to your home wi-fi. This contacts an individual who will respond to the alert. They will initiate a call back, and further contact emergency medical if there is no response. \nFor 80 dollars a month, they will set up a stand alone modem/router using their own router and include an extra gadget, such as a button to put in the shower.\nFor the full 120 they will include many gadgets, such as watches, lanyards, stand-alone network  routers, etc.\nWe always just call 911 for emergencies.  The apple watch has the capability of initiating a 911 call during a fall detection. When a fall is detected, it sounds off a bell/buzzer for a minute or so to cancel the call. If the user doesn't cancel, it will alert medics. It will then also alert contacts that you have set up.  I wish it would contact the contacts prior to the 911. I'm still trying to get it set up. Maybe others could help?\nShe happened to get a bit wavy with the hands the other day, and I heard it go off, on her wrist, and she ignored it until I grabbed her wrist and said \"It's asking if there is an emergency,\" so take that with some salt and tequila.\nUser needs to be within range of the iPhone, through local wi-fi connection, unless you get a stand-alone network on the watch, which is extra phone service (30 dollars a month roughly).\nBecause my mother lives with me, I have also bought a bunch of local CallToYou bell chimes that are placed around the home, that she can use to alert me if there are any issues. They are just some remote buttons that sound a chime. Easy to set up, probably many others on the market that do the same thing, not trying to push them specifically.\nThe apple watch allows medical information to also be included with the 911 alert, I've got some of that set up, such as medications, but I can't link to her medical group.\nI've also heard of options/apps that you can put on the iPhone, that will contact third party before calling 911. This might be an option, but I haven't investigated too much yet.\nA combination of the above, and a consistent check in time might be best.\nThanks for listening.\nIf anyone would like to add to this, please do!

Which is related to 1) size (bigger = longer charge but harder to hide on someone\u2019s person,clothes, etc) and 2) the refresh rate (how often it pings the satellite) - more frequent pings = faster battery drain, less frequent pings = less good idea of where people get up to. That said, if your person doesn\u2019t walk around all day (like my dad) you could set it to refresh every 30 minutes and then refresh within the app to see where he is just at that moment. \nWe have it set for a refresh every 10 minutes, usually get 10-13 hours that way. \nThe tracki is about 2x2\u201d. It\u2019s ok on a keychain... idk about sewing it into clothes...  \nAccuracy isn\u2019t 100%, depends on the location (signal strength) and its good within a few blocks.

I found that a lot of caregivers feel this way, and they always listen (read) with an open mind.\nAbout your well-being, I think it is a good idea to keep in touch with you physician about your mental health as well as you weight. I have the exact same problems, so I relate to what you said. Sport helps a lot with mental health. Before covid, I started to go to the gym for the first time and it felt really good. I think it might help you. Plus, you'll have the occasion to have time for yourself, and not always being a caregiver.\nTry to reach out to a local caregiver support group. You might find some support, and maybe some friend to have a walk? :) they would understand your situation and not be mean like your friends...\nTry also to see if you could have help at home taking care of him. Having someone helping you on a daily basis might relieve some of the stress of you shoulders.\nI'm curious about what people in relationship advice have said. How could they be mean to you? You are obviously in a dire situation and need help.\nForget what they said, they are not in your shoes, or the shoes of a caregivers, so it is difficult for them to understand.\nStay strong.

Try to treat them the best that you can and don't take the frustration out on them.\nI know you are tired of therapy suggestions, but it really does help.

        "text": "Hey there - that's super scary about your grandad. I hope he's found soon!\nI'm a bit of a tech skeptic when it comes to folks with dementia. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't try to find a solution, but I guess I'm here to urge a little caution unless you have very deep pockets... Here's why:\nGPS trackers are amazing. Truly. The trick is getting your loved one with dementia to consistently wear/carry the tracker. My mum started disappearing before I moved in to be her caregiver, so I moved to GPS trackers to try and keep tabs on her. Thing was: she never wore watches or jewelry, so even when presented with beautiful trinkets she would take them off in less than a day, never to put them on again. I tried adding a tracker to her fancy cigarette case, but she recognized the square fob-like device as foreign to the case\n (without remembering that it was important or its purpose) and so would diligently pick at it until her case was restored to her memory of what it was meant to look like. I found some neat shoe-lace trackers, but she entered a phase in which she would hide her own shoes around the house and so wouldn't wear the same pair day to day. I got her a new wallet (she was in the habit of carrying a wallet) with a tracker, but she never recognized the new wallet as hers and wouldn't carry it. A long list of examples to say: if you're going to find a GPS tracker for your grandfather, think carefully about what he's likely to actually carry/wear with him every day. You're going to have more luck, at least based on my experience, if you can find a way to add a tracker to something he already knows and carries in a way that he won't know it is there. (Does he use a cane? Unless he has many, that might be a good thing to explore?)\nRegarding a cell phone for your grandmother, and also to perhaps open you up to other assistive devices, I'd encourage you to check out the Alzheimer's store. Here's an example of a simple phone that they sell:\nhttps://www.alzstore.com/RAZ-Memory-Cell-Phone-for-Seniors-p/0039.htm\nI know that your grandmother doesn't have dementia, but if you're looking for easy to use devices... They have some really great options. You'll find some other good simple cell phones on Amazon. I'm in Canada so the options you have available to you may be different, but I've heard good things about the jitterbug flip phone. On the Alzheimer's store, you might also find some other things there that your grandfather might have some use for. Again, though, I'd urge caution about new tech for your grandfather... Learning how to use something new can be really difficult...\nHope this helps. Best wishes.",

Moving her to your house would be a massive disruption, and she'd likely do a lot worse for a good long while.  In an ideal world carers would move into the patient's house so their routine isn't affected nearly as much.  Additionally, your life and relationships would suffer.  It is not uncommon for breakups/divorces to occur to caregivers as they are torn between love and duty by guilt and resentment.  You probably don't want to pay her husband to move out and move you and your husband in to live with your mom, and no wonder.  \nWhat you may be able to do is (maybe after a vaccine is available) help to pay for a companion.  Someone who will do laundry, dishes, feed her lunch.  Nothing exciting, just take care of the everyday and make sure she's safe.  You could sell this to him as \"someone to take care of the house while you're at work\" and to him as \"A housekeeper\".   This would also take stress off your local siblings, so they can talk to the companion and not feel like they need to \"spy\" on the household.",

But, living there with him is less than ideal. \nMy 78 year old FIL has advanced Alzheimer\u2019s and my husband stays home full time to care for him. We have been here since the diagnosis five years ago. He had a bad fall and broke his femur which propelled him further very quickly into the disease. He\u2019s had a few other issues which have also helped expedite his journey. These last five years have been the most challenging of my life and I chose to move in and care for someone with this disease. I agree your stepdad is horrible, however, he didn\u2019t sign up for his wife to get dementia. He doesn\u2019t want to care for her. That wasn\u2019t part of his life plan. Go to court, get guardianship rights and figure out a care plan. He will probably be grateful that you made the choice that makes him not look like a super douche for leaving her. My husband and I made this choice even so, we get frustrated and lose our tempers too. You do get tired of repeating yourself and arguing about why they can\u2019t drive. Again, totally not defending the stepdad. He sucks, no doubt. He\u2019s a fixer and he can\u2019t fix it. However, he can\u2019t understand that this isn\u2019t curable. \nBeing the primary care provider is hands down the most difficult job on the planet. And even more so when it\u2019s your parent. My husband and I have had to work super hard to maintain our ten year relationship. We don\u2019t get vacations, we don\u2019t get date nights and we sure as hell don\u2019t get to leave the house together (pre-covid looks no different for us than current covid). We have zero help. Our lives are on hold to ensure he has the most dignified journey to the end that we can give him. Before you pick her up you need to think about what being a caregiver will be like. \nAre you ready to change her clothes? Are you ready to change her diapers? Are you ready to feed her? Are you ready to change everything about your life to care for her?\nI wish someone would have more honest with us when we started this journey. We knew it would be hard but we thought we\u2019d have family support. We don\u2019t. They were going to come over and give us a break. They were always going to see what their schedule looked like and call us back. It\u2019s been five years, we\u2019re still waiting to her back from my husband\u2019s brother. \nI hope your journey is brighter and filled with all the love and support the world has to offer.

And how your pre-Covid life is no different from current Covid life. I joke that I\u2019ve been practicing social distancing since we got this farm 7 years ago. \nI\u2019ve been telling my siblings for a year and a half that I want her to live with me. My husband is amazing and completely on board with whatever I want to do. Though, I am not saying it won\u2019t still be beyond difficult - even if I can get some financial support from her husband. But I am positive I can do a much better job taking care of her if she came into MY world, rather than me abandoning my husband to run the farm while I spend a few days or a week there. I was going back and forth so much last year and bringing one of my dogs along for comfort, that I permanently altered the dynamic between my travel dog and the dog that stayed on the farm. To the point I had to give the travel dog to my brother because the two dogs couldn\u2019t be in the same room together anymore without viciously fighting. \nI love that you and your husband are so determined to care for him. It\u2019s how I feel. My mom doesn\u2019t deserve to be lonely for the rest of her life. I know it won\u2019t be easy in the slightest but I\u2019m willing to see if it can work. As long as I can demonstrate to her how much more she could enjoy life here, I think it could be enough to break her out of the mindset she stuck in. She thinks there\u2019s no hope, no options. She just wants to die. I can\u2019t imagine having to feel that way at the end of my life. I don\u2019t want it for myself and I don\u2019t want it for her.\nThe only reason I haven\u2019t already gone and picked her up is because my house is in NO shape for an elderly person with dementia.

You would not have much time to help your husband with your farm.  My advice is to help the HHC folks blend in a little better. Maybe you could coordinate with the agency so you could bring them in as a friend to meet your mom? Maybe sit and visit and have snacks and chat and look at some photo albums?  If she could get to know one (or more) of the HHC workers she might decide to be glad she has friends visiting. Just a thought.",

You mom needs help, and probably to be put in a home (and away from her husband.)  In the meantime, he probably needs help too.  If DHHS can determine abuse is happening, then they can find a better person than your mom's husband to make decisions for her.  Usually the default person is the spouse otherwise.",

        "text": "I didn't read all the comments, so I apologise if I'm repeating someone else. Soooo holy shit where do I start?! Wow...this is an incredibly heart breaking story & I'm so sorry youre going through this, just awful!\n1st - just wanted to quick acknowledge you're a wonderful writer! Very descriptive & thorough... & you and your siblings all willing to step in is so amazing and kind, then hearing you describe your childhood with the classic single mom working 3 jobs and life devoted to her babies/not dating, no wonder she has such sweet children, sounds like such a loving, amazing mom! \nMy opinion towards this comes from my mother having to do this with her own mother (who was in the between mild - moderate, but fastly heading moderate stage of the disease)  who also found herself in an awful living situation (more on that later)  but they (my parents/aunts) basically had to abduct her to get her out of it!\n& I'm also an RN & I've worked at a nursing home (skilled nursing, rehab, and long term care) as a nursing supervisor & case manager for the past 5 years or so as well as critical care nurse in a hospital in the past & also (my bf and I both) worked as psych nurses at an acute, locked units, psychiatric hospital - i covered all floors there but he did geriatric psych for almost a decade...\n but I'm certainly no expert & honestly with dementia/alzheimers, not many are - theres still so much we don't know & def won't in our lifetime.. mainly bc with every organ in our body, all so wildly complex & can have so many disorders, they ultimately each have a main function or job & when it stops doing that job, theres typically a solution to fix & you can objectively tell if its worked (ex. Lab values, mri/CT scan imaging), but not only does the brain do millions of jobs - not 1 case is the same, not one person shares the personality traits identical to another & results are subjective. Sorry, got off track ...\nThe house theyre in - did she move in with him or did they buy it together? Is there anyway to get him the F out? Because, even tho this disease doesn't ever regress -  it is very likely the care shes receiving from him (or lack thereof ) will cause progression of the disease.  A huge concern from reading this was about the pill dispenser - not only does it show pure ignorance & blatant disrespt on his part - but youre not even sure she's taking the meds? With most of these meds (aricept & namenda are what I see most) they take weeks to start working & showing any affect. He's possibly never even seen what they're capable of BUT, missing doses, going several days without, not only cancels all the progress the drug has made, but its severely fucking with her brain chemistry, potentially making her worse... just stopping one sends the brain into like panic mode, could cause serious delirium. \nWay before you described him as this fox News binge watcher - that's already exactly what I was picturing lol. Trying to change a stubborn, stuck in their ways, insensitive, 74 y/o man is basically not going to happen. If there was going to be a change, it would've happened already. He can't accept change, he can't accept the new her, and he doesn't want to either. The very little hes done so far, has caused extreme burn out. And the fact he's able to leave her alone, take her out to eat, etc shows that she's still in an early stage and if he can't handle it now, then its absolutely crucial you separate them before she progresses.  Leaving the house and wandering away (even in fridged cold weather depending where u live) & starting a house fire are things that can easily happen if left alone. \nBut contrary to the one comment I did read - going off my experience- it's not nearly as hard or critical (I forget the words used) to uproot a person with dementia from their environment. Will she be angry at 1st? More than likely. Will she adapt and get over the anger? Absolutely 1 million % \nWith my grandmother- she lived in a little community for seniors in a modular home development after my grandfather died & met this neighbor, Fran, who also binge watched same news as your story, always angry yelling at the TV , also you had to scream to talk to him lol, but to save $ she sold her place & lived with him. They got along well & were great companions, both in their 80s & not romantically , but really loved each other. Slowly they both started showing signs of demntia & maybe cause it really started together, it seemed to progress quicker. We were scared & also living 30 mins away, Frans daughter was 5 mins away & felt she needed to have her dad @ home for safety & for fear of breaking both their hearts - she offered to take my grandmother in too (till she got too much to handle). \nShe was still slightly independent,  just need like supervision or verbal cueing  with bathing, bathroom, dressing, etc. Repeated herself a lot  & zero short term memory, slightly mentally draining. We thought Fran's daughter was an angel. We were so wrong. Long story short- she was hardly bathing or changing her clothes, wouldn't answer the phone if we called, was forging her ssn checks, & took out credit cards in her name. \nBecause she couldn't comprehend she was being abused, plus we couldn't really speak to her - when police showed up - she could answer all orientation questions (name, date, where she was) & she said she felt safe, she wanted to be there, etc. \nWe had to basically plan a sting & see when the daughter left the house, send cousin up to door for surprise visit, get her to agree for lunch, & took her to my parents, then to a Dr for a legal diagnosis, then to a lawyer to get my mom POA, then slammed the stupid cunt with every charge possible \ud83d\ude09 \nWe obviously felt terrible for putting her through this, she was confused, angry, upset, asking every 2 minutes where Fran was..and that lasted about 1 week. Then she adapted. And most importantly, she was SAFE!         I won't go any further on my own story cause this post is long af already. \nBut I can tell you with 100% honesty, for all these years doing admissions...i havent seen many difficult transition from home to long term care, waay more happier, & the ones that were difficult - were much further progressed than your mother now. \nYoure without a doubt going to need in home care, even for you (or siblings) for your own mental well being. & yes - every health care worker has been called awful names or faced racism,  but when someone's work environment is hostile - they either won't come back & spread the word around the agency, or think of how anyone's work ethic would be in an unpleasant, unappreciated environment.... less than satisfactory. \nSo not only is he harming her with the meds, hes harming her emotionally by yelling creating tension, hes harming himself by not listening on how to also make this easier on him, hes harming her relationship with her kids, & hes harming her potential of getting great, structured care.\nPeople with dementia THRIVE in a calm, structured environment. They crave a solid daily routine. \nYou asked who you can contact for advice - the office of againg! No, they will not take your mother, theyre full of resources & are specifically trained for issues identical to yours. \nSorry i drug this out so long! Your story really hit home for me. I wish you all the strength in the world cause these situations are HARD!!!! \noh - & if not already, while she's still maybe legally in sound & mind - get an advanced directive & make one of you guys (her kids) power of attorney!\nGood luck to you!",

        "text": "Hey, sorry for the delay in responding to this. But I just read your comment again and wanted to say thank you for taking the time to share your experience and offer advice. It\u2019s always nice when someone seems to \u201cget\u201d my family\u2019s specific situation. Because you\u2019re absolutely right \u2014 if you\u2019ve met one person with Alzheimer\u2019s, you\u2019ve met ONE person with Alzheimer\u2019s. No two are alike. However there are other things, as you stated, that are absolutely necessary for every person suffering from dementia, like routine & a calm environment. \nI was just with her last week for a few days, and learned from her husband that he\u2019s started the process of selling their house and has signed them up for a new facility being built nearby. It should be done in 2021, but I supposed it could end up stretching to 2022. As Charter Members though he is getting an incredible deal for both their independent living quarters AND for her eventual private memory care space. It\u2019s good, but it\u2019s still a long way off and I\u2019m hoping they\u2019ll be able to stick it out till it\u2019s built. I spoke to one of my sisters this morning \u2014 she had a bad phone call with mom earlier. The home-care girl was there and mom was PISSED. She took it out on my sister, ended up shouting Fuck You at her... it\u2019s really sad bc that sis has 3 young sweet girls, and spends ALL of her spare time over there at the house, helping out with mom. She\u2019s been decluttering the house \u2014 taking out all the clothes and other hoarded crap that makes living there so chaotic. Poor girl. She does so much to help and ends up getting shit on the most by mom. But she\u2019s strong at least. \nAnyway, we\u2019re hoping that today\u2019s & last night\u2019s dramas will push the husband to finally do what we\u2019ve been asking: get the home-care for every morning and every night, so her meds can be on time and she can have help brushing her teeth, bathing, dressing. Right now her skin is always itchy (because she\u2019s not bathing properly) and her teeth are discolored. She\u2019ll put on full makeup and jewelry and clothing (w/shoes!) to go to bed at night. Apparently her eyelashes fell out bc she wasn\u2019t taking off her mascara. :/ It\u2019s just bad. It\u2019s so bad. And it boggles the mind as to WHY he won\u2019t just LISTEN to us and do what we say. He finally got the home-care people in, but it\u2019s not really so much about taking care of her than it is about him having long chunks of time where he can not be around her. He has the money to pay for the extra expense of having them come in the AM and PM, but it\u2019s a 3 hour minimum. And 3 hours isn\u2019t enough for him to be alone. Even though my sweet sister even offered to come over after the morning girl, just to give him an extra few hours on top. It makes no sense. HIS life would be so much easier if he gave her any kind of structure and consistency. \nUgh. Thanks for letting me rant more. It\u2019s just so frustrating when the caregivers aren\u2019t on the same page. It could be sooooo much better for everyone if the paid help was taking care of all the \u201cofficial\u201d stuff so her kids could just BE with her and try to create moments of joy while we still can. And I totally believe what you say about how much better they can be when their basic needs are being met. At first the transition is hard, but once it kicks in, they\u2019re better for it and won\u2019t fight the change so much. \nI\u2019m gonna pass along some of your advice to the husband \u2014 I liked the words you used in a few spots. Made me think about it differently. Sometimes the right phrasing is key. :) Oh, and thanks for the compliment to my writing! My mom was a writer/journalist. She had a column in the Catholic paper, syndicated in like 25 states at one point in her life. She was always so witty and sharp. Which makes it all the more hard to hear her struggle to find words and stammer through sentences. She was so bright. And I think part of her still remembers or thinks that she is the same as she was, so the defiance she has whenever she feels belittled or not in control of anything, it\u2019s intense man... But anyway, thank you. I was the one of her daughters who got the creative, journalistic side of her personality, so thanks for the huge compliment. Means a lot. :)",

The sad irony is Mom always went on and on about how bad some of her distant cousins were for never visiting their father with it after he went into LTC, and now that mine is temporarily in a facility we've not once gone to see him. When he still had...well...some of his faculties we could have gotten the ball rolling on this, but she resisted at every turn.\nDue to finances we'll be getting him back soon, and she's promised to \"be better\" and help now, but I really doubt it. We're supposed to be getting Home Care in a few times weekly but she complained about her \"space\" being \"invaded\" so am sure that will end lol\nGood luck with her husband, the guy needs to own up and admit he wants nothing to do with her.

If you decide that's the best situation for her, be prepared to make an excuse, tell her you need her with you for a while to help with something, give her a reason to be there to keep her calmer for a while until she settles in.   \nSomeone else touched on the idea of having a \"friend\" show up. That worked well with my mom. In her case, the lady who spent every morning with her was her granddaughter's mother-in-law, so she peripherally knew her and she just decided she needed to stop in and see Mom every day, or that was what Mom was told. She never knew she'd been hired by my sister and made it really difficult on us when she would say things like \"I love that Mary's coming to see me but I wish she wouldn't come every day!\" It never occurred to her that \"Mary\" was coming every day at the same time and leaving at the same time.",

        "text": "Wow. I hadn\u2019t considered how bad the dynamic of a resentful husband can be.  My dad has early stage dementia, but lives alone. this sounds awful for everyone. Denying her access to a therapist sounds abusive. He needs to be told that he doesn\u2019t need to see the point to give her a ride. A social worker may need to do that. \n1) call your state\u2019s equivalent of Agency on Ageing\n2) Alzheimers association is a good info clearinghouse, but they also frustrate me because they recommend recourses unavailable in my area. Which I find irksome. Adult daycare? Nice IDEA. They recommend resources but don\u2019t actually provide anything.\n3) adult protective services.\n4) find about Medicaid waver in your state. \nAdvice:  you really need to simplify.  Forget the dog, it\u2019s fat. The husband will feed it. forget the optional (tea, c pap, mushroom stuff,  changing their home, white board) Fight the ONE most important battle. If its meds, load the med box yourself, put it in the place and call her at med time every day until its a routine.  If its meds management, take her yourself. If it\u2019s a walk or something the care giver can do,  tell her you are taking her on a walk on (time and date) and go on the walk with them both. Do it again until it\u2019s routine.  Give the caregiver jobs. Don\u2019t  give hubs jobs or expect hubs to do it. He won\u2019t.  Sorry he\u2019s a dick. Your mom chose him too, on some level anyway.  \nYou seem to have the fantasy that w/o hubs in the picture you would be able to take care of her better.  Maybe, maybe not. Think carefully before going for guardianship. He\u2019s frustrated, ignorant and overwhelmed.  At the end of the day, what does he want? What will change the situation so he doesn\u2019t have to be an abusive ass?  Is it a divorce, or is it he just needs a break? Maybe there are interventions that can help change awful to acceptable, if not good.  If you take her, she\u2019s yours, for years. Looking at that time horizon may make it easier to see if any social services can help. Because it\u2019s going to be frustrating.  : /. sorry \ud83d\ude10",

We will give my grandmother Ensure which she doesn\u2019t mind drinking since she wants nothing to do with food. She\u2019s in the late stages of Alzheimer\u2019s and is 85, so we do what we can to make sure she gets some form of nutrition.\nAnother thing that helps (in my case) is feeding my grandmother and bribing her with something so she finishes her food. She loves coffee so if I give her a bagel for breakfast, I\u2019ll tell her that if she finishes it, she can have coffee. (She\u2019ll get it regardless, I always make it for her breakfast, but she doesn\u2019t remember that anyways so it works out)\nFinally I make sure she drinks lots of water. It keeps her metabolism up so that she\u2019ll get hungry quicker so she\u2019ll eat more often. Rejecting a big meal is common, so stick with smaller meals throughout the day. If your grandmother is like mine and doesn\u2019t remember when she last ate/what she ate, you can just lie if she rejects a snack and say that she hasn\u2019t eaten all day and should eat regardless. \nI\u2019m on mobile so formatting is weird, but I hope these help.",

It'd probably be worth seeing if there's a subreddit that knows more about these kinds of devices (r/spygear or r/stalker etc. ;).\nAnyway, strap one onto the bottom of the wheelchair and you'll always(?) know where he is. :) Furthermore to his anxiety about being left somewhere, you could tell him that the tracker is on the wheelchair and that you'll always know where he is as long as he's in the wheelchair could do double-duty in motivating him not to wander off without the chair (memory issues aside).",

The issue is the \u201cpendant\u201d is very large and heavy and really not designed to be worn around the neck. It can be attached to a walker, or if she can remember to always keep it in her pocket so she has it. The model of phone is SN5147 I believe, and you need to buy the pendant separate. Unfortunately the total cost with tax was over $130 for us.\nAnother option: you could possibly buy one or more Echo or Google Home devices for throughout the home, which she could tell to call you as long as you\u2019ve programmed your number in as a contact. The issue is you have to rely on the voice processing for it to understand her correctly, and if she were significant distress, she may not be loud enough or speak clearly enough for it to execute what she wants them to do.\nAnother edit: I should clarify that at least the life alert pendant that we have does not automatically dial 911.

Bay Alarm gives the code to first responders so there\u2019s no guessing. It\u2019s a $20 a month service. She\u2019s 87 & 45 minutes from me and it gives me peace of mind. That and a WiFi camera looking at her front walk ($20 and I can listen to the audio at her place if I felt like i needed to) and most recently an echo dot.

        "text": ">\\> I know it's time to sit down with my dad and have a serious conversation about getting help\nThis will almost certainly be heard as \"You're not doing enough\".  This community is rife with stories of \"my fucking family has no idea what I do for my loved one, but they're telling me all the time to do more, and of course they're not going to help!\"\nIf you do the sit-down-heart-to-heart, you will be the Bad Guy Who Sticks His Useless Demanding Nose Where It's Not Wanted.  I have never heard of a good way anyone has brought up \"you need to be doing more\" without it going completely down the shitter.\nOn the other hand, you could do it right: let them know that you'll be dropping by at x time, and leave early.  Get some nice fresh fruit and some lunch/dinner you know they'll like and haven't had for a while.  Then when you get there be relentlessly positive.  Have a nice meal, and say that you're ready to step up.  You're going to be coming by X times a week with a meal to watch Mom.  This would give Dad, finally, for once, a break.  Go to the movies, go shopping, go for a walk, take a nap.  Some kind of a freaking break after months of being on duty.\nWhen caregivers work 24/7, they burn out and can't focus on anything but making it through the next crisis.  So if you want him to be able to think beyond the next crisis, you have to help him enough so he can recover from burnout.\nWhen you're seen as a help, when you're on the care team, then you can make concrete, actionable suggestions like \"now that you're getting Saturday afternoons off, can I get a meal delivery service to help with dinners?  I think you'd deserve to eat something nice at night!\" or \"I have a great housecleaner, shall I ask him to come by to vacuum twice a month?\"  These kinds of suggestions won't be seen as imposing, they might actually be considered.",

        "text": "I was in a similar situation with my father who was the sole caregiver for my mother. He refused help from my sister, my older brother and myself for many years. We would see that my mom was getting worse year after year. He would not budge to help himself or my mom. He saw only expense instead of quality of live although he had the money. I approached my sister to contact Adult protective services three years ago. She did not approve of this avenue in favor of an intervention. The intervention never happened. Fast forward two years...the situation was dire. My mom could not walk well and had pain in her knees. She was near end stage and still no help of any sort. I contacted my sister again to push for Adult protective services with anonymity. We called and got the ball rolling. Adult protective services visited my parents house to my fathers surprise. Adult Protective Services determined that she was neglected. My father had three weeks to place my Mom in an appropriate care facility. Two weeks later my mom was sent via ambulance to the hospital kicking and yelling \"Help...help...help...help\" as loud as she could, tied to a medical cart to the back of the ambulances. She was sedated for the trip to the hospital and later diagnosed with pneumonia and a nasty foot infection. She was treated for pneumonia and the foot infection over a period of three weeks. The social worker at the hospital told my dad that his wife was in the process of dying and the pastor visited him and my mom.  My father did not take this well. He didn't grasp that she was dying or that she was not coming back home.  After three weeks at the hospital, my mom went to a really nice rehabilitation center. She stayed there rehabbing with incredibly compassionate nurses and staff. The nurses were shocked she was living alone with my father. She was doing well at the rehab center but medicare would only pay for eight weeks of rehab. My father didn't want to keep my mother there because it was expensive and found only one assisted living facility that would possibly accept her, where she had to walk everywhere. My mom failed the assisted living placement interview and could not walk 50 ft. My father pressed again to have her retested. She barely passed her placement test which in hindsight I believe was detrimental to her survival. She was later moved to the assisted living home and she was there for a week. She fell once out of bed, got into a fight with another patient and a few days later she fell again and broke her left femur below her ball joint. Due to her end stage condition, she was not a candidate for surgery nor would any medical doctor perform surgery on her. She had been recommended to hospice for comfort care but my father was considering surgery against our wishes. She survived intense pain for three weeks. Soon after she passed.\nMy point is, do not wait to intervene if you feel someone is not acting in the best interest of your loved ones. Act as soon as you can to give your them the care they deserve. Call adult protective services if you have any doubt that your relative is being neglected or not being cared for properly.\nEdited",

Sometimes pts react opposite to medications\n3)Find someone to help you so you don't get overwhelmed. Some agencies provide relief. This is NOT some thing to be ashamed of; taking care of someone with dementia can be exhausting, especially when it's a family member,and it's easy to become burn out.\n4) Give him activities to do during the day and keep him busy. What job did he have? Was he a carpenter? Give him something to do that he won't potentially hurt himself, or give him tasks around the house.\n5) De-clutter the room he is in, but keep it familiar enough without a bunch of hazards such as throw rugs, etc.\n6) Are his windows secure, your front door locked, etc? Are there any weapons in your home? Maybe a night light to help, or illuminate the bathroom at night. Maybe this will help his toileting issue?\n7) Have a baby monitor in his room, one without a light that would disturb him.\n8) You don't want to restrain him but maybe an alarm or something to alert you he's getting up if you're losing sleep.\n9) Have a scheduled bedtime routine. They respond well to routines- as a nurse working with Alzheimer's and Dementia patients for over 7 years, I can say this with confidence.\n10) Does he wear diapers or pull ups? Sometimes pull ups are more like underwear and they won't be as apt to remove them when they are soiled. Toilet him every 2 hours,encourage him to try even if he doesn't have to go. Have a urinal handy for him to use if he keep standing up and peeing.\n11) Put notes such as \"Put your Underwear in the green bin\" .Visual cues are wonderful !\n&#x200B;\nHope this helps.",

        "text": "I think he does. His dementia diagnosis was on a paper in his discharge instructions that listed \"dementia\" and \"suicidal/homicidal ideation\". However one doctor left a voicemail saying he may have something and I can't remember the name exactly. Vascular sounds right or \"small\" something.\nSo the beginning of this story goes back about 4 years while I was in AZ & my parents here in PA. My dad started having very bad balance issues, couldn't really talk or do much, no bowel control, and it was just my mom caring for him. My mom kept calling the doctor begging her for help, same doctor, and the doctor would just dismiss it as mismanaged diabetes. This went on until one night my dad slipped in his own feces and fell, they took him to the hospital where they found out he had brain swelling. For at least a year my mom called that doctor begging for help, so for at least a year he had brain swelling. He had a drain put in and get got a lot better.\nFast forward 2 years I moved back in to help care for him, my mom got lung, liver, and brain cancer so that was hard and doubled my caregiving load. I have made 22 calls for the doctor's office and called back twice  in last couple months. \nHe started getting worse during Covid19 because he couldn't go freely anymore anywhere he wanted, I was the designated shopping person since I'm the youngest. And he would instantly forget why he can't leave. The doctor revoked his license, we wouldn't let him drive he'd continuously call the cops. The doctor dismissed it as mismanaged diabetes so a month ago I decided to take over his insulin. First off the dosage was so incorrect, the pens say 30 units 3 times a day before meals and his vial says max 10 u it's 3 times a day when it's the same concentration of insulin. The doctor has yet to fix that issue she knows I'm paying out of pocket too for the vial insulin since the dosage is wrong I'm picking it up too soon so insurance won't cover it. \nFinally dad had an appointment, a follow up with her on 9/1 and he was able to shower with minimal help after the pill she gave him by 9/10/20 he was freaking out screaming he didn't understand in the shower and was hitting mom and I.  I called about it she just said she won't do anything else and passed me onto psych services for him. I complied and called every single one of them, none can help him.\nWe need his Seroquel back, he doesn't have the appetite he used to, he's so confused now too it's sad. \nBed alarms wouldn't work due to our dogs would be freaking out and all four of us try to sleep whenever we can. Yes there's lights and clearly marked paths to things, I write notes but he just throws them away without doing what it says to do on there.\nI've just gotta get him into a new doctor, but there's a 3 month wait to get into a new one here. \nI'm hoping if he goes to the ER they'll give him another script for Seroquel, that's who gave him the first one to begin with.",

Hopefully others will chime in and give you details on how to do that in your specific situation, but you might start with a call to her doctor.  Be honest and tell them you're overwhelmed and you don't know what to do.  Ask who could best help you, perhaps a social worker?  You may be able to get in home assistance if you're interested.  You might also ask about grief counseling for her (and possibly yourself) or how to help her cope with that.  I found my dearest friend's body and 6 months later my husband's, and it was horrific.  I've no idea how you would cope with that along with Alzheimer's.\nWhile I'm thinking of it I want to point out that in the course of their illness Alzheimer's patients can begin to wander and escape the house.  At some point you may need locks and/or alarms on the doors and possibly windows.  My autistic son went out a window when he was 8, we had locks on the doors but I had never considered the windows. \nGoing forward, if you continue to provide her care (and, really, even if you don't) it's going to be vital that you find ways to take good care of yourself.

If you aren't able to care for her long-term and she needs to go to a facility do your best to keep up visits. You never realize until it gets to the end how much you will miss them.\nLooking back these were the absolute hardest years of my life and my grandmother has a huge list of medical conditions that have been endlessly managed during that time, including memory issues like your grandma (I started at 30 and had almost no help while also working full time). I do not regret for a second not putting her in a home. However, that is not at all the same situation for everyone and in home care long-term sometimes isn't right for you or your loved one. Know all your options right away before you get too deep. Also, any way you can get respite, take it. Burnout is hard to bounce back from and i know it is easier said than done, but find ways to get a break. You are still in school, so you also have to consider your future. Im dealing with end of life so I don't have a lot of time or emotional capacity at the moment, but i wanted to let you know I've been there and you can message me....it just might take me a bit to reply.",

Basically they're incapable of taking care of themselves so you get control of their finances and make decisions for them that are in their best interest. \nYou could move your parents into an independent living facility if they can afford it. There's also Continuing Care Retirement Community. They often require a few hundred thousand dollars down, but once you're in it, you're set to transition in place from independent living to assisted living to nursing home without an increase in fees. I'm not sure what the value of their homes would net you, but if it's enough, that could be a permanent solution that would give you peace of mind. This does require monthly fees of several thousand dollars, but if you have conservatorship, you can control their finances to make sure these are properly paid by autopay each month.

Reduce it to what you could easily throw away when they die and what you would want to keep to remember them. Most of The things probably never used, too old to be useful or they have too many copies of. Take someone else along who isn\u2019t related to help say to you: that\u2019s junk, toss it. If there is some question, put it in a box in the garage, labeled, and if it hasn\u2019t been opened in 6 months, toss it. They will have forgotten about it by then. Get a dumpster or put it in the curb after requesting an extra pickup from the local garbage company. Throw everything in your childhood bedroom away. If you don\u2019t want it in your house, there is no reason to store it in your parents house. You don\u2019t need all of that old stuff. Buy one if those cheap ikea expedit huge shelves and get the rest of the stuff off the floor.  The smell may not be in the vents at all. It might be a dead rat or a milk carton behind some price if furniture. If they object to all the tossing, then tell them you are putting it in the garage or in storage (but don\u2019t actually get storage) then actually toss it or put it in the garage to toss later.

I'm a caregiver to someone with a feeding tube now and these devices were never options that came up when she was having trouble swallowing, which included two Heimlich maneuvers.\nEdited: she may not be able to do a swallow test with dementia because you need to follow instructions. Before a feeding tube, you may also try PT exercises to make swallowing easier, changing her diet to pureed food or thickened liquids, changing liquids to honey or nectar-thickened liquids, and assessing which foods cause choking (it can be non-obvious ones - my patient needed the Heimlich for rice and muffin crumbs).",

Speech therapists work closely with swallowing disorders. It may be that your grandma requires a specific food texture to avoid aspirating. Thickened liquids can be beneficial to help avoid aspirating on beverages and pureed food or mechanical soft diets are also options for those with dysphagia. A speech therapist would be able to evaluate your grandmother and tell you which diet is best. Altering her diet will prevent choking and make mealtimes much safer.

They will probably give her a few different liquids and watch her swallow them and feel her throat to see how she is clearing the food. In addition, they might conduct some type of cognitive assessment as well, such as the MOCA, to determine if any cognitive impairments are present. The combination of both of these will help a speech therapist see where the underlying issue is. As others have mentioned, there definitely is the swallowing test with an ultrasound that can be utilized. My dad got this when he was admitted to the hospital with aspiration pneumonia and that was how his swallowing difficulties were diagnosed. I think they only did that because he had pneumonia, though. Hope that makes sense!",

It sounds like you're on the path of burning out, you will really really be much more useful to your Mum if you take care of yourself.

At the appointment, the PCP handled it very well, asked my dad a few questions in a subtle way to get a feel for how things were going. At that point my dad had lost his driver's license after a car accident so this led to a referral to a neurologist. Even after seeing the neurologist and seeing his MRI scan my dad still didn't get it and was  flabbergasted that we all thought he had dementia. Then not to long after he had a period of clarity and realized that he did have a problem. And now, he doesn't know me, sometimes. It's been about 3 years from diagnosis to now.",

Yep, they'll usually argue till they're blue in the face there's \"no problem\" - very frustrating.   \nWhen my mum got diagnosis, I did some free short courses / workshops with Alzheimers Australia (now DementiaAus) for carers / family / friends of memory lossed person.  It was quite helpful for me.  I've been her 24/7 carer for years already, her progression is slower than your dads.  Sometimes I'm in danger of burnout.   \nHere in Aust we have govt services (free, if on govt seniors pension) to support folk at home, oldies facility respite, etc. There are some oldies groups for social support, activities, mens craftworking sheds, so they can have social interaction, & carers / family get time-off.    My mum goes out twice a week for 4 - 5 hours with govt-run group specifically for dementia folk,  it's really great.  If you could find some weekly group for your dad to join?  Your mom too, get her to join some nice hobby/social group.  Idk but, I guess your country would also have Carers associations, at least advice/resources info for support for family?   \nDoes your dad have a \"safe return\" bracelet at least?  There's no GPS, its just a metal bracelet such as diabetics / epileptics have - bought from & registered with alzhms org, cost like $60, its engraved the persons unique ID number, that ambulance / police can access the private contact details. If they go wandering lost, or knocked unconscious without ID for eg.   It's impossible to get them to not go out for walks if they want - just have to let them go, trust it'll be ok. My mum is very mobile, I got her high-vis vest to wear when she's out walking alone up & down our street. \nI guess at some point, as your dads condition deteriorates, your mom will have to bite the bullet & find live-in facility for your dad, I don't know how it works there.  Some folk go stay at facility 2 nights a week for eg, ease into gradually;  then have a week or 2week stay now and again.\nIn the meantime, try get your mom to take at least a day / half a day / a night off every week, idk, if she could go stay with family or at your place with the kids & you or another family member stay with dad; and/or you & mom go on some nice outings.   This 2020 with so many places on lockdowns & so on, it's tough.   good luck!",

I would suggest getting one that has the ability to warm water because cold water there is quite a shock if you're not expecting it. That being said, there are a few things that you might want to consider:\nFirst of all, water doesn't generally come out warm unless someone's just used it before you. Therefore you're going to want to get one with a self-cleaning feature (most have this) and let it run for a few seconds before turning it on to spray her posterior to allow the time to warm up.\nSecond, warm water bidets have a knob to adjust the temperature. They can be bumped fairly easily on some models. I would suggest using it yourself and adjusting it to a comfortable temperature, letting it run for a minute or so to be sure it's not going to get hotter, then put a piece of packing tape over the knob to stop it from being changed. A scalded bottom if it gets set to straight hot water by accident, especially if the person has trouble communicating that it hurts, is not good.\nI've heard that using a bidet can be good for hemorrhoids if you're not blasting the water pressure. I've read that gentle water pressure is much like a sitz bath and cleaning without rubbing with toilet paper to irritate things and leave behind \"lint\" can help alleviate itching. As for cleaning the more frontal area, most have a setting for front and back to redirect the spray. I'm a bigger woman and to be sure everything's getting cleaned, I lean forward a bit to help the spray hit the target better.  \nAll in all, I can see a bidet being pretty helpful. Use it yourself for a bit to become familiar with it before helping her use it. Good luck!",

One day 32 password alerts came to my email in three hours.\nThe few apps she uses for entertainment don\u2019t concern me as far as security goes, she has never set up personal financial info on any of her devices and I am her POA so her bank account flags me for all transactions & her two financial advisors have to run any transactions through me. \nIf she didn\u2019t do it then someone helping her with IT at her facility did.

Before that, there are several posts along the lines of computer simulations and games. All of this put together suggests (to me) that you seem to have an obsessive type of personality to begin with. It's a good thing that you got a bike for your birthday so that you can spend more time outside, in reality. If you don't, this is a recipe for a future mental disorder that can become irreversible. Being split from reality can lead to dementia later on. Living in Fantasy Land is not good! Make friends, be yourself and get outside! Trust me-I speak from experience. I'm not right in my head (never have been), but it's gotten worse, and I'm not sure myself if my deal is reversible. I'm 49 years old, and most of my issues are drug and alcohol induced. I wish someone had gotten on my case about being myself, not living in Fantasy Land, etc when I was your age. I don't think I would have indulged in the substances like I did. I don't have very long (relatively speaking) with having enough of my faculties to continue without a caretaker. Not any time soon, but likely sooner than most. That's The harsh reality of my situation. There is a possibility that I can keep this at bay for many years to come... we'll see what the specialists say. But please go get your head checked out, and try to live as much as you can! You're not bothering me by posting what you post-it seems you do want answers.

He then proceeded to put me with another doctor. They never say what I have, besides anxiety, which I only had gotten from realizing I had gotten my symptms.\nMy diet consists of junk food as snack. For dinner, it's usually subway, pizza rolls, and rarely is it Pizza, or Tacobell. For breakfast, I kind of stopped eating it because I don't like it(it's cereal). For drinks, I usually have to drink soda. Even with all these food, my stomach is like a blackhole, and I can consume food after food, and I would never get very fat.\nFor school, it's quite easy, I'm failing a class because of the teacher's lack of knowing about technology, and my memory problems keeps causing me to forget about PE(I have to do it online), and how my teacher wants me to do attendance online during home school. I don't really try, I usually procrastinate, and I still do really well.\nMy sleep, before, was always at 12:00 PM to 1:00 AM.

If you had a traumatic brain injury, they would have noticed. You wouldn\u2019t have been able to pass that cognitive test for one thing. And even if you had barely passed it, you\u2019d be making all sorts of excuses for why it was harder than one would think to try to explain your confusion about the test. Instead, you acted insulted that they gave you such a simple test. My previously intelligent husband thought he did well on the test but also was very defensive about how poorly the test was explained and designed. It was neither. He just couldn\u2019t do it all well.",

I\u2019m an atheist, so I\u2019m not judging that, but hearing that he no longer believes in god because he listened to an album about memory loss is further evidence of possible obsessive behavior. Other obsessions he has are with synesthesia (thinks he is blind to sound) and dreams. He also has a history of depression.

        "text": "The second year\nThe routine for this year stays about the same. As she losses the ability to communicate she becomes angry more often. Around 5pm every night, she paces the house yelling and screaming for about an hour until she finally makes way to her room. The feeling of being totally helpless in this situation wears on you. I tried everything possible to calm her down, my usual shenanigans or calm voice don\u2019t work during these episodes. You just have to let it run it\u2019s course and try your best to ignore it. If you get upset or try to stop it. She instantly shifts to complete sadness, full of tears. This very heart breaking to experience. Being completely helpless is one of the worst feelings ever. \nWork out gloves are the norm, she wears them everywhere. They seem to serve as a mental block. If she doesn\u2019t have them she\u2019ll obsessively look at her hands with confusion and sadness. I assume her mind was trapped in a time where she was younger. The appearance of her hands seem foreign. \nSimple stuff started to become too complicated for her to do on her own. The daily dress up was starting frustrate her. Shirts are on inside out or half worn upside down. There was a morning where she came to me in tears saying, \u201cthis doesn\u2019t go, this doesn\u2019t go\u201d. She couldn\u2019t figure out what pants to wear. \nI turned her sadness around by saying. \u201cIt\u2019s ok mom, that\u2019s just a stupid one,  we\u2019ll go get a good one.\u201d  Phrasing is simple now she understands, anything negative as \u201cstupid\u201d and anything positive as \u201ca good one.\u201d \nWe hopped in the car and headed to the Mart of Walls. I grabbed 10 pairs of soft sweat pants and 10 hooded sweatshirts in the smallest size they had. Knowing small wasn\u2019t going to be small enough, we went directly to the seamstress down the street. That lady was awesome! I paid a little extra, she had them sized perfectly and ready for pick up in a couple hours. When we got home, I cleaned out her closet and removed all the old clothes. My theory was, too many choices are causing confusion, she then gets very frustrated. The clothes she has now, all look the same and are the colors she likes. 5 blue  hoodies, 5 purple ones and 10 pairs of grey pants. Pants folded neatly in the dresser and tops hanging on the rack, purple on the left and blue on the right. I had the nanny give her a bath and left her alone in her room. She came out 20 minutes later completely dressed, with a smile on her face, pointing at her clothes saying, \u201cthis is a good one.\u201d This was a small victory.  \nLooking back on things, I should have done this the first day, it would have saved tons of stress. What I thought was fun daily dress up, keeping her mind occupied, was really just a game of confusion. \nThat was the second year.",

        "text": "The 3rd year. \nThe dementia seemed to rapidly advance, cognitive function is almost completely gone. She has a hard time feeding herself and can no longer get dress on her own. She\u2019s also extremely combative with everyone but me. I ended up letting the nanny go, mom was getting very aggressive with her. She really doesn\u2019t like other women, especially around me. Days are filled with a roller coaster of emotions. Mom will be sad, happy and very angry just seconds apart from each other. The angry spells usually lead to her storming out the front door and walking around the block. You have to let her go outside, if you try to stop her, she\u2019ll stand at the front door screaming and pounding. Letting her roam usually calms her down. I usually follow behind, as to not be seen and let her find the way back home. She usually sticks to the same walking pattern we did daily in the first two years. I watch to see if she\u2019s  confused or scared, it\u2019s easy to spot, her walking pattern will appear more erratic instead of purposeful. When spot this, I usually shout out a goofy comment to get her attention, something like, \u201cI think the beach is the other way\u201d. Soon as she sees me, everything clams down and we walk back to the house with her holding my arm. This happens almost every day. \nShe got out one morning while I was in the shower, I must have forgotten to pin lock the front door. The panic when I got out of the shower was real, she was gone and so was the dog. Fortunately I passed out flyers explaining her condition a month before. I received a call from the local PD as I was walking around the block looking for her. I turned the corner as I got the call, the officers had her corralled at the end of the street. They were very polite, but seemed a bit confused by what she was saying. Her jibber jabber at this time was a bit crazy, if you listened really close it almost seemed like she was trying to say something, it was just jibber jabber tho. \nI had a family member watch her one evening and he had a nervous breakdown 3 days later. He saw Jesus in my basement that night and thought he understood exactly what she was saying. The jibber jabber was definitely enough to make a person crazy, if you listened to deeply. About a month later, I had a friend watch her for the weekend, she also ended up having a nervous breakdown. The combination of her emotional roller coaster and the jibber jabber, was enough to make a person crazy. Looking back I have no idea, how I kept it together the whole time. \nAfter the great escape, I felt it was necessary to upgrade surveillance system in the house. I put cameras inside main living areas, one in her room and a couple outside. The new system notified me when the cameras saw motion, and had a mobile app so I could look in when I was away. This was extremely helpful to have. With the new surveillance system working, I felt confident it was ok to take little breaks when she was in bed. I could keep an eye on her from anywhere and get notified if she got up. I would wait until she had her evening medication and was asleep. The Seroquel at night would completely knock her out for 4-6 hours. I wouldn\u2019t travel far, or for very long and made sure I could make it home in 15 min flat no matter what. This definitely limits what can or can\u2019t do. I found a regular spot close to the house, never drank more than two drinks, and was never gone for more than an hour. Its a nice escape to have a place where you know everyone, and everyone knows you. And, was a very important component in maintaining my sanity. \nAs time went on, I noticed how I was forgetting who she was before the dementia. I think it started with, removing old pictures on the walls, and forms of digital media. Eventually, it lead to me completely blocking out every past good memory of her. I\u2019m not sure exactly when it started, I just really noticed my disconnect in the 3 rd year. She had a manic episode and I didn\u2019t feel anything when she started to cry. I just remained calm and dealt with it as usual. This must have been my subconscious mind protecting itself. The pain of seeing her in this state and knowing who she once was, became too overwhelming. I didn\u2019t know until recently, that blocking out emotional attachments like this, would apply to every aspect of my life. This is definitely where everything started to become grey. \nHer physical health was also starting to decline. One morning while giving her a bath she fainted. It was hard to wake her this morning, usually she\u2019s alert by 6am. This time she had trouble walking bathroom. I got her into the tub and keeping her awake was a challenge. After the bath, she couldn\u2019t stand on her own. I carried her to the bedroom and covered her with a blanket. It was time to take her to the ER. I ran out to the car and got it warming up, leaving the passenger door open. After getting her dressed, I carried her over my shoulder wrapped in a blanket to the car. A call to the hospital on the drive and they got her in right away. They did a multitude of scans and blood work. Turns out it was a UTI. The gave her an IV, some antibiotics and we were on our way the next day. This happened 1 more time this year, almost exactly the same way. It was in the middle of winter tho.\nIt totally sucks, because she had no way of telling me she was in pain. I remember feeling horrible, like I hadn\u2019t done enough to prevent it or paid enough attention to subtle details. \nThere\u2019s nothing reasonable you can do to prevent the UTIs once you start using diapers. I changed them frequently and always made sure she had enough fluids.\nAt this point some people called me Stoic. Looking back, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s was stoicism or not, I no longer had the ability to emphasize. Fortunately, I had a good childhood and was given a solid moral compass. My strict moral code is definitely what kept me in the green when I could no longer empathize. I drew hard lines within myself of what was and wasn\u2019t ok, this was all based upon what I was taught growing up. I owe mostly my mother for this, but also my father and grandparents too. They made sure I always knew right from wrong and through example taught me what kindness was. \nThat was the 3rd year.",

I think this has a pretty slim chance of happening, though. Like i mentioned in my post if i had literally everything squared away and she wouldnt have to do anything, i think itd be fine. Even moreso if i could keep my sister in alabama. \nMy mother has had a lot of issues with substance abuse in the past, and its been getting steadily worse since she and her long term boyfriend split in 2016. Shes coping the way she knows best, things havent been easy on her but shes not the nicest to her children. Shes quick to being a bit violent when frustrated, not dangerously so but any amount i dont like. Its fine when its me, not so much when its my sister, for obvious reasons. I hear from my grandmother though that shes become a lot more gentle with my sister since i moved, which is good to hear. \nHowever her living situation hasnt been consistent since the split up, we have bounced between homes and living with my grandmother on/off whenever we couldnt find anywhere else to go, and i worry about the day my mother cant figure something out and is actually homeless. she also has a tendancy to neglect my sisters personal hygiene (bathing, brushing teeth, ect) a lot more, and now that shes working my sister can go upwards of 9ish hours without having her diaper changed (my moms now boyfriend cares for her, and is very sweet with her but my mother wont let him change her. Worried about it being sexual, god knows why. Hes not like that and my sisters in no position to consent nor be looked at in that light) Its moreso a case of will my mothers actions get her killed or jailed for an extended amount of time / get my sister taken from her in general, and can i avoid that before it happens because waiting till it does will be more difficult to fix. \nI know though that my sister is in greater spirits since getting out of school / since i moved, and i dont think she really notices the neglect. Doesnt make it right, but it does make the situation for me at least not need to be done asap. Its a complicated situation im not happy with, but its the best i can do at the moment. If i had my way id just buy my mom house and a personal nurse for my sister, then i wouldnt have to worry about what things my mom does in her free time affecting my sister while not having to split them up as im sure my sisters the last thing keeping her from going completely off the rails. My mother loves her dearly, and isnt an awful person. Shes just a bit difficult, and doesnt have the resources that would help both her and my sister. \nAlso! Id be her brother, not sister :-)",

You should call or drop by during normal business hours and see if yours does. Ours asks for photos, description of identifying marks, descriptions/licenses of car/bikes/motorcycles, and any local past workplaces or favorite haunts. If your Dad goes missing one day, and you call the police letting them know he is missing - you cut out at least an hour of delay of sending photos and possible routes to the people who will be searching for him. You can also list yourself and your cell as family so if the cops independently find a confused senior before you guys even know he is missing - they know who to call.\nIf you younger folk move out - call the police dept and see they have the \"are you okay\" program. It's a phone call that auto-calls seniors every day at a preset time. If no one picks up, it notifies the cops who drop by to see what is up. Most times it's just an accident, grandma didn't make it to the phone or is feeling lonely. Cops love talking and having a coffee or cookie with grandma or grandpa, a wonderful positive interaction during their day. And if grandma falls and grandpa is not with it enough to call 911, it can save a life.\nWhen it comes to tech I find it's a mixed bag.

If his short term memory is poor you could try \"tricking\" him into thinking that he is about to do some of his old chores, prompting him to do them.\nFor example, when he gets up for something you could prep his coat, put the lead on the dog, get your own coat on and say something like \"thanks for getting the dog ready while I got your coat. Come on, let's go for the walk you wanted to go on\". It sounds pretty dastardly, but if it works and he goes out and enjoys himself then there's no harm done.",

He also has a writing pad and pen and he writes down nonsense stuff that he overhears , not sure what he thinks he is doing but he likes it.\nI used to want to push him to go out for walks and stuff, but I realized that one of the KEY things for dealing with dementia patients is to never try to coerce them into doing something they don't want to do. It's just a guarantee of conflict and confusion and bad feelings. You can suggest, but if they say no, just drop it and let them be. Arguing will get you nowhere. \nI've stopped feeling guilty if he just wants to sit and spend hours in front of the TV, or just staring out the window. He is drifting off into his own world, as sad as that sounds. It's a world of his memories, and we don't know, maybe they make him happy? We can't understand how their minds work under our logical ways of thinking. What makes us happy may not be what they need.\nGood luck!",

Try bowling, or tennis, or basketball, something where you only have to think about what is directly in front of you. Maybe go to a driving range? No math and keeping score - just a basket of balls he can practice his stroke on.\nWe do board games around the holidays and we had to do a complete overhaul away from strategy games to stuff he would enjoy. We have an electric potato that shocks you when the music stops, giant jenga, and a balancing game with sticks. Fun for all ages and all based in the moment, no or limited strategy. He loves it. He loves being part of the group, the feeling that no one is accommodating him, and the fact he can genuinely win. I should have known that is basically just a quiz game relying on long term memory, he enjoys that as well. \nHobbies - does he have any old hobbies you can make accessible? Like if you labeled or attached a photo of the contents of every drawer would he resume making lures for fly-fishing, or woodwork, or model making etc.?\nChores - This was a u shaped curve for us? There was an immediate drop off in chores completed. Now there has been a radical escalation out of seemingly nowhere. Now counters are wiped, cans are crushed, sodas are replaced in the fridge, etc. Great! But also, concerningly, he goes around shutting every door he can find, laundry get chucked in the machine without being sorted, dishes get put away in interesting places, and he will not stop turning off lights. He also keeps spreading hand towels out on top of bathroom counters to dry, not sure where that came from. And, oh my god, shredding mail for \"security purposes\". Good lord, I hope no one got a jury duty summons. He is very firmly reiterating his independence and it is not going particularly well.\nFood - put out snacks and ready to eat foods front and center. Does he eat apples? Bowl on counter. Will he nuke himself some leftovers? That needs to be in transparent packaging at eye level when he opens the fridge.

They don\u2019t feel up to it since there are just too many steps. \nMy grandmother is currently on the middle stage of dementia. A few months ago, it was almost impossible to get her out of the house, have a shower, she will make excuses like ; she\u2019s isn\u2019t feeling great today or have a headache.  \nI slowly realised what the problem was and have managed to take her to dinner at a restaurant occasionally, walks in the wheelchair ( she can walk but it\u2019s more comfortable for her ) and short shopping trips to the malls and she really enjoys it. The most difficult part is convincing them that they will like it. \nFor my gran, before a shower, I will get all her clothes laid out, the towel ready and I walk her through all the steps of getting herself out of her clothes, wrap herself in a towel and walking to the bathroom. I will test the water temperature right before that so it\u2019s at a comfortable range when it hits her skin. She gives up easily at the moment so any discomfort will discourage her. Before we go out for a meal or shopping, I try to get her when she\u2019s in a good mood before even suggesting. You have to make it seem like an easy task for them. \nHope this helps!",

It sounds like you have an amazing partner which will help tremendously. At moments like this step away, take a minute, give yourself a time out, fake a phone call, whatever it takes to buy yourself some breathing time. It\u2019s so hard caring for your parent because you have all the baggage from your relationship that you remember but they probably don\u2019t. I suggest thinking of your father as a whole new person, separate from the father you grew up with. That will help with some of the reactions regarding what he did or didn\u2019t do when you were younger. Finally I suggest agree, don\u2019t argue. If dad says you shouldn\u2019t quit your day job and that you\u2019re a terrible musician just laugh and agree. Remember, his brain is damaged, probably not the best judge of artistic ability.

With FTD for example, the anterior cingulate (which is implicated in empathy) may be affected. It\u2019s the brain. \nI think you\u2019d benefit quite a bit from reading more deeply about his diagnosis - where I am it\u2019s the alzheimers society that\u2019s the best resource.

It\u2019s dementia. Absolutely they get a hall pass. \nThat is not to suggest staff need to stay and passively accept that kind of behaviour directed towards them.

I have tried to suggest they see a family counsellor or mediator, which can be arranged by the dementia helpline but they refuse to call as they think counsellors are only for crack addicts.",

Also, you absolutely should make sure as soon as is possible, that your mother completes POG & POA (powers of guardian & powers of attorney) with a proper lawyer.  Hopefully appointing you, obviously.  Too many people leave this too late, & end up in hands of Public Guardian - not best option, often.  \nSome oldies will argue about doing this, thinking \"I don't need to do that yet, I'm not THAT old.\"  But really, anyone at any age should have completed POA & POG.  If you're knocked unconscious by a cyclist & get addled for coupla months, or in coma from traffic accident, it's too late to do it, can't be done.  I hope you prevail upon your mum to get it done - and NOT appoint her other family members there, sounds disastrous\nIt's a nightmare, this situation of can't get back to / into Australia.  I have friends from Melbourne were visiting India for a month in Feb, they couldn't bring forward their flight before the plague hit, they're STILL stuck in India.  I can imagine how awful & frustrated you must be feeling.  Nobody expected this bloody plague to hit - it's not your fault, you can only do so much from afar - then we just have to leave it to fate.  Sucks but...  I used to live in Europe & India, would spend at least half th year outside of Aust, so while I was here, would set stuff up for mum's home support & care while I was gone.  Sis used to often try interfere.  Mum eventually degenerated of course, then I moved back here permanent 3 yrs ago.  Sucks.  Anyways, I feel for you!! \nIs your grandma on govt pension?  If so she should be signed up for home care assistance (as my mum is - it was a battle getting her to accept home help) ?  It would give your mum some relief & respite.   It's quite a process & a wait-list, but sooner get on it the better. I understand you think she'll be better in a live-in facility, (I WISH my dad would go residential)  just floating another idea, if that doesn't come off - again, wait-lists.  In either case, she needs assessment by Royal District Nursing or whoever oversees yr mum & grandmas area, for receiving home assist, or respite in a residential facility.  Dementia.org.au can tell you info all about that.  \nOften, if the person starts to spend an afternoon or 2 per week, or a day or 2 per week, in oldies facility for respite, they will get more used to the idea - your grandma might even start herself to prefer to move.  I don't know what's yr grandmas native language?  But there are oldies facilites in Aust specifically catering to a bunch of other native language speakers (eg Italian, Greek, Viet, Chinese, etc). \nWith my psycho obstructive power-crazy sister, I often have to \"fight smart\" - maneuver things before she gets wind of it, before she has chance to oppose or put up an alternative psycho-kooky-self-interested option.  Sometimes more the steam-roll approach, (not with my mum, with crazy sister) often the \"fight smart\" - keep it secret till it's done, so she can't object or throw obstacles.  Good luck!\nBest of luck with everything!  Take care of yourself too, best of luck supporting your mum, as well as grandma!  Merry crappest festive season ever!!  :)",

She has had carers come for her but she's so worked up from all the family drama she's started acting as though they have come to kill her and being violent toward them. \nIt's really hard coming from an immigrant family where no one trusts authority or doctors and have these extremely traditional mindsets just because they had to endure so much adversity when moving to Australia. \nMy sister is back in Aus and I guess the best thing that's happened from me pestering all of them is that she has now started to see the signs in my mother and has agreed to help me get her proper care.",

Though aggression is a normal symptom of sundowning/dementia, I definitely think she can get more emotionally stable. When my mom first had to go to a short term rehab facility after being in the hospital and getting diagnosed with dementia, she was very violent, screaming every night for HOURS and thinking everyone was going to kill her. She was more out of control because she was scared and alone and confused and with covid we couldn't see her enough. She has taken a 180 turn with the proper environmental changes and medicine/vitamins/nutrition. I 100% think your grandma can get more stable. There are also medications to consider if it is very very bad to calm delusions/psychotic episodes.\nThe thing is it would get worse either way, dementia is a progressive disease. Your mom isn't guilty of anything. This is VERY HARD to go through. If your mom calls any helpline they will console her. Try conference calling one with her so you are on the phone too. She needs to get through the denial and the guilt - no knows how to handle this perfectly. \nGoing home for a while to help your mom and standing up to her siblings for her will go a long way. This is a lot for a woman her age to handle. If your mom is the guardian, she is the decision maker at the end of the day. The court deemed it so. So people can share input but its not their legal decision or liability. Empower your mom and gatekeep talking to her siblings for her if you can - that something you can do from where you are. \nDoes she live with your mom?",

Another option is splitting the curtain in several spots (maybe like 4 big parts) and attaching magnets that will \"let go\" when he pushes against them. Or small garment/fishing weights.

Maybe a foam dispenser that can absorb into his skin. Maybe just wet wipes he can run his fingers through. My dad forgets to wash but he'll wipe his fingers on a wet-wipe since he's already using that for wiping in general.  \nIf you have the money/space for a remodel of the doorway, you can look into a bathroom remodel for him.

The problem with her two is the dog who would need the diaper the most has some skin issues, and my mom really doesn\u2019t want her to sit in a dirty diaper or need additional bathing because she already gets bathed enough. The other dog was a rescue and has misshapen back legs, we believe due to abuse in a previous home, and it\u2019d be pretty hard to get a diaper on him. Thankfully he is able to control his potty habits pretty well. So it just boils down to lots of supervision, and of course the dogs have impeccable timing and always need something when you\u2019re in the middle of a task!\nI think one of those places you\u2019re describing sounds great in many ways, however I\u2019m not sure my mom is quite ready for that. I also don\u2019t think she\u2019d pay the high prices. I think she could swing a small home and yard on her own with someone to come and mow the grass for her. It\u2019s just getting her into a smaller home that I don\u2019t think she can tackle. Downsizing and moving seems like an insurmountable task at this point, especially with me not being close by to help her.

My father passed away when I was little, but my parents were already divorced. I miss my dad a lot. How is your mom\u2019s health? Does she do alright on her own?\nMy mom is not very open to having a lot of help with things. Other than her yard man (who hasn\u2019t shown up in weeks, so I\u2019ve been doing yard work), she has no help here. I doubt she\u2019d want to spend money on a dog sitter, and quite frankly, I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s my responsibility to do that. In many ways, my mom is in a hell of her own making, and she doesn\u2019t take suggestions well. And if she did have a pet sitter come by, she\u2019d spend a lot of time chatting with them and wouldn\u2019t use the time wisely to do things she needs to do while she doesn\u2019t have to keep an eye on the dogs. Time management is a huge issue around here.\nThe dogs get regular vet care, and she has spoken with the vet multiple times in recent weeks. My mom is of the opinion that if they eat (she hand feeds both of them twice daily), drink, and go potty, they are living, and their quality of life, and hers, is secondary. The older dog can no longer seem to control her bowels, and my biggest fear came true last night when she had an accident in my mom\u2019s bed. Guess I\u2019ll be doing lots of laundry today!\nI\u2019m certainly not trying to not take suggestions, I just know how stubborn my mom is. She is the person who spends money on things she never uses, and they sit around in bags or boxes forgotten about. She says she can do this or that, but when it comes down to it, then she will struggle. Sigh.",

It's a disease that affects people around the person affected quite badly.\nMum said a lot of weird things before she passed away.\nThat the pillow of her bed was a machine, and my brother looked like a machine.\nThat she was sitting on a rock and saw us all under water below her.\nThe hardest bit was demanding to see dad... he'd died a few years earlier. Every time my brother told her he's dead, she seemed to relive the grief of him dying again. I always tried to deflect her but he bluntly told her \"he's dead, we've told you this a million times\". That was hard.\nShe'd tell us she'd ran away from the home and gotten lost before they found her. Talking to the home, they had no record of her leaving.\nOnce, she didn't recognise me. Then, moments later she did.\nThe nursing home let her phone me. All I heard was her screaming non-stop for five minutes. I kept saying unless she said something I would hang up. She eventually mumbled something and went back to screaming.\nI hung up. Later that day my brother told me she had no recollection of doing that.\nThe rest of that day, I was upset and did little work.\nBoth my parents are dead now. I felt numb for quite a while. We'd fallen out ages ago and were distant. I remember the bad times more than the good.",

Problem is, she was living with me in a state she's never visited and totally far away from her birth home.  But to her, the family was right down the street.  \nI purchased the watch from T-Mobile for $125 - and with a monthly line fee of $15 a month, that is if you currently have a T-Mobile account.\nIt's designed for kids, so it's perfect.  However, it has, like all the phones do, apps that they can play with.  Here are the features:\nGPS tracking, setup a Geofence for safe areas and when they exit that safe area you get a text message;\nSOS button, which when pressed, calls the main guardians that have been setup in the device\nIT'S A PHONE - so they can call whoever they want and you can call them (My mom never answered as she just did not recognize the phone was ringing and thought it was music)\nGPS is really good.  When she's walked away, it guided me directly to her (once she was two miles away) \nYou can set lock out modes during designated times you configure on the watch, however, as I discovered this prevented the person from making and receiving calls and that's not good.  I thought this would allow me to lock out tinkering with the phone while still be GPS and phone functional.\nCons:\nIt behaves funny on WIFI networks and will provide some false positives when on the wifi network - you might get alerts that the watch has left the area because it connected to a cellular tower 1 mile away.\nGames - allows them to be distracted, but also can cause mishaps as they get focused only on the watch, even when walking.\nConfiguration - you cannot lock out configuration settings on the device - so it can easily be changed.  I've asked Timex if they can put in a control that assigns an administrator so that only designated people can make changes.",

My opinion is entirely based on a couple conversations with older family members who are the kinds of extremely prepared and responsible people who buy all the insurance for all the things, (and wouldn't it be nice if they were all like that). It's my understanding that LTC insurance proved to be unexpectedly expensive for insurance companies. Companies rely on a certain amount of their customers stopping paying their bills and therefore not getting their benefits, like how gyms calculate a certain amount of their members never going to the gym. Well way way more people used their LTC benefits than they thought were going to. So they are still paying out existing policies but good luck finding a company willing to sell you a new LTC insurance policy. They aren't profitable. Is what I've been told. If you know different speak up!",

        "text": "Fascinating. I'm actually doing some homework myself. From my understanding, the older insurance polices were not priced accurately enough, which was the proximate cause of the constant increase and fluctuations in premiums. By any chance do you recall what the annual premiums were that they were initially paying, and what they got adjusted to? Also, do you know if they had inflation protection in any of their policies? I do think LTC is a national problem that no one really wants to address. The population is getting older, and living longer. Even if Medicaid does pay for LTC there is no guarantee that someone in need would receive it due to the qualification requirement. And Medicaid requires you to liquidate most of your assets to qualify. In your case, as a consumer, how do you think you would cover any of the home or facility based care you would need possibly in 20 years? Especially since people are living longer, and retirement money can get drained very quickly. From my homework In home care, home health aid is the cheapest option of care for people that want to have some kind of independence. The national rates for a home health aide are hovering at $20-$25 per hour. In a best case scenario of needed a home health aide only for 40 hours a week, the cost would be at a minimum $3,200 a month on top of standard living expenses. Once again I'm more curious, and am looking for personal experiences.",

I am sure it's very stressful, but it sounds like you're doing a really good job of trying to figure out what's going on and being there for her. It is great that you are tracking the changes you're noticing. That is very helpful.\nOn the policy \u2013 It's very likely that they would want to perform a physical exam before issuing a policy. This may make it hard to impossible to receive one, but you're certainly welcome to try. No downside that I know of for attempting.\nOn a diagnosis \u2013 I just want to note that you can tell your mother's doctors anything. That may be a violation of her trust, but it is not a violation of HIPAA \u2013 which it's sometimes described as being. If she has any trusted doctors, including ones she hasn't seen in a while, you can just send them a short summary of this information by email or fax and ask for their help encouraging her to come in for a visit.",

I was scared to bring it up but my mom was receptive and she wants help. We're headed in the right direction and the comments on this post help me feel validated that there is definitely an issue, so I will be pushing them to figure out the LTC so we can move forward.",

        "text": "Taking your mom to a doctor will help to tell if it is dementia. They have tests that they can perform, on top of what you have experienced with her, to determine what is going on. \nAs for the LTC, you will need to look into the policy she has. Some policies make you see a doctor to find out which ADLs (activities of daily living) the person is in need of, as well as how many of them, before the policy is active. Also, there is typically a waiting period for when it will kick in. During the waiting period, you have to pay for care out of pocket. Once the waiting period is up, then there is typically a reimbursement. However, if you wait too long, it is more out of pocket during the waiting period. Most LTC companies have you go through a company when you hire help as well. You can start looking into different companies to see who does and doesn't take LTC. Home Instead is one that does and is found around the world. (You can also ask the LTC company for a list of care companies they work with.)\nScheduling the doctor appointment and getting more information from the LTC policy mom has is step one.",

It is hard to say which one fits you the best or if she is issuable. Even for the waiting period different products have different definitions and some don't have waiting period. Anyway it is very complicated. You should find an agent who knows a wide range of product to find the best one. It is also important to know which state you are in. \nI have a word for yourself.

No one told us that, so we put our mom in a great community that she loves, but money is almost out and we have no choice but to move her. Now because she hasn't lived there as private pay first, several places told us that they wouldn't accept her as their current residents have priority. We've waited six months and finally have a room in a place that's an hour away, but they first want to examine her records and see if she's a good fit.

Now we know that they decline MUCH faster when institutionalized, and it's cheaper to keep them in the family home, where they get better care.\nThis is bullshit, and induces guilt in caregivers who are already burned out and beginning to develop their own health problems related to long term stress.\nMany people thrive when put into a care facility. For many it's the increased socialization. There is an entire staff to watch out for and take care of their increasing needs. Even a nice facility is cheaper than in-home care, which is often unreliable. Fact.\nAnd IF somebody does decline, how do you know it's \"faster\"?? They are ALREADY declining no matter where they are. \nSorry but you are absolutely wrong on this one.",

        "text": "This is a great post. May I add a couple of things?  \nIn mid-to moderate dementia, financial issues become common. Our elders forget they didn't pay a bill, and think they are being stolen from when the company asks again to be paid. They forget how much money they took out from the bank, and think the teller stole it from them. They become much more susceptible to scammers and fraud.   \nUnfortunately your bank cannot share details of their financial accounts with you unless you are a signatory on their account. Before the dementia is too far along, try to persuade them to make someone else a signatory on their account - basically, you just go to the bank and they sign paperwork to allow you to access the accounts. This will allow you to monitor what is happening, pay their bills, and take care of them. If you are part of a family with issues, it can be wise to have 2 different people sign on to the account so you can watch each other and prove you aren't stealing from mom yourself.   \nIn addition, call the 3 credit monitoring agencies and have their accounts locked. This will prevent someone taking out a new loan in your elder's name without additional verification. It can still be done, if the scammer gets the elder to approve it over the phone or in writing, but will help prevent casual loans from scammers.  \nLastly, make sure your elder has an account created for them on the social security website. Not having an account has become a common way to steal tax refunds and identities.",

No one outside the family should, in my opinion.\nYou yourself could take the financial stuff on, your husband could help with tech (maybe find some more intuitive/easy/senior-oriented solutions). You could hire a personal support worker  (who is bonded, through an agency) to help with managing meals, medication, and personal care. Probably someone else would do cleaning. That would be ideal. \nAs far as talking to your brother about this - he sounds like a bit of an inflexible autocrat. I would try to reassure him that you\u2019ve got things covered (seems like you\u2019re trying this :/). Maybe a third party could mediate this. In my area, seniors are referred (by anyone but often through a hospital or doctor) to a government agency that manages care in the community. There is a coordinator to speak to. Someone like that might be able to help with this conversation with your brother and come up with other solutions as well.",

Since she can't go to the gym anymore (and refuses \"home exercise\"), she's gotten shakier on her feet, and in November she fell flat on her face. Then explosive (and I mean, like, horrific) diarrhea in mid-December, and now despite our best efforts, a UTI, which has ramped up the confusion several notches. \nSundowning has gotten more and more of a problem for us as time passes. I've lived here for uh, almost 3 years, and it started gradually but now she gets anxious in the evenings/as it gets dark because she feels like she's forgetting something (yes, everything) or that she's supposed to go somewhere.  \nWe tried various calendar systems, but if she knows something is planned for the day, she will panic as she remembers something is happening but not what, and that panic will just follow her all day. (even if the event is detailed on the board, she will forget it / panic about it / forget the board is there and just continue to feed the anxiety loop.) So we ended up with a whiteboard with a permanent little message that we update daily:  \n> Today is [month]/[day]\n> [weekday]\n> Nothing is happening today!\n> Love, [Grandson's Name]  \nAnd we moved a clock that shows the day/date in addition to the time to be directly beside this little board (so she doesn't get up to make sure the information on the board means today, because it can't mean today because isn't something happening today?).  \nWhen we had messages like \"Haircut at 3:30\" she would start getting ready every time she saw the message, no matter what time it was--getting dressed to go out, looking for her purse and checkbook, and sometimes just walking out the door to find her own way there.  Or \"Dinner with [Relative],\" she'd see that and wonder what I'm going to be doing about dinner if she's going out to supper, so she'll seek me out every thirty seconds to make sure that I know I have full run of the kitchen and liquor cabinet.  \nIt's really sweet of her, and it's become something of a ritual, where she insists that I help myself to everything, anything in the house, and I say, \"Yes Grandma, when you come home, we will have eaten everything!\" And she laughs and goes along with whoever has come to pick her up.",

GPS tracking is definitely not a perfect solution, but it can be helpful as things progress. The one we make in the US might be a good fit for your family. The app is pretty straightforward and you can set up geofencing alerts (so if he wanders off, your mother-in-law will know)\nI shared this already on another thread but I thought it fit here too. A few weeks back a customer sent us this story about finding her mom. \nDon't hesitate to reach out in DM if you've got any questions.\n\"It was an incredibly stressful day! My parents are very independent people. Our (my sisters and I) original intent in purchasing the gps device was for peace of mind for us. My sisters and I all live outside of our home state. We wanted to make sure my mom never became lost when driving. She is becoming a bit more forgetful than we are comfortable with and is not a cellphone user. We placed the GPS in the glove compartment of my parent's car. My older sister linked it to her phone. One day, my mom had been gone most of the morning. My sister, out of state, looked on the GPS app and saw that she was not just far from home, but heading towards the neighboring state! My sisters, father and I did a group FT and decided we needed to call state troopers to locate and stop the car. With the help of your device my sister was able to give the troopers specific enough information that the vehicle was found within a half hour! And this is with the car driving on a freeway! The trooper called and let us know when he found her and was safe. My father rented a car to pick her up and the first thing she said was \"\" How did you find me\"\"? She was absolutely stunned, surprised and grateful we found her. We hate to even think how our story would have ended had we not purchased your GPS. Happy endings indeed! It really worked perfectly! Seriously, we have been singing the praises of your company ever since. We give it an 11/10. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude03\u201d\n-Matt from Invoxia",

Anyone who falls and cannot get back up, is incontinent, has trouble swallowing, isn\u2019t able to cook or do his washing needs a full time aide or a appropriate facility. He hopes his health will improve but he\u2019s not doing anything to make that happen. I also agree that getting him to agree is going to be difficult. Does the Assisted Living Facility offer activities he would enjoy? I would approach it from the social, food, fun side. Take a virtual tour (or live if you don\u2019t have COVID restrictions.) Let him see how nice and clean the rooms are. Ask for sample menus to share with him. Tell him you\u2019d feel so much better if you knew he was having fun and eating well. Maybe suggest he try it for a month and he can go home if it doesn\u2019t work for him. Good luck!",

And the incontinence, is it that he can't tell he's going, or he just can't get out of bed fast enough to get to the toilet? A urinal jar by the bed might be a solution if it's the second, then he could empty it when he had to get up for something else.\nMy FIL was one of those old guys who just don't bother to take care of themselves or the house after the wife is gone. The solution he found was having a roommate, a younger lady who stayed in his house and cooked and cleaned instead of paying rent. She wasn't there around the clock, she still worked and spent time with her kids and grandkids. But it was good knowing someone was there sometimes.",

With your fathers liquidated assets set up a trust to cover his expenses.  Go over the will if he has one at the same time.\nAlso, be prepared to have your father throw every nasty thing at the book at you to get you to stop.

        "text": "Hi /u/William444555, I'm sorry to hear about your mother. That's a really rough situation to be in. My grandmother suffered from dementia throughout her 90s (she made it to 96!) although thankfully she didn't tend to wander. That balance between independence and security is really tricky.\nI know a bit about these things as I work for a company which makes GPS trackers. Maybe I can contribute to the discussion. \n*Here's an overview of the different types of trackers on the market today.\n*\n\n\nBluetooth trackers: \nThere are lots out there but the best known are Tile and Samsung's Tag. They great for finding your keys when you've misplaced them at home. Within a range of 30 or so yards, they can be incredibly accurate. As more and more people use them, you will also be able to locate your Tile/Tag remotely using data collected from passers-by. Great for keys and small items you often misplace, not so great for vehicles or people. \n\n\nReal time GPS Trackers: \nThere is a pretty wide range of trackers in this category and most are focused on vehicle tracking. A large number of the cheaper options are the same 2 or 3 models rebranded and resold by different companies under different names.\n\n\nThese trackers ether use 2G/3G (or rarely, 4G) networks to constantly update their location. For vehicles they can be hardwired in. However, outside of use in a vehicle, because they are updating all the time, their battery life is very short (or they use a massive battery to compensate). These sort of trackers are great for keeping an eye on your fleet of delivery vehicles to know where they are at every second, or for tracking your bike route across town. There are some wearable trackers (watches, etc.) which are mostly marketed for use with children that function in a similar way. Again, battery life is the limiting factor and they typically need to be charged every day. \nMany companies selling this type of tracker are looking to make a profit off the monthly subscription, and not the sale of the hardware. In the U.S. these subscription costs can range anywhere from $15 - $30 per month. If purchasing this type of tracker, be wary of the low upfront prices. \n\n\nGPS Alert Beacons:\nThe most well known brand in this category is SPOT. These trackers are designed to work practically anywhere and are a great lifeline for hikers and outdoors enthusiasts. The're usually designed to only send out an alert if a button is pressed. They can also send prerecorded messages. Great for outdoor sports, not great for elderly parents who will forget to press the SOS button. Expensive, but worth their weight in gold if you're hiking solo. \n\n\nGPS Trackers with motion sensing and regular interval position updates\n\n\nThis last category use the same 2G/3G/4G networks as the real time trackers, but either only activate when they sense motion, or send regular less frequent updates about their position. These trackers are great for theft prevention and recovery, as well as tracking people. You won't get the picture perfect map of every step your mother's taken throughout her day, but you'll get a ping every few minutes. The biggest advantage here is that battery life can be extremely good. \nThere are a handful of companies out there which make trackers like this, (disclaimer: my own included) and some are the right size/shape to be tied into clothing, slipped into a pocket or handbag. \nI think this is the category where you should be looking. Are you based in the U.S. or U.K.?\nSome of our customers are definitely using our trackers to keep an eye on their elderly parents/grandparents and, from what we've seen, they're working well. We didn't design specifically for this use, but I'm glad our products are helping families like this. \nAs I don't know this subreddit's rules, I'm going to avoid linking to anywhere, but feel free to DM me or google my company. \n\nMatt from Invoxia\n",

Now I have playlists that run all night. It keeps her anxiety down. \nWe have Wyze cams. They are inexpensive plug and plays. We told her they were alarms to keep anyone from getting in without us knowing. She didn\u2019t really know they were cameras. They have little door alarms and motion detectors as well. Occasionally she would unplug, but they soon became part of the background. I live with her now. I now have two cameras and bed alarms in her room. I keep my phone open showing her all night. If she trips an alarm I can look over and see if she is getting up, or starting to fall if the bed or whatever. Sometimes she is just turning over. It saves me from getting up more than needed. \nGood luck.",

I tried the blink mini too because I need routines but I had troubles getting the routines to work with those too even though they should have been seamless as they are amazon brand.\nI don't have a particular brand suggestion, but I do suggest you look for cameras that specifically can trigger routines if you think there might even be a slim chance you need routines triggered in the future.  Also, if you think allowing multiple users to have different levels and times of access is important, id make sure the camera can do that as well. I want to higher a caregiver and give them camera access during certain hours of the day only.  But blink minis don't allow for different users and eufy cams allow different users but don't allow restrictions based on time of day.  Although, I'm just getting an extra eufy came and then putting a smart plug in that turns the cam off during certain hours a day as a work around. Miss cheaper than the more expensive cameras that can do all the stuff I want.\nFyi, ou can get samsung smart watch 3 and not get a data plan if you wanted.  I only suggested the data plan because if she left an area with wifi, then some of the watch functions wouldn't work but i think it should still work within wifi.    That doesn't require an iPhone and you could just get the wifi version if you dont want a monthly fee.  Do a little research on the watch if you choose to buy tho cause I haven't actually gotten it yet.\nJust an FYI, The fee is just $10 a month typically  for data with most plans.  Though like i said, if you're in wifi you don't need it.  $5 per month if you are on magenta or above plan on tmobile.  But yeah, I'm debating getting the plan myself (will research more later) as I don't have a magenta plan.  I'm going to get the lte version tho just in case I change my mind.",

Those centers also have social workers who can help with accessing services. \nYou can't do it all on your own. Your parents are likely to be eligible for services - let them know you need help. And set it up. Caregiver burnout is a real thing, and you have said yourself that you are struggling. \nIt sounds like your mother needs a thorough check up from a specialist for older people. This is not normal at all, and her medications may have to be adjusted. \nYour dad is being a self entitled ass. A social worker might be able to come up with ideas on how to deal with his behavior. He is a generation behind in his thinking - my brothers are 67 and 75 and they both are able to cook, clean and take care of kids. \nFor teaching intellectually disabled people how to do things, we use a method called backwards chaining. You could use it on your dad - think of it as a bit of a game. See what he will do and then provide food just a little bit further away or food that needs just a little bit more effort to put together. \nFor example - with the sandwich, you could make it, give it to him but just put the condiment(s) he likes on the table so he has to do it. Very gradually change it so you are putting the sandwich fixings on the table.  Then\"accidentally\" forget to put a condiment he likes on the table - so he has the choice to either get it or eat without it. The point isn't to punish him it is to help him get used to doing things himself. Eventually, put the sandwich fixings on the counter and hand him a plate. Again, forget some part of it in the fridge. Eventually he should be able to take all the things out of the fridge or cupboard himself. \nSame with soup or casseroles - start with him serving himself from a pot on the table, move it to the stovetop, put a plate of food in the microwave and ask him to take it out, start the microwave for him and let him know it will be warm in two minutes, hand him a cold plate and let him know how long to set the microwave - he can eat it cold or heat it up himself. Gradually, you should be able to leave a sandwich or a plate of food for him. \nBut mostly you need to get services in and get support to set boundaries. Let them know what is \"too far\". The fact that they invited you to live with them gives you a bit of leverage. Smoking in the house where there is a baby or a child is no longer acceptable. \nI am feeling cranky on your behalf. They are barely older than I am and I find their behavior to be outrageous. Please take care of yourself. Make sure you and the baby get out for a few hours most days, and make sure you take time with your husband, too.",

All I have heard of have semilars/resources/counselling on caregiver burnout and setting boundaries. \nI figured your dad knows how to do things. Backward chaining also works with inappropriate or maladaptive behaviors. It is an interesting bit of psychology to see where his limit is. Is he willing to take a plate from your hand or to pull a plate towards himself if you put it so he has to reach for it? Is he willing to take food off a common plate? Find his limit and just push it a little. It helps you with having a project and it helps him to gradually be more involved. \nLet their social worker and their doctor know they are needing more help than you can offer and they are refusing extra help. You can't do this on your own. You are being reasonable in your expectations. They are allowed to make poor choices for themselves but you don't have to fix things if they are unwilling to. They can refuse services but that does not mean that you have to take up the slack. \nIf things are bad for your mental or physical health, the health of your baby or your relationship with your husband you are allowed to leave and act as a daughter rather than a caregiver. Take care of yourself first. This is not sustainable.",

If they don\u2019t want to change, all your worry and stress is hurting you and not helping them. \nMy personal opinion is that you need to focus on your child, husband and yourself. Your parents want you as a full time maid, cook, and care giver, but they aren\u2019t willing to stop a habit that is very harmful to your daughter. That is not fair nor loving. I think it is time for you to move out. Your main responsibility is your child\u2019s health and safety.

Your dad needs a reality check and to know that there are consequences to his choices. Maybe hearing some tough love and realizing that he might have to get separated from his wife, daughter, and grandchild might motivate him to help get up and do something! \nThat said, you also need to get to the bottom in understanding his lack of trying. Is he depressed? Is he just being lazy because he\u2019s had it so good for so long? Is he afraid that he will leave burners on? Is he intimidated to try because he feels overwhelmed in not knowing what to do? If you can find that out, that\u2019s at least somewhere you can start, be it in getting him into therapy, purchasing gadgets specific for seniors living at home (special can/jar openers, timers, alert systems, etc.), or giving him some basic lessons in how to operate the microwave and stovetop, and leaving brightly colored index cards with instructions posted on the kitchen cabinet doors.\nI\u2019m so sorry, OP, that you\u2019re parents are being so stubborn and hope that you will stick up for yourself and your family!",

There are some remotes that have pictures of  the app names (nexflix, hulu, prime are on mine) but you might have better luck just switching over to a basic cable that's always on and getting a simple remote. Our cable company had a senior-friendly remote included when we switched. Now we rarely have problems, though she does sometimes point the remote the wrong way (a red arrow taped to the control may be a good solution if that becomes an issue)\nAs far as the phone, I found a flip phone is much less likely to be confused for a remote (or sat down and lost because it just looks like a shiny black box). In lieu of that, you may get a clunky case on which you can put a label \"PHONE\" right at the top. It might not solve the problem, but it may help.",

I know it doesnt matter that its easy to use, all that matters is that its hard for him to remember and figure out. Its been getting worse so it seems that he is declining cognitively. What I considered is taking a pic of his devices and doing a poster and labeling one phone and one remote. I dont think it will help to write directions on how to get to the different channels. he would forget to look at it. part of his issue is he just clicks buttons without knowing where his thumb is at. So he just clicks but hes not clicking on the right button. If I can just get him to understand which is the remote and to look what he clicks on I think thats half the battle. \n   There is a voice search on Youtube but it isnt very good and he doesnt speak clearly. I just labeled the back of his phone and the lower half of the remote, will see what that does. Need to add an arrow.

She has good days and bad but isn't anywhere near where she used to be even on her best days. I feared a stroke but she got an MRI and her Dr. said it was normal for someone of her age.",

But its very coincidental that she was fine and then right after getting the vaccine she was never the same again. That was a month ago.",

        "text": "We went through this a few years back with my father, who now has managed to rehab up enough that on good days he can walk around the house without his walker even.  Our case, it ended up being that I could not physically handle him because of his size and my own deteriorating health, so we've all had to put in the work here to keep going.  \nAt this point, the best option would be to get her back into some PT.  You may be able to do this with just a phone call to her doctor to see if you can get physical therapy to come to her at home.  That way, PT can also assess her other needs and get her strengthened up a bit more too to hopefully prolong these things from happening, rather than making her adapt.  As long as she's making progress in it, medicare should cover most of the expense, plus being mostly homebound as it sounds, she is eligible for them to come.  The more independence she can keep now, the better it will be for her and you physically, mentally, and emotionally.  \nI'd recommend a gait belt if you don't already have one.  \nFor dressing, if she can balance standing with a walker, you can dress her while sitting on the commode.  Her cleanups between baths/showers can be done there too before getting dressed while sitting there.  You can dress her upper half that way, then help get her pants, socks, and shoes on while seated on it, giving you more access to line stuff up with her legs.  Then you help her stand, she grips the walker for support, and you pull up the pants.  If she needs to sit back down then she can and you can swap the walker for the wheelchair where she needs it.  If she cannot do that, you can do the upper half of the body still on the commode, and the lower half you may have to do while she lays on the bed, with her laying on one side while you pull up the other side that you can access, and have her roll then to the other side and repeat.  \nAs for devices, there are technically standing lift machines (or sit to stand lifts, sit to stand machines) they use in assisted living and such, but they are expensive.  There may be some lower cost ones available, but even the ones used professionally are used between multiple people.\nAs for the incontinence, if you can get her to the commode on a schedule, it can start to help too, even if she says she doesn't need to go right then, the body learns.  Plus, her doctor may be able to look at her meds and see if something is contributing to it too.  That happened with my mother and it helped some when she was taken off one of her medications and another one was changed in dosage.",

        "text": "First, you sound like you are already at burnout stage. \nIf your sister is really there to help you out, then I suggest you get the actual help you need from her. She works full time yes but you are literally working 24/7 so she still has more spare time to help. Even if it's only on her off days. \nI'm guessing you need like an actual vacation to recharge yourself. Even if it's only 2-3 days of you not being responsible for everything. Seriously good uninterrupted sleep and not being in caregiver mode is essential. \nYou need off time. Even if it's only an hour a day. You need time to do literally whatever you want. Steal a kitten, rob a bank, watch paint dry, scream into the void, it doesn't matter what it is. No one should be asking you how you use that time to decompress. It is your time and you need it to be a functioning caregiver.\nWithout any break you will be going further into the burnout which is going to hurt. You're going to make mistakes and it's hard to come back from a major mistake. Likely it will be something not related to caregiving. Like putting in the red with the white laundry. Dropping a plate because you thought you put it on the shelf but you're so tired you couldn't tell the difference. Worse driving while you're burnt out and you may literally not see the cars on side streets because you're so tired and stressed out. I've done the double take and been unable to tell if it was my turn or they came up after I checked both ways. \nIt's terrifying and at the same time hard to avoid when burnout hits you. You don't know how it is going to affect you exactly. At some point your brain will miss something that didn't seem important. You don't want to get to that point. It's not even your fault as you're doing your best with the resources you have. \nI don't want to scare you but I do want to say I've been there. I hope you take enough time for self care. You need to have time alone. Even being in the same room watching TV is stressful because you're always in caregiving mode. You're always wondering if they need something.",

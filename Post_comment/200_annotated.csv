caregiver burnout,"over a year ago, spouse was diagnosed with stage iv colon cancer. he's had numerous surgeries, 6 months of chemo, two more hospital stays, a stay in a nursing home, home health care, blood transfusions, the works. i sold our farm, moved us to an area nearer to hospitals. i used up all my leave to take him to the medical services. i sold my beloved car and bought a more comfortable van. i researched cancer and fill out forms. i take care of the bills and paperwork, taxes, rx and keeping his family informed. i am his only caregiver and the only breadwinner. his cancer has exploded and he only has about 5 months left. incredibly, he wants more treatment! i am exhausted, burnt out and desperately need closure. he sits at home and watches tv all day. the fact that his spouse is staggering with exhaustion and sick from anger doesn't register with him. he has no pension, no benefits except from my job and basically contributes nothing but always wants something. he's forever ordering rubbish from amazon and running up credit card bills. he refuses to see the misery he's created.  my life is wrecked and will not get peace until after he passes. oh, and he's rude to his doctors, too. i cry with anger and exhaustion and he's say  'i'm glad you love me so much and grieve for my passing '. which is of course, totally wrong. i'm crying because i'm exhausted and am no longer grieving, just needing him to get on with it.  thanks for letting me vent.",psychosocial

hello! need your opinion!,"hello! my name is ann. my team and me are working on a 3-headed electric toothbrush which effectively cleans teeth without any complicated movements needed. we plan to adapt it for people with special needs and eldery health issues.  toothbrush concept:  1. it cleans teeth without any efforts and complicated proper movements, because the toothbrush has 3 heads, that cover the tooth from all sides at the right angle and with the right pressure. you just need to move it from tooth to tooth.  2. since the brush cleans immediately 3 sides of the tooth, it cleans much faster. if you have any info about what should we take into account to make the toothbrush as effective as possible for people with special needs, please, click on the link below to answer some questions. i would highly appreciate if you could help us. https://jedibrush.com/special_form",daily care
when the timeline becomes jumbled.,"hey all. to make a long story short, after a string of traumatic events (a car wreck involving head-trauma, great grandmother's death, and my aunt's death) my nana has been showing signs of alzheimer's. my great grand-mother was also affected by alzheimer's; however, she was older than my nana is now. my nana has been divorced and my papaw is remarried to my mamaw (all these familial terms, lol). she has never hated my mamaw, maybe not liked, but never hated, though she now is certain that my mamaw and papaw got married immediately after my nana and papaw got a divorce and it burns her up. she genuinely believes it with her whole heart. to make matters worse, my nana was the one cheating on my papaw! so there's that. i would argue that my nana is still in touch with our reality to whatever extent, but our timelines and belief of how events played out is so different. how the hell do you deal with something like this? do you play into it, knowing it's not the truth? just ignore it? arguing only upsets her.",psychosocial
how to motivate my grammy,"hey everyone, i'm 22 and new here. my grammy is about stage 5-6, and my family (me, my husband, and our two young kids) have just moved back to my hometown so i can be the caretaker for my grandparents, mostly my grammy who is 82. she lives at home with my grandfather, they've been married 60+ years and up until this point he's been able to do most everything for her himself.  i come over everyday now, about 6-7 hours a day, to help with meals, housework, activities etc. but i'm at a bit of a loss! my grammy was an avid quilter, loved to crochet, scrapbook, make cards... but i can't get her to do anything! she isn't interested at all in any of those things or even anything in that area. she just wants to sit in her chair. occasionally she'll read her guideposts, or watch the price is right, but i'm really struggling getting her to do things. i don't want to push her too hard as she can get very testy, but i know it would be good for her to engage in an activity of some sort.  any thoughts?",daily care
"this time around, i'm being proactive.","i'll just quickly share my experience and advice and then a resource. five years ago my family and i began noticing signs that my mother was having difficulty completing everyday tasks. initially, we looked at these things she was doing as quirky, elderly silliness. at the time, she was picking up my kids from school every day and they would notice that she seemed off and her driving was becoming a little more aggressive, she'd show up to school later and later, she had strange cuts on her hands and face, and one time she forgot they were in the car and went home instead of our house. i decided to change our routine and i began picking up the kids. all good, right? nope. basically, now that the kids weren't seeing her every day, we were no longer getting those all too important progress reports from them. we got busy with our lives, and we only spoke to her on the phone, and other some minor confusion, she seemed fine during those calls. fast forward two weeks and her neighbor is calling us saying she is at their house telling them that there are people staying at her house, so she needs to move in with them. we arrive to find her covered in bruises, unwashed, empty refrigerator, and untouched prescription bottles. those final years of her life were up and down and full of resentment. she seemed angry with me, and frankly, i can't blame her. so, now that my father-in-law has had some minor memory issues and one fall, we have had to have some difficult conversations, but i won't wait this time. i took several online assessments, like this one, as soon as i started to feel like something was off. be proactive, get help from professionals, and take care of yourself!",resource
advice on how to speak to my mom,"my 71 year old mother has been dealing with alzheimer's for many years. i've been bathing her about a year now. dad turns off gas and locks doors ( supplying details to give a frame of reference ). she often talks about going home to check on her parents (gone for 20 years) or kids (i'm her youngest at 34 years old) or whatever. she yells at my dad to take her home all the while saying their current home  is actually her house her dad got for her (it isn't). we are managing, but what's best to say to her? when she pleads to me to pick her up and take her home? most if the time, i can change the topic and she forgets eventually, but sometimes she gets fixated. do i go pick her up and drive around? do i gently remind her she is home? do i just listen? what's best in your experiences?",daily care
at what point should you hire a caretaker/move them to memory care?,"my grandma is 78 and in the 5th stage - she is conversational but mostly confused and if she's not at home she doesn't know where she is. she has a history of depression and mood swings and currently takes seroquel and aricept. lately she has been very unpredictable and upsets very easily, often walking out on her own out of anger (my grandfather follows her). she constantly threatens to take off and find a job for herself, spending hours yelling about it. my grandfather is her sole caretaker right now, all other family are too far and/or work full time and cannot be there daily. it is very difficult for him (he is 85) and he is finding it exhausting. when she is at home she constantly wants to go out, even right after coming home, and when she is out she wants to go home. it is very sad for my grandpa as he says he can still take care of her and she can still shower/go to the bathroom by herself, but i know it is becoming unbearable especially with her typical mood swings + sundowning. she needs to be watched around the clock and he doesn't have the energy for that, now that he's taken on all the chores and cooking and cleaning. right now, i think an in-home caretaker would make sense but i want to hear your opinions. was there a breaking point when you decided you needed to hire a caretaker or decided to move them to a care home? i am most concerned about the wandering at the moment, and giving my grandpa some respite from the daily housework.",care transition

what kind of questions to ask the doctor?,"my grandmother, whose (likely) dementia has been worsening at an increased pace for the last two or so years, but she was always able to talk herself out of a diagnosis when at the doctors, and my grandfather was in denial about all of it. she now hasnt been to a doctor in over a year for any reason because she doesnt like to leave the house.  lately she has been alternating between confusing my grandpa for her abusive step father or not know who he is entirely. she would call my dad at all hours of the day and night to tell him there is a man in their house, she didnt feel safe, and wanted to go home. my dad is always able to calm her down, so although stressful for all involved, my grandpa was still not convinced she needed medical intervention. she oftentimes thinks people are breaking into the house, someone is stealing their money, or spying on them.  my grandma walks hunched over with a cane. she can barely get around their small home on a good day. she hasnt driven anywhere in 7 or so years. my grandpa has breathing problems and tires out easily, and often naps.  today, for the first time, my grandma left the house while he was sleeping. it is 30 and freezing rain here today, but she decided to go for a walk. a neighbor saw her down the street and took her back home. grandpa called my dad, who came over and had a hard talk about taking her to the doctor.  so, on monday they will call and make an appointment with her gp. what sort of questions should we ask in order to get the full picture and to help my grandpa understand it a little bit better? i know this isnt going to be easy on either of them, but we want to try to make things as painless as possible.  thanks",characteristics

updates to my last post,"hey everybody, it's me again. this was my last post in case anybody is wondering. it was really nice feeling supported from everyone, this sub has really become a source of comfort, advice, and knowledge for me.  i wanted to give a bit of an update. incontinence started earlier than my predictions, with the first recorded instance happening last night. i don't know if it was a full-blown accident, as it seems more like she didn't follow bathroom hygiene for a while and maybe it built up to the point of being visible? i don't know, and it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things.  mil was walking around and had a large spot on the back of her pants that i pointed out to bf. he tried to talk to her about it, but it ended up with her denying and him losing his patience. she eventually took a bath and we swapped out the pants. bf was exhausted and he's been in shock pretty much all night. he doesn't want to believe that this is happening and wants to believe this is a one-off and that she still has another 6+ months before having to worry about continence issues.  bf is poa, and is feeling overwhelmed, saying he didn't realize that poa meant doing so much. i think last night was a huge eye-opener as even he realizes that fighting with his mom every day to change her underwear is a lot. he's been really sad about this latest step, understandably so. i've tried bringing him to the sub, but he says he's not ready for all that, although he appreciates it when i read some of your posts and helpful responses out loud for him. we talked it over for a while, and he messaged his sister and we're having a small family meeting tonight after work. according to him, she hasn't been telling him all the awful details that have been happening when she takes mil out once a week. i'm not sure about this, because sil and i have talked about it multiple times. he says he was doubting both of our stories because he didn't see it, it hasn't happened to him, and that we were alone when it was happening. i pointed out that he's the one in the family that's famous for having a temper and also that he is a man and his mother has been getting increasingly sexist in the last year or so and that may be affecting the way she addresses him. we also talked about our approaches to care. he admitted that he had been feeling like i was being a wicked witch and a bit of a dictator with trying to establish care. he also said i was being mean to his mom. i asked for clarification and explained that i keep my tone neutral and use easy to understand words when i'm asking her to do something because any other tone elicits an outburst from her as she really doesn't like authority, or me for that matter. he did acknowledge that i've never yelled at her, or sworn at her, or anything like that and that he didn't know that was why i was keeping voice low and that maybe he had misinterpreted what i was doing.  bf apologized to me for being mean to me when he's realizing that me being  'cold & clinical ' is simply trying to talk to him about where we are in the process and how to make his mother's quality of life better. he has been a bit frazzled and has never really had a routine, so it's been a constant struggle establishing one. for instance, last night, dinner wasn't even on the table until 11pm! granted, the accident was a huge factor, but we're just all over the place schedule-wise. i sat down with him last night and wrote out a schedule of care that she would be expected to get if she was in a hospital, or a nursing home. i told him i was willing to help as long as we could argue that the quality of her life with us would be higher than she would be getting in a home. i also wrote down a list of symptoms to bring up on their next dr visit in february.  i'm hoping that after tonight's meeting, we can really start in earnest to find placement for mil, or at least some sort of respite.",care transition

dad has nuerology appointment tomorrow,"im taking my dad to a nuero appt tomorrow. he was diagnosed with early stage alzheimers last august. he was told not to drive then. he has continued to drive, saying hes fine.  tbh, im not sure if its time to pull his license or not. i dont drive with him much. when i do, hes ok. the last six months have been horrendous. three weeks after my dads diagnosis my normally stable step-mom had a full psychotic break and has been way off ever since.  she tells us stories about him and his driving, but we arent sure if they are true. shes so manic and demanding that we cant really tell the extent of his problems. weve really been focused on her issues way more lately as she has needed a lot more help. she was the one that ran things for the two of them and now she cant balance her checkbook or follow a recipe.  heres whats has got me worried: - he has said, many times that if he cant drive his life is over. its his freedom and once he loses that his life will be over.  - he has always been a struggle to deal with. hes quite anti-social, prone to depression. he doesnt do anything but sit at home and watch youtube videos and drive to a local drive thru for a diet pepsi most days. and my step-mom sends him to the grocery store every few days.  - my step-mom hasnt been driving much since her break. shes very uncomfortable behind the wheel.  - i live 45 mins away. my sister is closer. about 5 mins away. i know there are services available to take them places like the grocery store, but we arent sure they will use them.  ultimately im scared im going to see my father give up tomorrow. ive heard so many stories of people that decline terribly after they cant drive anymore. im pretty sure the neurologist is going to really tell him to stop and its going to hit like a ton of bricks.",psychosocial

super frustrated with this whole process,"ughhhh, i'm just very angry about the whole thing. i've been fighting with my bf for a while now about getting his mother onto a waitlist for a nursing home knowing that it'll be about 2 years before she gets placed. he has refused to and is now saying she doesn't have the low-income insurance that she needs to get onto the waitlist. i'm frustrated because he isn't doing anything to get his mom the proper care that she needs and it's going to get way worse before it gets better. we live in a 2 bedroom apartment and the bedrooms and the bathroom is on the second floor. she's gained a lot of weight in the last year and is having trouble getting off the couch and the stairs are making her tired. i don't think she has much time left before she is unable to navigate them. she is also complaining of problems with her bowels constantly, of having diarrhea, which i suspect is her articulating that she is getting close to losing continence. bf is convinced that isn't the case and that it's simply her diet. she is also getting increasingly aggressive. she is irritable and angry with both me and my bf's sister. she yells, swears and threatens violence. she also hurls a lot of racist statements my way (i'm asian). his sister and i are on the same page regarding her care and needs and it's frustrating that bf can't see it that way. his biggest problem is that he doesn't want her to feel afraid and that's why he's resistant to her going anywhere. i understand his fear, but i feel that she is going to be afraid regardless and that it would be better to get her acclimated to a new environment sooner so that she has a chance to recognize her surroundings.  i worked as a nursing assistant to get through school and it's been really frustrating. i've worked in nursing homes and they're not as bad as people make them out to be. yes, they're not home, i get it, but they're not jails.  i've been trying to help him navigate the waters but he's been resistant to any help. when she was first placed on her meds, i mentioned that she should be on an antidepressant because of her behavior and to help her sleep. he eventually decided to take her off of it without telling anybody because he felt that i was too pill-happy and trying to overmedicate her. that led to a solid 2 months of her crying constantly, being angry with everybody and just having a really rough time before he realized that she really needed the meds. i'm worried that she's going to need assistance toileting, and bathing soon and she won't let him help because he's a boy, and she's violent towards me. it's unrealistic to expect his sister to drive over constantly to help because mil is violent towards her as well. i feel like he is setting us up for failure because by the time she really really needs help, we won't be able to get help when we need it. he told me yesterday that he'd rather the two of them move into a studio apartment and he can just deal with her so that she can die in her own bed. i'm really tempted to let him do it, but that would be a catastrophe, he has a very low patience threshold, constantly loses his temper, and isn't able to give any sort of structure to her life.  i'm just feeling like i'm watching a very slow-moving trainwreck and i'm tied to the rails.",psychosocial

just placed my dad in memory care today,"hello to everyone. i just found this reddit and i just felt the need to post. about six months ago, my 80 year old father was diagnosed with alzheimer's. we had noticed that he was forgetting when he was, and more importantly, this man who always balanced his checkbook to the penny had suddenly racked up tons of debt and had collectors calling him. shortly after the diagnosis, he was mostly ago, until about two months ago. he started falling constantly, wanted to go  'home ' (where this home was, we never knew) and was hallucinating people. it turns out he developed a uti on top of this, which made matters worse. they thankfully were able to clear that up, but it seems that the uti made him progress faster than any of us expected. we thought maybe we could do assisted living, but it turned out he needed more care than that. so after a lot of talk and discussion, we made the choice to place him in memory care faculty. today was his move in day, and after spending about two months in an absolutely horrible wreck of a nursing care facility, he seemed much happier in the new place. he has his own room now and lots of people he can interact with. i know we made the right decision as no-one in the family could give him the proper care he needed, but i'm still a wreck. i know i shouldn't feel this way, but i feel horribly guilty about having to place him there. i have no idea why i'm having these feelings. i also am a wreck just knowing that he's slowly going to slip away and one day, he's just going to be a shell, i guess placing him there just kinda of confirmed it for me. is this normal? has anyone else gone through this? i guess i just needed to let it out. thank you for listening.",psychosocial

enjoyable activities?,"hi everyone. we lost my grandma to alzheimers last december and now my grandpa is progressing into mid/late stage alzheimers as well. he is extremely bored all the time and i want to find things for him to do. right now he pretty much just watches tv. the problem is we have gotten him word searches (his favorite pre-alz), easy puzzles, simple games, etc but he refuses to use them.  he is very stubborn and still lucid a lot of the time, so things that are too childish like busy boxes offend him. he is also still struggling a lot with not being able to drive.  i feel helpless because every time we talk he brings up the fact that he is so bored and cant do anything. does anyone have any ideas how i can help? i live on the other side of the country so just visiting more isnt currently an option.

surprised by the level of grief following loved one's death,"my late mother had alzheimer's for 10 years and at the time i thought i would feel little more than relief when she finally died, and that i'd already done my grieving when she lost the last vestiges of her personality; i even felt guilty about my callousness on the subject. however when she died the grief hit like a brick. it was like the last 10 years didn't happen, and i thought about the person she used to be and all the things i missed about her, which was something i almost never did while she was still alive. it was a confusing, disjointed type of grief too, because the painful memories were from so long ago.",psychosocial

how do we introduce in-home care?,"our specific details are below, but tl,dr: i would love to hear from others about ways that youve gotten your stubborn loved ones to accept in-home & companion care services. what worked well? what totally failed? what recommendations do you have for getting them to accept the new normal? our mom is entering middle stage alzheimers. shes still highly mobile and thats our biggest concern. she has gotten lost on walks, lost her keys on walks, got in a car with strangers that stopped (and asked her to buy them groceries), and neighbors told us they witnessed her nearly cause an accident jay-walking across the busy road a block from her house.  my brother lives nearby, but they have three young kids, his wife is in school, and hes got a demanding job  they help out as much as they can, but coming by daily to go on long walks simply isnt an option. we want to get her companion care to accompany her on walks and errands. as rapidly as we can, we want to also add homemaker care: she needs help/supervision in the kitchen, her never-stellar housekeeping skills are vastly diminished, and shes quit doing laundry because she doesnt want to waste water. i suspect shell be needing personal care within a year or so  shes showing signs that incontinence is approaching. it is important to get her acclimated as quickly as possible. she has so far been very resistant to outside help. for example, she lost her license a year ago & we arranged for a family friend that shes known for 20yrs, who works as a lyft driver to be her on-call ride. she only uses him for one ride a week and the rest of the time she expects someone to offer to pick her up, shell sometimes ask for a ride, or she just wont go. she rejects any assistance that feels outside of family or church  the church folks really only give her rides to church activities. we have so far erred on the side of trying to respect her desire for independence even though thats resulted in a lot of wasted time and money on services shes rejected. but we are past the point where shes able to make good decisions for herself, so this one isnt optional. we anticipate shell resist this too & were trying to think of ways to help her accept that this is the new normal without resorting to command and control tactics. suggestions on how to play it?",care transition

beware of hidden upgrades that cost big,"just learn i need to use parental controls on the tv. my mom has alzheimers, my stepfather is able to care for in their home and i try to support them both. my stepfather called me upset that their cable bill was $60 more than normal. when he called, he was told they upgrade plans. he argued with them and they took off the charges. i followed up to see why they were upgraded to the next package. the cable clerk explained that if you click on a channel not in your plan, the system prop asks if you'd like to upgrade by clicking again. this is what happened and between my mom and my stepfather, who struggles with the tv remote, i'm surprised it hasn't happened before. the clerk explained i could fix the upgrade prop with parental control options. please check your tv, this is such an easy mistake for those with alzheimers (and even without)!",daily care

my grandma just passed away,"she had alzheimers for the past 5ish years and the decline has been fast and heartbreaking to watch. she lost so much weight. there was a time where she would scream in agony all day. she couldnt do anything for herself and towards the end she even forgot how to eat, drink water, walk. even though it has been five years, it feels like it all happened so fast. i remember one day she was telling my dad how she had been driving her car and somehow ended up in the middle of nowhere. and at the time, no one thought anything of it really. but after that, things subtly and gradually got worse. she would forget how to use a tv remote, forget where things were. and eventually she got diagnosed and i still didnt really take it seriously. all old people forget stuff. but it just got worse and worse. she started to forget who my grandad was and would be aggressive towards him, she started having seizures... its like my grandma was 3 different people. theres the grandma i grew up with who was an intelligent, streetwise, quick witted lady who was the centre of our family, the glue that held us all together. then there is her as the alzheimers was in the early stage, the goofy, adorable, silly grandma who always thought our front step was a huge drop when it was actually tiny and giggled at silly nursery rhymes. then there was her at the late stage, an unrecognisable shell. she spent the last year of her life sat in a chair, a far off glassy look in her eye, being completely reliant on other people. i had started university by then and so i wasnt around much. but if im being honest, i didnt visit her enough. my grandad and my aunt and my cousins all had a role in taking care of her and when i was there, i felt like a spare part, useless. i was only close to my grandma, i wasnt close to any of them and im a quiet person by nature, so i wouldnt ever really have much to say. when i was there i felt so out of place...its so odd to feel that way when surrounded by family. as if the situation wasnt depressing enough. not to mention it simply caused me so much pain to watch her suffer the way she did, to see her dignity taken away as people helped her use the bathroom, to see her slipping away. sometimes she would sit and just sob in agony. and that broke me completely.  i think i mourned her death long before it happened. shed been gone a long time, her physical body just had to catch up. im angry that this disease exists and there are so many scumbags who will continue to roam the earth in perfect health while my beautiful grandma wont. i am trying to hold onto the precious memories i have with her before this disease got her. i never want to forget the songs she would sing to me, the sound of her laugh, the way she would always tell me my eyes are bigger than my belly when i couldnt finish my dinner, her beautiful smile, the way she smelt when she would hug me, the way she could fix anything, the stories she told me, the way she would always say goodnight, god bless and remember those three little words: i love you as she tucked me into bed.  no one will ever be able to fathom how much i loved her and how much i still do. i would give anything to hug my grandma one last time. i hope that one day i will get to do just that. goodnight god bless grandma, remember those three little words: i love you.",psychosocial

father's alzheimers weighing down on my mother and family,"hi all, i want to preface by saying i realize there is a faq and that a lot of the problems i might depict in this post are common, but i want to tell a little of my family's story in hopes to get feedback and connect with anyone who has dealt with a similar situation. my father developed dementia and later alzheimers about 5 years ago after i took him to the hospital to be detoxed from alcohol. his alcoholism had gotten so out of hand it was my last resort to try and save him. this unfortunately set off a chain of events that lead to his dementia and alzheimers. he was about 64 years old when this happened and recently retired (forced to due to the alcoholism).  my mother is 11 years his junior and is his primary care taker. i live a few hours away, my only other sibling is my brother who lives in the same city as them with his wife and children. my mother has alcoholic tendencies as well and uses it as a crutch to de stress, along with smoking cigarettes. she has anxiety and depression, and sees a therapist (irregularly) to try and alleviate. she takes an anti depressant and i believe that is all.  i am extremely concerned about my mothers well being. she is under a great amount of stress dealing with my father, who is fairly far along in his alzheimers progression. we are surprised when he forms a complete sentence or thought, wears diapers that he uses, and my mother helps him bathe. unfortunately, he stays at home alone for the 5 hours in the morning / afternoon that my mother is at work. he is able to feed himself with whats in the kitchen and watches tv/naps while she is away. she has a camera installed on her phone that she uses to watch him while shes at work because its difficult getting him to answer the phone. as you all are aware, in care home or elderly care homes are all very expensive. we are not wealthy, but firmly lower middle class. i don't make a lot of money, my brother and his wife make decent money but have a child and one on the way. they live near by and help when needed but we are all a bit at a loss of what to do and how to help my mom. she is so stressed out constantly, understandbly so since she has to work part time and take care of my father when shes home, rarely getting time for herself.  at the moment, we don't really have the funds to put my father in a care facility or anything like that. we may be able to afford it by some way of a small inheritance me and my brother will receive from my father's mother who recently passed, though i fear it is not quite enough to sustain him for the long term there. essentially, my mother is forced to watch my father deteriorate slowly as she sacrifices her life and happiness for him. i have guilt about living far away from them but i had been living in the same city as them for several years and felt stuck and depressed. i moved away for myself and to start my own life (i am 28), as i feel my father and mother wouldn't have wanted me to sacrifice my life to take care of them, though i do second guess this decision all the time and wish i could do more for them.  me and my family have reached a plateau the past couple of years where my mother takes care of him, but i feel she is close to a breaking point mentally. she is so anxious, stressed, depressed, talks about how she is lonely, isolated, wants to date, etc. she is committed to caring for my father however and is steadfast in that. she gets frustrated and isn't perfect but she believes it is her duty to help him. partly i just wanted to tell our story, but i also would accept any advice in way of programs or financial aid or anything that could help me and our family out. my father gets worse everyday, it would break my heart to put him somewhere but i do feel sometimes that it would help my mom immensely to be relieved from that duty and stress.  thank you for reading, and god speed to anybody out there dealing with this condition. it is the darkest part of my life, has changed who i am as a person, and in some ways helps me appreciate life for what it is - a temporary experience. love and peace to you all.",psychosocial
gently correct my grandma or allow her to believe what she wishes?,"hi all! my grandma is starting to lose her memory (and i believe was told that she is developing alzheimers, but i'm not sure). anyway, what do i do? should i correct her? she never says she doesn't remember things, she just says things that are untrue with regards to recent, current events, and often forgets the year. for instance she thought she was 75 and not 86. she thought my brother was turning 17. he was 21. she says she didn't vote when she did. it was the week after the election. she said she hasn't been to the special exhibition at a museum. my mother took her there the week before.  i always just let the moment pass and agree with her, i.e. 'yes, it's a very interesting exhibition, you should go, i know you like that sort of stuff.'  my mum on the other hand is like: ' remember we went last week? we went together and you said xyz.' which approach is correct? she means a lot to me, and it pains me to see this happening to her. this is a terrible disease. the only plus side i see is that it's happening so late in life and that she had 86 good years. :)",daily care

am i the bad guy for my decision/thinking?,"5 years ago my grandmother was diagnosed with dementia, and roughly 2 years ago, alzheimer's was tacked on. it's been quite the journey to get to where we are now with her. there's been multiple home moves, many doctors/specialists appointments, and a lot of family meetings with my mum and her siblings. my mum is currently off work, and has spent the most time making sure my grandma is well taken care of. none of her 3 siblings make the effort as, and i quote,  'what do you want me to do about it?? i have my own life to think about ' my mum goes multiple times a week with my grandpa, and knows how to effectively redirect my grandma when she's on a  'thr nurses are hitting me/my husband's sleeping with other women/he's beating me too ' line of thought. these nurses are an absolute god send, and my grandpa has never laid a hand on her, nor would he ever. they don't even live together, as my grandma is in a wonderful ltc facility and grandpa is on the wait list to get in the same place.  anyways, my issue is this.. my aunts and uncles all want to take my grandma out of the home for a big family get together (where grandma will recognize maybe 4 people) and i believe this to be a horrid idea. not only because of how big (and confusing) our family is, but how badly she will lose her marbles when they have to take her back in. she has fought nurses screaming  'help me [my mum]!!

serious considerations are hard,"mom's been pretty deep in alzheimer's for a while now. at the beginning of this year she could sign her name pretty competently, now i'm not sure that she could hold a pen, let alone read, and she certainly can't sign her name. my dad's the primary caregiver, and i'm the backup. i had to give her a bath for the first time recently, which was upsetting, but it's hard to stop and consider your own emotions when there's a bone thin woman in the bathtub crying because she's cold. my sister's been pretty great, we've had serious conversations about moms decline, she's visiting frequently and making sure that she spends time with mom. my brother on the other hand has been frustrating to say the least. everytime he visits he's got his girlfriend in tow, he doesn't prioritize his family, he runs off and does touristy things with his girlfriend, and gets drunk and parties. he hasn't made time for the serious shitty conversations, and i can't express to him how frustrated i am because i haven't been alone with him in two years cause his girlfriend's always there. in the family group chat he always turns himself into the victim cause we're mean to him because we're frustrated with him and he doesn't have the emotional intelligence to figure that out, so i just confronted him about it, and he said he's gonna visit more this year, and i responded that's great and all but im beginning to doubt she'll last another year. which is true, but maybe a little too mean. i'm just upset cause really the time to have made an effort has passed but im also afraid that i hurt him cause he hasn't responded.",psychosocial

what was your diagnosis timeline?,"in reading these threads, i always wonder about the timeline of events leading up to a persons diagnosis. for instance, my mothers journey would look like this: 2014: father gets leukemia, mom has trouble visiting him in the city. later, my nephew is born and she seems somewhat apathetic. hes born in the city as well, and she gets lost trying to visit. we chalk it up to her being a nervous driver. she is 64.  2015: gets lost going to mcdonalds in the dark... a drive shes made dozens of times before in an area shes lived in for 30 years. we chalk it up to cataracts, which she has removed later in early 2016. 2016: my aunt is placed in assisted living with advanced alzheimers in august. i knew she wasnt quite right, but i had no clue it had gotten so bad because mom had never indicated as much. driving back from the hospital alone, mom ends up on the wrong side of the road and enters an army base. shes pulled over by a half dozen cops. at this point im in denial, but i urge her to get a mental health exam. she gets a referral from the doctor, but between my aunt and life, nothing ever comes of it. 2017: mom continues to slip. shes still independent but she no longer understands how to gas up a car, she refuses to cook, and shes been escorted home several times in the dark from church. i tell her she cant go out at night anymore. in october, she cant remember when her next drs appointment is, so instead of calling, she drives there and ends up lost. the dr drops her off, leaving me to find her car, which she cant remember where she left. 2018: i start receiving late notices in the beginning of the year. shes writing the checks but the written amounts dont match the numerical amounts. when leaving to go to target shes gone for hours at a time. target is 2 minutes away. when questioned about why shes been gone so long, she gets defensive. i have a panic attack every time she leaves. i ask her to let me know where shes going but she rarely does. i force her to go to the drs for another referral, where the dr clearly states that she has dementia. im stunned that he didnt think it was important to tell her family that. in april we have our first neurologist appointment. in june, shes officially diagnosed with alzheimers at the age of 67. in july, my brother and i make the decision that its no longer safe for her to drive. in late august, she gets angry with me for not sharing a personal pizza with her. this aggression happens a couple times a month.  in december, my aunt passes at 73. mom wont let me help her pick out an outfit; she decides on the same black jeans she always wears and a sweatshirt. from this point on, her aggression and paranoia have a marked increase. in january 2019, her sense of taste change, and she starts throwing out food i make her unless its sweet or bland. over the next several months, her behavior worsens, including tantrums and physical aggression. her hygiene begins to suffer, and she aggressively cuts her own hair, leaving both sides patchy but the top long. she refuses to let me take her to get a cut. in may, my brother and i place her in an assisted living community. she still speaks poorly of me, despite not having seen me since june. she turned 69 in december. thats about it for me. what does your timeline look like?",characteristics
how to get a diagnosis?,"so, my grandmother is possibly showing signs of alzheimers/dementia.  for quite a while, probably a year at least, she has made small comments about people doing things around her home. about 6 months ago, she got into an argument with my mother, saying that people were coming and going from her home, and said that my stepdad was doing weird things in her home and that she didn't want him there any more (he is never there and is not doing any of the things she is saying).  about a month ago, that happened again, where she was gone for awhile and when my mom brought her home, she thought someone had been there. my mother has told me about this things, but i had never seen it firsthand.  last week, grandma had a surgery, so yesterday i stayed with her for the day.  everything was fine all day, she seemed to be herself.  at some point in the evening, all of the sudden she was at her front door, then basically running from window to window looking outside.  when she finally sat back down, she got upset and told me that her outside light had blinked and everyone thinks she's crazy, but she's not crazy, and someone is messing with her electrical systems and she doesn't know who it is but is she could catch them she'd kill them.  earlier in the day, she had been telling me how mush she loves her house and will never move. long story short, she is widowed and lives alone and we don't have a clue how to go about getting her help.  she obviously doesn't think she needs it, and i'm at a loss.  my mother is the one who is with her the most and is dealing with it the most.  my uncle, who lives in another state, thinks we just have to wait for something to actually happen that will force her to get help.   i'm going to look into support groups, and maybe even counseling for myself.  how did all of you go about getting the diagnosis?",characteristics

"handling a big move -- venting, worrying","my mother, 82, was recently diagnosed with alzheimer's, though has been showing increasing memory problems for several years and has been on a steeper downhill slide the last four months. she's currently living in the  'independent living ' area in an excellent retirement community where the residents and staff know her and care about her. later this week we are moving her to a new facility where she will be in assisted living, with memory care available when she needs it. i'm her son, 64, and i am her agent under her power of attorney, which was authorized by the written opinion of her doctor. my mom has a very controlling personality. for the most part, she has used her powers for good, planning carefully for her future. she has long term care insurance and enough money in her investments to last her for many, many years. but now, of course, she's resisting my taking control of her finances (she has forgotten many times to pay bills, her rent, etc) and is absolutely against moving. her current facility has been doing what they can within their legal power (we are in washington, where there are strict laws governing what the differences are between independent and assisted living) to keep her safe while we find new housing, but there is really no choice now that we have a new home for her. she has to move.  we've talked about it many times over the past few weeks. as expected, every conversation about her moving is the same conversation, because she can't remember what we've talked about in the past. she continually surprised by the fact that she can't stay where she is (they can't provide the level of care she needs). she asks over and over about the new rent, and where the money is coming from, why she has to move when she's happy where she is.  her arguments and questions are always the same. it's almost like a script, and have no idea how to get ahead of it, if i even can. i tell her over and over -- sometimes several times in the same conversation -- where the money is coming from, that it's hers, and it's being used exclusively for her (though, to be honest, i've been a co-signer on her bank accounts for over a decade, long before dementia was an issue for her...so i could legally use it for anything i want, but morally...no, it's hers). as much as i am able i keep my patience, answer her questions and explain the circumstances as if it's the first time i'm hearing her questions and giving her the answers. i dread the next week, as we pack and move, and the weeks after as she gets used to her new home (or doesn't, as the case may be). i love my mom, and i hate having to defy her. i'm afraid of her taking a walk in the next few days and getting lost, as she has a couple times lately (not seriously lost...not yet). since she's in independent living at the moment, the staff can't legally stop her from leaving. but i'm afraid she'll get it into her head to walk away as a deliberate act against the control i've had to take over her life. or she could write me a letter revoking the power of attorney, which is one of the provisions of the poa. i doubt she'll remember she can do that (though i've reminded her of it a couple of times), or won't be able to think through the decision and the act to do it. and if somehow she does, with the new lease having been signed and move-out notices given, i have no idea what i would need to do next.  i know this is probably an old story. everyone's alzheimer's journey is different, they tell me, but the broad strokes are much the same. and i know in my head what i'm doing is right for her. but she also makes me doubt it. i'm a pretty empathetic person, but i have a hard time empathizing with her, seeing things through her eyes, because her memory problems are foreign to me, especially since she's been so logical and thought so correctly for my whole life. i wish i could feel i'm doing things right. i know i'm doing the best i can. no one among her friends or family is opposing my decisions except my mom, but i'm also the only one making decisions. so i had to vent.",psychosocial

palliative care,"mom fell out of bed sunday and was admitted to the hospital.  hospitalist says he thinks palliative care would be a good option at this point and he doesn't think she will last another year.  i have my meeting with hospice in 45 minutes.  i'm nervous they will say she has not declined enough for them to step in.  there is no quality of life left, there is no dignity in dying, she is deteriorating quickly but is still ambulatory, able to use the bathroom on her own and eats well.  hoping for deterioration and palliative care so she is at peace is a weird thing to wish for.  i don't feel comfortable with the feelings i have because to me it goes against everything society tells you you should feel when a loved one is dying, alzheimer's is a different monster though, my mom expressed her wished to commit suicide if she ever got an alz diagnosis, but was too far into the disease when she did get the diagnosis.  i think about her wishes not to live like that every time i see her.  the pain of knowing that and seeing her live like this is awful, i feel guilty about it for some reason. not really any point to this post other than to get it out of my head i guess.  i hope the meeting with hospice goes as well as it can go.",legal

update to mil hair care,"hello! i was asked about whether we'd had any news about mil's hair, so figured i'd write a post. here is the story : https://www.reddit.com/r/alzheimers/comments/dsyokq/tips_for_taking_care_of_matted_hair_im_at_my_wits/ &#x200b; i think that will be our next move if this knot still won't move. i'm not really looking forward to it because i know it's going to make her very angry at the moment, but it may help with the knots moving forward. i think the sooner the better because if we keep having to comb her hair, she's going to get violent. i try to pick my battles, but i am worried about her skin integrity there and also about well-meaning strangers calling dhs because she looks severely neglected. it's been tough because she's in a stage i've been calling the  'negative nellies '. nothing is going right and there is an opposite response to everything we say. i never start the conversation about the hair, i've been waiting for her to come to us, which she'll do multiple times to complain about her hair. so i offer to comb it and style it, and then she'll get super angry that we're even touching it. she's still very capable of independent adls, except for combing her own hair and that's less about her dexterity and more about not being in the mood for it. i was talking about it with a friend who mentioned that one of those trendy  'undercuts ' may work because we could cut the knot out close to her skull, and then the rest of her hair would cover the patch and she may not notice. i think that will be our next move if this knot still won't move. i'm not really looking forward to it because i know it's going to make her very angry in the moment, but it may help with the knots moving forward. i think the sooner the better because if we keep having to comb her hair, she's going to get violent. i try to pick my battles, but i am worried about her skin integrity there and also about well-meaning strangers calling dhs because she looks severely neglected.",resource
i flunked the alzheimer's test,"alzheimer's doesn't run in my family, it gallops. i only missed passing by 3 questions, but, yeah, didn't pass. my kids and hubby were not surprised. i was. i know what the test looks like. i watched my mom take it a few times. i tried really hard but things that made sense in my head didn't translate to paper. anyway, let the journey begin, or should i say, continue.",psychosocial
lonely,"my (33f) dad (59m) is in the early stages of alzheimers. my mom is not working so she is with him almost all the time.  i regularly visit my parents on the weekend, sometimes for friday night and sometimes both nights. if my mom isnt there (she sometimes has commitments out of town) i usually dont go.  its gotten to the point where he is not a danger to himself or others, but he will forget to feed the dogs, forget to give one dog her medicine.  my mom asked if i would stay friday night with him to help remind him of things and give him some company. i went over there with my dogs friday night, we went to dinner and had a nice time, i stayed overnight and left around 3p today. i told him i would call him tonight and tomorrow morning to remind him to feed the dogs and to give them their medicine.  when i left he hugged me really tight and said he was lonely.  i feel like an awful daughter but i need some time to myself over the weekend. i guess i just need some confirmation that im not a terrible daughter for leaving today.  my mom will be back tomorrow.",psychosocial
terrified of getting dementia,"hi all,  i'm 42 years old with a wife and two kids, smart and college educated, but terrified of getting alzheimer's.  my parents are 70 and don't have any signs, and i don't actually know anyone close to me who has had it, but it's literally the worst thing that could happen to me.  last year after i turned 41, i was talking with my wife and she was incensed that i didn't remember even talking about some topic she said we had talked about a few months prior.  and then i started thinking about how i sometimes miss our exit when we're driving together because i'm not paying attention.  and how i'm always misplacing things.  and i had just gotten a fitbit and it showed that i only get like 38 minutes of deep sleep a night.  and back when our first child was born 10 years earlier, we did the attachment parenting thing and during the week my wife asked me to get up when our daughter cried, which then progressed to me basically rocking her all night long and me getting practically zero sleep for about 7 months, and i'm worried i did permanent damage to my brain... anyway i made an appointment with a doctor for early onset dementia even though i know i sounded crazy.  she gave me a ridiculously simple test which was obviously not designed for early cases, and had an mri run--of course they found my brain was perfectly healthy.  i do everything else i can think of to keep my brain healthy--exercise, my diet is great, fish oil, coq10 etc. except nothing i've tried has improved my deep sleep... so i've had adhd all my life, i was diagnosed as an adult, i probably have some anxiety, and i know that i've always misplaced things or my mind has wandered during conversations... so the rational part of me knows this, but then i'm just always looking for signs that i'm getting worse.  it's like i'm a hypochondriac for alzheimer's.  the other day i was at the gym and a song came on, and i was upset that i couldn't remember who it was by.  it was on the tip of my tongue.  i've heard it many times, and the group is one of my wife's favorites.   i was thinking about it the rest of my workout and on the drive home, and then later that night i finally remembered it--florence and the machine.  but this tip of my tongue episode really bothered me... maybe this is a midlife crisis, but do people grow out of them and get used to the fact that you're getting older? i've also decided that i'm not going to go out with a disease like this.  that means that if i'm ever diagnosed with dementia that i'll probably have a small window of opportunity to take action before i'll be too confused to do anything about it.  and i hate contemplating things like this--like should i go buy a gun now and take lessons just so i have it when the time comes...   but i'm just wondering are there others here who are freaked out about getting this too?  maybe people who know it runs in your family?  how do you deal with that?  the thing is, i may be a hypochondriac now, but the risk keeps going up the older i get.  if i make it to 85, there's a 50% chance that i'd be right....",psychosocial
facing the possibility of my dad having alzheimers,"just spoke to my dad (66) on the phone. he had forgotten that we actually talked recently, just about 2 weeks ago if that, which wasnt encouraging. he said he has a cat scan on monday and will know more at that point, but its possible hes in the early stages of alzheimers. this isnt all that surprising to me, we dont talk very frequently but ive definitely had to explain a few things to him multiple times - things that are pretty major, like the fact that im still in college. im 26 and i live on the other side of the country. he has a long-term girlfriend and they live together but arent married. i worry about the implications of a long and difficult illness on the horizon. i dont have the resources to care for a parent - i have a ton of debt and, unfortunately, decided to pursue a degree that doesnt leave you with a lot of stable employment options upon graduation. im planning on going to graduate school in a couple of years, after which id be able to teach, but thats so far out that who knows what his situation will look like by then.  i guess im just feeling guilty and uncertain. i have so much of my own life to figure out still. my dad and i have had a rocky relationship at times over the years - he and my mom divorced when i was 9. frankly, sometimes he can be an insufferable jerk, but at the same time i still value his support and input when i get it because, well, hes my dad. i feel like i owe him something, in a way, even if its just trying to maintain a healthier relationship while we still can because thats really all i have to give. please excuse me, there wasnt really a major point to all this. im just wondering if anybody has some advice to share. my parents were 36 and 40 when they had me, and i dont really feel prepared to approach this situation at this point in my life.",psychosocial
activities for someone with early alzheimer's,"late last year my boyfriend's mother was diagnosed with dementia. early onset alzheimer's runs in her family. she is still relatively with it, as she recognizes most people and can talk about her day. last week she had a stroke. her memory took a hit. she's having trouble recalling certain words and her delusions are worse. she still recognizes us, but it frustrates her when she doesn't remember details or who else visited her that day. she's still convinced she'll get better one day. she's retired, but her husband is not, so she spends most days alone with a few people coming to check on her or give her medications. boyfriend and i visit every other day to make sure she takes her pills and eats. she ideally needs 24/7 care, but it's not financially possible right now. she told us that during the day, she has nothing to think about. she spends most of her time watching tv, and she's starting to have trouble remembering how to make it play what she wants. she used to be interested in arts and crafts, but it was always socially. i don't know if her fine motor skills are intact. i'm worried if she doesn't have anything to do she won't improve at all or she'll decline faster. i plan to cook with her next time we see her. she lit up when i suggested it and went to find some recipes. otherwise i'm not sure what we could do. i really want something that encourages her mind to work. tdlr: if anyone has advice on activities we can give a woman with early onset alzheimer's, to do alone or with us, it would be greatly appreciated. or any advice at all on how to support my boyfriend and his family through this difficult time, resources, ect. thanks in advance.",daily care
driving liability and dmv drivers test,"hello all,  my father was asked by his neurologist to not drive any more this past august. he disagrees with this and feels his driving is fine. im on the fence. he scares me a bit, but ive definitely been with worse drivers.  the language in my dads after visit report says, please do not drive. if youd like a formal drivers test, the dmv is free. i have two questions: - i have heard that because he has this diagnosis and recommendation in his medical record, if he got in an accident, they could be sued and lose everything. is this true? it would be a good argument for him to stop driving.   how do i get a dmv test scheduled? ive called, searched their website, stopped in. no one has any idea what im talking about. i want to schedule him for a drivers test to make sure hes safe. they tell me he isnt due for a test for a few years.

tips for taking care of matted hair? i'm at my wits end!,"my mil went to visit a relative for a few weeks so that partner and i could get respite. unfortunately, her hair never got combed or brushed and is now matted. it's waist length and there are knots all the way up and at the base of her skull. i'm worried that this may be bad for her health, i don't want her getting a fungus under there. we tried soaking it with coconut oil last night and combing it, but we couldn't get all of the knots out and she refuses to help. she got quite agitated, threatened to hit us, and was yelling about it. i can't think of anything else but to cut the knots out, but i think this may mean using clippers on the back of her head. her hair has been her pride and joy for her entire life and i don't want to take this from her, but i don't know what else to do, i think it will only get worse from here.  any tips, either on getting tangles out or how to go about cutting it? she's adamant that she won't have her hair cut.",daily care

sibling relationships and a parent's cognitive decline.,"one of the hardest aspects of caregiving that i've experienced, has been feeling pretty invisible. my father began to show mild signs of slipping cognitively several years ago which gave me a sense of panic about what was to come. friends, co-workers, and distant relatives didn't understand it and would dispense platitudes such as  'you're lucky you still have him, ' or  'appreciate him for who he is. ' i do not have children and while i'm at an age where i should be concerned with being a father and experiencing the known stress of parents my age, i was consumed with getting all of my father's affairs in order, and eventually pursuing a higher level of care for him. we have established rituals for losing a loved one, but i have found that there's no playbook for how to cope with the sense of loss around experiencing a loved one's cognitive decline. as a counseling professional and researcher, i am committed to advocating for caregivers and facilitating dialogue in families around coping with the sense of loss around the cognitive decline of a loved one. perhaps the most meaningful experience i had as a clinician and in my own journey as a caregiver had been a support group i ran for adult caregivers of parents with alzheimer's. i was privileged to hear about how this condition has a profound effect on family dynamics; namely how it creates rifts in a family, but also brings siblings closer. but was was most poignant and empowering for me to hear was the profound sense of purpose in life that some caregivers began to experience when taking on this role. these experiences led me to pursue a phd in marriage and family therapy at the university of louisiana monroe, where i am writing my dissertation on sibling relationships in the context of dementia care. i recently got approval to begin my study, and am looking for participants to interview around their relationships with siblings and experiences as caregivers. if you are interested in participating, i'd love to hear about your experiences. my expectation is that my study will create an effective framework for clinicians do discuss the emotional aspects of caregiving in a family therapy setting. please feel free to comment here if you're interested in participating, and i'll provide more information. i understand and respect the sensitive nature of what is discussed in this forum, and got permission from one of the admins before posting this.",resource

grandma and the rise of technology.,"basically, my 84 year old grandmother is wearing my mother down. we live in the same house, which is split. my grandma has a basic apartment to herself as she is still able to manage herself to a degree. her memory for things has greatly declined, and yesterday she pretty much forgot who her eldest daughter was when my mother (second of 4 siblings) reminded my grandma.  regarding my post. she insists that she continues to have a phone. demands a cell phone or a landline. we have gone through quite a few of each. a flip phone with basic tech to big buttoned land lines. she cannot grasp how technology works anymore. she comes out and gets angry, throws fits saying how she wants a land line  'you have a land line grandma ', how she doesn't understand after we explain it both verbally and in written form. we write extremely legible and simple instructions, that she never follows. after these confrontations my mom is in tears of frustration and sadness. there's more to my grandma's fading world, but right now my focus is on tech. could anyone who has experienced similar suggest anything with a voice command option? has alexa or an echo worked, something that requires no pushing of buttons as she has a light touch and claims to press buttons but ends up turning the phone off in the end. any help would be greatly appreciated.",daily care

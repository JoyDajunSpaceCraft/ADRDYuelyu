"hey all. to make a long story short, after a string of traumatic events (a car wreck involving head-trauma, great grandmother's death, and my aunt's death) my nana has been showing signs of alzheimer's. my great grand-mother was also affected by alzheimer's; however, she was older than my nana is now. my nana has been divorced and my papaw is remarried to my mamaw (all these familial terms, lol). she has never hated my mamaw, maybe not liked, but never hated, though she now is certain that my mamaw and papaw got married immediately after my nana and papaw got a divorce and it burns her up. she genuinely believes it with her whole heart. to make matters worse, my nana was the one cheating on my papaw! so there's that. i would argue that my nana is still in touch with our reality to whatever extent, but our timelines and belief of how events played out is so different. how the hell do you deal with something like this? do you play into it, knowing it's not the truth? just ignore it? arguing only upsets her.",when the timeline becomes jumbled.,"traumatic events (a car wreck involving head-trauma, great grandmother's death, and my aunt's death) my nana has been showing signs of alzheimer's.","to make a long story short, after a string of traumatic events (a car wreck involving head-trauma, great grandmother's death, and my aunt's death) my nana has been showing signs of alzheimer's. my great grand-mother was also affected by alzheimer's; however, she was older than my nana is now.",n/a
"been with my wife since i was 19 and had an overall happy marriage until this dreadful thing hit.  recently (last 6 months) i've become really friendly with another woman and we enjoy each other's company and are both keen to progress our  'friendship ' within the constraints of my domestic situation. i trust her implicitly.  i fully intend to be there for my wife but for the first time in a couple of years i feel genuinely alive again. i've told my adult children about it and although they don't want details, they are fine with it and want me to find a little happiness along the way, but whilst being discrete and respectful. i'm not after permissions and validation from anyone just wanted to gather peoples thoughts on the matter, as my loneliness was starting to hurt. thanks for reading. reggie",wife of 34 years - at late stage 5 of alzheimer's - is it wrong to have a girlfriend?,recently (last 6 months),been with my wife since i was 19 and had an overall happy marriage until this dreadful thing hit.  recently (last 6 months) i've become really friendly with another woman and we enjoy each other's company and are both keen to progress our  'friendship ' within the constraints of my domestic situation. i trust her implicitly.  i fully intend to be there for my wife but for the first time in a couple of years i feel genuinely alive again.,n/a

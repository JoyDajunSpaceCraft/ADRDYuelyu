"late last year my boyfriend's mother was diagnosed with dementia. early onset alzheimer's runs in her family. she is still relatively with it, as she recognizes most people and can talk about her day. last week she had a stroke. her memory took a hit. she's having trouble recalling certain words and her delusions are worse. she still recognizes us, but it frustrates her when she doesn't remember details or who else visited her that day. she's still convinced she'll get better one day. she's retired, but her husband is not, so she spends most days alone with a few people coming to check on her or give her medications. boyfriend and i visit every other day to make sure she takes her pills and eats. she ideally needs 24/7 care, but it's not financially possible right now. she told us that during the day, she has nothing to think about. she spends most of her time watching tv, and she's starting to have trouble remembering how to make it play what she wants. she used to be interested in arts and crafts, but it was always socially. i don't know if her fine motor skills are intact. i'm worried if she doesn't have anything to do she won't improve at all or she'll decline faster. i plan to cook with her next time we see her. she lit up when i suggested it and went to find some recipes. otherwise i'm not sure what we could do. i really want something that encourages her mind to work. tdlr: if anyone has advice on activities we can give a woman with early onset alzheimer's, to do alone or with us, it would be greatly appreciated. or any advice at all on how to support my boyfriend and his family through this difficult time, resources, ect. thanks in advance.",activities for someone with early alzheimer's family.,"she is still relatively with it, as she recognizes most people and can talk about her day.",last week she had a stroke. her memory took a hit. she's having trouble recalling certain words and her delusions are worse. she lit up when i suggested it and went to find some recipes.

"5 years ago my grandmother was diagnosed with dementia, and roughly 2 years ago, alzheimer's was tacked on. it's been quite the journey to get to where we are now with her. there's been multiple home moves, many doctors/specialists appointments, and a lot of family meetings with my mum and her siblings. my mum is currently off work, and has spent the most time making sure my grandma is well taken care of. none of her 3 siblings make the effort as, and i quote,  'what do you want me to do about it?? i have my own life to think about ' my mum goes multiple times a week with my grandpa, and knows how to effectively redirect my grandma when she's on a  'thr nurses are hitting me/my husband's sleeping with other women/he's beating me too ' line of thought. these nurses are an absolute god send, and my grandpa has never laid a hand on her, nor would he ever. they don't even live together, as my grandma is in a wonderful ltc facility and grandpa is on the wait list to get in the same place.  anyways, my issue is this.. my aunts and uncles all want to take my grandma out of the home for a big family get together (where grandma will recognize maybe 4 people) and i believe this to be a horrid idea. not only because of how big (and confusing) our family is, but how badly she will lose her marbles when they have to take her back in. she has fought nurses screaming  'help me [my mum]!!

i lost my dad do alzheimers in 2018. he was pretty young as he was in his mid 50s and was diagnosed around 5-6 years ago. i honestly have trouble remembering the times when he wasnt sick and we could go on family vacations and stuff as they feel so distant. on nights like these i really miss him being shuffling around and eating random snacks or just messing around the house. i miss when he would wake me up because he couldnt figure out how to change the chanel and get help. i miss him making me late for work because he wouldnt let me leave because he wanted to be with me. i just miss having him around even if it wasnt him 100%. it just sucks because when youre taking care of them you just want things to be normal but then when they pass you realize that normal now is never seeing them again :(. i love you dad miss you every day,anyone just want to help out again?, messing around the house. i miss when he would wake me up because he couldnt figure out how to change the, i miss when he would wake me up because he couldnt figure out how to change the chanel and get help.
"my grandma is 78 and in the 5th stage - she is conversational but mostly confused and if she's not at home she doesn't know where she is. she has a history of depression and mood swings and currently takes seroquel and aricept. lately she has been very unpredictable and upsets very easily, often walking out on her own out of anger (my grandfather follows her). she constantly threatens to take off and find a job for herself, spending hours yelling about it. my grandfather is her sole caretaker right now, all other family are too far and/or work full time and cannot be there daily. it is very difficult for him (he is 85) and he is finding it exhausting. when she is at home she constantly wants to go out, even right after coming home, and when she is out she wants to go home. it is very sad for my grandpa as he says he can still take care of her and she can still shower/go to the bathroom by herself, but i know it is becoming unbearable especially with her typical mood swings + sundowning. she needs to be watched around the clock and he doesn't have the energy for that, now that he's taken on all the chores and cooking and cleaning. right now, i think an in-home caretaker would make sense but i want to hear your opinions. was there a breaking point when you decided you needed to hire a caretaker or decided to move them to a care home? i am most concerned about the wandering at the moment, and giving my grandpa some respite from the daily housework.",at what point should you hire a caretaker/move them to memory care?," and mood swings and currently takes seroquel and aricept. lately she has been very unpredictable and upsets very easily, often walking out on her own out of anger (my grandfather follows her). she constantly threatens to take off and find a job for herself,","it is very sad for my grandpa as he says he can still take care of her and she can still shower/go to the bathroom by herself, but i know it is becoming unbearable especially with her typical mood swings + sundowning."

"hi all, i want to preface by saying i realize there is a faq and that a lot of the problems i might depict in this post are common, but i want to tell a little of my family's story in hopes to get feedback and connect with anyone who has dealt with a similar situation. my father developed dementia and later alzheimers about 5 years ago after i took him to the hospital to be detoxed from alcohol. his alcoholism had gotten so out of hand it was my last resort to try and save him. this unfortunately set off a chain of events that lead to his dementia and alzheimers. he was about 64 years old when this happened and recently retired (forced to due to the alcoholism).  my mother is 11 years his junior and is his primary care taker. i live a few hours away, my only other sibling is my brother who lives in the same city as them with his wife and children. my mother has alcoholic tendencies as well and uses it as a crutch to de stress, along with smoking cigarettes. she has anxiety and depression, and sees a therapist (irregularly) to try and alleviate. she takes an anti depressant and i believe that is all.  i am extremely concerned about my mothers well being. she is under a great amount of stress dealing with my father, who is fairly far along in his alzheimers progression. we are surprised when he forms a complete sentence or thought, wears diapers that he uses, and my mother helps him bathe. unfortunately, he stays at home alone for the 5 hours in the morning / afternoon that my mother is at work. he is able to feed himself with whats in the kitchen and watches tv/naps while she is away. she has a camera installed on her phone that she uses to watch him while shes at work because its difficult getting him to answer the phone. as you all are aware, in care home or elderly care homes are all very expensive. we are not wealthy, but firmly lower middle class. i don't make a lot of money, my brother and his wife make decent money but have a child and one on the way. they live near by and help when needed but we are all a bit at a loss of what to do and how to help my mom. she is so stressed out constantly, understandbly so since she has to work part time and take care of my father when shes home, rarely getting time for herself.  at the moment, we don't really have the funds to put my father in a care facility or anything like that. we may be able to afford it by some way of a small inheritance me and my brother will receive from my father's mother who recently passed, though i fear it is not quite enough to sustain him for the long term there. essentially, my mother is forced to watch my father deteriorate slowly as she sacrifices her life and happiness for him. i have guilt about living far away from them but i had been living in the same city as them for several years and felt stuck and depressed. i moved away for myself and to start my own life (i am 28), as i feel my father and mother wouldn't have wanted me to sacrifice my life to take care of them, though i do second guess this decision all the time and wish i could do more for them.  me and my family have reached a plateau the past couple of years where my mother takes care of him, but i feel she is close to a breaking point mentally. she is so anxious, stressed, depressed, talks about how she is lonely, isolated, wants to date, etc. she is committed to caring for my father however and is steadfast in that. she gets frustrated and isn't perfect but she believes it is her duty to help him. partly i just wanted to tell our story, but i also would accept any advice in way of programs or financial aid or anything that could help me and our family out. my father gets worse everyday, it would break my heart to put him somewhere but i do feel sometimes that it would help my mom immensely to be relieved from that duty and stress.  thank you for reading, and god speed to anybody out there dealing with this condition. it is the darkest part of my life, has changed who i am as a person, and in some ways helps me appreciate life for what it is - a temporary experience. love and peace to you all.",father's alzheimers weighing down on my mother and family gets frustrated and isn't perfect but she believes it is her duty to help him.,"partly i just wanted to tell our story, but i also would accept any advice in way of programs or financial aid or anything that could help me and our family out."," me and my family have reached a plateau the past couple of years where my mother takes care of him, but i feel she is close to a breaking point mentally. she is so anxious, stressed, depressed, talks about how she is lonely, isolated, wants to date, etc. she is committed to caring for my father however and is steadfast in that. she gets frustrated and isn't perfect but she believes it is her duty to help him.

"i moved away from my family for college and ended staying thousands of miles away to start my career. my family called to inform me that my 83 year old grandmother who i'm very close with had a sudden change in her mental state. she's has been getting slightly forgetful in the last few years, but she's recently called the police 4+ times claiming there was a break in and things were stolen. all the items were found in odd places in her house, so now she's convinced someone broke in and moved them. i dropped everything and flew to her to make sure she was safe and assess the situation.  she's normal most of the time, but gets bouts of paranoia and delusions. i took her to her primary to check for a possible uti and to address her oxybutinyn perscriptions (side effects can be hallucinations and delusions). doctor wrote off my concerns about the meds, claiming he also takes them and they are fine. i had to fight to get the urine testing for a possible uti, which was supposedly negative. he excused himself quickly to see other patients. i discreetly spoke to the ma's (i hate to belittle my sweet grandmother) about her delusions, they seemed concerned and wrote down my concerns and said the doctor would call me later. he indeed called and told me that those were reasons to be concerned, but followed up with  'i understand your concern, but not sure how i'm supposed to fit in here? ' im not a doctor! i assumed these were things her doctor should be aware of and perhaps would like to monitor or even refer me to a neurologist. he offered no advice other than  'put her in a home '.  please tell me there are more constructive, helpful doctor's out there! i have no idea if she has dementia, alzheimer's, or some other issue causing this. i have put my day to day life on hold to help my grandma (which i am very happy to do if she needs me) but i can't come to a solution if i don't even know what exactly or roughly what i'm dealing with.  this is the hardest thing i have ever dealt with. i cry every time i talk about her symptoms to anyone, it breaks my heart to know my grandma is scared and confused.  any advice is greatly appreciated.","finding a doctor for my grandma put my day to day life on hold to help my grandma.,(which i am very happy to do if she needs me) but i can't come to a solution if i don't even know what exactly or roughly what i'm dealing with.",""," he offered no advice other than  'put her in a home '.  please tell me there are more constructive, helpful doctor's out there! i have no idea if she has dementia, alzheimer's, or some other issue causing this. i have put my day to day life on hold to help my grandma (which i am very happy to do if she needs me) but i can't come to a solution if i don't even know what exactly or roughly what i'm dealing with.  this is the hardest thing i have ever dealt with."

"hi all! my grandma is starting to lose her memory (and i believe was told that she is developing alzheimers, but i'm not sure). anyway, what do i do? should i correct her? she never says she doesn't remember things, she just says things that are untrue with regards to recent, current events, and often forgets the year. for instance she thought she was 75 and not 86. she thought my brother was turning 17. he was 21. she says she didn't vote when she did. it was the week after the election. she said she hasn't been to the special exhibition at a museum. my mother took her there the week before.  i always just let the moment pass and agree with her, i.e. 'yes, it's a very interesting exhibition, you should go, i know you like that sort of stuff.'  my mum on the other hand is like: ' remember we went last week? we went together and you said xyz.' which approach is correct? she means a lot to me, and it pains me to see this happening to her. this is a terrible disease. the only plus side i see is that it's happening so late in life and that she had 86 good years. :)",gently correct my grandma or allow her to believe what she wishes?," just says things that are untrue with regards to recent, current events, and often forgets","she says she didn't vote when she did. it was the week after the election. she said she hasn't been to the special exhibition at a museum. my mother took her there the week before.  i always just let the moment pass and agree with her, i.e. 'yes, it's a very interesting exhibition, you should go, i know you like that sort of stuff.'  my mum on the other hand is like: ' remember we went last week? we went together and you said xyz.' which approach is correct?

"my mother, 82, was recently diagnosed with alzheimer's, though has been showing increasing memory problems for several years and has been on a steeper downhill slide the last four months. she's currently living in the  'independent living ' area in an excellent retirement community where the residents and staff know her and care about her. later this week we are moving her to a new facility where she will be in assisted living, with memory care available when she needs it. i'm her son, 64, and i am her agent under her power of attorney, which was authorized by the written opinion of her doctor. my mom has a very controlling personality. for the most part, she has used her powers for good, planning carefully for her future. she has long term care insurance and enough money in her investments to last her for many, many years. but now, of course, she's resisting my taking control of her finances (she has forgotten many times to pay bills, her rent, etc) and is absolutely against moving. her current facility has been doing what they can within their legal power (we are in washington, where there are strict laws governing what the differences are between independent and assisted living) to keep her safe while we find new housing, but there is really no choice now that we have a new home for her. she has to move.  we've talked about it many times over the past few weeks. as expected, every conversation about her moving is the same conversation, because she can't remember what we've talked about in the past. she continually surprised by the fact that she can't stay where she is (they can't provide the level of care she needs). she asks over and over about the new rent, and where the money is coming from, why she has to move when she's happy where she is.  her arguments and questions are always the same. it's almost like a script, and have no idea how to get ahead of it, if i even can. i tell her over and over -- sometimes several times in the same conversation -- where the money is coming from, that it's hers, and it's being used exclusively for her (though, to be honest, i've been a co-signer on her bank accounts for over a decade, long before dementia was an issue for her...so i could legally use it for anything i want, but morally...no, it's hers). as much as i am able i keep my patience, answer her questions and explain the circumstances as if it's the first time i'm hearing her questions and giving her the answers. i dread the next week, as we pack and move, and the weeks after as she gets used to her new home (or doesn't, as the case may be). i love my mom, and i hate having to defy her. i'm afraid of her taking a walk in the next few days and getting lost, as she has a couple times lately (not seriously lost...not yet). since she's in independent living at the moment, the staff can't legally stop her from leaving. but i'm afraid she'll get it into her head to walk away as a deliberate act against the control i've had to take over her life. or she could write me a letter revoking the power of attorney, which is one of the provisions of the poa. i doubt she'll remember she can do that (though i've reminded her of it a couple of times), or won't be able to think through the decision and the act to do it. and if somehow she does, with the new lease having been signed and move-out notices given, i have no idea what i would need to do next.  i know this is probably an old story. everyone's alzheimer's journey is different, they tell me, but the broad strokes are much the same. and i know in my head what i'm doing is right for her. but she also makes me doubt it. i'm a pretty empathetic person, but i have a hard time empathizing with her, seeing things through her eyes, because her memory problems are foreign to me, especially since she's been so logical and thought so correctly for my whole life. i wish i could feel i'm doing things right. i know i'm doing the best i can. no one among her friends or family is opposing my decisions except my mom, but i'm also the only one making decisions. so i had to vent.","handling a big move -- venting, worrying s",,"her current facility has been doing what they can within their legal power (we are in washington, where there are strict laws governing what the differences are between independent and assisted living) to keep her safe while we find new housing, but there is really no choice now that we have a new home for her. she has to move.

"she had alzheimers for the past 5ish years and the decline has been fast and heartbreaking to watch. she lost so much weight. there was a time where she would scream in agony all day. she couldnt do anything for herself and towards the end she even forgot how to eat, drink water, walk. even though it has been five years, it feels like it all happened so fast. i remember one day she was telling my dad how she had been driving her car and somehow ended up in the middle of nowhere. and at the time, no one thought anything of it really. but after that, things subtly and gradually got worse. she would forget how to use a tv remote, forget where things were. and eventually she got diagnosed and i still didnt really take it seriously. all old people forget stuff. but it just got worse and worse. she started to forget who my grandad was and would be aggressive towards him, she started having seizures... its like my grandma was 3 different people. theres the grandma i grew up with who was an intelligent, streetwise, quick witted lady who was the centre of our family, the glue that held us all together. then there is her as the alzheimers was in the early stage, the goofy, adorable, silly grandma who always thought our front step was a huge drop when it was actually tiny and giggled at silly nursery rhymes. then there was her at the late stage, an unrecognisable shell. she spent the last year of her life sat in a chair, a far off glassy look in her eye, being completely reliant on other people. i had started university by then and so i wasnt around much. but if im being honest, i didnt visit her enough. my grandad and my aunt and my cousins all had a role in taking care of her and when i was there, i felt like a spare part, useless. i was only close to my grandma, i wasnt close to any of them and im a quiet person by nature, so i wouldnt ever really have much to say. when i was there i felt so out of place...its so odd to feel that way when surrounded by family. as if the situation wasnt depressing enough. not to mention it simply caused me so much pain to watch her suffer the way she did, to see her dignity taken away as people helped her use the bathroom, to see her slipping away. sometimes she would sit and just sob in agony. and that broke me completely.  i think i mourned her death long before it happened. shed been gone a long time, her physical body just had to catch up. im angry that this disease exists and there are so many scumbags who will continue to roam the earth in perfect health while my beautiful grandma wont. i am trying to hold onto the precious memories i have with her before this disease got her. i never want to forget the songs she would sing to me, the sound of her laugh, the way she would always tell me my eyes are bigger than my belly when i couldnt finish my dinner, her beautiful smile, the way she smelt when she would hug me, the way she could fix anything, the stories she told me, the way she would always say goodnight, god bless and remember those three little words: i love you as she tucked me into bed.  no one will ever be able to fathom how much i loved her and how much i still do. i would give anything to hug my grandma one last time. i hope that one day i will get to do just that. goodnight god bless grandma, remember those three little words: i love you.","my grandma just passed away felt like a spare part, useless.","i was only close to my grandma, i wasnt close to  any of them and im a quiet person by nature, so i wouldnt ever really have much to say.","my grandad and my aunt and my cousins all had a role in taking care of her and when i was there, i felt like a spare part, useless. i was only close to my grandma, i wasnt close to any of them and im a quiet person by nature, so i wouldnt ever really have much to say.

"one of the hardest aspects of caregiving that i've experienced, has been feeling pretty invisible. my father began to show mild signs of slipping cognitively several years ago which gave me a sense of panic about what was to come. friends, co-workers, and distant relatives didn't understand it and would dispense platitudes such as  'you're lucky you still have him, ' or  'appreciate him for who he is.

"ughhhh, i'm just very angry about the whole thing. i've been fighting with my bf for a while now about getting his mother onto a waitlist for a nursing home knowing that it'll be about 2 years before she gets placed. he has refused to and is now saying she doesn't have the low-income insurance that she needs to get onto the waitlist. i'm frustrated because he isn't doing anything to get his mom the proper care that she needs and it's going to get way worse before it gets better. we live in a 2 bedroom apartment and the bedrooms and the bathroom is on the second floor. she's gained a lot of weight in the last year and is having trouble getting off the couch and the stairs are making her tired. i don't think she has much time left before she is unable to navigate them. she is also complaining of problems with her bowels constantly, of having diarrhea, which i suspect is her articulating that she is getting close to losing continence. bf is convinced that isn't the case and that it's simply her diet. she is also getting increasingly aggressive. she is irritable and angry with both me and my bf's sister. she yells, swears and threatens violence. she also hurls a lot of racist statements my way (i'm asian). his sister and i are on the same page regarding her care and needs and it's frustrating that bf can't see it that way. his biggest problem is that he doesn't want her to feel afraid and that's why he's resistant to her going anywhere. i understand his fear, but i feel that she is going to be afraid regardless and that it would be better to get her acclimated to a new environment sooner so that she has a chance to recognize her surroundings.  i worked as a nursing assistant to get through school and it's been really frustrating. i've worked in nursing homes and they're not as bad as people make them out to be. yes, they're not home, i get it, but they're not jails.  i've been trying to help him navigate the waters but he's been resistant to any help. when she was first placed on her meds, i mentioned that she should be on an antidepressant because of her behavior and to help her sleep. he eventually decided to take her off of it without telling anybody because he felt that i was too pill-happy and trying to overmedicate her. that led to a solid 2 months of her crying constantly, being angry with everybody and just having a really rough time before he realized that she really needed the meds. i'm worried that she's going to need assistance toileting, and bathing soon and she won't let him help because he's a boy, and she's violent towards me. it's unrealistic to expect his sister to drive over constantly to help because mil is violent towards her as well. i feel like he is setting us up for failure because by the time she really really needs help, we won't be able to get help when we need it. he told me yesterday that he'd rather the two of them move into a studio apartment and he can just deal with her so that she can die in her own bed. i'm really tempted to let him do it, but that would be a catastrophe, he has a very low patience threshold, constantly loses his temper, and isn't able to give any sort of structure to her life.  i'm just feeling like i'm watching a very slow-moving trainwreck and i'm tied to the rails.",super frustrated with this whole process and is now saying she doesn't have the low-income insurance that she needs to get onto the waitlist.,i'm frustrated because he isn't doing anything to get his mom the proper care that she needs and it's going to get way worse before it gets better.," i'm frustrated because he isn't doing anything to get his mom the proper care that she needs and it's going to get way worse before it gets better. we live in a 2 bedroom apartment and the bedrooms and the bathroom is on the second floor. she's gained a lot of weight in the last year and is having trouble getting off the couch and the stairs are making her tired. i don't think she has much time left before she is unable to navigate them. she is also complaining of problems with her bowels constantly, of having diarrhea, which i suspect is her articulating that she is getting close to losing continence.

"i'll just quickly share my experience and advice and then a resource. five years ago my family and i began noticing signs that my mother was having difficulty completing everyday tasks. initially, we looked at these things she was doing as quirky, elderly silliness. at the time, she was picking up my kids from school every day and they would notice that she seemed off and her driving was becoming a little more aggressive, she'd show up to school later and later, she had strange cuts on her hands and face, and one time she forgot they were in the car and went home instead of our house. i decided to change our routine and i began picking up the kids. all good, right? nope. basically, now that the kids weren't seeing her every day, we were no longer getting those all too important progress reports from them. we got busy with our lives, and we only spoke to her on the phone, and other some minor confusion, she seemed fine during those calls. fast forward two weeks and her neighbor is calling us saying she is at their house telling them that there are people staying at her house, so she needs to move in with them. we arrive to find her covered in bruises, unwashed, empty refrigerator, and untouched prescription bottles. those final years of her life were up and down and full of resentment. she seemed angry with me, and frankly, i can't blame her. so, now that my father-in-law has had some minor memory issues and one fall, we have had to have some difficult conversations, but i won't wait this time. i took several online assessments, like this one, as soon as i started to feel like something was off. be proactive, get help from professionals, and take care of yourself!","this time around, i'm being proactive.","off and her driving was becoming a little more aggressive, she'd show up to school later and later, she had strange cuts on her hands and face, and one time she forgot they were in the car and went home instead of our house.","so, now that my father-in-law has had some minor memory issues and one fall, we have had to have some difficult conversations, but i won't wait this time. i took several online assessments, like this one, as soon as i started to feel like something was off. be proactive, get help from professionals, and take care of yourself!"

"hey everybody, it's me again. this was my last post in case anybody is wondering. it was really nice feeling supported from everyone, this sub has really become a source of comfort, advice, and knowledge for me.  i wanted to give a bit of an update. incontinence started earlier than my predictions, with the first recorded instance happening last night. i don't know if it was a full-blown accident, as it seems more like she didn't follow bathroom hygiene for a while and maybe it built up to the point of being visible? i don't know, and it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things.  mil was walking around and had a large spot on the back of her pants that i pointed out to bf. he tried to talk to her about it, but it ended up with her denying and him losing his patience. she eventually took a bath and we swapped out the pants. bf was exhausted and he's been in shock pretty much all night. he doesn't want to believe that this is happening and wants to believe this is a one-off and that she still has another 6+ months before having to worry about continence issues.  bf is poa, and is feeling overwhelmed, saying he didn't realize that poa meant doing so much. i think last night was a huge eye-opener as even he realizes that fighting with his mom every day to change her underwear is a lot. he's been really sad about this latest step, understandably so. i've tried bringing him to the sub, but he says he's not ready for all that, although he appreciates it when i read some of your posts and helpful responses out loud for him. we talked it over for a while, and he messaged his sister and we're having a small family meeting tonight after work. according to him, she hasn't been telling him all the awful details that have been happening when she takes mil out once a week. i'm not sure about this, because sil and i have talked about it multiple times. he says he was doubting both of our stories because he didn't see it, it hasn't happened to him, and that we were alone when it was happening. i pointed out that he's the one in the family that's famous for having a temper and also that he is a man and his mother has been getting increasingly sexist in the last year or so and that may be affecting the way she addresses him. we also talked about our approaches to care. he admitted that he had been feeling like i was being a wicked witch and a bit of a dictator with trying to establish care. he also said i was being mean to his mom. i asked for clarification and explained that i keep my tone neutral and use easy to understand words when i'm asking her to do something because any other tone elicits an outburst from her as she really doesn't like authority, or me for that matter. he did acknowledge that i've never yelled at her, or sworn at her, or anything like that and that he didn't know that was why i was keeping voice low and that maybe he had misinterpreted what i was doing.  bf apologized to me for being mean to me when he's realizing that me being  'cold & clinical ' is simply trying to talk to him about where we are in the process and how to make his mother's quality of life better. he has been a bit frazzled and has never really had a routine, so it's been a constant struggle establishing one. for instance, last night, dinner wasn't even on the table until 11pm! granted, the accident was a huge factor, but we're just all over the place schedule-wise. i sat down with him last night and wrote out a schedule of care that she would be expected to get if she was in a hospital, or a nursing home. i told him i was willing to help as long as we could argue that the quality of her life with us would be higher than she would be getting in a home. i also wrote down a list of symptoms to bring up on their next dr visit in february.  i'm hoping that after tonight's meeting, we can really start in earnest to find placement for mil, or at least some sort of respite.",updates to my last post table until 11pm!,"granted, the accident was a huge factor, but we're just all over the place schedule-wise.","granted, the accident was a huge factor, but we're just all over the place schedule-wise. i sat down with him last night and wrote out a schedule of care that she would be expected to get if she was in a hospital, or a nursing home. i told him i was willing to help as long as we could argue that the quality of her life with us would be higher than she would be getting in a home. i also wrote down a list of symptoms to bring up on their next dr visit in february.

"dad's (90) facility is having a holiday party for the residents and family.  nice thing to do, however, this past weekend he tried to escape twice resulting in the facility placing a ankle monitor on him.  my father's alzheimers has him being very verbally abusive.  my fear is on this visit he will disrupt what should be an enjoyable visit for the other families.  anxiety level already increasing.",visiting dad,,"nice thing to do, however, this past weekend he tried to escape twice resulting in the facility placing a ankle monitor on him.  my father's alzheimers has him being very verbally abusive.  my fear is on this visit he will disrupt what should be an enjoyable visit for the other families.

"hey all. to make a long story short, after a string of traumatic events (a car wreck involving head-trauma, great grandmother's death, and my aunt's death) my nana has been showing signs of alzheimer's. my great grand-mother was also affected by alzheimer's; however, she was older than my nana is now. my nana has been divorced and my papaw is remarried to my mamaw (all these familial terms, lol). she has never hated my mamaw, maybe not liked, but never hated, though she now is certain that my mamaw and papaw got married immediately after my nana and papaw got a divorce and it burns her up. she genuinely believes it with her whole heart. to make matters worse, my nana was the one cheating on my papaw! so there's that. i would argue that my nana is still in touch with our reality to whatever extent, but our timelines and belief of how events played out is so different. how the hell do you deal with something like this? do you play into it, knowing it's not the truth? just ignore it? arguing only upsets her.",when the timeline becomes jumbled.,"traumatic events (a car wreck involving head-trauma, great grandmother's death, and my aunt's death) my nana has been showing signs of alzheimer's.","to make a long story short, after a string of traumatic events (a car wreck involving head-trauma, great grandmother's death, and my aunt's death) my nana has been showing signs of alzheimer's. my great grand-mother was also affected by alzheimer's; however, she was older than my nana is now."
"been with my wife since i was 19 and had an overall happy marriage until this dreadful thing hit.  recently (last 6 months) i've become really friendly with another woman and we enjoy each other's company and are both keen to progress our  'friendship ' within the constraints of my domestic situation. i trust her implicitly.  i fully intend to be there for my wife but for the first time in a couple of years i feel genuinely alive again. i've told my adult children about it and although they don't want details, they are fine with it and want me to find a little happiness along the way, but whilst being discrete and respectful. i'm not after permissions and validation from anyone just wanted to gather peoples thoughts on the matter, as my loneliness was starting to hurt. thanks for reading. reggie",wife of 34 years - at late stage 5 of alzheimer's - is it wrong to have a girlfriend?, recently (last 6 months),"been with my wife since i was 19 and had an overall happy marriage until this dreadful thing hit.  recently (last 6 months) i've become really friendly with another woman and we enjoy each other's company and are both keen to progress our  'friendship ' within the constraints of my domestic situation. i trust her implicitly.  i fully intend to be there for my wife but for the first time in a couple of years i feel genuinely alive again."
"(long post is long cause i really dont know what to do and theres a long history) so, ive been living with my mom my entire life, minus 2 years in college, and im 33 now. shes never been married, my father left when i was an infant, and i have a half sibling, but hes in a different state and we share a dad, not mom, so its only ever just been us. when i was around 20 she had been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, and after that i went back home to do community college to take help her out and to help take care of my grandpa who had been starting to get sick. ff to 2012 and she loses her job cause she was so sick, in and out of the hospital. in 2013 i lost the my job, the only job bringing in money, and right after that my grandpa died.  during the time i didnt have a job, (and before) we were borrowing $ from family, not paying bills, eating out a lot, and turning into hoarders. i would manage to get part time jobs in between, but they wouldnt last long, and lots of other stuff, but i was essentially her caretaker starting around that time. she got social security disability benefits in 2014. at the end of 2016, she had to have a leg amputated before she stepped on a sewing needle that went into her leg and turned the bottom half gangrene.  we lost our house in 2017 while she was recovering, and we moved, and i took over the finances, (which everything gets paid on time now), i kept the new apartment clean (because of a marathon of watching the show hoarders for almost 6 months), and i was her full time caretaker while working 2 jobs. i took care of all her dr appts and pills because she couldnt process the fact she had lost a limb, and then would go on to get an ostomy bag because the colitis was so bad and there was a cancer scare. she let the fear control her life, and then became too dependent on me.  i found us a better apartment, bigger for her wheelchair and have watched her go in and out of the hospital a half dozen, dozen times a year, watched her go to rehabs, been told at least a dozen times by drs they dont know how shes alive with how many health problems she has and how she refuses to take care of herself. ive been told 4 times in my life that if i had waited even one night longer she would have died. one rehab said they thought shed never get out of bed again, and 5 months later shes walking on a prosthetic leg.  only to watch her throw it all away as soon as she gets home because she wants normal back. she doesnt listen to me or take me seriously because she still sees me as her little girl, and were both stubborn as heck. we have more fights than good moments and im physically and emotionally exhausted. i now work from home, but have a part time job, and have a hobby i recently turned into a side hustle thats starting to make money, cause we live in an expensive place, and ive recently been using my health insurance to try and take care of my own mental conditions. she has family but they refuse to help, after so many times that ive asked for help. they tell me i need my own life, but wont offer even advice on how to make it happen.  recently, a friend helped push me to make some realizations that my mom is actually rather manipulative and shes not going to change because she has me waiting on her hand and foot. she honestly cant live by herself, but she refuses to think about even going to an assisted independent living place, and wont even let anyone but me take her to drs appointments, which is affecting my job by needing so much time off.  ive decided we need to live apart. im searching for a place for me, and im going to have to work almost 2 jobs and my side hustle to afford it, but feel it should be worth it. we found her some senior apartments and got her on a waitlist, but need to find a back up place for her while the waitlist goes on, because i cant do this anymore. i cry more often than not now, and we fight all the time because i just cant get her to take care of herself, even when im there doing everything for her. i know shes capable of it, and i hope that by moving it forces her to do it. i told her that id still be over at least a couple times a week to help prep meals and fill pills, but i havent lived on my own, and i need the freedom.  am i doing the right thing? im just..... so exhausted and im starting to resent her, and i dont want to, shes my mom, i love her.",am i doing the right thing?," need to live apart. im searching for a place for me, and im going to have to work almost 2 jobs and my side hustle to afford it, but feel it should be worth it. we found her some","ive decided we need to live apart. im searching for a place for me, and im going to have to work almost 2 jobs and my side hustle to afford it, but feel it should be worth it. we found her some senior apartments and got her on a waitlist, but need to find a back up place for her while the waitlist goes on, because i cant do this anymore.

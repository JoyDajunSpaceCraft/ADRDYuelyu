No hate here bro, just want you to have an actually happy life and I don’t see this as sustainable. Believe it or not going to the gym and working out can be very therapeutic plus there’s pretty girls! After some dedication to those weights they will want to talk to you. Good luck my friend.

AlzheimersGroup,I’m writing a screen play and wanted some feedback on the script so far.,"We open on an orange cat sitting on a purple table in a typical suburban house. Then, the cat says “There’s nothing happening,” which is humorous when you take into consideration the fact cats cannot speak. Then, a man runs in and says “I finally got the wildfire in my sock drawer under control!” which adds another layer of whimsy to the story because it is improbable that his sock drawer would be on fire. Finally, the cat says “Nothing out of the ordinary, I mean,” which is also funny because the cat is implying this is normal for him.","We need a name Name cat. What is carts name

AlzheimersGroup,Advice for Uncle Jon,"I am concerned that my uncle has Alzheimer's but he has no-one in his life to look out for him. 

I visited him the other day and I was shocked to find the fire in his sock drawer was not under control. I asked him what was going on with the fire in his sock drawer and he said it was under control. 

His orange cat (I forget its name) was no help. It considers this kind of behaviour as nothing out of the ordinary. The cat is lazy, fat and sarcastic, but it is the closest thing my uncle has to a friend. 

I have arranged for my uncle to get help from a nurse but he is convinced that she is his deceased wife, my Aunt Liz. I feel like her presence is only making his condition worse. 

I talk to my parents about my concerns but they are quick to shrug it off. They are busy working on the family farm and my father, Doc, just writes off my uncle's behaviour as the behaviour of a ""cappuccino-sipping city slicker"". I can't understand this attitude because it was my father who found a kitten in a sealed box outside my uncle's house, addressed to Abu Dhabi! Nobody even knows who the kitten belongs to. 

Does anyone have any advice?","Thank you ted. Very good job grandson.

AlzheimersGroup,How to convince a reluctant parent that they might have Alzheimer's and need to see a doctor,,"It actually makes me really sad when someone posts in here for real advice/info 😭
Obligatory Garfield shitposting subreddit disclaimer

On the real though, I have had two grandparents go the way of Alzheimers, and a third the way of dementia. Unfortunately I was too young to know any of the details of how these situations were really handled to offer real advice, but you should know there there are people out there who know what you are going through. What I remember most vividly is how by the time the funerals came around, my mourning had already transitioned to questioning why we kept dumping money into keeping these hollow husks of who we used to know alive. But then again, I think I would have a much stronger reaction and opinion if it were my own parents that I had been close to for 50-60 years and not my grandparents. Don't get me wrong, I loved them, but they did not raise me, day in and day out, provide for me both shelter and food daily, shape my world view, advise me constantly even after I moved out to make it on my own...

It's a hard thing to deal with. I don't know if you've already dealt with it in your family before, but I'm sure you already know how this will end, should the doctor confirm your suspicions. As people, our clocks are always ticking from the very beginning, but theirs is ticking louder now. There are things that can be done to stave off or slow the progression; mental exercises, eating berries (physically good for the brain, apparently), puzzles, but you must cherish every remaining moment.

I think I would start the conversation from that angle; the sooner you can address your suspicions, the sooner anything can be done to counteract progression. Best case scenario is that you're wrong and there's nothing to worry about. Worst case scenario is spending the rest of your life wishing you had pushed them harder to get checked out early on. This will be a tough ordeal for your entire family, and I am so, so sorry. 

I wish you the best, and implore you not waste any time.

There’s nothing happening
Dr. Camden is that you? Did you know my granddaughter Sheryl? She passed away in 1989 and last week she sent me a letter asking for a funny cat comic. I said, oh dear. Dr. Camden is that you I hear? My son was born in 1999. We adopted him to set our taxes straight. In 1998 I had a love affair with Tony Hawk. He had made me soup when my husband passed away in 2001. My husband had strong hands. When he passed he gave me nothing in the will. That bitter old man gave me a printed funny comic. Do you think they still show reruns of that one funny but naughty TV show? It had such a sweet young man but a very evil orange cat in it.

I am so sorry you have stumbled across us all in this subreddit. I just wanted to say since I see others have guided that this is an extremely hard thing to maneuver. My honest advice would be to contact the doctor first and see if they have advice in a general sense. Because Alzheimer’s and a dementia don’t become the stage 5 end of life right away many patients put off getting help. I would do my best to phrase it as “there is nothing to lose but everything to gain situation.” If they go to the doctor and get told they’re fine then they wasted a couple hours. In the other direction could truly haunt them as I worked with those that had end staged of this and they literally sat up at night screaming in terror due to it. I’m very sorry you’re going through this and hope it gets better for you.

Day doesn't matter since the incident. I have woken up with broken shackles around my limbs. I am now in a desert, how did I end up here. There is blood everywhere, but I don't know the source. I don't know what to do, there is no one to help me. I don't want to fall asleep, I want the voices to stop, I want everything to end

I remember him. Funny fella, he is. He… he was on a paper once. Or was it one of those newfangled “iPhones”? I’m not too sure anymore.

Anyways, him. He was… he was just sitting there. And then this young man in a blue shirt… just runs right past. As if, there’s something urgent to take care of.

”Wildfire”, “sock drawer”. Those are two things i remember most. “Grandma”, and “Do you remember?”, those are two more things i can recognize from such an incident. the blue. the orange

orange… what was it… he was orange… he was… just sitting there. a cat. the young man. or was it a young woman? was he in blue or was she in brown? how many were there? there must’ve been… there must’ve been 4. yeah, 4 bright, young ladies and gentlemen.

they were crying, remember? they kept calling out, for “grandma”, and… “halmony”. there mustve been something rong. somthing out of the ordinary, at least.

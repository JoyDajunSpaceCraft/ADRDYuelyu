,My dad has Mild Cognitive Impairment and I could use advice,"So within the last year, my dad was diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment through the VA. A little background, he will be 67 this year, and was in the military most of his life. When I was growing up my father wasn’t the most attentive listener, he showed symptoms of ADHD and he was also dyslexic. He joined the military at 17 years old, retired nearly 35 years later, then got a job working for the government for another 10 years after that. In one way or another, his adult life has been structured by the federal government. Work came first so as a kid it always felt like he wasn’t listening anyways, cause he couldn’t even remember the things going on in my life as it was.

After he retired for good, and being alone for almost a decade, he moved back to be closer. This is when we started noticing changes in his personality and memory, it was like he was almost a different version of himself. The best way to describe it was almost childlike, without his traumas affecting his day to day life. His quirks were there, but his anger/jealousy/bitterness/cynicism, whatever you want to call it, that was gone. 

He started to ruminate about how he raised me; not being present as a father, fights, blaming himself for the issues that carried over from his own childhood abusive family. I assumed this change was sparked by me having my own first born child, and learning to forgive him myself, I wanted him to be a grandparent in my daughters life. But over the next few years and into the current, the memory issues really started showing up. So we’re at a point when I’ve had to step in and help, which is something I never imagined I would be taking on when I was growing up. 

The reason I explain a little about our past is because our biggest issue now is having to remind him about things. He has always had a little Rejection Sensitive Disorder and with a complicated past he already carries around so much guilt, I don’t want to hurt his feelings anymore than they already are. 

I guess my question is, how can I help remind him about things we’ve talked about before, without hurting his feelings? 

It’s not like he’s forgotten everything, cause when someone else reminds him of an event taking place or conversation happening, he doesn’t get his feelings hurt. 

To be honest, any advice in general on how to help him through this would be awesomely appreciated. Thanks!","I actually suggest that you take advantage of the resources the VA has to offer if you have not. They can offer in home care providers on a weekly basis determined solely on his needs. It’s typically anywhere from 6-15 hours/week but it can help stabilize the situation to have someone without history in the home.
I care for my husband who has memory issues, but his long term memories are largely intact.  If he's surprised about an event I've told him about before I try to just explain ""we have to go to the eye doctor because you've been having trouble reading"" without going into ""I told you yesterday"". Just like with kids, gentle distraction goes a long way. 

 It sounds like you have a good handle on things and frankly, your attitude of forgiveness and love for him is the most important tool in your belt.  That helps your head as well as his.  Try not to neglect your own needs, and as Mush8911 suggested get that home care going.  You guys are going to make it through this.",2022-05-15 17:16:41,TickleMonster528,uqfri4
,{venting},void,"Thanks for sharing. Honestly, I do not know many families who do not bring I help as caregiving is more than a full time job. Please be in touch with your local chapter of aging & disability resource center as they can guide to local resources. Also, a free webinar that might be helpful Guilt while Caregiving which now lives on youtube here.[https://youtu.be/oSWK8Ie6HrQ](https://youtu.be/oSWK8Ie6HrQ)
You are a brave person.  Hope things work out for you and your mom.  Definitely look into a day program for your mom: my husband goes two days a week.  He would rather stay home, but now he looks on it as his job and goes without complaint.  Medicare should pay for most of your mom's home care, depending on her income.  Talk to an intake worker at a home care agency.
Caregiving is a burden at any age. You doing this at your young age would be especially difficult. Your feelings are normal. It seems that you have been given some good ideas for resources. I hope one of the resources will help you. Best of luck to you.",2022-05-12 00:11:14,Away_Piano_4425,unsfgy
,I'm taking care of my mother now and need advice,"A few years back my mother (56) had a brain...thing. it wasn't a stroke. The neurologist ruled literally everything major out, but the aftermath is the aftermath. She has improved a lot, but she still falls and doesn't tell me and probably other stuff that she won't tell me, but I'll have to take that as it comes.  

I have to find a sort of automated pill dispenser for her.

She needs a walker/cane. Most likely a walker.

She has a lot of trouble concentrating and she needs a hobby. She used to crochet, but she doesn't like to be reminded of things she can't do.

I'm too tired to think of anything else right now. 

She's so much better, but now we're at a point where a new normal has settled in and I don't know what to do now. I'm autistic and overwhelmed. I had to speedrun a lot of growing up because of this and because she was overbearing. I also don't want to be overbearing. My father is zero help because he's afraid of the way she is now. 

I just want her like safe and to make how she lives now better and I really don't know what to do.","Maybe coloring? There are adult coloring books, and it doesn’t matter what colors are used, if the colors go outside the lines, when you start or end.  My mother (strokes and dementia) enjoyed them greatly. She progressed from  detailed books back to the books used for toddlers (before her passing, many years ago).

Not sure about the automated pill dispensers, but there are pill boxes where you can prepare a week’s worth of pills at a time. They are labeled with the days of the week. 

And your father needs to grow the F up. (Not that this is going to happen, but I sympathize. You having to be the adult while he gets to coast makes me just fume.)
Ask yourself if your father is helping your mother, If he is abusive or neglectful of her then it might be worthwhile to get adult protective services to do a wellness check on the situation, if y’all are better off without him around there might be a solution, if it’s a matter of money you may be able to get the courts to order him to pay spousal support of some kind.",2022-05-11 13:38:27,Frownload,unfe6a
,I had a breakthrough thought about guilt and receiving/asking for help,"Hello fellow caregivers. If any of you are like me, you experience a lot of guilt and negative emotions when it comes to asking for help and accepting help from friends amd family. And I think its safe to assume all of us are empaths. With that in mind, I had a thought that I think a lot of other people could benefit from as well, so here goes.....


Im my older sisters caregiver and we come from poverty and abuse. Well, I have this buddy who comes from a ""normal"" upper middle class family who is always extending himself to help us. As an empath, I can feel that he experiences a lot of guilt and other negative emotions about having resources and support that we dont and it occurred to me......


I wonder how much of the guilt and etc that I feel receiving his help comes from the emotions I'm sponging off of him?


And although I can't completely answer that question, past experiences can tell me that I tend to experience a huge amount of emotions vicariously. I know some of these feelings are my own, but knowing myself tells me not *all* of them are. So next time I'm in the situation where he is offering help and I am feeling bad about it, I think I'm going to address it head on. He is an empath as well, so I figure if I tell him I'm feeling his emotions as much as he is feeling mine, perhaps together we can lower our collective guilt, anxiety, etc. 


It's just a thought right now. But I'd love to hear other caregivers thoughts on this as well as any advice on dealing with these emotions you may have. 


Thanks guys, and happy mothers day to all of you who are taking on a motherly role with a loved one","I think there is a lot of truth to this when it comes to caregiving in general. So much of what I and my mother felt while caregiving for her parents, I can look back now and see that a lot of it came from other people/uninvolved family members, and the general pressure we feel from society. 

Society tells us that we shouldn’t need to rely on other people to support us, live within your means and work for what you need! 

Society tells us that even if your parent was abusive your entire life, when they get old you should just let go of all that because they aren’t the same person now and why are you still living in the past? “Blood is thicker than water! Your family needs you (not me, even though I’m also family, but definitely you)!”

Society says when someone develops dementia, you’re supposed to be everything they need and somehow hold yourself together at the same time, and if you feel like you’re at the end of your rope, well that’s because you haven’t made sure to take care of yourself, too! Self care is SO IMPORTANT!

Put them in assisted living or a nursing home right away? You clearly don’t love them, don’t you know how awful these facilities are? If you cared about anyone but yourself, you’d move heaven and earth to keep them at home and give them dignity in their last days...

It goes on and on and on, and it’s EXHAUSTING, on top of the obvious exhaustion from the actual caregiving day to day. Things ended up getting so hectic and we were literally moving from one moment to the next and hoping not to drown, and it wasn’t until near the end that we were able to actually take a breath and realize that all of those voices weren’t telling us the truth.

Obviously I don’t know the full dynamic between you and your friend, but from what you’ve shared, I think you’re on the right track with discussing it with them. If assistance is being freely offered, please don’t ever feel guilty for accepting it!

I highly recommend a book to any caregiver called The Selfish Pig’s Guide to Caring. I wish I’d found it so much sooner, because simply having your own feelings echoed by others in similar positions can be so validating.
Interesting concept.  In my case, I think my determination not to ask for or accept help is an independence thing.  I was raised by WASPs, and taught that you carried your own load, full stop.  Even though our present position--I'm caring for my husband, a stroke survivor, who lost a good ten years of working income--is the result of a health crisis,  I still feel obscurely guilty that our financial situation is shaky.  Just Work Harder is the mantra among my birth folk.",2022-05-08 15:12:56,TheRealShadyShady,ul8uxl
,Need advice helping my brother out for the next few days/weeks…,"If this isn’t the right place plz direct me to the appropriate sub. Idk where else to post this. I figured someone could help me brainstorm….thanks in advance!

Long story short my brother dislocated both of his shoulders and broken one shoulder as well. He was sent home with no pain meds. We are currently in another state away from home and in a hotel until Sunday. I need help with a few things…


1. Pain. I’ve given him Tylenol, lidocaine patches and and an ice pack and he’s still really uncomfortable. We still have to endure a 4 hr flight home. He doesn’t want to get admitted back into the hospital but wants something for his pain he’s worried they’re not going to prescribe him anything since they didn’t when he was discharged. 

2. Clothing. 
His range of motion is extremely limited he can’t move his arms above his head out,backwards, in front or to the side. Making it impossible to put a shirt on. At the hospital they would just drape a gown on him like a cape and had no shirt. A friend suggested a button down or zip up. I just want him appropriate enough so he can fly. 


Idk what else to put it’s been a weird 48 hrs all I can say is check on your friends and family when it comes to mental health stuff and remember to take time for your self as well bc in the end your life is worth living and you have purpose.","Warning: you asked for brainstorming. All of the following may sound a little unhinged, but this is intended as brainstorming, not a literal blueprint.

Clothing: look online for how to wrap a sarong, kanga, dhoti, sari, or other cultural no-sew textile clothing. Most of these are lower-body garments, but you can get some ideas to start experimenting. See if the hotel has a concierge, or is willing to find, give or sell you fabric, and loan you an employee to help figure it all out. It won't look ""normal,"" but that ship has sailed. 

Call the airline and/or airport, ask for help. He has a disability which should qualify brother & a caregiver for wheelchair service, pre-boarding, and alternatives to the cattle-call scene that is air travel.  I accompanied an elderly friend a few years ago, and found that with a little advance notice the whole thing was quite tolerable. 

Pain: no meds sucks. You probably do NOT want to be experimenting with unfamiliar medications at 30,000 feet, as altitude can intensify effects. Call the hospital, talk with… probably a social worker, discharge team, etc. Call your health insurance ""talk to a nurse"" hotline. 

Tip your hotel staff who go above and beyond, and/or write them thank yous, commendations. Have plently of $1 and $5 bills on hand for tipping airport assistants. Take pictures of the trip. You don't have to post them anywhere, but you'll want to have them to laugh over 50 years from now.

Edit: consider getting your brother to wear briefs for incontinence as a precaution. 4 hour flight can turn into 6 or 7 hours with delays and other nonsense, and airplane lavatories are probably not going to work with the shoulders.
Cut the side(s) of a t-shirt open, poncho style? Then you could close it up with hem tape or similar
Can you get one arm into a sleeve?  If you can't, I think you're stuck with draping a zip-up jacket over his back, and taping it closed (adhesive tape or vet wrap) a couple places in the front.  Tough duty, you are a good brother.  Hope the trip goes better than you're thinking it will.  Good advice from 108beads below.
Pain management: You can mix Tylenol and Advil. Look for [Advil Dual Action](https://www.advil.com/our-products/advil-dual-action/) at the drug store. If you can't find it, give him 2 Tylenol and 2 Advil. 

Clothing: Look for ""Adaptive Clothing"" I think I found a shirt from JC Penny's that you might like. It opens in the back. I would get it in one size larger for ease of movement/getting it on.

,"New to caregiving, need advice.","I am planning on quitting my job to become a caregiver for my wife. My state allows this, and her condition combined with a caregiver shortage is making it a necessity. My biggest fear is making ends meet. She isn't able to work, and whatever I make would be our paycheck. I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice, knowledge of programs or anything else that could help. Thanks.","Are you of retirement age?  Is your wife eligible for ssdi? I retired as soon as I was eligible for social security to care for my husband.  An attorney specializing in elder law helped me sort things out.  We live on our social security and a small distribution from my 401k, but we have no debt except the house.  My husband qualifies for Medicaid, so his healthcare is free.  I haven't looked into any possible veteran's benefits for him, but with the price of oil I might have to look into that next heating season.

My guess is that you don’t have long term care policy correct?  I agree with the above .. search for at home gigs to help get you by in the meantime. Does your state have any disability programs?

,Advice on caring for parents,"*TLDR: My widowed family member (65) is the main caretaker of her 92 year old mother who has severe dementia and refuses to put her in a long-term care facility, while simultaneously expressing her desire to travel the world, but complains that she can’t because she needs another family member to come and watch her mother. (Don’t @ me for the run-on)*

Alright, so let’s call this family member “Elle” and her mother “Mom”. Let me preface this by saying these feelings have been discussed with other family members, and even at a surface level with Elle (because she changes the subject).

As a quick back story, Elle’s husband battled with an illness for \~3 years, and ultimately lost. Since she had retired, she was taking care of her husband. At this time, Mom was in a different state with one of Elle’s siblings, and had been for a couple years at this point (since Mom was declining and could no longer live alone in her apartment).

A few short months after Elle’s husband passed away, she moved Mom into her house to begin her full time caregiver position. This was about 4 years ago, and Mom’s dementia has gotten significantly worse. Outside of that, Mom is completely health.

One of Elle’s siblings (the one who was previously taking care of Mom), is sick. They can’t commit to helping out with Mom anymore, not to mention Elle wants to go spend time with said sibling. Another sibling, who also lives in another state, has yet to retire. They’ve reduce their hours to be part time, but they’re at the age that they \*should\* retire - however I feel like they’re not because they’ll feel obligated to take on an active role in this caregiving situation (though they already spend half of their PTO taking care of Mom anyways).

Mom has in-home care for 4 hours each day to give Elle a break, and get Mom through (subjectively) the toughest part of the day. I say subjectively, because I think Mom gets worse (meaner) as the day goes on. I don’t think the level of care Mom gets with Elle is necessarily better (safer) than it would be in a long-term care facility. Mom gets around the house with a walker, showers alone (standing), sleeps for 12 hours, and spends 90% of her day mindlessly watching TV (or napping, so + 1-2 hours to sleep total).

During this daily 4 hour time period time, Elle..doesn’t really do anything. She fills her time with meaningless errands. She has minimal involvement with her church (compared to what she used to). She doesn’t have friends (aside from one, in a different state, who is just patiently waiting for Elle to figure things out so they can go travel together). She preaches about going and living life to the fullest - she’s planned these trips she wants to take in Europe and America - but it’s hard to take her seriously and talk about these plans.

And maybe this belongs in AITA - because I hate to watch Elle orchestrate care for Mom so she can get away and live her life while she still can. I don’t want Mom to pass away and then Elle not be able to live out her dreams because she’s too old to. But I also think since the loss of her husband, Elle has just taken on the role of caretaker and has let that define her. I don’t think she ever had the chance to properly grieve and be alone, and instead she filled her time with looking after Mom. I also worry that Elle’s mental sharpness is taking a hit, because she’s living in this Groundhog’s Day, too. Other family members have expressed this concern, and their acceptance to putting Mom in a care facility, but Elle refuses to (let’s assume cost isn’t an issue here). I also kinda feel like this is forcing Elle’s choice on the rest of the family/dictating how they spend their time (because they're who Elle looks to when she needs a break).

Has anyone been in a similar situation (to family members OR Elle)?","I can’t offer any advice but I sure am glad you posted this. This could easily happen to anyone of us caregivers. Thank you for the heads up
That's a really tricky situation, OP. 

This isn't crazy similar, but my mom's side of the family really struggled to take care of my grandmother once she got sick -- my grandmother was sharp until they end, but she refused to go into a long term care facility even though she needed 24 hour care. Though she did agree to go to respite care for a bit, which was a huge relief and my grandmother didn't even fight it much because it was only temporary-- if that's an option, and I may give some advice, I would recommend exploring respite care for your mom. It would give Elle a chance to see how your mom would do in a care facility, and at the same time enable Elle to take her trips without you or any of your other siblings needing to take care of your mom in the meantime. It didn't convince my grandmother to go into long term care, but it did give my family a much needed break, which was great in and of itself. And Elle might find that your mom is better off in a care facility (it sounds like she would be, or it at least wouldn't hurt).

Elle reminds me of my aunt, in some ways. My aunt has been living alone for most of her life and put a lot of work into taking care of my grandmother for many years. She became a much more frustrating person since my grandmother died (more selfish and needy, treating my mom like a replacement mom, in some ways). I think it's good that you're trying to get Elle to think about her life beyond your mom, even if Elle isn't acting receptive to it. Caregiving is certainly noble, but she's gotta think about self care too -- and an exit strategy.
I’ve worked in care homes and If she does send mom to one, it is so important that she visit as much as possible, dementia patients often see a marked decline as soon as they are moved out of their homes and routines.
Qs: Who is making a determination and by what criteria on when/if your mom will be better served in a facility? Does Elle keep in touch with you daily and give reports and track things in a journal and attend doc appointments?

We had home health come (in the USA) when my mom took a turn and they went through everything (doctor perscribed, medicare paid). The first visit they looked through house, asked questions, assessed mobility gave caregiver trips and tricks and made recommendations. A PT was assigned who came 2/wk and worked with strength and stuff like how to get out of chair, etc. and a nurse came 1/wk to take vitals and do a check. Lasted for 8 weeks. It was excellent.

All this is showing Elle that  1. she's not alone 2. there are alternative ways to do things 3. there will come a time she can't manage it without professionals. It's also giving your mom interaction and putting part of her own care back into her hands with some exercises.

It also sounds like Elle will have a hard time transitioning when her life is her own, but has made the choice to 

All that being said, as a caretaker I would sacrifice a limb to have a 4 hour break every day to do nothing. That's a really big deal and must go a long way for Elle's frame of mind.",2022-04-26 14:51:20,ViewChase92,ucjri8
,Thinking of going private with caregiving. Advice?,"Been doing senior care for a little over 3 months now non medically and I enjoy my work, as long as my client isn't trying to attack me haha. Recently though, I partnered up with someone through my company and we have decided to go privately to work better hours and obviously be paid better. Does anyone else do private care and what's your advice or opinion on it? For the record I'm not CNA but my partner is looking I to to since she has been caregiving for 10 years.","Haven’t done private, but I’m at my second company doing caregiving, and really make sure to go over their competition policies. Sometimes they’ll say you can’t do private for clients you’ve had in the past, or in a specific radius from headquarters or something. I worked for a company that noted if we worked for clients that we had with them, through another company or as private, we would be fined $2000 and the client would be fined $10000. 

Don’t want that to discourage you, just be real careful! And best of luck to you!!
Worked many years, for various agencies....they paid caregivers $11.75/$12.50  per hour & billed the client $30.00/$33.00 per hour (we made the agencies rich).
Eventually worked sweet, private paying jobs, at $28, but the boss...who organized the caregivers, tended to be a flake &/or just expect us to fill in whenever (not to mentioned texts/emails off hours)...but I digress. Private pay, for the win!!

,New to this…need lifting advice,"I have moved in to help my elderly parents and I need a lift assist plan. Dad falls occasionally and needs help getting to his feet. My back hurts today from that. 

I think that a device that could be placed under him in a seated position seems best. I can foresee the needs changing too, of course, with other assist needs coming. I don’t know yet what to expect. 

I’m looking for advice on the best solutions, and best suppliers. Quality used equipment seems like a good option, but I have no idea where to look.","I have gone through exactly this with my Dad recently, also to the point of injuring my back.  

You need to accept your limits. There are devices that can help you lift him, but don't be afraid to call the EMT's. My Dad just ended a month long hospital stay and the social worker was direct - if he falls or is on the ground and cannot get up, call the EMT's. 911. They will help get him into a chair or bed and you don't have to get any more help, don't have to go to the hospital, etc.  

My Dad had lumbar decompression so he is walking very unsteady now. If that is similar to your dad look into a gait belt. [Here](https://www.amazon.com/COW-Transfer-Caregiver-Therapist-60inches/dp/B07P6ZM2CN/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=gait+belts+for+seniors&qid=1649902128&sprefix=gait+%2Caps%2C168&sr=8-5) is an example that is just like the one we use. You fasten it around his torso and slide your hand underneath to grip the belt on his back. This helps to provide stability when walking and also allows you to help control a descent if there is a fall.  

Best of luck to you and your parents!
Couple of suggestions: 1) for a device, look into a [hoyer lift](https://www.assistedliving.org/best-hoyer-lifts/). They can pick someone up from the floor to about 3' off the ground (some even higher). They're pretty easy to use, can be operated by one person, and allow the person being lifted to ""help"" (they can get into the harness themselves and hold onto the lift bars, making them not feel so helpless).

2) Check your local veterans' organizations and elderly centers for a hospital equipment room. Our local VFW has a room with just TONS of hospital beds, wheelchairs, lifts, commodes - you name it, they've got it. Most of it's free to use.

Good luck!
What are the circumstances under which he falls? Do you use a gait belt?

There are videos which demonstrate getting someone up from the floor. I learned all of my transfer and lift assist from YouTube videos.",2022-04-13 12:39:57,TowlieJrJr,u2uilb
,Mild cognitive impairment,"My mom (75) was diagnosed last week with mild cognitive impairment. What kinds of activities can I engage her in that will help her preserve her cognitive skills? She lives with my dad (74) and enjoys playing cards, reading (although she needs large print these days, which unfortunately limits her options somewhat), and watching sports, particularly baseball and football. I got her a couple of large print crossword and word search puzzle books as part of her birthday present, and she seemed to enjoy those. She also has a cat and is taking good care of her so far.","this is going to sound like an ad, but i swear I'm a real person. Have you ever considered getting her a Kindle? The screen looks just like paper, and you can check out digital books from your local library. You can make the text as big as you like. If she has an iPad, you can also download the kindle app instead or whatever app your library uses for digital loans. The learning curve shouldn't be that difficult if you need to show her how to use the kindle or iPad.
There is some research showing links between perceptual abilities and cognitive decline. So make sure that her prescription glasses are up to date and that if she needs a hearing aid that she has one and wears it. It is also a good idea to try to provide her with new things to do or think about. It is easy to fall into set routines, especially for older people, but once something becomes routine it becomes an easy cognitive lift and not much of an exercise for the mind.

Exercise! New research shows combining a physical task with a mental task is the best way to slow cognitive decline. Look for a personal trainer in her area who is specialized in older adults.",2022-04-12 15:58:09,WildColonialGirl,u27wzx

I get called off my hall constantly to swap to the most problematic residents when they are at their worst. I also have the hall with the most care needs. This makes it where I am constantly climbing stairs and crossing the whole facility.

I’m tired, my lungs feel like crap, and management just keeps on asking for more.","Nothing I can say to help except you're a saint to your patients.  I assume you would quit if you could quit, so your other option is to carve out a chunk of time--like 48 hours--to be totally off call.  Tell your boss.  Your competence is obvious, since it's relied on so much.  Don't be afraid to use that.  Thanks for your good heart and your heroism.",2022-04-12 03:33:58,MrChunkyCat,u1te9j
,Stoma,"I'm not sure if this is the correct sub so please redirect me if it's not. I've been a caregiver for several years and had been working at an elderly board and care for 6 months. I get minimum wage and I am not a nurse. When I was hired, my job description was feeding, changing, companionship, laundry, housekeeping, medication...


On Friday night, a new resident arrived. Resident from Hell, though she's supposedly a devout Christian, go figure. She's very demanding and demands things like a rude guest at a hotel would. Very passive aggressive, she exhausted and drained me and I had no energy to take care of my five other residents over the weekend. My opinion is she needs one on one care in a different environment.


This wasn't the problem though. She has a stoma and indiana pouch. I was expected to shove a tube into her stoma every four hours to empty her urine. I have never done this, I have no experience with this. My boss did not make me aware I would be doing this until she arrived and I met her.

Staring at this tube going into a hole in this women's body made me nauseous, headache, shakey...I felt like I was going to pass out. I excused myself and called my boss. He didn't care that I was sick, showed no concern. I was the only caregiver there at 8am. He told me to get over it. 


Four hours later and I get sick again doing the procedure. The boss is upset, says it's easy to do(it took him over 45 min though) and comes to do it himself. I tried to leave home early as I didn't feel well from this the whole day but nobody was ever sent to relieve me. 

He asked over three times why I can't do the stoma catheter care and I explained how I got sick and was going to pass out. He laughed, and laughed some more. I told him someone comfortable with a medical background should be doing that. He laughed again.


At the end of my shift, I told him that I quit. 
I guess I'm posting to vent but also to protect myself from anything in the future like this. Does anyone have experience with an indiana pouch and is it usually an RN to empty it? Thanks","Stoma and catheter care should be done by a CNA. This resident requires a higher level of care than the RCFE can or will provide (LOC w more staff and attending CNA.) You did the right thing. I hope you fine employment by a new, more humane and competent workplace, which you deserve. Keep your head up. Maybe you can go to SBA.gov and find a community navigator and tel them you want to open your own business - a board and care. 🛌
I don't really know an answer for how that should be done.  I think you did what you needed to do by quitting.  
  When my mother stayed in a nursing home, the staff were overwhelmed.  She sat for two hours one morning with a messed diaper.  Because of covid, I could not go in to help.  We stood outside her window in January talking on the phone to the nurse, while my mother sat without pants on with the woman telling me that everyone got dressed at 8am and my mother must not be, in her right in her mind to think she didn't have pants on.  I think that nurse was like your boss. She was overworked and just didn't care anymore.
Because in the US it is sad how we push our elderly away from our homes.  We hire people who often are struggling with low wages and little if any training. We don't support the people who live there or the people who work there, but damn the insurance companies and nursing homes pocket the money.
I have family work with older people in a home environment.  They care for their people.  They both make about $15 hour.  My mother is able to stay with me and I pray to God if she were need to go into a home that covid will be over and I can go be with her and help.  She will be 98 this summer. 
I hope you find a job that will offer training. Good luck. Bless you
In addition to leaving this hellhole of a job, I would encourage you to report it as elder abuse.
Sorry to hear about the abuse YOU took, and the negligence of your boss, to provide a client/patient with proper care. It sounds like he’s warehousing bodies. Obnoxious or not, this woman needs a properly trained person to care for her & your boss WHO CONTRACTED WITH HER/RELATIVES OF HER TO PROPERLY CARE FOR HER is in dereliction of his duties. As someone who also works with the elderly in an at home situation, I can not and will not do anything that I am not trained to do (mine involves Hoyer lifts & catheter with bags that I do not touch, & George, who is an absolute doll, appreciates that as well). It could hurt me or George if I tried! But that’s a situation where the boss is the patient.
Report it all to the proper authorities. Someone may actually care about this woman and they need to realize she is not getting the care she is paying for. Not YOUR fault. This is all on your @$$hole boss.

He had a nurse but has since let her go as he cannot afford her anymore. He has fallen several times during and since then. What are my options? I have lived with him in the past but moved out due to emotional abuse (ie. saying he won’t kill himself but if he was going to describing in graphic detail what he would do) and I really don’t want to move back into that situation but I am unsure what my other options are. Any advice is greatly appreciated!,"does he have Medicare?
Aside from getting him a life alert, installing things around his house like motion-sensored lights along the stairs and railing in the shower, you will most likely need to work out an alternative living situation for him. 

1 in 3 fatalaties from elderly people living alone are from falls. If he can't afford to have an in-home nurse, I'm sorry to say but it's really time for him to go into a home. It's just too dangerous for him to be there without someone to help.

,Advice for long term overnight caring at hospital,"Asking for a friend

Their mom recently had a stroke due to a blood clot in the brain and was diagnosed with rectal cancer while she was in the hospital. She will most likely be hospitalized for a while. 

The doctors suggest that someone stay with her overnight because she keeps trying to move when she’s not supposed to so someone needs to make sure she doesn’t fall out of bthe d during the night time. 

My friend can work from home so their schedule is flexible but they are overwhelmed about how to even begin to prepare to stay up practically all night while working during the day. They have their work laptop and phone with them so they can essentially work anywhere that has wifi. 

Any advices/tips for how to prepare to juggle work and caregiving? 

🙏","Been down this road with my mom many times.  I absolutely had to hire a companion to sit overnight so I could manage the days and evenings. It was around $30/hour but luckily she had the resources. There may be volunteer services within the hospital; worth it to inquire.  ~Best
My wife was hospitalized for several months.  The hospital has nurses and care staff for that.  Sure your friend can stay sometimes but they should also make time to take care of themselves too.
Not ideal but don’t they have bed straps and aren’t there rails? Or are you saying that the mom continues to climb out of the bed? My family took turns staying the night at the hospital with my mom for 6 weeks. We slept on the chair in the room when she slept and the nurses would check in every hour or so. There was never a concern of her falling out of bed, but she also didn’t have any strength on her left side so it would be physically impossible.",2022-04-06 22:29:35,ymilikedis,ty2rnp
,"19M, UK, Full time unpaid carer to my emotional abusive mother, cannot cope anymore.","I don't know where to start. So much has happened in my life over the last few years that I cant put it into a few paragraphs on here. I feel like I'm at the end of my rope. I just can't cope anymore.

&#x200B;

Both me and my grandmother who is 73, take care of my mother. She has MS and requires somebody to look after her all the time. We have no other family who can help. We have tried getting professional help for her but there are no carers available at the moment due to a huge shortage, and even then, we wouldn't be able to afford it for very long. The thing is, it's not my mothers illness thats hard to deal with, it's her personality issues. Her partner left her a few months ago because he couldn't cope with her either. She is argumentative about absolutely everything, she goes against everything we ask her to do to help herself, such as eat healthily and exercise as doctors have suggested, but she would rather sit there and scream and shout and swear at us all day long than do anything to help herself. Recently, she's been falling a lot. Last week she went into A&E after falling and she had 3 fractures. Today she's fallen twice. A physiotherapist told her last year that she must do specific exercises every day, or she could permenantly lose her ability to walk, but she has refused to do any exercise now for months. She is in a wheelchair all day, and every time she transfers from it into bed or onto the toilet, 99% of the time she falls to the floor, and me and my grandmother have to pick her up.

She won't eat her food, instead she demands chocolate and sweets, and if we ask her to eat her food first she gives us absolute hell and calls us bullies and abusers. 

A couple of years ago she was admitted to hospital due to alcoholism and she almost died. She had been drinking for many years as a way of coping with her illness. I know it's not her fault.

There is so much more than what I've said on here, but I'm trying to keep it as short as possible.

I just don't know what to do. Surely this isn't right. Both me and my grandmother are incredibly stressed all day every day, and I just feel like we aren't getting any help at all. All we are currently getting is one carer a week coming in, to shower her, and that's it. I've been having severe depression and anxiety over the last 5 years because of this messed up situation, and I don't see any way out. I'm extremely worried about the future as her illness just keeps getting worse and worse, and my grandmother is getting older and I'm worried something might happen to her, all this stress isn't healthy.

&#x200B;

Sorry if I've missed out any important details. This was basically just a way for me to vent and say what's been on my mind. Feel free to ask anything. If anyone can relate to this situation in any way, or can offer any help or advice, that would be really appreciated.","Are there any additional social services that might be able to help? Or maybe she needs to be in a facility that can better care for her.
Also if she is barely moving and using adult diapers, she could have a UTI, which in older adults can make them really difficult and loopy. They are very common in senior women
have you tried medication to make her less moody? For my grandmother who has dementia, Seroquel worked wonders. Even a low dose of antidepressant could make her more mellow and less prickly
To be honest, you're really young and your grandma is elderly, your mum isn't likely going to be receiving the 'level of care she needs' not because you guys are doing a crappy job but because she sounds really intense and it's hard to imagine you're well equipped to deal with that kind of behaviour. Not to mention, you're at an age where the government's gonna be trying to push you into further education or a career and your grandma shouldn't be a carer way into her old age. How you have managed this for 5 years breaks my heart.

There are helplines that I would 100% attempt to get into contact with - bear in mind there might be a lot of messing about and a lot of waiting but I urge you to sit through it and see what help can be offered. Also do try and have a look at your local council website to see if more support can be gained there. I'm not being funny but if all they're offering you is for the one carer to come in and give her a weekly shower thats pretty appalling. My no.1 tip is don't go down easy, you're in a difficult situation and you deserve help so if they mess you about you have to kick up a fuss.

It's likely you've already tried this so let us know n we can brainstorm some more. You deserve to move on with the rest of your life and your grandma deserves to actually spend her later years resting.

Hello Dear.  I am so sorry all of this is on your young shoulders.  
This sounds just terrible.  The UTI suggestion is sound, can cause falling and confusion.  Docs resist treating them in the elderly, they say a higher count of bacteria is normal, from my conversations.  I make a point of encouraging hydration, just plenty of fluids.  Another thing is to check toenails, doctors never check feet on the elderly, watch for infection or bad shoes.

Most importantly, you mentioned many medications.  Read the drug information, there may be bad interactions.  Change doctors and ask to cut back on meds as much as possible.  This requires monitoring but might be worth it if it reduces side effects.  Your grandma probably cannot research online as fast as you.  My go to  for research is Pubmed and the  Mayo clinic, for starters.

I wish I could offer more qualified assistance, my experiences are not as extreme.  My mother has had some delerium, but no ms and no addictions.  In your case, a prescription for Indica may kill two birds ... anger and a desire to be zoned out ... with one stone.",2022-04-04 16:49:06,Throwaway158175,twcnec
,Elderly aunt has impending knee replacement surgery. Any advice?,"I'm a very small woman, just barely 5 foot. I know I'm not going to be very helpful with mobility, and we have another family member helping out with that but i truly think most of the work will fall on me.

Anything that can help fight burnout? Last time i had a whole episode and it wasn't good for anyone. 

Any meal recommendations? She's an incredibly picky eater, like feeding a 10 year old which is annoying on a good day. She's prone to not eat things she generally likes just because she didn't make it, especially if it's any type of veggies. 

Any equipment she might need? We have a walker, a walk and sit, a toilet chair, a recliner for her since her bed isn't gonna be an option for a little while, and a bunch of chairs and cushions. 

Anything important we may have forgotten and need to get or consider or do?","Not sure where she's getting her surgery, but you should ask the surgeon to prescribe for her a Breg Polar Ice Cube machine. It's a machine that circulates ice around her knee, reducing both pain and swelling.  If she's not mobile when she leaves the hospital, there's a chance they'll have to send her to rehab to recover and get daily physical therapy. In addition, she can be in a bed, just make sure she has enough pillows to keep her 'toes above her nose.'  
The tough thing is that she will be in pain. Do not get behind in her pain medication, and make sure she takes a stool softener so she doesn't get constipated.

Your doctor probably has videos for her to watch regarding the surgery, after care, and physical therapy. If this sounds like it's too much, say something now so that arrangements can be made to have her recover in rehab instead.

,Preparing for brain surgery,"My husband (39) started losing motor function on his right side in 2020. It developed very slowly up the right leg until late 2021 when he started feeling weakness in his right arm, which, in a matter of only a few months, has completely lost function. After almost a year of seeing specialist after specialist, we finally found out last week that he has a brain tumor. It is relatively big, but suspected to be benign, and he will need a craniotomy to remove it. Our neurologist told us that a neurosurgeon would most likely want to operate in the next couple weeks, but it turns out they can't get us in until 3 weeks from now, and it will only be for a consultation. Because we aren't officially patients yet, they can't tell us how long it will be after that for the surgery to be scheduled.

The whole process of finding a diagnosis has been long and agonizing. My husband is understandably upset and struggling after having lost most of his mobility and independence. It's been heartbreaking to watch him wither away in front of my eyes these last few months and there have been many difficult days along the way. We've gotten along well through it all, but we're both stressed to the max and have been for a long time. Finding out we'd be waiting almost another whole month just to have a surgery consultation has hit him hard. 

We have both been doing our own online research on craniotomies and the risks associated with brain surgery. We've been advised before not to ""consult with Dr. Google"", but, our doctors have been pretty vague about how risky his surgery will be. In a way, I'm glad we have a little extra time to prepare before the surgery, but this month has already turned into a gloomy brain surgery research-fest, and we are both really feeling the weight of it. If anyone has any suggestions on activities we can do (keeping in mind, he has limited mobility) just to bring a little lightness to all the misery, it would be appreciated.

If anyone has been through anything similar, I'd also love to know if you have any tips on how much to prepare and how much online digging should be left un-dug. It's been difficult to strike a balance between staying positive and being informed. Also, as his caregiver, I feel like it's my responsibility to provide emotional support right now. I've made listening to him and allowing him opportunities to talk about his feelings a priority. However, I can't help but feel like whenever I try to keep things positive, it comes off like I'm sweeping it under the rug. Alternatively, when I try to bring up those important conversations we need to have, I feel like I the world's wettest blanket.

Another thing I'm worried about is that my husband controls our finances. In general, it's better that way, but if surgery doesn't go according to plan, it'll be me taking care of our bills, and I don't even have access to our primary bank accounts. I've also tried to bring up the possibility of him getting some kind of living will, but he's just brushed it off.  Also, we're not really sure if insurance is going to cover the surgery. I keep trying to get him to call and get more info about it, but he just keeps saying that because we were able to schedule the consultation, that the hospital must've worked it out with our insurance. If pre-authorization has happened, I'd rather know and have it in writing, especially since we have more time get our affairs in order than we originally thought. If anyone has any advise on navigating these sticky issues, it would also be appreciated.","Your husband having so much control over your finances that you don't have access to your bank accounts is a huge problem.  Try asking him to teach you his system, so you can keep up with things ""for him"" so he can take back over when he recovers.

 If he keeps you away from the money because you're a frivolous spender, you're going to have to quit that.  If it's because he's controlling, you need to take steps to protect yourself.  **If I were you, I would quietly consult a specialist in elder law**.  And don't expect a hospital to automatically check your insurance coverage before scheduling you.  When you go to his next appointment, speak up and ask them to check, if you can't call them yourself.

I'm sole caregiver for my husband who has severely limited mobility and dementia from a stroke.  He's incontinent, and depressed, as who wouldn't be.  ***I can't make him happy.  I can't bring his health back.***  **There is no way to be a perfect caregiver.**  I keep him clean and fed.  I do the best I can.  I will never feel like I'm doing enough.  Self care is both important and very difficult for caregivers.  This is obviously a trauma for both of you, but you can't fix it.  You can only deal with it one day and one crises at a time.

,Downs Syndrome Client Making Inappropriate Gestures,"I work for a company that provides care support for adults with disabilities. The client I see twice a week from 3pm-9pm is a nice guy, very sweet, sometimes very cheeky and funny. My only problem is that sometimes, whether he's getting in/out of the shower or dressing, or when I'm helping him clean up after he uses the bathroom, he'll grab his penis and say ""play?"" 

I've tried to tell him that this only something you can do by yourself, when no one else is around, but I'm not sure whether he understands, and if he does, whether he remembers, as he is in his 50's and has dementia.

Just now, he came home from work, and then went to the bathroom. When I went in to ask if he was finished so we could wipe, he said that he'd done something, or a phrase to that effect, and when I asked what he meant, he said ""You!"", and shook his semi-errect penis at me. I kept it professional, but I was very upset and told him sternly that ""I don't like that, it hurts my feelings, and if you do that to me again, I won't work with you anymore, I will leave."" I was trying to use simple words and phrases that he can understand, and I adjusted my tone and expression to show that I was upset, but I did not yell (and I never would.)

This time, this made me want to cry. I like him as a client, and we never have any other problems. I can't actually afford to drop him and lose the hours because I don't know that they would have anyone else for me to work with, but I don't know how many more times I can take it with the penis shaking, and telling me he wants to masturbate.","Is there a supervisor you can involve? A parent or guardian? I had a friend with CP and developmental delays. Growing up she was spoiled rotten, ""pity the poor gimp,"" so she was never corrected, no boundaries ever enforced. 

It wasn't that she couldn't learn, but nobody was willing to do the work needed with any growing child. Kids grow up, and develop sexually. As an adult, she acted like a spoiled brat. Sweet person, but horny and utterly off the walls inappropriate at times.

You probably can't walk away when the behavior starts, for safety reasons. Can you stop what you're doing, step back, frown, etc.?
I agree with 108 in the suggestion of involving supervisors or guardians. With dementia as an additional complicating factor here influencing both his behavior and capacity to learn, I’m not sure how much change you’ll see in this man’s behavior. Perhaps you can workshop alternative ways to approach bathing and bathroom with his team. Before the end of bathing and before you enter to wipe, you could also add verbal reminders of what you will help with and any boundaries around stimulatory behavior.
I'm thinking that maybe he has been sexually abused before. Just maybe. Someone or some people have said or done what he is doing to you. He thinks it is normal behavior. 

I have heard of instances of sexual abuse in people with disabilities. Did you hear about the comatose woman (She had been in a coma for over a decade) who gave birth somewhere in Nevada?

She has some level of senility but is generally in decent health and wellness.  Unfortunately, the television cable package she has is full of commercials and endless reruns which run 24 hours/day - which only makes her living environment more static. She's most comfortable with familiarity but she's losing her concept of time of day and I think a big part of it is because of this ""stasis"".
What suggestions do any of you have to help me with gran's understanding it's 5 a.m and not 5 p.m? (for example?!)
Thank you in advance!","Having clocks around that show the time along with am/pm will help with time. Having some type of calendar that you make sure it is updated each day, so she knows the day, day of the week, month, year will help.

As far as keeping her oriented...having regular (but flexible) routines can help, too. Try to have things like meals, meds, naps, activities around certain times. Maybe have a pre-bedtime ritual so her body knows it is bedtime and calms down will help.

The down side to senility/dementia is that is can mess with your body's natural day/night clock. The more routine and regular things are, the more it will help.
Amazon has day clocks.  Looks like an ipad screen and has not only time of day in large size, but can say Tuesday Morning, or Thursday Evening.  This assumes she knows what morning and evening represent.  They worked for my dad for a while, until they didn't.
Change her drinks depending on time of day (depending on her likes of course).  For example:  juice and coffee until lunch.  Water and herbal tea in afternoon, wine in evenings.  :-)  Give her something to look forward to, with each part of the day.
I got my mom a watch that speaks the time of day from the CNIB , a store which supports the blind.
I find a daily wake up call helps.",2022-03-23 18:06:17,ModularFolds,tli6ok

,How to help a fall risk patient struggling with loss of independence?,"I have a patient at an assisted living facility who can walk, but is a fall risk. They've fallen more than ten times in the month I've been here though they cannot remember it. 

This individual has had an incredibly difficult time adjusting to dependence. We very frequently find them attempting to walk without supervision, and due to their memory they forget why they can't every time. 

Is there any reliable way to quell this behavior? I don't quite have the time in a given night to walk this individual around and get it out of their system. I've attempted to teach them to use their wheelchair to be mobile but they never seem to retain it.","I would suggest a chair alarm, like this one: 

https://www.amazon.com/Smart-Caregiver-Basic-String-Monitor/dp/B00BUT1O0U/ref=mp_s_a_1_10?keywords=chair+alarm&qid=1647123248&sr=8-10

Simple clip to the clothes, and keep the alarm box attached to the chair or bed. An awful alarm sounds if they get up/fall and the string pulls away. The end on the box is a magnet, so them pulling will activate it. 1)you will hear right away if they move 2) the alarm may startle them enough they sit back down before a fall, or at least stop trying after a few alarms 3) insurance may cover this item as it is considered necessary medical equipment for some fall risk patients-just ask their DR, caseworker, or or agency nurse. 

Good luck!

If a person has a paid caregiver, it is standard for that caregiver to act as medical advocate in the hospital.

Family care is different than paid care. When the family gives over care to an agency or single care provider that is not emotionally invested in the patient, it is expected that the medical aspects of their care will be dealt with by the caregiver. This includes hospital stays. Yes, the patient may have a POA. That POA does make final decisions. These decisions are informed by the entire medical team-including the paid caregivers. 

I have worked both for my own family and as a paid caregiver. As a paid caregiver,when my client is in the hospital I am expected to work longer hours. However, I am NOT expected to do the majority of care. I can help feed with dietician approval. I can help the CNA or Nurse change a brief. I cannot give meds or walk to the toilet. The work is much less intensive, so longer hours are standard. In the hospital I am expected to keep detailed notes-regular vitals, what meds and when, what food and when, every void and visitor, and every word spoken by a doctor.

Edit to add: a medical advocate is NOT a visitor, and the patient is entitled to at least 1 visitor AND a medical advocate at all times. His wife could very well be there, and your mom is absolutely expected to be as well.",2022-03-11 15:08:21,lesmtz,tbyvoc

,Bed-chair transfer advice,"Hi everyone - I’m seeking advice on bed-chair (and chair-bed) transfers for my grandmother. In December she had a deep right brain stroke resulting in severe deficiency on her left side. That said, she was quite weak/frail to begin with. She spent about a month in a rehab facility (that unfortunately was not well resourced and did not have quality care standards) and has been home for about 5 weeks. I live out of state but have gone back and forth over the past several weeks to help my mom get some semblance of a routine for her care.

She has caregivers come to the home, OT, and PT, and my mom just hired a live in caregiver…but the problem is that my grandmother is not reliably able to assist with transfers from bed to chair, she panics every time and kicks her feet out…so it’s a necessary two person assist. Outside of transfers she doesn’t really need more than one person…I’m curious what kind of equipment you all have had good and most importantly SAFE experience with for all parties involved. 

Her PT wants them doing “stand and pivot” transfers but she only seems to think she’s capable of doing that when her PT is there. She’s on blood thinners and has bruises all over from moving related trauma. 

I thought maybe a basic manual hydraulic lift…but I also don’t want to increase her deficit. But I also feel like her marginal and debatable progress isn’t worth the huge safety risk it is to her and her caregivers (and my mom who has already hurt her back as she’s filled in gaps in care so much). 

Any advice would be appreciated!","Have you tried a slider board? It's just a piece of smooth wood that goes from the chair to the bed or wherever your transferring too that the patient slides across. Very low tech and usually effective.
Oh - I forgot to mention I am familiar with gait belts, but unfortunately her skin is so loose and fragile that they e caused injury to her and haven’t proven to be helpful. I’ve also suggested to my mom to look into a harness that loops around the legs to prevent it from slipping up and damaging her skin.
Something like this maybe? Transfer pole she can hold on to for balance while standing and pivoting. Still enables her to do it independently and avoids skin shearing from devices like transfer board or lift.

,Can I be a paid caregiver to a friend via her insurance?,"Sorry if the title is confusing, I don't really know how to word this without telling all the details.

My(23F) roommate and best friend(20F) has lupus, fibromyalgia, and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures.  When she has bad flare ups they last months.  Everyday she wakes up in excruciating pain, unable to function.  She can't move her legs enough to get out of bed, she can't move her mouth enough to actually speak, she is just suffering.  This usually lasts about 2-3 hours, and then her medicine starts to kick in.  I've missed 2 days of work this week because I didn't feel comfortable or safe leaving her alone.  We're thinking she might need an in home care taker, but she's really weary of new people.

A coworker of mine works part-time as a caretaker for her elderly grandmothers.  She gets paid through her grandmother's insurance.  Is there a way that I can do this for my friend?  I can't find anything online about it.  We're hoping that I could work the mornings as a caregiver and then work evening shifts at my current job.  She has medicaid and we are in Ohio.  Thanks.","What part of Ohio?

First, definitely check with Medicaid.

But you may still run into issues. To be an independent (self-employed) care giver, you have to go through a few hoops and some paperwork to be able to accept payment from Medicaid as a caregiver...and will also need liability insurance. And to get your payment, you have to chart/submit various things about the care given, etc. Also, keep in mind that Medicaid compensating you does not have a set timeline like a job...sometimes it could be a bit. It's not a ""submit paperwork/hours by set day and get paid by set day"". A few people I knew who went through all this...the ""quickness"" of the pay varied for every single one of them.

It is worth looking into, if you are both open to it. 

One other thing to keep in mind is how many hours Medicaid will ""qualify"" your friend to get. When I worked home health, I had a client I took care of who was a quadriplegic who was a hoyer lift, total care, and had vey limited use of fingers so she even needed fed her meals...and she only got 8 hours of HHA a day. And that was with her having NO other family who could come in and help her.

Now my Dad, on the other hand...I am his 24/7 care giver. We have tried through 2 programs to see if I can get paid a little for taking care of him, as he cannot be left alone, so I cannot leave to work. Currently going through a 3rd that should get approved, but can take months. However, because he DOES have me, he only qualifies for 13 hours of HHAs a week coming out to help. Before I became his POA, I could have applied for a job at the company sending the HHAs and work those hours. But once you are their POA, you're not allowed to do that.

Sorry...really only shared that to show that the amount of ""hours"" you might be allowed to get paid for helping her could change. It's based off of their ability (how much they can/cannot do themselves) and what other support people they have.
Have her call her Medicaid caseworker and see what needs to be done to have her assigned an in-home aide.  Ohio does have expanded Medicaid so it should cover aides.  She will probably need to talk to her primary care doctor and explain what is going on and they put in the orders for an aide.  So the first steps would be calls to her caseworker and doctor(s).
Contact your county's agency on aging. A friend of mine, mid 30s, has her mother as a paid caretaker and that's where they started. Her mom needed CPR and first aid certification and took an online class for a couple weeks through a caretaker company.

,I'm worn out,"Not sure anyone can help me, but I'm about at the end of my rope.

A bit of background: My son is 30 and has autism and Klinefelter syndrome. Because of the Klinefelter's, he has an ongoing magnesium deficiency. He's on supplements, but any kind of stress can deplete his magnesium faster so he needs to take more. 

When his magnesium is low, he can't think straight. He becomes narcissistic, belittling, and apathetic towards anyone but himself, plus he hyperfocuses on one thing and rants nonstop about it (usually everyone is against him, etc).  He can't be talked to rationally at this point. 

The only cure for this is for him to take more magnesium. We have gummies, dissolvable powder, and capsules. Once he takes magnesium, he is usually back to himself in 1\`5-20 minutes. But when he's in that state, he refuses the magnesium because he says, ""Every time I have a problem, you try to push magnesium on me,"" and it has become sort of triggering for him. But when his magnesium is at a good level, he understands why he has to take it and usually takes it daily without reminder.

Before we figured out the magnesium deficiency, he was having daily rages since puberty. Today was the first one in a couple months since he has been taking the daily supplements. I think that's why it hit me hard - my defenses were down.

I don't think anyone can help with his magnesium deficiency, but how can we get him to take his magnesium when he's already low? He's currently living with me, and I don't think he'd be able to live alone without risk of losing an apartment with the screaming and ranting when he's deficient. His magnesium can be depleted by stress and even certain foods or carbonated water.

I just can't take the outbursts anymore. There's no physical violence, but the emotional trauma is wearing me down. When his magnesium is okay, he is an awesome, caring, kind person. 

It helped a bit just to get this out. Thanks for reading.","Honestly- I have very little advice for you, but you have my deepest empathy. I have a disabled brother but he’s relatively easy to give medications to.

I have told my brother before that he always felt better and that the medication was going to help him feel even better, but I’m sure you have tried many strategies.

Do you have access to community mental health support in your area? I know for me when I was caregiving to my brother over the course of 18 years (on and off, but most recently last year) I relied on them a lot - sometimes just to vent and other times for psychological support for me and my brother. We also had a psychologist come into our home to help with a behavior plan for my brother when it was really rough. 

I know autism is a completely different ball game as I have worked with individuals in the community in the past and a good friend of mine has a son who is quite high functioning, but when he is triggered it gets really intense. I also worked in a group home for several months last year and one of the three residents had autism and all were on different spectrums. My favorite guy regularly had many mood swings- and the only thing that I could do was sit and listen and be as compassionate as possible until he would take his meds (which he didn’t like). 

I know that living with this day in and day out is exhausting and I would reach out to a therapist or maybe even one that might see your son. There are good therapists out there who do make wonderful strides with individuals with different abilities.
And talking to one yourself might give you some peace - and maybe some ideas as well. 

My heart goes out to you, as a caregiver myself I know how disheartening the whole situation can be when there is no end in sight at the moment. For me just having a small support network of social workers from the community mental health system where I lived was so helpful especially when I was dealing with burnout.

,Agencies versus independent practice,"Hey there guys! I would like to hear your experiences and hopefully some advice. My mom is a certified HHA and has been working at several agencies through out the years but lately I’ve been thinking if it would be worth it for her to become an independent caregiver? 
I personally work at an agency for Behavior Therapy and I noticed it runs similarly to Homecare agencies for the elderly.  I realized that insurances actually pay a lot more than what agencies pay their caregivers so I wondered if it would be worth it for my mom to strike out on her own. 
I know there’s benefits and security working for an agency but she’s also not receiving half the pay she could be earning. Does anyone have any advice or experience they’d like to share about this? Thank you!","You will have to check with the rules/requirements in your area. BUT, it is NOT always easier to strike out on your own.

In my area, you are limited to people willing to private pay (which not a lot of people can), unless you're willing to go through the red tape and process of getting set up to accept Medicaid/Medicare. And there is a lot of paperwork. And then to get reimbursed for your services, you have to document a lot of things, the services you provided, etc...and submit it to Medicaid/Medicare...and being paid can take some time. On top of that, you have to carry a medical liability insurance policy incase anything should happen. On top of that, you would be considered an independent contractor/self employed...which means you will have to keep track of a lot of things, and file a business return with your tax return each year.

It may vary in your area...but MOST private insurance companies did not cover a self-employed independent aide/care giver, and would instead refer their customers to nursing agencies...mostly because of them having nurses to supervise the aides, manage patients care, track medical/billing, etc.

So unless it varies a ton in your area...the majority of your patients would be private pay, OR Medicaid/Medicare if you're willing to go through everything needed to register.",2022-02-25 21:07:46,small_town_legends,t1l4ld

,Pooping While Changing,So I had a question for any veteran caregivers.  There a resident at the assisted living facility where I work that I will change in the mornings and while I'm putting the new tabs on him he relieves himself again (and I'm talking about both ends). He is incontinent of course and this has happened to me a few times now. I'm wondering is there a trick to make sure everything is out before changing him? Should I roll him over a few times before starting or something?,"One thing, try rolling them around a bit and doing everything else you can before changing their attends. Sometimes the movement stimulates them to go. Also, if you just removed their warm blankets and then underwear, they might be cold and being stimulated by that. I have the issue with my Dad that if you try to roll him around before you have him use the urinal, he will pee in his attends. Not intentionally. He is usually continent...unless I could not get to him in time, or I had to roll him around a lot before him using the urinal. For this reason, he sleeps with no pants on, so we don't have to roll him before giving him the urinal.

Sometimes, there is no preventing it. I had a lady I took care of a few years back...that she could have just literally peed a bunch...and then will dribble more when you rolled her. For urine, at least, it's possible the bladder is not completely emptying, and rolling them puts enough pressure to release what was retained.

,Live-in caregiver employed by family. A little advice needed with how to guage and balance alone time and burn out,"I have been caring for my grandmother for the past year and a half (I am 35 and she is in her early nineties). Lately, I've been feeling just so sluggish and burnt out, and am growing restless/having trouble bringing myself to spend engaging quality time with her.

The issue that I'm having is that my grandma does not have any friends or hobbies, and despite my occasional efforts to get her out of the house, she is pretty much stationary in her little spot on the couch watching TV from morning until night. I need to initiate doing any kind of activity; she just doesn't do anything on her own, even though she is capable to do so.

She really doesn't like socializing with people her age and is judgemental or weirdly jealous of others. She's burned a few bridges with her neighbors over the years, and really seems to distance herself from other elderly people.

I stay in the house with her and can't really leave her alone for more than an hour without feeling guilty, becasue she needs help with everything except for the bathroom. 

I am usually bustling around her doing chores, and some days I can just meet her basic needs but end up escaping into my room, just scrolling on my phone, or sometimes just staring at the wall. But i think my patience has just been spent repeating myself over and over in conversations, and I am too distracted (my ADHD does not help) to sit still to watch tv with her for more than an hour. I can sense she's a bit lonely when I leave the living room to go do something else.

I'm not even sure what I'm asking, or if I just needed to vent. I reached out to a social worker recently to help with arranging for another care taker just to come in and entertain her for a bit, but I know this will be a bit difficult for her and I feel a bit awkward asking someone else to watch her while I abscond somewhere for a few hours.

So my questions are: how to approach this subject with her that I need another person to come in here and watch her becasue I'm feeling drained in general and bored of being stuck in the house all day? Also, for 24/7 caretakers that live in the home, how would you describe your hourly break down and how much alone time is appropriate? How much time do you spend in your rooms?","I dont know if this is the right answer, but I never told my grandma someone else was there because I needed a break.  I kept it vague (just need to run some errands; be back soon!.... totally sat in a coffee shop with some token groceries already in my car).

I cant really answer the second part. I had 2 toddlers so I have no answer for bedroom time.  But I can say if if you're that burnt talk to your respite for ideas. I had my grandma help cut things for meals.  I'd play Big Band and ask about meals her mom made.  Then I'd try to cook them and mostly fail but it was fun. I'd give her my laundry to fold so she felt useful (and wow did it help me). But get some outside advice and try it all.  One nurse suggested making playdoh and letting her play and knead it. I did thinking it'd be a flop and she loved it. 

Can you maybe knit while she watches her shows? Or just scroll your phone but still be near her?  I'd put on a CD of Jack Benny and sit with her until she was ready for bed.   But for sure get out and get some time for you.  It is mentally exhausting and if you can get a break you should.
You need to remind yourself that you can't be responsible for their emotional comfort 7/24 like their physical comfort.  You literally can't do it.  Let someone else come in and give you respite - Grandma might feel uncomfortable - you can't control that.  But you know that she is safe and being taken care of and that is enough, it's all you can do.  She might feel lonely sometimes, we all do, but you can't be her entertainment 7/24.  You can't sacrifice your emotional and mental health all day everyday to try and sustain hers constantly, it's impossible.  Because we love them and want to take care of their every need it's hard to separate what we can take care of and can't. She is human and like you she is going to be lonely, sad, in pain, bored, angry, uncomfortable, and you can't stop or control it so don't feel guilty like it's your fault when it happens.  It will pass.  Do what you can, remind yourself that she is being well taken care of, you are kind to her, and her emotions are out of your control.  Easier said than done I know, but just keep reminding yourself that you have to take care of yourself too ( mentally and emotionally) - it's not selfish, it's necessary.
I take care of my husband, and I struggle with the same thing.  He's a chair and tv guy.  He has dementia and is mobility impaired and incontinent.  I take care of his physical needs, keep him clean and fed, take him to appointments and do all the routine household stuff.  He would qualify for in home help, but there is no availability right now.  I don't sit with him.  I don't interact with him much outside of his care needs,  I can't do it.  We've been married over 50 years, but only occasionally do I see a flash of his ""real"" self.  Sometimes he hits me with this dead-eyed stare, which skeeves me out.  So I look at it like this: he's in his own home.  He's safe and cared for kindly.  If you were to try and hire for what I do, you would need at least three people.  So the best I can do is okay.  8 years in April, and I've had one weekend off, five years ago.  But you do what you have to do, and know that there are countless others doing the same.
This is a great time to get all the questions answered that you can. How did she meet your grandfather? (Watch her eyes go up when you ask that, and the lines of her face will soften.) Let her tell you every little thing she can remember. 

See if she can identify people in pictures. We all have boxes of family pictures that aren't labeled. 

Also, I agree with getting her to ""help"" with simple chores, such as folding socks. 

As for you, it's not only acceptable, but essential for you to take time to recharge yourself. You must. 

Find out what her funds/ insurance will cover in the way of ""sitters"" so she won't just be left alone. And please get specific recommendations there, because they vary widely. 

Now go take a nap.
I guess I’m lucky, my 13 yr old likes to be alone and tells me or the nurse to “go away” when she’s keeping to herself. But I had terrible guilt for about 3 years even when the nurses were here to help.  I felt like I should be spending every moment I could with her, despite burnout and compassion fatigue. I’m kind of over that now. I like my down time, and I’ll take it whenever I can, which is rare (we need help really badly). I don’t think of it as selfish, I think of it as refueling my own tank, so or speak.
Completely understandable and surprising you’ve done this for so long without a break! 
Is there another family member you can arrange to have come in twice a week for a few hours or someone else you trust to safely come at regular times for a small fee? If you have a solution set up before you speak with your grandmother it may be easier. Don’t feel guilty!

I don't really know, just offering my support.
I found a bro-bono social worker from a flyer at the public library. They will help you find the assistance that you need, and you might be suprised how many resources are available. The question is, what state do you live in, and what type of insurance do they have?

Medicare/medicaid.gov, AARP, and the senior care division on your local townships website can help. If you havent tried already, there are online resources like care.com that can help with the search of available caregivers in your area.

,Paid caregiving for family members?,Does anyone have experience becoming certified as a caregiver to get paid to take care of family? My aunt and uncle were hospitalized from covid and are going to need some at home care for the foreseeable future. I'm wondering if it's worth it for my cousin to certify so he can take care of them but also get paid. He does currently have a job he likes that pays $20/hour with healthcare benefits that he would need to leave to do this. Any experience as far as how reimbursement from insurance goes/pay? Advice? Words of caution? TIA!,"I would look into homecare first, as a good job with healthcare is not easy to replace.  Like everything else in elder care, benefits are going to vary widely by state.   This site has pertinent information.  Senior centers and home care agencies are also good sources of local information.  https://www.seniorlink.com/blog/how-to-become-a-paid-caregiver-for-a-family-member-6-steps-to-uncovering-financial-assistance-options-for-family-caregivers
It largely depends on your state as they set the rates. unlikely to get paid by Medicaid anywhere near $20 per hour with benefits though. https://www.payingforseniorcare.com/paid-caregiver/elderly-parents

Definitely look into getting him a Home-care Medicaid waiver and/or adult day programs first before quitting any career!!!!!!! 
https://www.payingforseniorcare.com/resources/locator_tool
I will echo what someone else said...it depends on your state. I am a nurse aide, licensed in my state. However, there are additional hoops you have to jump through if you want to be able to get paid by medicare/medicaid to do homecare for people.

I have not done so, but I know people who have...and sometimes there is a delay on receiving your payment. It's not like a job that has a set pay period...and one person I knew went over a month between the care she provided to someone and being reimbursed by medicaid for it.

Now, there is a ""slight"" work around. If you get your loved one accepted into a local nursing agency that provides the nurse aides/home health aides, you can work for that company and pick up the hours for your loved one. BUT, you would not be getting $20 an hour, and benefits vary from company to company. Also, with almost ALL of those companies, if you become POA for your person, you can no longer be paid through the company to take care of them.

Another thing you can look into is a program through Medicaid in your state. I know in my state it's called ""Passport"", but as long as they do not exceed the income limits, you can get paid some compensation for providing home care for your loved one.
Its lovely to look after ur relatives and also gets paid even not that much.",2022-01-11 23:12:51,Bohlieve52,s1wydh
,Help stop unwanted visitors in Assisted Living Memory Care,"I don’t post very often so I apologize for any formatting errors. 
My grandfather has dementia and is in a memory care facility. This floor doesn’t normally lock doors as the residents don’t always remember keys and such. However, he has a key and mostly locks his door with some exceptions of forgetting. Nurses and aides also try to lock the door with some exceptions of forgetting as well. 
There is one resident whom my grandfather really dislikes and it’s like his room has a magnet. She is always trying to get in. And when she does manage to roam in she doesn’t want to leave. He will yell at her to leave and she’ll head for the door just to turn around and wander back in. Her memory issues are more severe than my grandfathers. No matter what he does for yelling and pointing she doesn’t leave. 
Does anyone have any advice? What does other memory care facilities do to keep the wanderers at bay?","Please let the staff know this person is bothering him, so they know to look out for her specifically.  She may need more supervision in general.
You could try putting yellow tape on the floor across his doorway.  Sometimes dementia patients won't cross a perceived barrier.
Is his name on his door? Sometimes that helps. If she can see that it’s clearly someone else’s space that can help.",2022-01-11 17:14:07,tiffroy86,s1p7un
,How to Stop Removal of Depends at Night?,"I apologize if this has already been asked here...but I have scrolled and scrolled down the page until it wouldn't let me scroll any more, and did not find a similar post. I have also tried Googling it, but really did not find anything helpful.

At night, there are times my father will either rip his attends off completely, or manage to slide them way down his legs. And then if he has an accident, I have to also change the bed pad and a lot of times his shirt. He is usually pretty confused when he is doing this.

The closest to ""might be helpful"" I could find when trying to Google it was to use a one piece pajamas that zips in the back. The biggest issue with this is that I toilet my father using a urinal, and MOST times he is dry if you toilet him...however, if you roll him around much before you toilet him, he ends up peeing before you can get the attends down and urinal in place...so having to roll him to get the pajamas off and use the urinal would cause more incontinence and go through more attends. I tried looking for a version of the pajamas that had a way to toilet/place a urinal without having to roll him around (kind of like the ones you see with a butt flap...but for in the front), and could not find anything.

Any ideas or product suggestions? I really just need something that will prevent him from pulling the attends off...but be easily accessible for toileting by urinal at night...without having to roll him around a lot.

((Wanted to add...once he has peed in the urinal, it is ok to roll him around...whether to adjust him in the bed, put a bedpan in if he needs to have a bowel movement, etc. But if you roll him around too much before he pees, he will end up wetting the attends))","[deleted]
Continence issues are what send a lot of old folks to a facility.   For some things there just aren't good answers.
Is there something about the diapers that are bothering him? Some people have more neurological sensitivity (or whatever you want to call it) and are irritated by close-fitting things rubbing up against their skin at night. Speaking from personal experience, I can't go to sleep if my socks are on. 

Anyway, I am thinking maybe try switching up the sizes or brands of the diaper, if he keeps subconsciously getting uncomfortable and fussing with it. I know that the men's thermal pajama pants/underwear things (that you typically wear for camping in cold weather to add some layers), have an easy open pocket in the front for easy peeing.

I need to re-read your post again becasue I'm not too sure if the problem is the diaper itself, the unconsious pulling them off, or the pajamas that he's currently wearing. But these were my initial thoughts.
Maybe something like this? https://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/47356?productId=821716&attrValue_0=Red&sku=0DBJ740008&pla1=0&qs=3155275&gclid=CjwKCAiA1JGRBhBSEiwAxXblwYRBl1-1XJYn01xwp0O58xKw570s5eAXQ6Ma_zbg1SGH4d2vi7My3BoCXLkQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds",2022-01-11 14:33:34,GoddessLeeLu,s1ldxc
,Help Finding Activities (Programs),"I have been taking care of my father since June. From June-October, he really just needed limited assistance. However, he was hospitalized on October, ended up having two surgeries on his spine...and after a stay in a rehab facility (for PT, SP, and IV antibiotics), he has come home to me. He now needs around the clock care due to the sepsis/infection flipping a switch on severe cognitive decline. He now is diagnosed with moderate/severe dementia because of it.

I am working on making a weekly schedule of activities, so I can offer stimulating things for him to do. Kind of like how a nursing home has an activities schedule. I do already have some ideas...like reading time, puzzles, movie time, board/card games, various crafting, plants (during warmer part of the year), etc. My goal is to mentally stimulate him so it doesn't feel like all he does all day is sleep and watch tv.

However...I am trying to find online video church services for Sunday morning, and a daily online video bible study for him to attend. It needs to be something I can access from a tablet and set up/open for him, and then all he has to do is watch (he's not very tech savy). He is Presbyterian. I have tried a Google search, but have not found much. His current church does NOT have online streaming church services, but they are working on it. Most I have found has been a daily calendar of devotionals to read each day, throughout the day. I found a few Presbyterian churches that stream their Sunday service, but it almost felt like it was for the members in their area/congregation only. I would like something where it feels like it is not me running it, and feels like a real church thing.

Also, wondering if anyone has ideas for more ""hands off"" type of activities. I have plenty of activities I would be running/helping him with...but I really need some where I can set them up for him, and be able to let him do his thing...while I do something like dishes, laundry, etc.

Thank you for any advice and resources you can share. :)","You are such a caring and thoughtful caregiver, your father is very lucky to have you! 

I cant think of any helpful suggestions off the top of my head but it might help if you could give more details about his current level of functioning. For example how mobile is he? Do you have a wheelchair? And what kinds of things did he enjoy doing before? Do you have money to make things  easier or are you on a strict budget?.

Also is there a Presbyterian sub here on Reddit? Asking there might yield more knowledgeable response about the streaming services.
I am in the same boat!  It’s such a challenge finding things for them to do independently to give us a break.

For my mother who is mostly blind and not tech savvy either, audio books have been a life saver.  Through our state, there is a free Talking Book program through the public library to provide an easy to use player for low vision folks and people with disabilities. You make an account online and order audio book cartridges through the mail and send them back when they are done.  She is able to work this herself as the machine is simple, though she does not have dementia, so that may be an extra challenge.

Another idea is to download the Libby app and enter your local library card and you have access to thousands of books for free digitally. I set it up so Mom can listen to free audio books with an Amazon Echo. Now on this one, I have to start the book on my phone or iPad because voice controls are limited, but she can stop it whenever she wants. 

Mom used to think reading was a waste of time but at this point, she has listened to far more books than I have had time to read in a couple years and just loves it.  

Also having the Alexa in her room is so handy because she can ask it the time, the weather, or have it play a public radio station she likes, or even ask it to play music of all kinds. She loves big band music or quiet piano music before bed for example.  There are many possibilities with this technology but it took some patience and practice for her to understand how to ask Alexa to do things. 

So I sort of have the mental stimulation part handled, I just need to find more physical tasks for variety. During gardening season, I have her help process vegetables like shelling peas, or pulling leaves off parsley, that sort of thing.   This fall I gave her a huge bag of dry beans to shell and she would work on it everyday for a couple weeks as arthritis would allow. She enjoys having jobs to contribute. 

I plan to call my local Department of Aging to get further ideas and resources, I think my county has a yearly Spring Fling and invite people to learn about resources available.

Caregiving is not an easy road…I wish you the best of luck in finding some solutions! ❤️",2022-01-09 10:41:10,GoddessLeeLu,rzubil
,Caregiving support for elderly woman with intellectual disability,"My mom is the guardian for her older sister, my aunt. My aunt is elderly now, has lifelong intellectual disabilities, and is starting to have serious-enough physical problems (like mobility issues) that she might not be able to stay in her current living situation for much longer.

Can anyone point me to a Reddit community that could be a source of support for my mom? She has questions from the serious to the mundane, like how to pick a good cell phone for my aunt that can be totally locked down, or how to deal with doctors that don’t respond to my mom’s phone calls even though she’s the guardian.

Is this the right place? Is there anything for guardians of elderly people? I’m still relatively new to Reddit and not sure how to find niche communities.

Thanks for the help.","aging and long-term care in your area will be able to help. you might look into aarp for phone suggestions.
Try r/agingparents
Your local senior center can help you find resources.  Do a search for caregiver support groups in your area.   Eldercare varies widely from State to State, so local info is the most helpful.
r/caregiversupport r/agingparents r/eldercare

[The Arc](https://thearc.org/find-a-chapter/) has chapters in every US state and most city-metro areas. They are very helpful for navigating local/state-run social services and resources that your aunt may qualify for, also exploring disability/medicaid benefits and such. And they may run caregiver support groups where people share information. many of these are on group videos if you live far away.

Grandpads are great options for the cellphone issue. You have to pay for data, but they are totally close-source and if you mother buys it for your aunt she can make herself the “family admin” that way no one can contact her unless they are an approved contact. She can call whoever she wants, but if they return the call and aren’t an approved contact they get routed to GrandPad. It’s a great option for anyone who is hard of hearing, seeing, have cognitive impairment, etc. they get really loud and the screen is large. Their customer support team also answers calls 24/7 and their customer service team is based in the states.

One more thing. Does your aunt quality for Medicaid?
Is your sister getting developmental services ? Service coordinator or her worker has some resources or will find them , also depending on her age there are parent activity type groups to connect .It’s time for her to also consider what will happen , a group home , Shared living ? I put the S because it’s the future and it’s now and it can take years to find the right match so please consider starting asap even for a back up ( there are multiple agencies and the possibilities are endless yet hard to come by ) Search Disability support groups your state then there’s emails etc to get connected but it’s critical.

,How did you hurt your back?,"I'm hoping to share a laugh with fellow caregivers. It's one of those, it wasn't funny at the time, but it's funny when you think about it.

My husband, who has a prosthetic right leg was a bit out of it when I came home from shopping one day last month. He likes his vape (weed) and I figured he was just a bit more baked than usual. NBD. 

After a while, he tries to get up without his prosthetic leg on. (He sometimes takes it off in the living room.) I race to him in his TV chair and stop him. I go through the signs of stroke FAST Facial drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulties and Time., none of these are apparent. I asked him if he took an Ativan and he said yes. I decided it was likely mixing Ativan and weed. Throughout the evening he tries to get up without putting on his leg. I try to tell him to just sleep it off in the chair then when he can put on his leg, he can go to bed. 

Now, I am very fatigued and not thinking very clearly myself. I've been in chemo for almost a year and had a very long and busy day. I'm afraid to go to bed until he can because he might fall and he's 6'6"" and I'm 5'3"". There is no way I can help him up if he falls. 

So in my overtired and pissed off state, the last time he tried to get up, I had a full-blown foot-stomping, arms pumping, toddler-worthy temper tantrum. During this tantrum, my feet flew out from under me and I landed flat on my back. I hurt my back very badly. 

I knew I was no good to him anymore and he didn't seem to be sleeping it off, so I called the ambulance for him. It turns out he had a very small stroke. It was a real surprise. 

I ended up in emergency myself a few hours later, I guess the adrenaline wore off and even 3 extra-strength Tylenol couldn't touch the pain, I knew I'd really hurt my back. Emergency gave me morphine. I had a pinched nerve. The next day my sister picked me up from the hospital and asked what happened. I just had to laugh relaying the story that I because in my frustration with my husband, while extremely fatigued, I'd had a full-on toddler tantrum and fell on my ass (and back). 

BTW Hubby was in the hospital a few days. He has no deficits from the minor stroke.","Not me, but a coworker -

She was trying to stand a girl up, heavier girl but nothing crazy, but Christina was bent over, arms extended, trying to help pull, and she pulled, for lack of a better term, a butt muscle.

Well, she knew she hadn't been doing the assist correctly, and didn't mention it to supervisors, thinking she'd be fine. 

After a week of butt and lower back pain, she accepted the fact that it wasn't going to get better, but didn't want to get in trouble for not reporting it. 

So I vouched for her with this slightly altered version of the story, which had supposedly ""just happened"" and she went to the doc, covered by workers comp, all that. 

A couple days later she started feeling guilty and told our boss the real story! 

Thanks, chick. You inadvertently confessed for me, as well! 

Lol nothing came of it, supervisor didn't care, but still. Annoyed me! I hope her butt still hurts when she stretches.",2021-12-24 15:59:22,i_say_zed,rnurdj
,How do you navigate having young children and caregiving?,"My fiance and I are part time caregivers for his brother but will be full time at some point. We don't have kids yet but want 1.

I think the big key will be how long his brother can go without care. If you can set him up for hours, you’d just need a normal babysitter and to get back before the brother needs help.",2021-12-23 18:36:59,EmotionalMycologist9,rn8iyz
,Tips for smaller caregivers?,"Update: the client this was in regard to actually passed away but I learned quite a few things to help me with future clients so thank you! 

So I’m pretty new to being a caregiver and I work in their homes. 
My question is does anyone have any tips for things like transfers and all that for people who are on the shorter side?

I’m 5’1” and all of my clients are larger than me and admittedly, I do not have that much upper strength. So I’m just trying to find easier and safer methods when doing these things.","Do you know how to use a gait belt? What kind of transfer specifically are you looking for info on? If you could tell me a bit about the person you’re looking to transfer I may be able to help. Is he weight bearing at all? Are you going from a wheelchair to a shower bench? Are you using any kind of lift? 

Also, body mechanics has a lot to do with it along with assistive devices.
Sorry to resurrect an older post...but wanted to add my input as someone who has worked as a nurse aide for a bit over 20 years, and now take care of my father at home.

The transfer...type, how to, etc...will depend a BIG part on the capabilities of the person you are transferring.

The BIGGEST question in that regards is...can your person bear weight on their legs? In not, then you have 3 options. 1st option, do they have good arm strength? If yes, then you could try a slide board transfer. If not, then you are limited to needing a 2nd person to help you transfer OR a mechanical hoyer lift.

If able to do a slide board transfer, here is a Youtube video on how to safely do so...  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZ6xeS\_GjSk&ab\_channel=CraigHospital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZ6xeS_GjSk&ab_channel=CraigHospital) 

Now, if your person can bear weight on their legs, your options will depend on whether or not they can also walk (strength and balance). If they can bear weight and walk, best bet is a gait belt to give assistance (I like to call it a ""boost"") when they stand up and hold onto while walking, and use a walker to assist them with the walking. If they cannot walk, your best bet is to do a pivot transfer, and still use a gait belt to help lift and have something to hold onto.

Because it is easier to ""watch and learn"" a pivot transfer, vs trying to explain it in text...here is a Youtube video showing how to properly and safely pivot transfer someone.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZAYejxPl5Q&ab\_channel=JoeMartinALSFoundation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZAYejxPl5Q&ab_channel=JoeMartinALSFoundation)

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. :)

,meal ideas for elderly?,I just started a job as a caregiver and I’m 21 but honestly not that good of a cook besides chicken nuggets and noodles (still on the college diet) whats some good go tos to make?,"- Baking boneless-skinless chicken thighs in the oven is great, healthy and delicious - just take off the big sections of fat on the top of most cuts. And unlike chicken breasts, it’s a million times more forgiving at over-cooking, whereas a chick breast is so easy to cook terribly. Just coat the thigh with a little extra virgin olive oil, a touch of salt, a little paprika on the top for a beautiful color when cooked, and that’s it. Lots of ways to cook - but I do mine at about 390-400 degrees for about 23-24 minutes. Chicken should be cooked until at least 165 degrees, so just use a thermometer and stick it in the middle somewhere, but I always end up exceeding this at these times and temps - and it’s still tender and delicious. Couple this with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli (8-9 minutes, or until a little tender) and your good. Super easy and super healthy - unless of course you have an extremely picky eater who doesn’t like healthy food. With the mashed potatoes, for two people, you should only need 2 potatoes MAX - and you can spice it up by putting some graded Parmesan cheese in with the butter, touch of salt, and a little milk when mashing - 1/4 cup of parm is PLENTY (can certainly do a little less/more if you want). I love mashed red/Golden potatoes, I do think russets work better for a whip (and with bringing out the flavor of the parm). With red potatoes, you can leave the skins on with your mash - which is always great, IMO - my mother hates it though. You can also substitute one of the potatoes for 1-2 parsnips (peeled) - for a slight added sweetness in flavor - same cooking time as the potatoes (you can’t whip them as easily, but mashed is good). This is great, because you can really reduce the salt significantly,  because of the added flavor of the parsnips (IMO). And for a nice touch, cut a wedge of lemon. Goes great when squeezed over the broccoli (especially for people not in love with broccoli) AND even better on the potatoes (don’t mix the lemon juice in with the mash, it’s better when squeezed on top) - and bonus is the added nutrients of the freshly squeezed lemon juice!

- You can also make a salad, using baked chicken thighs. Bake the chicken as you’re preparing the salad - and make your own balsamic vinegrette dressing (healthiest dressing, IMO, and perfect in general - and always impressive), it’s super easy. In a small-medium sized jar, add 1 cup of extra virgin olive oil, 1/2 cup of balsamic vinegrette, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1 tbl of Italian seasoning (or tsp oregano, tsp thyme, and/or tsp rosemary - whatever is available ), 1/2-1 tsp of garlic powder, 1 tablespoon of Dijon mustard, and 1-1.5 tablespoon of honey - then shake the sht out of it to mix. It’s GREAT. With the salad, you can even add grapes (cut in half) OR dried cranberries to the top, and then maybe even add low-sodium bacon pieces as well (not the crunchy ones in the plastic container, but the softer pieces in a bag sold next to the jar - big difference) - this is really great! And if you really want to make a bang with the salad, add a little crumbled goat cheese to it - adds such a rich smoothness to the salad (better then feta, IMO). All this will make a salad seem like a treat - especially if you spent the extra 5 minutes to make your own dressing. **if the person doesn’t like carrots (get shredded in a bag, btw), take the shreds out and chop them into small pieces (it’s good vitamins, and it shouldn’t bother them)…same for onions, if they don’t like (red) onions, shave your slices paper thin, and then chop them into small pieces (so much less strong tasting when eating). If they don’t like tomatoes, cut into 8 wedges, remove the insides, and then slice into small pieces. My mother didn’t like carrots, onions, or tomatoes in her salad, and if she made her own, she’d never include them, but she likes mine! So, IF they’re picky, don’t even ask what they want in it…make it this way if you know they’re picky, and then find out what they’d like changed for the next time, AFTER they’ve tried it. If you add a little bacon, a little cheese, and a fruit, this should mask ANYTHING they may not otherwise “like”. You can also make a strawberry salad to mix things up lettuce, strawberries, red onions, crumbled goat cheese, and chicken OR walnut pieces - with the balsamic vinegrette) - nothing more, nothing less - these are always great - and makes a simple salad extra special, IMO.

- Basic pasta with sauce is also an easy thing to do when you don’t have much time. To add an extra vegetable, you can even steam green beans (cut the tips) and cut the beans in half, or zucchini/yellow squash also can go with pasta. When done, a touch of butter and a touch of salt can go a LONG way if they aren’t already huge fans of vegetables. You can also roast asparagus if it looks good and fresh in the grocery store (personally, my mother only likes thin stalks of asparagus, not a medium-thick stalk). Coat with a little extra virgin olive oil and bake for 10-12 minutes at about 400degrees. It’s also okay to overcook these a little, because even if they get a shriveled and “ugly”, they are still very tasty! So, it’s almost impossible to ruin them when roasted. 

- on an off night, make a half a deli sandwich (or 2/3 if a bigger eater) - Turkey or roast beef since those, IMO, go best with tomato, lettuce, and onions. Again, if they don’t prefer these vegetables, you can slice them EXTREMELY thin. Of course, if they detest one of these, then you’ll have to forgo it. Add Italian seasoning to any sandwich (can add liberally) for great added taste. You can even use your balsamic vinegrette as a condiment, and it’s great (or, if they like Mayo - a thin layer of Mayo, and then a little bit of balsamic dressing is incredible)! Don’t add cheese slices, but can sprinkle on a little grated Parmesan cheese. Now, if your going to just do a half a sandwich, which I recommend since cold cuts are high in sodium (so don’t over stuff the sandwiches), you should prepare 3 small sides on the plate for maximum variety  - and it makes the whole thing seem like such a big meal that has a lot of thought behind it (and is on the healthy side). Here are some side options: (1) a string of grapes (2) cucumber salad - just cut up some cucumbers, cut the slices in half, use a very small amount of your balsamic vinegrette, just to coat, add a touch of salt and pepper and parm cheese (see a theme of reusing basic, staple ingredients) and that’s it - it’s great, (3) cottage cheese with diced peaches on top (you can buy prepacked peaches in those plastic cups - use enough to liberally top your 1-2 tablespoons of cottage cheese, - this makes the cottage cheese AMAZING and a total treat, (4) roasted asparagus (see above), and/or (5) a small handful of kettle chips - you shouldn’t need many at all since you’ll have the 1/2 sandwich and 2 other sides. Do this, and this makes a “stupid sandwich” into what feels like an actual meal, where your low-er effort actually feels like so much more. And, IMO, it’s a fun thing to make, serve, and eat. That, and you’ve taken something not typically that “healthy” and actually got in a decent amount of fruits/vegetables and vitamins. Again, I do it this way, because I don’t want to overload my mom with the sodium from cold cuts - so this really takes that down a lot. —- also, instead of a deli sandwich, you can also do a grilled cheese - BUT if you’re going to do this, make it special and make it adult! Add a thin layer of strawberry or raspberry jam to the sandwich - it is transformative. If they like pickles, you can then add pickles another time instead of the jam- also incredible. And if they’re open, add whatever you want, and you can even call it a “melt” - which it’s really just a grilled cheese with an extra ingredient. Now, what I do is cut the sandwich 2/3  - 1/3. I eat the 1/3, and then I cut the 2/3 in half, for almost “sticks”. With the sides, it’s totally fine. Also, make sure to use heart healthy tomato soup (30% less sodium). Great for dunking the sticks - and don’t forget the oyster crackers. I open a full cam since it’s cheap, but probably only serve her such a small bowl of it, since there’s so much more to eat with the plate. 

These are some very easy things to do that, in my opinion, are very healthy and easy to rotate.
Fan of chicken nuggets I am.  Herh herh herh.
I am in the exact same boat as you. One little trick I do, is getting a bunch of TV dinners on sale, presenting them nicely on a plate and beefing them up a bit with fresh things that are lying around to give it some extra umph with a lot less work and planning.

After experiencing some severe burn out this winter, I recently caved and signed up for a pre-made meal delivery service called Freshly. There are some other apps and services that do this as well for a weekly or monthly fee. Usually you can find promo-codes or get the first week half-off or something similar.

And there's always meals on wheels!

You can get breakfast too, and it's a lot, and imo better than the main meals.

,Need help regarding my Aunt,"First let me start by saying I **do not** need financial help and I am not asking for it. My father and I no longer know what to do and after looking and calling around for resources, we find it near impossible to get any good info. 

My Aunt has and is diagnosed with severe agoraphobia. She's in her late 50's. It's so bad that she has not worked or left her home since she was 19. Honestly, if I dropped her off around the corner, she wouldn't have a single clue as to where she is (I wouldn't do that obviously). She collects SSI due to her condition. Here's where it gets life threatening... Her foot had a small little bunyon like crack in it a few months back. She didn't tell us anything about it and she spend all day in her room so it's not like we could tell something was wrong. She finally told us about it when it became clearly infected. We took her to the ER, they gave her antibiotics and sent her home. Fast forward a couple of weeks and her foot became even worse. We took her back to the ER where she ended up freaking out and leaving. My father and I talked her into going back in. (We aren't allowed in due to COVID). They said it's not life threatening but it appears she's having vascular issues and that Wellspace will be calling us. They have not called us. We called them mutliple times and have received no answer or a call back. Now her foot is clearly rotting off (It's turned black and looks absolutely horrendous). I honestly think she's about to lose her foot. We want to take her back to the ER but she is refusing to go. We can no longer care for her and we do not have any legal rights over her healthcare. Long story short on that, my grandmother passed away about 5 years ago and we just took my Aunt in. She obviously needs to be in a facility and looked after indefinitely. We love her and just want the best for her but we can't provide for her any longer due to our own situations. We don't have funds to pay for a caregiver or a facility. There has to be something out there where she can be taken to ASAP. I'm looking for any advice on resources or experiences in this same type of situation. We live in Roseville, CA.","If she has no resources of her own, the state of CA may be able to pay for a care home.  However, would she be willing to move?  I would start by calling state social services.  They should know what kind of services she is eligible for...
Call an ambulance.  They may not be able to transport her if she refuses, but it's worth a shot.  At least they may be able to convince her how serious it is.  Maybe you could kind of blanket-fort her on the gurney so she can't see the outside?  Or cover her eyes with a scarf?  If she is her own legal agent and she refuses to go, I don't know what else you can do...except have her declared incompetent and get power of attorney.  On a self-protective note, keep records of all your attempts to get her to aid.
Have you applied for a Medicaid waiver? Also, her PCP may be able to write a script for home health care. Not the same as non-medical home care. Home health care is covered under health insurance. If her foot needs medical attention an NP may be able to treat it from home.",2021-11-23 13:56:13,just_deuced,r0kc0v

,Groundhog Day,"I’m mentally and physically exhausted

I’m my husband’s caregiver. He’s partially paralyzed, brain damage from at least 4 strokes over a course of 4 years. He’s also blind because of the strokes. He’s morbidly obese, type 2 diabetic and sleep apnea.  His apnea was the cause of his strokes.  

Last year my husband spent in total 3 months in the hospital.  Two of those months the entire country of Italy (where we live) was in lockdown because of fucking COVID.  He was in a hospital an hour and a half away. I wasn’t able to visit him for obvious reasons. Because of his vision loss and the state of his brain after his strokes, my husband had difficulties using his smart phone.  I don’t know how many times he locked his phone up. Also, this hospital was very close to the Italy/Switzerland border and only one phone carrier (and of course not ours) worked there. So communicating was a tragedy. Two weeks, new SIM card, new phone and a care package from home we were able to communicate again.  My husband started coming out of his dark place.  

His father is 95 and is in frail health.  Every day he is on this earth is a blessing.  He lives about a mile and a half from us, along with his live-in caregiver.  I manage his finances, caregiver, doctor appointments etc.

We’ve had problems with my father-in-law’s caregivers.  We had to fire one for not filling necessary prescriptions.  My mother-in-law last year was in and out of the hospital a few times because of urinating blood. One kidney was dead.  My mother-in-law passed away December 28, 2020.  Car problems that left us carless.  

I have my fair share of health problems.  For years I put off going to the doctor about suspected sleep apnea.  About 10 days before lockdown, after falling asleep in my FIL’s pulmonologist’s office, she gave me a referral to a specialist.  Went in, scheduled a sleep study for June. Then lockdown. FINALLY had that this March. I am overweight and type 2 diabetic.  

I’m tired, mentally and physically.  I’m becoming more and more forgetful. My house is a disaster.  I feel like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day.  I will be 50 in December, my husband is 57.  I worry when his time comes what I will do.  I won’t move back to the States, considering my health issues and have no family.  I have nothing there.  We rent our apartment here in Italy and other that his dad and cousins, my husband has no other family members here.  I worry about money, I worry about a place to live.  I worry what “life” holds and will hold for me.  I am sorry to sound like I am thinking about only myself, but I have been thinking about everyone else except myself for so long.  

I am sorry for the long, confusing, jumbled story, but I just needed to get this out and to people who could possibly empathize.  Thank you for taking the time to read this.",,2021-11-09 17:31:02,Conscious_Bear2787,qqf4cd
,So burnt out. Frigging COVID.,"A bit of background, my wife of 11 years was diagnosed with a chronic issue that prohibits her from doing 70% of what she used to including parenting. My daughter has ADHD but is medicated (honestly, she's the easiest part of my day), and my son is a high functioning autist but often gets frustrated and when he gets frustrated, he 'hulks out' complete with punching holes in walls, throwing heavy objects (laptop, tablet, etc.), and just screaming about how much he hates us.

All of this was manageable for the most part before COVID hit but after the last 2 years (we have been quarantined since late 2019 due to all of them also being in high risk categories), I've been trying to help everybody with school/home/life and I'm just completely burnt out and run down. My kids have gotten to the point where they just hate the situation and make it my problem every blessed day. My wife took the kids to her parents house over the weekend which was supposed to help them and me but it just strung all of them out even more, and I have to deal with it. Kinda went the other way there but oh well. 

At this point, I feel like all I do is lurch wildly from extremes in attitude to crippling depression and back again. I cry almost every day and I don't know how much longer I will be able to put up with this. 

If you read this far, thank you. It is a weight off my chest to vent all of this and I hope that things will turn around soon.","Hang in there. You're doing the best you can. No advice, no words of wisdom, but I just wanted to give a shout out n wish you well
You need help to do all this. Anyone else in the family? IDK where you are, but with vaccinations and masks, could someone come do things with your kids? Or clean your house? Cook food ahead for you? 

You're in an extended state of emergency, and you're reacting in a normal way.
Every caregiver struggles, but you have more on your plate than most.  There aren't even homecare workers available to help out, and no matter how much you do, there's always more.  Hopefully with kid's vaccines available you'll be able to get your kids back to school, which I'm sure will help a lot.  My experience has been that things look bleakest right before they ease up some, and that has helped me endure.  

The care you give is literally priceless.  No amount of money will buy the kind of care given by family in one's own home.  All of us who give up our own lives to focus on caring for the people we love are united by an invisible solidarity.  We take courage from each other.  In the most difficult times, we know we have sisters and brothers struggling like we are.  I am thinking of you today, and wishing you and your family well.  You have hidden depths that will carry you through this.
No advice, but wishing you well. Stay strong!
Hugs from an internet stranger.
Big hugs for you and your entire family.
Sending positive vibes your way. When I get too burned out I try to get away for a day. Dunno if there is anyone you trust who could stand in for you for the day, but doing something for yourself like going for a drive away from the ruckus of the house and routine would be... well, it helps me. Good luck to you, friend, may you find that extra something special you can do just for you as a treat/escape.",2021-11-09 11:59:13,Bigpapawolfie,qq81bw
,Mom died,"I want to celebrate each of you who are caring for a loved one. It’s HARD. There’s something you are uniquely experiencing. I feel for all  of you. HANG IN THERE!

Mom finally let go Oct 14 4:15am holding my hand. I thought I was ready, I wasn’t ready to see her go, I was ready for the suffering to end, her pain, and me observing her pain.

I wasn’t ready for the way the body so quickly decays. Blisters, mottled skin, foaming from the mouth. I wasn’t ready to see that. It was traumatizing for awhile. Mostly because I was trying so hard to help keep her comfortable, I couldn’t.

The caregiver tasks are hard. It’s equally hard to see the death. 

I’m saying this to help anyone reading this to get ready. Ask questions of your medical staff. Read “ the needs of the dying by David Kessler. Prepare yourself.

I can’t be fully prepared in every situation I’m sure, but it might help you in your experience.

My deep compassion for ALL if you caring for a loved one. You are seen. You will get through this.","Bless you for being there with her and for her.

,Caregiver resource Center suggestions needed,"I'm a caregiver to my two kids with a serious mental illness and a Community Health Worker. I am partnering with a nationwide organization that creates Caregiver Resource Centers to start one in my area.

Ours will be Community Based vs Hospital based, so it's a different type of model.

,Devices/tools for caring for newly disabled senior dad,"Hello everyone,
My dad who was very active suddenly had lung issues and needed to be intubated and in a coma for months
The result of this is that he is totally disabled now, he cannot move any part of his body productively (he can lift his legs for a few seconds but that's it)
The hospital gave up on him improving with physiotherapy and are discharging him.
He will go back to his apartment and live with my mom (who's senior as well)
Can you guide me to the best tools that make caregiving for a completely immobile person easier?
Things for turning, hygiene, transfer to wheelchair, etc?
I want both of them to be comfortable as this is obviously an extreme adjustment","The social worker at the hospital should help you with this.  Otherwise, your nearest senior center should have all the info you need.  Do a search for home care and ask to speak to an intake person.  Depending on where you live, there are definitely resources.
You could also try r/caregiversupport
Get the gait belt (helps secure your dad as he transfers).

 Google home or Alexa to turn on/off lights (also serves as a secondary calling device). Get a wifi camera for your peace of mind

Home health aids (guy who can help with showers) and PTs are free with Rx and Medicare / insurance

Wheelchair ramps on home Depot's website

Good luck, I did this with my mom during home hospice. It was challenging but we made it ok.
Following this post …  the same this just happened to my mom (almost exactly) and they’re going to discharge her next week and I have no idea how my dad and I are going to care for her.
Try getting in touch with an occupational therapist, they should be able to assess your dads ability at the hospital and visit your home to make specific suggestions for what you will need. At least get you started on the right track.",2021-10-29 10:22:28,VroomVroom_Bitch,qidy1e
,VSED experiences : A legal end of life decision,"I would like to hear experiences you may have had with VSED, the voluntary stopping of eating and drinking, which is the only legal choice in many states for competent people who wish to bring forward the ends of their lives.    


Have you or your loved one considered it?  What influenced the decision, either way?  Is it something you would consider for yourself if you're in a position where your life is complete and your life is a burden?  Is there anything else you'd tell a patient or caregiver who is considering this?  The patient in question is in terrible pain, and increasing disability.    


Would it be easier to help a stranger get through this \~10 day experience than to go through it with a loved one?    


Thank you for any thoughts you might have for me.","It's definitely something I would consider for myself.  As a caregiver, you follow the wishes of your patient/client/relative unless it will cause them significant harm.  However, if they voluntarily quit eating, tube or force feeding them would cause more harm imo.  Would it be easier to go through this with a stranger?  You wouldn't be as attached, but keeping vigil with a loved one would be more rewarding.  It's the last thing you can ever do for them.",2021-10-28 22:03:46,InAHundredYears,qi26ie
,It’s been rough (rant),"Gran’s been letting all her frustrations out on me these last few weeks, and I can feel it wearing me down. Last night she started berating me through the closed door at 11pm. Then she burst in at 3am to talk about appointments - turns out she misread her alarm clock and thought it was 9am. Then this morning the first thing she says to me is not to tell the family about the 3am debacle because she’s embarrassed and doesn’t want to be judged/ the laughing stock. Nobody’s laughing. but I don’t react well when people tell me not to talk about something that’s affecting me. Even if I don’t tell my mom and uncle. 
Today I’m so tired and just feeling depressed and drained. I have a bunch of college deadlines and it’s hard to juggle. I don’t know how y’all do it. I’m in awe of other caregivers who devote their lives to their loved ones and somehow manage it all. 
Gran just hugged me and told me I’m not allowed to have a rough day. We have to get through it together. I told her to let me have my emotions and that not every day is going to be a good day. Sometimes we just need to let ourselves be low energy. She understands but doesn’t want me to be low energy. 
I’m tired. I feel isolated and overwhelmed and stressed and I don’t want to tell her because it’ll just make her feel worse. Hopefully the insurance comes through soon and she can go to an inpatient rehab clinic. I need a break.","Of course you're entitled to feel down and overwhelmed.  We all do, sometimes.  This may sound corny, but when I run out of patience I turn away, take two deep breaths, and consciously let go of the frustration.  It's like a little mental cleanup.  A two second reminder that I know why I chose to do this and that the alternatives haven't changed.  It's annoying to suck it up and go on, but a little shrug and an ironic smile and I'm back.
Your first obligation is to yourself, to making as sure as you can that you can take care of yourself when you're older.  Those deadlines, your studies, your social life in the next decade or so--these are your wealth when you are older.    


You are not supposed to be a caregiver at this time of your life.  You're not equipped with the life experience or the training.  Those other caregivers you are in awe of--they are doing it at the expense of other choices because they too only get so many hours a day, and have to spend a third of THOSE sleeping.  


I am a disabled person whose caregiver is not handling anything well, and he's a fully fledged official grownup who has had the opportunity to make his choices in life.  Actually he just flew to pieces because I asked if he made an appointment.  I'm becoming afraid of him.  I KNOW this issue from both sides because at times in our life he's been the one who needed caregiving (after major surgery) and I did that.    


When they ask you to take care of your gran, they are really asking you to trade your future well-being for hers now.  Ask yourself if this is really the best choice for anybody involved.  If you hadn't been born they'd have had to figure something else out, right?  It's time to figure out what your boundaries need to be, how much you can be there for your grandmother as you move into the college phase of your life.  Set those boundaries and then insist upon them.  It isn't a negotiation--it's a decision only you can make.  One more thing, there will be times when emergencies happen.  Have that in mind too.  My mother got terribly ill while visiting me and I had to ask for extra help because I wasn't enough.  Being willing to do that may have been important to her recovery because if I had tried to do it at all just then it would have been disasterous.",2021-10-28 06:01:12,EulenFrost,qhjlgm
,What do you do for yourself?,"When you need a moment or a day or a week, what do you do? Do you take a bath? Separate yourself completely from the person you're caring for? Take a vacation away?

I've tried painting and crocheting and it helps quite a bit most days.","I am sole caregiver for my husband, who has cognitive and mobility issues.  I look at it like my job.  I get him out of bed, cleaned and dressed, check his blood sugar, give him his meds, help him to his chair, and reverse the process at night. I take him to the toilet.  I do the food shopping, the cooking, the laundry and the general cleaning.  I take him to a day program with PT and health monitoring twice a week.  I take him to doctor's appointments.  I can handle all that.  What I can't handle is sitting and making conversation with him, or entertaining him in general.  So, I don't do that.  He's a tv guy, and will really flip through those channels. Aside from the time necessary to accomplish the routine chores, I stay in the other side of the house and play with my toys.  Currently I'm painting in watercolor, but sometimes I crochet, do beadwork, or grow a few flowers and a tomato or so, seasonally.  I've had one weekend off in seven years, but tbf I could have respite time if I was willing to put him in an assisted living facility while I was off.  He would hate that, and I would just feel guilty, so not an option for me.  I take him and go to visit our daughter, who lives in a nice resort town, about four times a year, and that helps.
I try to fit in as much light entertainment in to the day as possible. Funny podcasts and funny or scary action movies. Nothing dramatic and it helps to keep me company, to distract me and entertains me. I feel guilty ike I should be doing something more academic and enriching but I also need to survive each day with out falling into a depression.

,Any tips for family with memory loss?,"My SO's brother has short-term memory loss, so it's very difficult for him to remember things he's just done. Sometimes he can remember everything they just said on TV, but he won't remember what he ate 5 minutes ago. I've noticed that when he brushes his teeth, showers, etc., he does so for a very long period of time (about 4x longer than average). I think it's because he forgets that he has already washed off or how long he's been doing a task. Is there a way to help him with this? I thought about using a timer for certain things but I didn't know if that seemed cruel. He does some things as though he has Autism or OCD (he doesn't do well with change and when he's done brushing his teeth, he does a specific tapping pattern on the sink each time). I don't want to limit him in any way that adds to his existing limitations, but I also can't have the water running for hours each day and don't want him to continue being wasteful. I feel bad for even saying that but no one helps my SO and I when his brother is here. I'm sure I would feel a little differently if his brother paid for anything (he doesn't offer to pay for his food when here, doesn't help pay gas/tolls to pick him up or take him home, etc.). I don't want it to seem like it's all about money, but we're trying to save up to buy a house and have a wedding too.","My SO has memory loss also. The only thing I am able to do is just stay calm and answer her questions in a calm and caring way. If her questions become to repetitive I'll refer her to her notes that I have written or she has written down. The notes can actually be followed with more questions but not always. I always try and keep snacks around because she doesn't always remember she has eaten. I'll try and work with her memory questioning her about a TV show we are watching. I also try and get her to do word puzzles. I've only been her caregiver for about four months so I'm still learning. Thank God for this subreddit and the members stories and advice otherwise I don't know what I would do. Hope this helps. God Bless. Reach out if you like. Take care.

My fiance and I help care for his brother (he's here about 50% of the time, needs help with meds, STML, doesn't do much for himself, danger to himself and property if left alone). My fiance works 24 hour shifts so when his brother is here, I'm with him by myself for days. I get it - that's life and I can't expect him to take 2 weeks off a month to take care of his brother. When he's not working, he's with him. But...my fiance also has an injury that I help him with (try to find new meds, DME, massages, etc.) So I'm basically doing it all for 2 people now. Today, I had a terrible headache and my fiance just said ""take some medicine"". I know he's had a rough day and is in pain (back injury) but I really needed a different person to come out of his mouth because that didn't make me feel cared for in the least.

No one asked their dad to leave 20 years ago and for their mom to pass at such a young age. We were just thrown to the wolves.

,Parent wants to name me caregiver of my disabled brother in will - questions/advice,"Hi there, my older brother is developmentally disabled and has some serious medical conditions. I love him so much, but I am 23 and do not feel comfortable with the idea of becoming his caregiver in the event of our parents’ death (maybe this will change but I don’t know yet). 

Since I was 16 years old my mom would ask to put me in the will as his assigned caregiver, and it’s always caused me a lot of stress. My oldest brother agreed to take on the role, but she wants to change it to me because she thinks I understand and could care for him better. On the phone today she basically asserted that it’s her will and she can put whatever she wants in it. I have a few questions and thoughts about this.

1. Is it legal for her to assign me that role in her will if I don’t consent? If she did without my knowing, what do I do?

2. Are their ethical caregiving options that are not family members and don’t cost a fortune? 

She’s always painted the picture that if he doesn’t stay with one of us he will get abused or neglected in an adult care center, so I have a lot of fear about that. I love my brother, but I don’t think I want to take on the role of caregiver/guardian. 

3. Does anyone have a similar situation? I don’t mean to rant, but I have alot of fear and a lot of guilt around this, and I don’t know anyone who has been through something similar and can give me guidance - thanks in advance for your thoughts and support","She can name you as a follow up guardian, but that isn’t legally binding.  It’s the same as with children.  Parents can name a person of their choice, but there are investigations into that person and their life to make sure the children or disabled adult will be safe in their care.  You have to see a probate court judge.  Your brother would likely be assigned a guardian ad litem.

That said, if you can’t or don’t want to care for him be up front now.  Really think about what you’re willing to do.  I’m the stand by guardian (if  our mom if unavailable or dies I’m the legal guardian but we set it up that way and I agreed, signed the paperwork and appeared before the judge to swear to it) and primary caregiver for my sister.  It’s literally my job.  I love my sister but it’s hard.  I’m so burned out I’m starting to lose it.  But there’s no one else.  She can’t be in a facility, she needs 1:1 care 24/7.

Would you be willing to be his guardian if he were in a group home?  That’s hard too, won’t lie.  But you wouldn’t be doing the day to day care.  If you are, you and your parents should start looking for a suitable, reputable program for him.  The best programs have long waiting lists.

I’m not judging, it’s a terrible, hard situation for everyone.  It’s hard for your parents to consider him not being cared for by family, it’s hard for you to consider potentially sacrificing your future (and that’s what it can be as a full time caregiver to anyone, your sibling, your child, your parent, another relative).  Don’t be guilted into if you think you can’t do it.  There are some AMAZING programs where the residents really thrive.  But for those he needs to get on the list now.  It’s absolutely okay for you to say I can’t do full time day to day care.  That doesn’t make you a bad person.  It makes you honest.  I wouldn’t wish my life on anyone.  It’s so isolating, stressful, and lonely.  I’m alone with my nonverbal sister almost all the time.  I get two hours away on Wednesday (gives me to drive to and from and take a Pilates class) and 4-8 hours on Saturdays (Pilates, errands, and helping my aunt with things).  I get no real time off, no sick days, nothing.  It’s having an autistic medically fragile seizure having toddler forever.
If you're in the U.S., the Fourteenth Amendment has you covered.  She can name you in the will all she wants, but she can't make you do anything for your brother.  Absolutely nothing she could do forces that role on you, especially since you're over 18 and can go anywhere you want, subject to Covid and financial considerations....

Many of us have situations like yours.  Most of us realize that a disabled child's siblings shouldn't be asked to give up their lives for caregiving.  You need to be preparing to earn money to save for your own needs.  I didn't earn enough social security quarters because I was a caregiver, and now I'm 50+ and disabled myself, it's really a big deal.  I didn't have a career.  So I get to be an impoverished disabled senior, and I'm far less use to those I love who need me now.

Caregivers get little to no support from our society.  That's why they burn out.  In most places, there is no alternative for affordable care by qualified non-family.

You'd probably get next to no help from your other sibling. Once they know they've got it all dumped onto you, you'll never be able to ask for time to go to the dentist without heaps of extra guilt.  Caregivers suffer chronic health problems because they just don't get time to meet their own needs!

I hate to tell you and your mother this, but being dependent on the care of family members is no panacea for abuse.  We are all more likely to be harmed or even killed by family than by strangers.  Disabled persons are particularly vulnerable.  What can we do if someone is irritated by our neverending neediness?  Nothing.  Someone working at a nursing home at least gets to go home and sleep!  Some people caring for disabled children or relatives go years without an uninterrupted night.

I don't know what your brother's needs are.  Are you even qualified to provide what he needs?  There is a lot to think about.  I think at 23 you are still learning who you are and what you want out of life.   You should be getting education and developing your own social support network.

You should be aiming at getting money.  Money doesn't buy happiness, of course, and it can't cure everything, but it's incredibly useful at solving so many problems.  Enough money would solve this one.  You could hire and adequately supervise good care.

You can probably tell that I was unsuccessful at finding alternatives, and I don't know what in heck is going to happen to my son when I'm gone.  I have the awful suspicion that there are no real alternatives for his particular situation.  He's high functioning enough that he doesn't  need full time care with a bed at some facility.  That seems to be the only kind of help available in MY state, and the waiting lists are years long.

Your mother needs to realize that her ask is too big here, and she is trying to force you to mold your life 100% around your brother's needs.  If she does the will that way anyway, she throws away what little opportunity she might have to do something smarter. I don't know what that might look like.

Figure out where you COULD fit in the picture and still live your life.  Set boundaries (look up ""boundaries"" because they are part of healthy relationships) and practice mirror listening (look up ""mirror listening"") so that you can make sure you're understood.  If you can communicate to your mother that your brother needs more than one person taking care of him, that it's too much to put on just  you and furthermore it can leave him with nobody if you fall down a flight of stairs--that would be the best thing.

Caregivers are expected to be there 24/7/365, but other relatives might only show up once or twice a year, mostly to criticize the caregiver.   Don't let anybody force you to live your life the way they want you to live.  Give up the guilt and shame.  Your brother is very important, but you are important too!

You are sensing that you are on the brink of a disaster, and you are right.   This could leave you old, bitter, and alone with no resources.  I bet a lot of homelessness is linked to having been an uncompensated caregiver during early and mid adulthood.
Caregiving is a monumental task. Think long and hard about it before you agree.",2021-10-11 16:26:20,Organic_Challenge_54,q64xuf
,Rehab center bust,"We’re in Germany and Gran had a stroke 2 months ago. We got verbal confirmation from her insurance for a rehab in-patient stay on Friday. I had gotten the name on Monday, but didn’t think to look up reviews. My mom did today. Turns out it’s an absolute disaster of a place. Dirty, outdated, with too many patients and therapists are constantly rotating away. I need to call the insurance and ask if they can send her somewhere else. Gran said she doesn’t want to know the quality of the center, so I’m doing it in secret. I thought I was doing this well. I wish I’d thought to check the reviews earlier. I feel like I’m letting down my gran, and also I’m tired and I was looking forward to having a couple of guilt-free weeks to myself but now this :( I’m so disappointed I wasn’t more vigilant.","wow i didn’t know German places were like this. growing up as a German in America, all

,Advice on keeping track of medical history/records?,"Between different hospital visits, ER trips, doctors (primary, psychiatrist, surgeon) my mother’s had a rough year. Finding that each visit is a repeat of going through her history and wondering if there’s a way/system/app/service folks here have used to properly track medical records and visits. Ideally could be shared w/ medical providers and also track as a family. Also any tips on how to obtain this info properly as a healthcare proxy? Sorry if I’m missing anything but would really appreciate any guidance. Thanks in advance!","Before deciding on the ""best"" software, just note things in Google keep or whatever is most convenient for you to take notes with. 

Here's what's worked for me, since my father died and I'm keeping track of my mother's finances and meds and bills and everything

* important entries in Excel. Columns are Date, tag, amount, comment. Tag is one of: medical, tax, insurance, etc.

* I set up gmail in her name and use Google calendar, and sync that with Alexa so she can see her calendar on her Echo Show screen. 

* Google doc one page with her medicines list and conditions. Doctors love this, it saves a lot of time when checking in.

* j2 fax to email (or efax) service

* UPS store mailbox, to avoid losing important documents in ""the pile.""

* poa,dpoa,ahcd, POLST but you already know about those

* LastPass to store all those passwords to bank accounts, utility providers, insurance IDs, SSN, etc

* Google keep for doctor addresses, and agenda items, and I have one with a tax prep checklist.

* Voice recorder app to record quick notes like her next appointment, and when she decides to talk about family history

* Half a day per week to do a sweep of her bank accounts, transfer voice notes to that Excel, pay her bills online, and organize things. 

* To avoid scam calls I set her cellphone default ring to silent, so it rings for only numbers in her address book. And ccf to a Google voice number tied to her Gmail that leaves a message there so I can get it from her Gmail. 

* A home scanner that won't jam. I scan a lot of docs, and save them with file name e.g. 
 mom\tax2020\ssa1099-20210104.pdf
I keep these on my laptop (and external USB disk) so that I can go back and access them if need be, from my home.
Honestly, not that I’m aware of. I just keep a running timeline typed while each event is fresh in my memory. If you are attending these appointments with her, most docs will provide records if asked in front of Mom. That plus setting up a login to the Hospital systems online portal (MyChart or Patient Portal, they all call it something different) should fill in the blanks and allow you to show specific test results to other medical pros helping her.
AMEN! I have no answer, but I really hope someone else does or someone creates an APP that medical offices could use with all standard info, tests, meds, and diagnosis. At this point there should be something with all our information that can be easily sent to any doctor. I would be happy to add additional information for each specialty. I spend so much time writing the same info over and over and then trying to remember what each doctor said. This shouldn't be this difficult. 

Side note, my dad had Kaiser where he lived for like 30 years. When he moved in with me, we had to get him a different insurance. It has been next to impossible for me to get any of his old records from Kaiser. Example: We went to see the neurologist all I could tell him was he had a stroke sometime in the past 5 years (His first was very minor and only noticed after the fact). I had NO information on any tests or results, or diagnosis and Kaiser is not sending to doctor. Every time I try to call them, I end up in phone hold hell and lost in the auto system.

I'm an inhome caregiver through an agency. I've been with this woman who is described as 'difficult' but she has said many times I am her favorite to we are pretty close :)

Anyways- getting old, memory issues, get upset, etc. All the common issues we run into. Well today (I'll keep this vague) she asked me to do something, I told her no, I'm sorry, I can't as I was directed to by the other people living in the house. 

She ended up yelling and swearing at me, this has only happened with us once but she is quick to yelling towards other people. At somepoint she is walking to another room to climb on something and I am standing in her way. More screaming and swearing, and she ends up shoving her walker into me. I don't get hurt obviously but this is the first time she's done something like that. 

I've called the office to update, my shift is over, I said goodbye to her, etc etc so that's taken care of. My main issue is am I allowed to be upset about this?? I mean at face value, yes, I know I can. But clients getting upset is common and to be expected as part of the job. I don't know. I'm very new to this. Today has made me feel like I'm just not helping at all. 

Thanks for listening to my rant. Any advice or insight would be appreciated.","Of course you're allowed to be upset. Just because you could have known things like this could happen doesn't mean you aren't going to have a very natural human reaction when it does happen.

I'm sure you *are* helping. You have a real relationship with this woman and she clearly cares about you. Like any relationship, there will be conflicts that arise. But unlike most relationships, her capacity to handle that conflict kindly and constructively is going to vary a whole lot. You are probably feeling a mix of fear, pity, sadness, anger, and more. Let yourself feel it, talk about it with people who love you, and give yourself whatever you need -- starting with permission -- to work through it and recharge.
Every day is different when caring for somebody with dementia.  I don't know how grounded she is in place and time, but tomorrow she may have forgotten all about it and be back to what's normal in your relationship.

Loss of agency is one of the hardest things for older people to deal with.  She may have perceived you as ganging up with the other people in the house against her.  When you go back, I would reassure her that her needs come first with you.

,Traveling,"***Update***
I was able to hold my ground and even told him if this was a deal breaker he could find another caregiver. He threw a tantrum and even tried to convince me. I am not going to Mexico and I am still working. Thank you everyone for the help, you guys rock.

*******

The person I work for needs to go to Mexico for 15 days, I already told him I cannot go for that long but he is very pushy.

He also wanted to share a room and I do not feel comfortable with this, he is very sweet but he is also a man who tries to hit on my (I like to believe is due to loneliness). He has told me he won't pay for a second room so that would fall on me.

Normally I work 3 days per week, 5h per day. During this trip he expects me to care for him 9h per day 6 days per week and 5 h on Sundays (if we go for 2 weeks which I wont). No overtime.

His mobility is limited, he has a pee bottle he uses during the night and is able to go to the bathroom with a walker. So my guess is he wants to save money.

I would have to drive there (12h drive) and then he expects me to drive him around, which I understand, so he can investigate the market ( he is trying to sell a house and wants to buy the land around but doesn't want to talk over the phone).

On top of the expenses for the room I need to get someone to care for my pets which I understand, I have done the math and I would be making 7$ per hour.

He is very pushy and I am having a hard time to get him to understand this is not viable for me and he should go with a family member. How would you shut this down if it was you?","Look him in the eye and tell him no, you are not able to do this.  If he keeps it up, use your firmest mommy voice and say ""No, I will not go to Mexico with you.""  Make sure you mean it.  If you go on this trip he will definitely grope you, treat you like his personal maid, and you will have a miserable event to get over.   Believe in your own worth.  He's your client, he doesn't own you.
This trip, in it ‘s current iteration is inappropriate. And unfortunately, as the caregiver, you’re the professional here. The last thing you need is to then have his family think he paid for the two of you to go on vacation together! This is a no-win situation. You need to be firm.
Dont go protect yourself  once you get to Mexico he will hit on you
I would find a different place to work
Money talks. Bullshit walks. I too am a caregiver. You need to be real for yourself. Get a good handle on the ""mommy voice"" the other commenter indicated and stay firm. Your client can add the needed extras into the property investment as research costs. His wallet could be thinned a bit to account for the additional sacrifice. My sympathy for medically challenged people has limitations. When the crap hits the fan, you are the one who cleans up the mess. I try to keep said fan on the lower speed to hopefully avoid a larger mess. In short, an ounce of prevention is worth more than a pound of cure...sometimes.
""No"" is a complete sentence.    


Jobhunt time.  Polish the resume.  Looks like you'll have time to sort out offers.

I'd probably say something like this. Let them know you wanna be there but on their terms.

Also, the number 1 thing someone can do for me, is listen. Even if what I say is wrong or disgusting or whatever. Sometimes I get fed up, and I'm not gonna tell my patients that I'm sick and tired of them. It's so so nice when I can call a friend after work and just get it out of my head.

Good luck, you sound like a great person.
I find it really hard to accept help.  I've been a full time caregiver for my husband for seven years, and just recently have brought myself to accept some home care.  I think Alienrubberduck had it right:  make sure they know you really want to help them, and always listen.
Give them a break day occasionally. They don’t get vacations. Offer to take a day caring for their person, or to bring a meal so they don’t have to cook and visit with them, because they may not get out much. If they can get out, invite them somewhere like to a party or bbq. Send gifts or flowers or something which makes their life easier. Do jobs around the house which they don’t have time or energy to get to.

,how do you convince an elder to take a bath?,"good day to all of you, im 16 and my great grandma(92,its been long since she cant stand because of some problems in her legs). she  started to refuse to take her baths, its been a month already since her last bath. we didnt know what happened , why she started to dislike it, when in fact she likes to do it back then and will spend hours in the shower. it is just suddenly she doesnt want to go to the bath and refuses heavily when we ask her to take a shower even just for minutes.

the only thing that we do is use some wet cloth and wash her with it, but it is not a really big help

do you have any advice what can we do? it is really bothering me because, she cant also wash her vaginal part, which is dangerous and we dont know what to do.. and the smell is getting worse .","I'm a caregiver student at a retirement home, here's some tips I use at work when they don't wanna bathe:

1. Ask why. Is it too hard? Do they need extra help? Are they embarrassed? Have they stopped caring? Etc.

2. Explain the consequences. If they don't bathe they can get skin infections, vaginal and anal rashes etc. Explain that they are dirty and that they smell. In a kind way ofc but explain it to them. 

3. Tell them, that you're concerned for them and that you care about their well being. 

4. Be positive! Tell them all the good things about bathing. The water is warm, they'll smell nice, they'll look better, people wanna be around them etc.

5. Reward them. Tell them if they take a bath, you can go get chocolate. Or go to the park. Or just whatever they like to do.

6. If nothing works, get creative, and take what you can get. Okay so they didn't take a whole bath, but hey! You got to wash their hair. And tomorrow, maybe you can convince them to was their lower parts.

7. If absolutely nothing works call for help. There are professionals out there, and you shouldn't take on more than you can bare. It's a tough job taking care of the people you love. It's okay to ask for help.
I have the same issue with my mom (89). We've started giving her sponge baths.  I think thats the best option, especially when there are physical limitations.  You can try and convince her that a bath is gonna make her feel better, but since things aren't working in the brain, those words are just lost. You don't want to risk her having an injury getting in and out of a shower. Yes, she smells! I just feel like it's the least of the giant list of worries.
Mom refuses to have a regular bath or shower because she doesn't want it, ever. But that's ok, cuz there's all sorts of wet wipes, in particular for the body that work pretty well (pleasant fragrance), better than rinseless washes. 

Whenever mom uses the bathroom, I always use wet wipes (after regular wiping with toilet tissue; we currently use the Costco Kirkland brand of wet wipes--not the best, but does what it needs to; I don't like the smell of Cottonelle), and I sprinkle baby powder on her behind (if things get messy we have portable bidet-like devices that I fill with warm water and rinseless soap specifically for this type of region). 

I mix up warm water, white or apple cider vinegar and occasionally some essential oil (tea tree or peppermint or whatever is on hand) to hand wash her head/hair--literally, she's sitting on her wheelchair, I dip my fingers in the mixture and use my fingers to rub the solution on her head (some ppl might be sensitive to this so you need to try a little first, if you do it). There's also a shower cap with rinseless shampoo inside it that you can heat up in the microwave and wash her hair that way. Mom prefers me using my fingers though cuz it's like a head massage that she can't feel with the thick shower cap.

I soak her feet every other day or two, massaging her feet in the warm water with Epsom salts and white or ac vinegar so it seems like a massage more than washing her feet, wiping her legs up to her knees with a wet washcloth. 

You do what you can. Good luck.",2021-09-04 09:34:32,pUzzi_pleaser,phrnpl

,I am really on my breaking point rn,"Hey guys.
I am an in-home caregiver and have been doing it for about 3 years now. I previously did facility work for assisted living but like home health a lot better, more one on one time. I specialize in end of life care and memory care.
I am currently taking care of this one particular client (just regular incontinence, dressing help, showering, etc help) I am just really starting to get frustrated. Mind you, I don't get frustrated easily due to what I work with a majority of the time, but man I just can't help it at this point. I do overnights with her and the minute we get dressed for bed and she settles in she has to 'walk' either because her foot is cramping or her leg twitched. It's really endless. But then I find her in the pantry or in the fridge trying to eat ice cream. I have tried the whole snack before bed. Still does it. It's every 20 minutes she either has to go to the bathroom or wants to 'walk' but the moment shes up she insists me to use her wheelchair to take her to the living room or bedroom wherever she's at at the moment. No problem, right? Well this now has been happening 12+ times a night. Back and forth. Back and forth. She will go back and forth from her bedroom to the living room... all night. It's currently 3am and she has not slept a wink and just went back out to the living room and as I'm typing this I just want to cry out of frustration? I have had her for about 2 1/2 months now and I'm trying to power theough it but when it's like this every night for 3 overnight shifts in a row I just feel so defeated. 
When I try to talk to her about it she doesn't really want to. Also, it seems like she has been more sensitive in the mornings as of lately in the last week or so. Maybe from not getting sleep? 

Thanks for listening to my rant :( made me a feel a little better.","Do you know what Restless Leg Syndrome is?  Look it up.  It's hell.  There's no sleeping when it's happening.  You bet it's frustrating.  But you're trying to solve with chitchat what is, in fact, an actual physical issue with your patient's vitamin/mineral deficiencies.  (Foot cramping likewise.)  


Mine is relieved 90% or so by Magnesium supplements.  (Not Magnesium oxide--that's just laxative, very hard for the body to absorb from the digestive tract.  Look for Mg Citrate, Maleate, other very bioavailable forms.   Start with one capsule at bedtime. The body will take what it needs.  Increase by a capsule a day.  When the body has all it needs, it will leave what's left in the intestinal tract, where it will attract water, acting as a laxative.  Then just drop the dose back down a little.)    


If she's on a lot of meds, or she has a doctor or HHN who might listen, enlist his/her help with this.  RLS is real and can be treated, even if the cause is other than magnesium deficiency.    


But most of all, you're there for her at night.  She doesn't OWE YOU good sleep.  I bet she longs for it more than you do, though.   You're there to take care of her every hour.  Don't see her bad sleep as your inconvenience.  See it as job security.    


I feel the irony here.  I'm up trying to help you because my legs are cramping and restless.  And you're up trying to help someone else for the same reason.  I hope you succeed at making this better!  


One more thing.  An old wives' tale was that restless legs could be calmed by slipping a bar of dry new soap under the sheet where the legs can't settle.  The placebo effect can be a mighty thing if you can make her believe it, too.  The smooth feeling of the soap, and its hopefully pleasant scent, are reminders that it is there, but at least for me, it's not annoying.  I really believe in the Magnesium (zinc, possibly calcium, potassium--she needs bloodwork to check her levels!) but I've discovered that I fell asleep while using only the soap.  A mystery!  But don't knock it if it seems to help.
She’s having a medical issue. Could be so many things. Atrial fibrillation that’s untreated or not managed right? Other people on here know more… she’s in need of a doctor visit
UTI maybe? I'd consult with her pcp, nurse.
My mom had a huge fascination with being brought to the bathroom every 10 minutes during awake hours.  Drove the caregivers crazy.  Doctor said not to oblige her.  It was not physical but mental.  It took about a year to get her re-trained to a ""normal"" amount of toileting.


Same at bedtime.  What we did to cure that is doctor prescribed 10 mg Diazepam and 30 mg Mirtazapine (an anti-depressant that makes elderly drowsy) and she sleeps like a log for well over a year now.",2021-08-25 05:09:44,alannking,pb7ilc
,"I'm 24 years old, no job, not in school and the perfect candidate for taking care of my grandmother, who is toxic and manipulative and aunt who has Apert Syndrome.","Hello to all.

I don't know where to particularly start. I guess I could start on the relationships between my grandparents and their daughters (my aunt and my mom), as well as I, the grand daughter. According to my mother, both of my grandparents always treated eachother with no respect from the very beginning. My grandfather was more level-headed than my grandmother and she tends to be impulsive and reckless, i.e being told not to do something for the sake of their safety and doing it anyways. An example would be that my grandmother wanted to take driving lessons from a girl in the neighborhood and my grandfather strictly forbade it, saying it's distracting to do so and dangerous. My grandmother did it anyways and crashed the car as she ran a stop sign. Boy, did my grandmother get a good talking to by my grandfather. It's important to note that at this moment in time with the information I have, my grandfather never raised a hand towards my grandmother in any forms of anger or abuse; my grandmother in present day claims that he has. My grandparents don't sleep together, but sleep in separate rooms. They constantly like to press each other's buttons too.  I digress, however, as I will explain a bit better later in my post.

The relationship between my grandmother and mother was apparently a rocky one. When my mother was in her teens, pre-teens, my grandmother would always call her names whenever my mom did something wrong. As my family are of Mexican culture (families tend to call eachother names), my grandmother used to call my mother, 'tonta' or 'babosa' or anything degrading. My mother would say that she had to develop a hard-shell in order not to be affected by the name-calling. Talking about it to me today, I could tell my mom had some sort of hurt or trauma caused by it. I could tell she wanted to cry, but she kept it at bay.

With regards to my aunt who has apert syndrome, she's considered the youngest out of three. There's another aunt besides my mom and the younger sister, but she's not in the picture as of this moment. My aunt (with apert syndrome) today is extremely toxic not only to my grandfather but to my mother as well. For you, I paint a picture of when my family visited the grandparents months before COVID started happening (a few months before Kobe Bryant's passing). Before arriving at my grandparent's house, we had stopped by a dollar tree to pick up some drinks for lunch. Apparently, most of the registers weren't allowing card transaction and had to use cash. After that, we arrived to the grandparents and basically just spend half the day conversing. At one point, my aunt asked my grandfather if they could go to dollar tree after we left to do a bit of shopping, and thus my mom mentioned that most of the registers weren't working and should probably try again some other time. Now, I don't know what compelled my aunt to go in this super aggressive behavior, but she left the living room with a huff, basically went into her bedroom and stayed. We didn't think anything of it, and my mom continued to talk her parents a bit longer.

I had excused myself to go to the bathroom, which was literally next to my aunts bedroom and overheard her calling someone. I thought to myself, huh, I wonder who's she contacting right now. A friend, maybe? Nope! My aunt had called the store itself to confirm if the registers were truly working or not and I don't know which dollar tree she contacted, but they confirmed they were working (she probably called a different place). After I finished my business, I went back into the living room and chilled. Minutes later, my aunt comes out and basically rushes up to my mother and starts pointing at her and starts shouting, ""They are working. You're a liar! you're liar! you're a liar!"" on repeat. I could tell this caught my mother off guard because instantly she felt cornered and started crying from shock. I was in shock as well, so was my siblings and my father. After that fiasco, we left quickly, my mom didn't want to stay any longer than she already was. My grandparents yelled at my aunt and reprimanded her, and we left.

That wasn't the first time my aunt acted in such a way. In fact, she wasn't always like this. She's currently 35-36 years old. I've known her all my life, and she's never been this toxic or bad and I don't know if it has anything to do with her syndrome or the influence around her (lives indefinitely with my grandparents). The first time I've ever heard my aunt ""acting out"" was when my parents went to my grandparents to install a ramp to their house for easy access. My grandfather (although shouldn't be helping because of weak knees) decided to help my parents in any way that he could. During this, my aunt had come out and basically berated my grandfather and pestered him nonstop to take her to the store...to buy a pickle. That was the start of everything. My mother didn't know where it came from or how it started, but she's said that it was the start of a weird change my aunt was going through.

Through the months of my mother visiting my grandparents, my aunt would berate my mom calling her ""fat"" and always saying, ""why is she here."" My grandfather usually sends my mom home with gifts of food and other things as he usually does ever since I could remember and my aunt would say, ""don't give her our food! Why are you giving her our food, look at her, she's fat anyway!"" I could tell my mom is trying to keep that hard shell on. She's got that down on lock, but I could tell she's slowly ebbing away from the emotional distress caused by my aunt. We really can't do anything, not even yell at her for her behavior because she has apert syndrome. But I feel as though she understands what she's doing, and doesn't really care for how people feel when she berates anyone.

Now, with the relationship between me and my grandparents and aunt. From the moment I could remember, my grandmother always treated me with love and care. Never once yelled at me nor treated me in such a way as she has with my mother (calling her names). I remember taking neighborhood walks with my grandmother and aunt and we'd have a splendid time. There was never anything bad that went on in our relationship. So, It kind of freaks me out considering how my grandparents are acting today and how my aunt is acting today as well. It's like, I don't even know them anymore.

Fast forward today, my grandparents household is beyond toxic. I would like to mention some important details before I get into the present day. A few years ago, my grandmother had fallen ill. My mom, usually phones my grandparents every week to see how they were doing, and one day, she's talking to my grandfather and he mentions that my grandmother is sick and is laying on the floor in the living room. It's a dire situation and he mentions that she doesn't want help or ambulance and wants to be left alone. Distraught, my mother leaves to their house and what she finds is somewhat traumatic to her? My grandmother is lying on the living room floor, in her own urine, feces and bodily fluids. My grandfather couldn't call anyone because my grandmother threatened him not to and my aunt didn't say anything, didn't even call my mom. My mother ended up calling the ambulance and they took her to the hospital. Doctors discovered that her kidneys were failing and in order to survive, she would need to do dialysis, practically for the rest of her life.

My grandmothers past illnesses include: diabetes(currently) and breast cancer (survivor). So, nowadays, my grandmother is supposed to be going to dialysis 6 times a month and has been barely going and here's why.

My grandparents relationship deteriorated fast. I mean fast. My grandfather (in his 80s) still drives my grandmother and aunt around for errands and to the doctors often. My grandfather drops off my grandmother to dialysis and now my grandmother is accusing my grandfather of having an affair with a nurse or patient at dialysis. My grandfather is a outgoing man. He loves to talk to people whether young or old man or woman. He's curious about a lot of things and loves to learn, and he's pretty darn sharp for his age. But now, my grandmother is accusing him of doing things that she has no proof of. Such as bringing food to an alleged ""woman"" or leaving the house to meet some ""woman"" and it's taking a toll on him.

It's getting terrible to the point where, my grandmother has forced him out of every possession he had in terms of property and money and all he has left is his social security. He would go to her for money to pay bills and groceries and now she doesn't even allow him a single cent (she lives off of my aunts disability check, most goes to my aunt and the rest to herself since she was the one to go to lawyers a WHILE ago to gain FULL custody of my aunt, in which she successfully gained). It's gotten to the point where he's not even allowed to leave the house, not even to his own appointments without her accusing him of cheating on her?

According to my mother, she's extremely critical of others from the very beginning. Critical of others and not herself. She's always right and never wrong and I feel as though that this is causing severe toxicity in that household and is slowly rubbing off onto my aunt who is essentially picking up the traits of my grandmother unfortunately. So much so that at one point when my grandfather would take my grandmother and aunt to the store and a cashier would ask how his shopping went, my aunt would step in and aggressively mention that's he's married as if the cashier was trying to get a go at him. I can't imagine the humiliation my grandfather must've felt all those years leading up to today.

My grandfather was the sole caretaker of both my grandmother and aunt and took them to their appointments. For the past year, my grandmother has been REFUSING to go to dialysis and my grandfather would tell my mother about this on phone calls. There was a phone call recently where my mom and grandfather were talking and my mom could hear my grandmother shouting at him saying, ""Who's that you're talking to on the phone!? Is it that vieja (trans: Whore, depending what Latin country you're from)?! Of course it would be!"" My mother was extremely shocked by this. My mother also threatened that she'd call the state to intervene if my grandmother refuses to go to dialysis, and I don't know if my grandfather told her that, but they did end up going after the phone call, and I don't if it's in fear of getting the state involved OR to my mother's theory, my grandmother's manipulative plan to make my mother look bad, because apparently, according to my mother, my grandmother is extremely CLEVER and manipulative. Always has been. That's where we are at today.

Now, the real reason as to why I'm writing this is because today, my mom had sat me down and asked basically in desperate heed if I'd be okay with living over there with my grandmother and aunt to take care of them while my grandfather lived over here away from the toxic environment he was in. He would live comfortably, go to his appointments and not worry about a thing and while I feel like that would absolutely be the best option for him, knowing me, I don't know if I could do it.

I'm 24 years old, about to be 25 years old. I have mental issues of my own, hence why I don't have a job and I'm not going to school. However, with good intentions, I can see how I would be a perfect candidate in my mother's eyes to take care of my grandmother and aunt over there. I would need to take care of the house, cook for them, drive them places. But my mom also gave me a warning that if I do take this on, that I would need to build a hard shell and that I would need to be mentally and emotionally prepared to take care of them. I don't know how BAD things have gotten, but I'm someone who is EXTREMELY hypersensitive and over empathetic. I don't know if I would be able to take care of them when I can't even take care of myself properly.

So, I ask, for ANY advice on how to deal with two toxic people, one of them being extremely manipulative and emotionally distressing and the other having a disability. Any advice would help, by all means. I don't have a ""deadline"" for my answer on what I want to do, I was told to just think about it and If choose not to, It would be okay, but I would feel extremely guilty having not helped.","Don't do it OP. Caregiving is so hard in the best of circumstances and this situation sounds like complete hell. u/shayzelala is right, you will be abused.
DON’T DO IT. Caregiving is very difficult emotionally even if the patient has good intentions and isn’t trying to use you as an emotional punching bag from the get-go.  For someone who already suffered mental health problems to be the emotional punching bag for two people who have had decades of practice manipulating good intentioned people.

Are you in the US? You can offer to do research on social services in their city and to help get them with the paperwork to set up with Medicaid, so that she can get in-home aide services.

The fact that they are dramatic and manipulative will be amplified by your being essentially their servant indefinitely, getting wrapped up in family drama, not getting paid, not being able to walk away. With a paid health aide, they are more likely to “behave” or at least be much nicer to the aide. And the aide gets a chance to get off their shift and leave the situation and go to their own private world. You would be swimming in this stew of toxicity all the time with no way to get out.
Please rethink and rethink. Caregiving is extremely draining.You are so young and you have a wonderful future. You could work and get a good cna to support the family a bit.
Don’t do it. Your grandfather is a grown man. He chose to stay in this abusive relationship. Your mom is basically offering you up for the next round of abuse. People like this usually need SOMEONE to take their anger out on and that will be you. 

Your grandmother will die without dialysis. If she chooses not to go… well that’s her choice. Your mom needs to stop worrying so much about people who don’t even like her. There are other options besides offering you up in place of your grandfather. Your grandfather could try standing up for himself as a start.
Like all others I advise not to do it. Since you are a sensitive soul, going there knowing that will be abused will not help shield you from absorbing all of that. So do not do it. As a mom of a 23 year old, my advise is that you find work in activities that you can do from home. Data entry for a healthcare company or something that does not require you to be too overstimulated. You must protect your own mental health and find a way to break the cycle of abuse and manipulation.",2021-08-21 19:39:57,vniversus,p91tdl
,Questions for Caregivers,"Hello

My mother (67) just had a stroke. Unfortunately, she was the caregiver for my father (74) who has mild dementia and is physically disabled. We are going to be looking into an at home caregiver. What types of questions should we ask them when we reach out?","Before interviewing a caregiver, I would outline specifically what my expectations are, like a job description, so the caregiver tasks are clear to everyone.   


Some questions you could ask:  
•	What type of experience do you have as a caregiver?  
•	What experience do you have working with clients with a) physical disabilities; 2) stroke; 3) dementia?   How do your skills qualify you for this job?  
•	How comfortable are you performing personal care/hygiene tasks to elderly clients?   
•	You could review your expectations of what the caregiver would do and ask if they are able to do those tasks and ask how comfortable they are with performing those tasks.  
•	Is there any task you are uncomfortable doing?  
•	Why do you think you are a good caregiver?  
•	What are two positive things one of your previous clients would say about you?  
•	Describe a time when you faced a difficult situation with a client and what did you do to resolve it?  
•	Where was your last employment? Why did you leave that job? What did you like and dislike about your previous job?  
•	Do you have reliable transportation to get to work?   
•	What is your availability?  Are you able to work the hours needed? Do you have any upcoming planned vacations? Are there any holidays you can or cannot work?  
•	Pay: You could review the amount to be paid, the method of payment (e.g. check) and how often they would be paid and confirm they are agreeable.  
•	References: ask for past work references

Good luck!
a good place to start is your local Area Agency on Aging (if you’re in the US) however far away it may be.  they’ll be able to discuss the different options available to you, get you a good starting point.  Also look at the AARP website (again US) because they really do have useful info.  also check out dailycaring.com because they have good articles about differences between options, what to ask, agency vs freelance workers, etc., and what to expect.  it’s a lot of information gathering at this stage.  good luck!  👍
To start, are you looking for hourly or live-in help, or some combination thereof?  I’d expect the hospital social worker to have some info to help you get started, but don’t expect much beyond a list of facilities (and their phone numbers) appropriate for your insurance.

,Trying to find a caretaker to relieve my mom who is taking care of my disabled adult brother full time.,"So my mom desperately needs some respite and I want to get her here where I live for a weekend, but it would be hard for her to also take my brother. I'm wondering where I would be able to find a caretaker to relieve her for a weekend. They would have to stay at my mom's with my brother for the entire duration of her being gone. He doesn't stay up long - approx 6 hours - and it wouldn't be working 100% of the time. I'm just wondering where would be a good place to find a caretaker who can do that and how much that would cost. It seems like it would be a flat rate. My mom has money, but she is scared to leave him with someone she doesn't know. Thanks for the advice!","If your brother has a caseworker at your local community mental health office, your mom may be able to call the caseworker and ask for a list of respite providers in your area. Many times these providers will do respite in their home or yours.

Your mom would or could depending on your financial circumstances apply for respite funds through community mental health. This would be a monthly stipend or lump amount of money that your mom could use just for respite. Again, there are providers who can come into your home, provide transportation, do overnights, have your brother in their home or help out in different ways.

This is something I have done when I need respite from caregiving for my adult disabled brother.

It would likely (depending on your local community health office’s practices) be something (once your mom has the list) she would have to initiate and then contact the providers in your or close to your area and ask all the requisite questions: are they taking new clients? Are they currently even providing respite (many stopped during the height of the pandemic and need to resubmit their paperwork to community mental health to begin providing respite care again), and of course, fit.

It’s a bit of a process, but the caseworkers are usually super helpful about sharing respite provider lists and updating your brothers file to include respite funds (depending on your local CMH office’s resources). 

If respite providers aren’t in your area, again your mom might be able to get some ideas of different agencies who have folks who work with the elderly or disabled and can come into your home and help out. In those cases they may not be able to spend the night (all depends on the agency), but it could also provide some more leads for services.

If THAT doesn’t provide any information, you could always advertise for an PT in home care provider, interview them and pay them either a flat daily rate or an hourly rate depending on your budget.

There are also some monies available (usually depending on your community mental health office’s resources) Community Living Supports monies and people who do just Community Living Support (CLS). This would mean if your brother is able to, taking him out in the community for a few hours a week to do social outings, etc…

Again, your mom would have to make the call to your brothers caseworker (provided he has one) and ask for those supports. It could take awhile, but I have found once you are approved for respite funds and CLS it can take a lot of weight off your shoulders if you are able to find one or two providers to do the respite. If your mom gets respite money, there should be nothing out of pocket. If your brother doesn’t qualify for respite money (I don’t know how this works in different states) then it would be out of pocket.

Hope that helps!

,How much would you charge?,"Edit: amounts are per week, sorry I didn’t clarify!

I have a lady in her 80’s who still mostly takes care of herself i.e. walks, bathes, dresses most days. She has been feeling very dizzy and fatigued for weeks after a fall and now wants someone around the house more. Basically I would make 15 meals a week, grocery shop, light cleaning, take her to doctor appointments, communicating with people that upkeep the house and sleep 5 nights there. 
The total hours I would need to be “on call” would be 90 hours a week, but 40 of those are sleep time.  She is so low needs I feel bad charging her my normal $12/hr. It’s also in the wealthiest neighborhood in my city, so I really would like living there. Any advice is appreciated

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/odbqbg)","Is this how much you would charge by week? Just want to make sure before I vote.
Minimum $35 an hour for her waking hours. Maybe $25 for sleeping time. 

I recommend you call health care agencies and ask how much they charge. That's the market rate.
She may be little ""hands-on care""... but that's still a lot of hours and a lot of work... Make sure you pay yourself fairly and don't undercharge. Home health companies would charge a fortune...so she'll still be saving money.
Charge $15-20/hr. It's fair.
Normal caregiver rates where I am in the suburbs of NYC are $25-$35 per hour. You can research caregiving websites and see what other people are charging and what services they offer in your area on websites like care.com. 

I would not go under $25. Elder care is no joke and can be more demanding than you think, even with minimal care. Plus if you are not working for a company, you will need to report your income on your tax return, and you will most likely owe taxes.",2021-07-03 22:46:37,letsanalyzethat,odbqbg

,Going back to the real world after caregiving.,"Hello. I am a caregiver for an elderly person. Here is a little of my backstory. This might be long, bear with me…
I stumbled onto caregiving when an old friend called me asking if I new someone who could help her aging parents. At the time I was going through some mental health issues and had just dropped out of school, so helping her was a way for me to think about someone other than myself. I’ve been caregiving for this family for 7 years now. 
Last year, because of changing family circumstances, I had to leave this caregiving job and move cities … I was hoping to be able to find a job doing what I went to school for (10 years ago) but looking for work was extremely difficult… the pandemic closedowns hit our city just a month after I had left my caregiving job so I was out of work and unable to get unemployment… my family’s finances suffered tremendously. I took 2 jobs doing things I enjoy but even with both jobs I was making less what I made caregiving ( I am very lucky to be paid a living wage by my friend)…
Thankfully, my friend offered me my job back and I took it… but here is the catch… I’m extremely depressed… I had been depressed for years and I had not realized it has so much to do with my job… Moving away allowed me to see different me… and I hadn’t even realized it until I came back. I mean, it’s like night and day! I quickly became mentally and emotionally exhausted. Even with the financial difficulties my family was having, my mind was clear. 
Being back as thrown me into a full state of depression(I’ve only been back for 6 months but my mental decline has been obvious) … it is hard to wake up in the morning to go take care of my patient… I love the family so much, but seeing my patient struggle… hearing her pain, just fills my chest with extreme anxiety… I thought I wanted to stay with her until the end but I’m not sure I can take it emotionally. 
Now I have this existencial dread… I struggled for months to try to get a decent paying job but I have no skills now… 
Has anybody successfully gone back to the real world after caregiving??? How??? What steps did you take to prepare yourself for something different??? How long did it take? Is it possible to go to school and caregive? (I need to pay my bills!) 
I feel like I shot myself in the foot here… this caregiving job has allowed me to have a living wage all these years but now I have no career…","Hey there..just because you are employed privately by a friend, don't mistake that as not having a job in the ""real world."" Caregiving is a very important job and is definitely legit. As far as the depression, I can understand. You may have compassion fatigue. I've been there a few times. Doing 1-on-1 care really takes a toll and a lot of people don't realize this. In home care, you're it; you have to do almost everything.

If it's affecting your mental health, it may be time to find other employment and there is absolutely no shame in it. I've done home health off and on for years and while I've liked it, I've had to take breaks. I'm now working as a tech/CNA in a psych hospital. I find it far less demanding than home health. It's really nice having coworkers to share the load. The pay isn't great, but it's ok ($15/hr, I live in Indiana.)

I think it's definitely possible to take classes if you work in healthcare, especially if you have patients that sleep a lot and you're allowed to do your own thing during down time. Some employers expect way too much and want you constantly busy while others don't seem to care...so that's up to you in that regard. I picked night shift so I can do homework. Some of the nurses also do homework who are becoming NP's. 

Hang in there. 💙
Hey there, OP! Just wanted to let you know that, unless you want
    us all to get naked with you (or the pun is intentional), you probably meant
    to say **bear with me** rather than **bare with me**.

""Bear"" means ""to
    tolerate"", whereas ""bare"" means ""to get naked"".

,How do I help with feminine hygiene issues?,"This might be an odd question but I feel pretty uncertain right now and need some help. 
 
Just to start off, I am a man, I was a single father for about 10 year (since m’y kid was about 7). Im currently engaged and she been helping me out with my kid who is 21 and suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. For the record my kid is transgender and had only recently started hormones before the disorder popped up. 

With schizophrenia, there comes some major hygiene neglect. He’s been home for only a few days and has yet to shower and will not brush his teeth or change his clothes. 

Problem is, he’s now menstruating, which is a problem Im not prepared for. Does anyone have any advice on how I can help and work through these hygiene issues? I’m at a loss","Can you convince him to change clothes at all? Maybe check out /r/PeriodUnderwear . Period underwear use the same principle as sweat-wicking sports gear to move moisture away from the skin (there are also versions for urinary incontinence). You can wear them for longer than a menstrual pad, and then you rinse them in cold water and throw them in the washer (also cold water) and hang them up to air dry. A lot of brands use black lining, so the whole thing is less gory than it sounds. I like Thinx brand, but they're not cheap. They do sell a cheaper version at some Target stores, but I haven't tried them. There are also other brands that you can read about on that subreddit if you think this might be a solution. The Thinx [boxers](https://www.shethinx.com/products/thinx-sleep-shorts?variant=32208234184776) that absorb as much as 5 tampons and/or the [boyshorts](https://www.shethinx.com/collections/thinx-classic/products/thinx-boyshort?variant=34693104959560) that hold as much as 3 tampons might be good options for you to give him. I'm sorry that you're going through this. It really sucks to see someone you love suffering, and it sucks even more when you feel helpless to do anything for them.
There is a lot going on here! Menstruating can be rough in the best of times, but add schizophrenia and body dysmorphia... I feel for you both.

Do your best. Bad hygiene might be unpleasant, but it won't cause any permanent damage on its own. Obviously a UTI would not be ideal, but even that can be treated. In all likelihood he will be fine, just... crusty. I'm speaking as someone who has free bled for days in the same underwear, when depression blew right through laundry day that month. But yeah definitely look into the period pants /u/Anna_Mosity mentioned. 

Best of luck getting him the treatment he needs. I know it can take a while to figure out what works.
There are some birth control methods that stops periods. I'm 15 years past menopause so unable to give you names of products. I would suggest you call Planned Parenthood or a LGBT clinic/support group in your area.
I think you need professional help with this.
I'm going to recommend a menstrual cup. All the benefits of a tampon but it can stay in for much longer. It's not necessarily a feminine product either, it's more of a medical one. If you know he'll be okay with it, it might be worth investing in many of them so all he has to do is take it out and put in a new one and then you can wash them as you go at leisure. 

As for overall hygiene, I've had my own battles with schizophrenia and it helps to wash one body part at the time, like one day is arm day and the next day is foot day and it only takes two to five minutes. I've used a waterless soap but it's not something you're going to want to buy off brand. Waterproof clothes can be nice, and make sure you get antiperspirant instead of deodorant to eliminate moisture (if he'll use it). Incentives are huge. Permanent incentives especially, not common items or instant gratification like treats. On bad things, a little bit is better than nothing. Celebrate and reward small successes as well. Changing clothes instead of showering is much better than nothing. Him brushing his teeth for 30 seconds instead of 2 minutes does the job even if not as well.",2021-06-26 02:18:17,rocknroll888,o859ah
,Caregiver's Journey Podcast - Follow Up,"Hi Folks, 

A few months back I posted about the possibility of talking to caregivers in a podcast setting. The thought behind it was to have a place where people in our position could tell their stories, discuss hints tips and tricks, and really just feel like they've got a place in the podcast world. 

I did have a few people reach out to me during that time (thank you), and soon after my post my wife's Primary Progressive MS had a significant turn for the worse. Since that time we've sold our house, moved into a marginally ""accessible"" apartment block, she's gotten a hospital bed and a commode chair, and we've got a Hoyer Lift as well. So a lot has happened. 

But as we settle into this new place I want to take the time to reach out again to people who would be interested in being guests on this podcast as I get the wheels rolling again. I'm planning right now on having new episodes come out roughly every 3 weeks on Anchor (which will help me get it added to Spotify and Apple), and would like to see if anyone is interested in being a guest on the podcast. We'd record it via Zoom and would talk for about 30 minutes, and I'd pair it down to about 15-20 depending on our conversations. 

I'm working on putting things together now (a list of a few questions that I'll ask to everyone so as to get a flurry of different answers) to get things started and would love for interested people to message me here. I'm generally free in the evenings after 4pm Central. We can talk beforehand about some of the questions I'd like to ask and some things you'd want to talk about so we get a good flow, and go from there.

Thanks again for reading, and I hope to hear from you.","I am interested if I can go by a different name, and I can get half an hour of free time ;)
I’d be interested- I just joined this sub and r/caregiversupport I am a caregiver to my adult sibling. Have been for many years on and off. On again right now. Facing a bit of burnout, but trying like mad to cope in a healthy way and pull myself up and out.

Edit: I also have my own chronic health condition I’m coping with on top of being a caregiver.",2021-06-25 12:41:52,delifte,o7rfgx
,Guidance on how to best house my 63 y/o father with depression,"I've been taking care of my father by visiting him every other day for the last 5 years.  He has Major Depressive Disorder.  He has been seeing various doctors, some inpatient stints, day programs, etc.  When on medication he does okay with keeping up with it but doesn't take good care of himself or the place he lives in unless he gets a nudge from someone else.  I can see this as the garbage piles up when work gets really busy for me.  


The place he is renting with his savings/SSI is about to be sold (they have to, I don't blame them).  I've been looking into a nursing home type situation for him for a while.  He would flourish if forced to be around other people and had a daily nudge to take medication, shower, and eat properly.  Is there any type of place like that in the US, New Jersey that SSI and medicaid could pay for?  What type of assisted living would this be?   


Thank you ahead of time.","So I would start with Social Services for your county as well as local Area Agency for Aging. 
They can arrange for him to be evaluated and decide what kind of support he needs. They may need to loop in his doctor because if you want Medicaid to pay, they will need to verify that it is medically necessary. Not just what’s best for him and you. 

Unfortunately, my understanding is that you will not get to choose his Care Home when using Medicaid but I hope I’m wrong about that.

Edited because I forgot that NJ has great program to help families care for seniors at home:

Does your Father read? 

If so, I highly recommend giving him this book. It's the #1 recommended book for depression by doctors. You could probably get it for free at your local library.

I am 74 and have had home caregivers for several years. Most caregivers have more than one job and many work in assisted living facilities. They kind of don't realize who they are talking to and their comments about the conditions in assisted living have convinced me never to go to an assisted living facility. I don't want to scare you but:

Caregivers who work in facilities that charge residents $7,000 per month often have two workers at night, when many older people need help, for 100 residents. 

Security is so lax that a caregiver ran into a male at 1:00 am who had her cellphone in his possession. That night she and the receptionist were the only people working there.

A caregiver told me that she got so frustrated about all the ""bells going off"" \[meaning calls from residents who need something\] while she was trying to do the laundry that she turned them all off. By the way, residents are charged $40 for a load of laundry at the facility she worked in.

It's a sad fact of life that older people are often incontinent. People who have s\*\*t themselves lie in it for hours before anybody comes to help them because of the under-staffing in these facilities.

I would investigate any assisted living facility very very carefully. Ask: What are their staffing levels? What is the ratio of staff to residents? Do they have laundry and shower aides or are caregivers expected to do everything. How much do they pay staff? Try to talk to residents at the facility. If you do put your dad there, visit at night to see for yourself what the conditions are.

This whole world of intense elder care is, from what I can see, a situation that no one cares about, so make sure you are in touch with the conditions on a regular basis. because it will make a difference in the care he receives.
In CA, we have a program called In Home Supportive Services (IHSS) where the county social services agency pays for a caregiver to come to your home a few hrs a week to help w basic needs such as meal prep, cleaning, bathing.  There are eligibility requirements of course:  Medicaid patient, disability or condition that require support.  Think your dad is an ideal case for this type of help.  I think IHSS is an accompanying program to Medicaid so should be available in every state.  I would not recommend a nursing home for a person with depression as the homes are depressing themselves and the care standards can be low.  If he cannot continue independent living, a smaller board and care or group home is more likely to cater to his needs better.",2021-06-21 14:35:59,aswickedas,o522lq

,Options Between Assisted Living and Skilled Nursing,"Friends, I need some help.

My mother passed away about a year ago.  She had been the primary caregiver for my father, who is in his mid 80's and suffers from vascular parkinsonism.  I took over as his primary caregiver, but it was clear that he needed more care than I could provide.  He moved to an assisted living in January but has had several falls, the most recent one putting him in the hospital and then in rehab.

He is about to be discharged from rehab but his needs are now more than what the assisted living can provide (he needs ongoing supervision with transferring and walking).  To have a live-in caregiver at the assisted living will cost upwards of $14,000 a month.  This is not tenable.

My father is still somewhat independent -- he can feed himself, dress himself, he's continent, etc.  But he can't really move independently.  We are considering a scooter for him, and we are considering moving him into an apartment outside of a community with a live-in caregiver.  His mind is sharp, so I'd rather have him in a community with daily activities, etc.

My question is this -- **is there a level of care/type of facility that is appropriate for someone who is beyond what assisted living can provide but not ready for skilled nursing?**  Is there a search term I should be using that I don't know about?  I am writing from the US.

Thanks for any help.","I would call the place where he is doing rehab and ask to speak to the discharge planner.  They are usually social workers and can tell you what care options are available in your community.    The discharge planner will assess his needs and find out what level of care he needs.

I work at different nursing homes teaching gardening activities.  Different facilities have different focuses.   One I do does just memory care (one wing is early dementia, as patients progress they move to high-level memory care.

One nursing home I go to does skilled nursing and is also a common place where people go to do rehab.  So some residents live there long-term, others are only there for a couple weeks.  The long-term residents (as far as I can tell) have long-term medical conditions that they can't deal with at home so need to be in a facility, but are still mentally there. 

The third place I go to is a small independent nursing home in a small town. They do all levels of care (memory and rehab).  Since it's small town, everyone knows each other though any out-of-town residents are welcomed.   Just a different feel.

He might be interested in an adult family home.  They are home-like settings with 6 or less residents.  But they might have less activities.

I knew one resident who had Parkinson's and couldn't move on her own at all.  Her family found a CNA (certified nursing assistant) who had Parkinson's experience.  She worked independently, so was a lot cheaper than going through an agency.   You have to ask around to get the names of people who caretake independently.  The lady worked 8 hours a day and took the lady out for shopping and doctor visits, stuff like that.

Re-reading your post, I would talk to the discharge planner at the assisted living he was living at.  They might know what facilities are near-by that your dad would like.

Anywhere you go, I would check with the activities department, since activities is something that's important to you.  Find out what activities they have and if they are activities that will interest him.  There are a lot less men at facilities (women survive longer) so some activity departments don't do a good job of doing stuff that men are interested in doing.

I would say that since your dad has vascular problems, you might  want to look for a facility that has one wing that does skilled care and another that does memory care.  That way if he does have a stroke that affects his memory, you don't have to look for a new facility.  But remember that even if the facility you pick has a memory care unit, there's no guarantee that they would have a room open for him when/if he did have to move to memory care.  Check the admission paperwork to see what their policy is on switching people from one wing to another as they need more care.

Medicare sends social workers in to check on facilities every couple years.  Their assessment are available here  [https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare/?providerType=NursingHome&redirect=true](https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare/?providerType=NursingHome&redirect=true)and should always be available at the front desk of the facility.   Sometimes they are a couple years old, so staff that was a problem a couple years ago might not work there anymore.  So use those as a guideline.   

When you tour a facility, smell it.  Does it smell like urine?  They aren't paying housekeeping.  Watch how staff interacts with residents.  Stuff like that.
great comments here.  I am a former CEO of a broad continuum of senior living levels and it might be worth search on Adult Foster Care; think group home as was mentioned already.  These are often wonderful, home-like settings with capable staff in 1:3ish ratios.  I would advise researching history of concerns/complaints when you find 1-2 though because there is a sketch end of this business line as well unfortunately",2021-06-14 21:13:47,so2017,o021pb
,Caring for my father burnt out only 7 days in,"Before I begin a little backstory. I have a brother and a sister. I live with my brotther and father. My sister lives with her husband and kid. I was not close with my family. We had become estranged after many years of fighting. My dad and brother would drink a lot. I would smoke weed everyday and I had so for almost 10 years. But I managed to get sober and secure a job I could handle. I had saved up some money and was ready to move out with my fiance. When suddenly my dad had a stroke.
    He lost all movement on his right side. He cannot speak . He cannot do anything on his own from food to bathroom and needs round the clock care. Because I was sober I decided to be his care taker. Big mistake. I put off moving out and moving on with my life to do this.i even left my job . Big mistake. My brother said he'd help on the weekend but found any excuse to leave me and my dad alone for hours . My sister smokes more pot than me and she has a kid. So she's hardly around  and Dosent want to help. 
     For the past 7 days I wake up at 7am I help him use the bathroom. Feed him . Give him medication. Clean the house . Wash his clothes and sheets often covered in piss and shit. I never liked my father we were never close , but that Dosent mean I want him to suffer. 
    I just found out the doctors gave my brother a choice. To let my dad pass on or to attempt to save him with the caveat he would be wheel chair bound and unable to speak. They told him to consider the quality of life my father would want to have . Without discussing it with me , my sister or considering my father, he told the doctors to save my dad at any cost. Now he doesn't even help . He just goes to work and thinks that's enough. 
    I put my life on hold when it was just coming around. I've suffered years with drug addiction and depression, and it has taken years from my life. Finally I do the right thing and my brother decides to do something that reversed almost all of it. 
    It's no fair . I want to leave the family and never look back. They were abusive to me. And in a way still are. Should I leave? I hope someone reads this . 

Tldr: should I care for a father who was abusive to me? Or should I be selfish and make my life better?","You don’t say what country you live in but I will answer specifically to the US because it’s what I know. 

Either way. You need to leave. This is not your responsibility. Your brother made the decision without you so he can manage your father’s care without you. You owe these people nothing. 

I (someone who has been doing what you are experiencing this week for 10 YEARS) am telling you to go live a wonderful life. That isn’t selfish, that’s self preservation. They will suck you dry. Caregiving is incredibly difficult even when the person you are caring for deserves it. Your father doesn’t.

All that being said:

You can absolutely find a compromise between running out of the house this second leaving your father in his own filth and giving up your life. 

What I would recommend is to call social services. Most places also have Area Agency on Aging that can also help. They will evaluate your father’s needs and help your family make decisions. If you, during this process, make it clear that you will be moving out and going back to work by X date, they will not factor you into his care plan. 

Here are some examples of what might be determined:

Your brother might try to act like he has it all handled but you’ll need to speak up and tell them that your brother works full time and someone needs to be here while your brother is at work and that someone will NOT be you. Depending on the part of the country Social Services may provide a home health aide for your father for free or they may help your brother find on he has to pay for.

They might decide he needs so much care that he belongs in a Long Term Care Facility. If he is not able to pay for such a facility they will spend down any assets he has (the house?) and then put him on Medicaid to pay for it.

These people are experts at evaluating seniors in need. They will not leave your father to languish and be neglected by your brother.

If you do choose to stay, you should be paid by your father and/or brother for your labor. This is a job and going rate is $25/hr btw. You gave up an income to do this, you shouldn’t have to lose your working years. Also you should leave your brother with your father on the weekends.
Live your life while you can . We get what we give.  Feel no guilt for those in your family that want to use you. I’m 60 now and shit fire time flys.  Some things don’t come round again.
Area Agencies on Aging are called different things in different states.  Let me know if you need help finding the right number in your state.
I'm in a similar situation. My dad has been here for 2 weeks and he doesn't need the kind of care that your dad does, but it's hard enough just trying to look after him. I don't have a whole lot of patience and I deal with mental illness also so I don't feel like I'm well equipped for any of this. My dad did more emotional/ psychological abuse to me and I really don't feel like I want to take care of him. I couldn't imagine if the abuse had been any worse. In my opinion, most of this is on your brother because he's the one that tried to save your dad and now you're left to deal with the aftermath. That's not fair at all. I have a hard time saying what would be the right thing to do but I would have a very hard time also if I were you
I really feel for you. I've got similar, very complicated issues with siblings. Your brother may be motivated to help out if he realizes his ""home"" may be at risk, i.e., if your Dad has to go into a nursing home (if Dad can't afford to pay for the huge cost of in-home care).",2021-06-14 13:44:26,Puzzleheaded-Row5719,nzsfip
,My boyfriend has been caring for his disabled mother (chronic pain) everyday for years now. Can he receive compensation from the state?,"Hi,

Stumbled across this subreddit when doing research for my boyfriend’s situation.

So my bf has been caring for his mother who has been in chronic pain for 24 years, stemming from an improper epidural procedure during his birth. He is 24.

She is on disability and he takes over all of the responsibilities of the house and her needs. She is in bed all day usually, only up for periods up to an hour at a time. 

This is a lot for a 24 year old to manage on top of trying to build his own life and career.

We are from New Jersey. Is there any way my boyfriend can be eligible for compensation from the state? 

The only experience I have in this realm is that my mother got paid from NJ to be HER mother’s caregiver Bc she had Alzheimer’s and dementia. 

Thank you for ANY advice in advance!!","You might want to call her health insurance provider or her medicare/medicaid insurance for the answer to this one.  They should know the health insurance/ tax laws in your state.
He should call your local Area Agency on Aging.  They are a clearinghouse for all elder and disabled info--they are government funded, so they are unbiased and truthful.  They will tell him what the options are.   https://www.state.nj.us/humanservices/doas/home/saaaa.html
If she has medicaid and is eligible for a waiver, then yes he can be paid in most states. Contact your local Department of Social Services.",2021-06-10 10:13:24,justanothathrow-away,nwonb6
,What did you do for your elderly relative with early dimentia? Also a bit of a rant.,"My grandma has early dimentia and it's been tough on us. She needs someone to be with her almost every second that she's awake or she starts screaming that she's all alone and for her mom to come take her away and stuff like that. Sometimes we can make it to the bathroom just fine other times we have to sit in the toilet listening to her screaming in the livingroom until we can rush back to her. And even when we are next to her she will still randomly start screaming about something. We can't really do anything to entertain her since she can barely walk, she never learned to read, electronics confuse her and all of her grandkids either don't speak her language or barely speak it...and even if we could fully talk to her my parents, aunt and uncle say that she gets her words all scrambled up so they barely know what she's talking about. (Before she started with dimentia she passed the time by cleaning, cooking, gardening, crochet and tv but now all she can do from those options is watch tv) So from the time she wakes up to when she goes to bed someone has to sit by her and wait until someone else is able to sit next to her. I know it doesn't sound that bad but she still lives in her own house with my uncle who barely wants to take care of her (always trying to get someone else to take care of her asap but here the boys aren't really expected to take care of the family like that.) My mom (her DIL) works at night in another town so she can't take care of her too much without falling asleep, My aunt does do some stuff for her when she can like cleaning and doctor appointments but she's busy working (her schedule can be unpredictable) and doing other social stuff to be able to sit down with her for too long before she has to do something else. I do have 3 female cousins but one cousin did the majority of watching her when she lived with my grandma (this was when she was starting to get dimentia but we still came over and helped out) but she started complaining that taking care of our grandma and going to college and work was affecting her social life so as soon as she could afford her own home she left and never came back, one cousin just doesn't really take care of her too much idk why and my youngest cousin who is still in school is the only other person who watches her and the only reason I can take a break and stay home on the weekends. 
Im sorry if this sounds bad but sometimes I wish we had more help so I could go from watching her 4-6 days a week to 2-3 days a week. Has anyone had something like this happening with their family?","I am so sorry for your experience.   

Your grandmother's doctor is the starting point for treatment and accessing services, I hope.  It sounds like your family needs a break, and your grandmother may benefit from specialized services, like homecare.  And just maybe, she would be more comfortable in a senior's facility, where they have training  or at the least, other annoying old people screaming all day.  (kidding!  but...)

I was in your mother's shoes, and looking back I would have moved my mom into a home sooner rather than later, as I did.   In the end, it took way too much from my children and myself to put up with it.  Dementia doesn't get better, and she (your mom) won't get these years back.  God bless her, I understand the strong need to try as hard as you can.  She can visit the home, there will still be a great need there, to keep grandma well. At my mother's home, they call me the cleaning daughter.

At this point, I'd be going the medication route. Even if it's just a low-dose anti-anxiety/anti-depressant, it may calm her down enough to not be so manic.

Doctors are sometimes hesitant to medicate dementia patients, but in this instance, you're not necessarily medicating the dementia, but the high-strung anxiety.
Ask the doctor about SEROquel if she has Alzheimer’s. Many doctors are hesitant because it increases the risk of heart attack. BUT her quality of life will be so much better. My grandmother with dementia went from having a sundown episode almost every day, to only a couple times month.",2021-06-08 05:28:39,Jigglypuff2cute,nv0ss1
,Seeking advice on hiring live-in caregiver in California,"My 74 year old mother has alzheimer's and has been living with me for about a year and a half. I work full time and take care of her when I'm not at work. We have a little outside help - just enough to barely scrape by. Her needs for care are increasing and my availability isn't. I want to find a live-in caregiver to assist her full time 5 days a week. l am having a very hard time finding out how to get through all the red tape of minimum wage/overtime/sleep requirements. Agencies charge too much, I want to do a private hire. If you live in California and have a live-in caregiver, please message me! How did you figure out what to pay them? Are you following the rules or doing cash under the table? Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.","Be super careful hiring a live in caregiver… After a certain period of time they usually have rights as tenants and if they’re bad you have to follow the Tenant rules to evict them. Not ideal!
I’m privately hired by a family friend to take care of her 85 y/o dad and it’s been really great for me personally. Of course there’s the inherent stresses and I struggled in the beginning but I’ve settled into it nicely. 

My setup is different from what you’re looking from but maybe it’ll give some idea? I live in the house, have a bedroom and don’t pay rent, my groceries are covered and I get paid $1000 a month (under the table, just personal checks or cash).

I cook all of his meals, shop, keep up with laundry and light housework, make sure he takes all his meds and also that he showers and such. This is 7 days a week. If he’s having a rough day I have to stay home all day but otherwise I do leave the house to work another part time job/have a social life too. He goes to bed at 6-7pm too so I’m free during the evenings.

My other employer is flexible with me and knows I will have to leave immediately if there’s a problem or I will call off if I feel he needs additional help that day. 

That’s my setup, may be totally irrelevant to you but I figured I’d offer it up in case it helps.

Edit: I’m also in California.
Federally, there is something called the Companionship Services Exemption - but I don't know if California has something more strict in place.

Good place to start for the federal part -

,Short rant,"My wife has Me/CFS, luckily pretty moderate so they can usually do light stuff 1-3h a day, although it is is exhausting to them. Many I know have felt a relief through Corona regulations (more time to stay at home) but the first day I knew it's gonna be like that for some time (somewhere around last year) I knew that it would be much much harder for me. I have adhd (recently diagnosed and started medication) and I've been what feels like for years writing my thesis. If I have a good day, sometimes my wife doesn't and I have to make sure there's food on the table and they are cared for. If I have a bad day, it's hard to motivate myself beyond all the chores I already have to do in our life (cooking cleaning dishes and so on). Despite us both having our parents, everything seems so hard. I don't think anyone realizes how much effort it is to go through a day for us both.

I'm progressing so slowly and it makes me feel ashamed of myself. Many of my peers have already graduated and a job. Thanks to adhd I already felt like I'm lazy all my life. I wish I was an actual 'well spouse' and could do more.

It feels stupid to rant about this too, but my mother writes/calls me daily. I love her but the constant pressure of having to talk to her just eats me additionally. She doesn't respect any boundaries and today she called (I didn't take it) and then wrote 'I'm just best available in the morning' as if I didn't give her multiple talks that I will always always try to work on my thesis in the morning and I do not want to be disturbed. At this point it feels like she just wants to become a jobless bored housewife like herself.
(I know she doesn't but I'm too pissed to care).

Sometimes it feels like everything and everyone is demanding and it eats me alive. If it was only my wife it would be manageable, but at this point I almost feel like I'm babysitting my mother too.

I'm afraid I'll never be able to graduate at this pace, won't get a job and cannot give my wife the support they need. 

(no advice needed I'm just here to rant)","Not advice, but confirming that setting boundaries with your mother is an OK thing to do. All the best. 💚
My girlfriend has ME as well and I also have ADHD. I really relate to what you say about struggling to do all the chores on a bad ADHD day. It can feel like so much more pressure because you know the sick partner can't pick up your slack so you can't have much slack. I think after covid we will end up getting a cleaner just to take the edge off even though it will be a financial strain. You are not lazy though! Your ADHD is just as valid as your wife's illness even if it's less debilitating. It's okay to struggle with things, it's not a failing on your part. But yeah, it's not easy sometimes",2021-06-07 08:10:57,Blenderflower,nuavkq
,"It's time to get some paid help in for my dad, seeking best practices/advice on how to go about it.","My dad is nearly 90 and lives three hours away, my niece lives close by to him and can check in on him a few times a week, but she works two jobs and needs a life.

,Hired Chaperone??,"ETA: I’m going to cross post this, so sorry if you see it multiple times.
Hi, me again. I’m finally leaving my role as my mother’s caretaker after a very difficult year and a half. I have one last thing that I want to try and wrap up for her before I leave, and I’m not even sure where to look. She gets twice monthly ketamine infusions for chronic pain and needs someone to pick her up from these appointments. She doesn’t qualify to have a nurse or a caregiver paid for by insurance and I won’t be able to do it because I’m starting a masters program in another state. She doesn’t really have anyone else. This is really the last thing that is unfinished and I’d really like to have some sort of answer for her before I leave. Is there some sort of person one could hire to escort them home after an infusion like this?? I’ve been trying to google but results aren’t super helpful.","Even if your mom is too young for Medicare, senior centers or councils on aging can tell you where to start.  If you have to, local taxi services can do this, as well as Uber or Lyft, but it's not ideal.  Everything depends on what state you live in.

,What are my options for inheriting care of a sibling?,"I (37yo) posted a while back about my disabled (who I found out is not officially disabled...I don't even know how to get that assessed) sister who was in the care of our mother. Sister (39yo) has health issues out the wazoo and mental issues that she may or may not acknowledge and hasn't sought help for. Sis is in the U.S., I'm in Korea.

Basically, she can't/won't care for herself. She's in bed 23.5 hours a day. She won't make or return calls about her health care. If I leave her to her own devices I'm basically acknowledging that she'll either try to commit suicide or end up being dropped from all medical care for being noncompliant and...well I don't know what after that. I guess just waste away in a filthy house. If I suggest she do some particular thing due to the obvious fact that it MUST be done BY HER, she gets angry and refuses to talk or says that she's just waiting to kill herself anyway so I should just ""take a midol and get your shit together.""

Mom passed away, which was my ultimate fear, and now it's expected by family and husband and everyone who has never had to actually DO this that I care for sis. Which I already did for all of my twenties and ended up burning out hard, until my mom finally stepped in.

Anyway, when mom was sick prior to passing I went back to the states to care for sis and found it to be the same hell it was before. I settled mom's affairs after her death, set up home health for sis out of pocket since jumping through medicaid hoops in a time crunch was impossible, and had to get back to Korea in time to renew my spousal visa here that's about to expire. Currently in self quarantine as mandated by the government.

Sid is now sending messages that she hates the CNA who cares for her, doesn't know the status of her medications, doesn't believe any of her doctors who she says are gaslighting her, etc.

I...am exhausted by all of this all over again. Medicaid said they have no social workers, that there is no program through them for that. There's a short term case manager who basically just sends us phone numbers for checking out resources (crisis hotline, natural disaster hotline, etc) but doesn't act on sis's behalf in any way. The hospital said to call Medicaid to get a social worker, which the Medicaid short term case manager again said doesn't even exist through Medicaid. Her doctors are pissed that she never shows up to appointments and don't want to sign off on orders for assisted living (which sis said she wants) or home health, which we can't afford without Medicaid, and Medicaid requires doctors orders. She's been dropped by PCPs before for not keeping appointments, and won't call the new PCP back to schedule her next appt. It's all a huge jumble. I was trying to use home health until I can get back to the states with my husband, hopefully in the next 6 months, to try and sort this mess out. But even then I refuse to be a primary caregiver when we go back. It'll eat me alive all over again.

Are there any resources who can tell me what to do to get her into assisted living? Is there any kind of federal oversight for providing social workers or case managers? Any kind of funding if Medicaid refuses to pay any part of this? I got her on the waitlist for Medicaid's Long Term Care program, but the Medicaid person I spoke with said basically there are no promises and it'll probably be a year's wait at least. Mom had a very small life insurance policy and no retirement, so if I have to pay out of pocket for care I can make it oh...maybe 6 months using the insurance, tops. Is there any agency I can report sis's situation to, essentially stating that she's unable to or unwilling to care for herself and asking what to do?

Sorry, I know you're all exhausted. I tried googling resources and just got more of nothing, so I wanted to try asking those who may have been through this before.","Look for a geriatric care manager in your area.  https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/what-geriatric-care-manager

,my moms caregiver,"last year my mom attempted suicide but survived with brain injuries and left side neglect.

I am 22 and was chosen to be my moms temporary guardian. Although I want to do this im scared im not  going to be able to be responsible and selfless enough to take on a task like this. I struggle with depression myself and am struggling to keep my head on straight while im worrying about all of my moms meetings and therapies.

,Client is about to pass,"I’ve been a full time caregiver for over a year now, but I’ve only worked with one client. Their health began a rapid decline three weeks ago and they have maybe a couple of days left. 
I adore my client and it’s very difficult to watch them go through this, but I’m also worried about what happens after they pass because the agency I work for doesn’t have a great deal of clients- meaning I may be without a paycheck for a good chunk of time (one of my coworkers didn’t get another client until 3 months after her client passed). Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated, especially since I’m already financially strained. I’m in the US. 
My client also has two grown children who lost their other parent earlier this week and I can’t imagine the grief they’re going through right now. I want to do whatever I can to help them get through this. Any tips or advice on this would, again, be greatly appreciated. 
Thank you so much and I wish all of you ease of heart as you take care of others (and yourself).","I'm so sorry to hear about your beloved client's imminent passing; that must be so hard. To worry about employment stability on top of that must be especially difficult. Could you create accounts on sites like care.com, the carelinx app, or homecare.com? That way, if your agency can't find employment for you right away, you could perhaps pick up independent contracting work while you wait. Wishing you comfort and peace.
It's very draining work, and I agree you may need to step back from more difficult cases. However, right now caregivers are in demand. I'm a scheduler in the field, and if your company can't get you work, or you can't get unemployment for some reason, you could possibly look into a different company, but sign up for lighter work, or as a floater.

We hire people who only run errands, or do light housekeeping in addition to personal care caregivers. We also have a few people who only fill in for caregivers who are off for various reasons, from vacations to their own appointments or family reasons. 

The important thing is to take care of your own mental health while grieving, but not losing too much income from the loss of your client so that you worry about finances instead.
I am a parent caregiver for my 26 year old developmentally disabled son. I've been seriously considering a live in situation in the future to allow me to breathe a little and catch up on housework, crafts and garden.  I would offer low rent and proper accommodations as well as salary. I just wonder what the chances are of finding a live in kind, compassionate caregiver? Someone for long term care and who enjoys the job of helping someone, being part of a home and have a safe, quiet and comfortable living situation for themselves. My son is nonverbal but no behaviors, loves music, kickball and his iPad.  I really hope I can find a loving person for him.",2021-05-29 03:21:16,poyitjdr,nni0ni
,New to the community and compassion fatigue,"Hi everyone. I'm new to this community, but I wanted to post because I just need to vent. For the last 2 1/2 years I've been my mother's caregiver, and I've been on a break for the last 2 months. She has myotonic dystrophy type 1 (I believe it's type 1 thats adult onset sometimes I forget). I had to step away because it was destroying me mentally and physically, plus I got to a point where I ran out of empathy, sympathy, compassion, and my resentment became heightened. Don't get me wrong she is being cared for by my dad so she's ok, and I do love and care for her, but our relationship has always been rocky. She doesn't respect any boundaries I set and her personality just doesn't mesh well with mine. I'm sitting with her for my dad today, and I was talking about the state of my mental health she cut me off and made a comment about my teeth. I know that cognitive decline is a symptom of her disease, but she's always been like this. There's been times she's commented on my weight, skin, teeth (called me snaggle tooth and said my tooth breaking off is an embarrassment since she was a hygienist), and its been like that my whole life. She's not a mean spirited person and I know she loves me, but she's been the source for some of the insecurities I developed throughout life. I feel like a real asshole saying all of this, but it's the truth. I'm just fed up with the situation, and tired of the guilt I feel. I'm afraid that the situation has permanently altered the way I respond to other people's emotions and pain.","You'll be okay.  You need more recovery time away from her.  It doesn't sound like you can/should step back into your primary caregiver role.  It's hard, but you have a right  not to destroy yourself.
I feel like dealing with my wife's newly-diagnosed illness has made me more empathetic to people in these situations, i.e. following this subreddit. But I don’t have the best relationship with my mother and would certainly recommend boundaries and protecting your mental/physical/emotional health. It's good that your dad can be her primary caregiver and you can step in when he is unavailable. There are so many folks on here suffering these toxic relationships. I know I'm a better caregiver to my wife than I would be to my mother, just because it is a different relationship. Do the best you can for you.
Go easy on yourself!! If you were a horrible person you would not have even posted this.  Myself and my 2 kids older kids are doing 24/7 care for my husband, their dad.  We haven’t been doing it very long but we get exhausted and go without sleep often. He is as sweet as the day is long, I can’t imagine how hard it would be if he wasn’t.
I’m sorry your mom is hurting you with words(my mom was like that too) .  I don’t have any suggestions on how to stop it but if you could see it as an opportunity to grow spiritually that would help.  There’s some videos I watched on utube that changed me dramatically!  Life after afterlife series. The one called Tragedy by Design was one I watched several times.  I hope it helps you.  Be kind to yourself please.
Sorry for the delayed comment, but after years of taking abuse from some of my family members, I’ve started calling them out. If I were in your situation, the next time my mom says something mean, I would look directly into her eyes and say “That’s not very nice!!” Repeat that every time she says something unkind, and hopefully she will learn that 1) you do not like this, and 2) she, not you, will be the one feeling the stress from a stinging comment
I read your post... and it makes me sad to say that, with the exception of a couple obvious specificities, I could have written it.
I don’t know what it is about mothers and daughters... or their generation. My mother is great at insulting me, terrible at showing any gratitude... yet completely unable to be self-aware about her own emotional state etc.
     All I can say to you is that I understand. If you didn’t care, you wouldn’t be trying so hard.
     Also, therapy can be really helpful. 
     I can see now... no matter what I do or how well I do it, I will never get her approval. She can be ugly, cruel, bitter and cold. I keep trying to come at the situation with love and a sense of humor... but she can’t hear well and it’s always frustrating. 
       I don’t have answers... but it is a bit comforting to know I’m not the only one trying to deal with this added layer of BS. Hang in there.",2021-05-28 13:47:53,BiscottiNecessary680,nn3ds9
,"Burnt out, 28 months and counting","Happened to stumble across this subreddit today. I’m 30 years old and I have been living with and taking care of my 82 year old grandmother who has COPD and is pretty far along into her dementia for 28 months and counting. Half the time she knows who I am, but she always thinks there are other people in the house. This lady is the most impatient and flat out mean person I have ever met. She’s constantly mad about her situation and takes it out on me. She accuses me of stealing, moving things from their usual spot so they get misplaced, hiding other people upstairs. Her tone and instant condemnation has worn me down so much that I had to get back on my anti-depressants. Unfortunately, my uncle who controls her finances only pays me $50/week for being her and being her mental abuse punching bag. 

I don’t have another job so I’m here all the time and I find it extremely difficult to not find some temporary relief in drinking with the little amount of money I’m given.  The other day she was arguing with me and got upset that I stood my ground and tried to get her to understand my perspective and she took the knife she was using to cut up a cabbage and pointed it at me while shaking it and coming at me. I’m fed up with how little I’m being paid to deal with the most stressful situation I have ever had to endure in my life. My father and I promised my grandfather that we wouldn’t out her in a home, but I don’t think he ever imagined her getting this bad.

Sorry for the wall of text, but just needed to vent.

What family do you have for support.  How did you get there and do you want to get out ?
Is more money going to help your head?  Seriously, if you can't get to a place where you can ""one day at a time"" your grandmother's care without constant stress, you need to bail.  Tell your Dad you're done and look for a new job and a new living situation while you both figure out what happens to Grandma.
I just discovered this sub, and am new to caregiving, but have you looked into state aging services? States do offer it for Medicaid, not Medicare, clients. They will do an evaluation, and determine how much help she can get. It's not necessarily a lot of hours per week, but it could offer you some. In addition, a lot of caregiving companies will hire you to take care of your own family member.

I would guesstimate that 10% of my company's employees are hired by us to take care of a parent, sibling, or grandparent via Medicaid aging services. The company is signed up with Medicaid, so you would be paid by the caregiving agency, who is paid by Medicaid.

Try googling your state, and Medicaid aging home services to start with.
Depending on the state some  states have budgets for PCA's personal care attendants and the family member hires you to be the caregiver.  You could call the medicaid state office to see if they have a PCA program in order for you to get paid.
There's a pot of money from Older Americans Act and others that states have for respite care workers and some home services, cleaning cooking bathing.  This is all done without Medicaid, I don't think it involves medicare either. I'm the live-in caregiver and can't get paid but the respite worker does for up to however many hours a week and some more hours for extended leave, i. e. overnights.  I traded more home worker coverage for more respite hours.  They do cover a bath aid twice a week.  the Area Agency on Aging did the interview and intake and set us up with the home health agency and the respite care agency.

,A family devastated by pain,"My husband has flair ups, takes medication daily, uses electronic stimulation on his back daily. He needs massages often. While he walks, goes to work for 8 hours and in his mind is functioning just fine. For myself personally, lack of travel, lack of ability to enjoy out time for an afternoon out. He has about a 2-4 hour max before he explodes, needs to medicate, and has to rest for down time of about an hour. I know I’m not in the worst situation. He could be completely immobile. He could be bed ridden day in and day out (who knows, that might be our future). To say the lease things have impacted me very deeply on the emotional end. My background is complicated. But honestly growing up I had a lot of trauma. Grew up as a runway in my youth, became homeless as a young adult, was in an abusive relationship and then escaped. I had a daughter, got my life straight and was trying to learn how to be the best mother I could be. I never wanted to have children nor be married. My personality is neurotic and selfish in nature so the idea of nurturing others was never a largely interesting concept to me. So, I had my daughter by getting pregnant in a terrible way. Then a year later became religious, was dating a good man and decided marriage would be the next step. A year later my husband was in a devastating car accident. It’s been a long road of surgery, law suit, doctors appointment, medications and breaking points. I had no idea how depressed I was in all this. Now I have two children and feel completely trapped in a life that everyday feels like misery. I’m a journalist and would think to myself what if my life was different. These thoughts led me to falling for someone who had a similar career as myself. I sought council and then told my husband. After telling my husband, we have never been so close to divorce. He feels like I cheater on him for having room in my heart for someone else. Mind you I never expressed my feelings. They were just thoughts in my head about what if I wasn’t with someone in chronic pain, how would my life be different. I know what I did was wrong to allow my heart to be in a place of weakness and allowing my family to be vulnerable to a potentially dangerous situation. What if I acted on my thoughts, it would have been Devastating for my family. I want to be the best mother I can. I want to be the best wife that I can. When my husband has flare ups I spiral into depression. If I talk to him about how his pain effects me he says it’s abusive because I’m bringing up something he can’t control. My marriage is falling apart and I can’t remember the last time I was happy for more than a week. I have no idea what to do. I’ve cut off all relationships with men seeing that my heart is in a very weak place and I don’t want to have thoughts about what if my life was different. Does anyone else understand what I’m going through? Am I just a shitty human that needs to suck it up and just ignore my emotions? Help needed.","You're not a shitty human, just a human.  Watching a loved one in constant pain is devastating and exhausting.  If I had one wish from a genie or something I would immediately wish for my partner to be healed and well.

Don't abuse yourself by calling yourself names.  The heart wants what it wants.  You didn't think with your heart, you made the right choice for your family.  Hopefully your husband can see that if he gets passed his own hurt.  If he can't see it, that's really sad for him, given the way you've really shown up for him.

You deserve hugs.  You deserve support.  You have an incredibly hard job that comes with a soul crushing responsibility to people who are *completely* dependent on you.  You can't do that job in a vacuum and you can't do it for long if you're miserable with your life.  You *need* things in your life that make you happy, and you need to hold them sacred.

I'm a big nerd.  I love playing D&D with friends, playing Minecraft with my son, listening to SciFi audio books and having time to work on my own personal projects.  If I don't make that time and do those things, I won't be in a good happy supportive space for my partner and we will all suffer as a result.  What makes you happy?  You need to create space for it or your marriage and your mental health won't survive.
I see that a big part of your depression is due to caregiver burnout. It is time to find ways to get your husband some help from other caregivers who can share the load and unburden you so that you can have time and energy to develop yourself into the person you want to be. Have you gotten him on disability pay?  Does his health insurance allow for in home caregivers? Sign him up! You need some free time to spend with your children and to get a career going if you haven’t. You should not have to spend every waking hour dealing with your husband’s pain issues. He will have pain, but you shouldn’t have to be his only caregiver. Don’t feel guilty for having your own needs and desires. That’s only human.",2021-05-18 12:15:43,futureofminds,nfetn5
,Caring for an ungrateful father,"My father had a stroke more than 15 years ago and his condition has worsened a lot over time. Used to be my mum taking care of him but she’s in bad shape now and I’ve taken over while we look for alternative solution.

Daily routine: diaper changes, meals, shower, potty, getting him meds ready 

We gave up our daughters room for him. We try very hard to engage him. Eg, we bring him out for walks where we move him around in a chair, try to start conversations, etc. But he’s never interested and doesn’t express any gratitude. Even getting him to have meals is a tiring process as he will always complain that he’s not hungry or has not appetite. However he will happily help himself to snacks during meal times.

I don’t mind doing all the dirty work but the lack of appreciation and cooperation is really getting to me. I know it’s not possible, but sometimes I just want to throw him out on the streets and let him suffer for a few weeks so he will know how good he’s having.","Totally understand. The complaints are exhausting. My mother gets more miserable everyday.
Not a doctor.

Sounds a little like he has vascular dementia. Stuff like this can impact his ability to have any kind of basic social grace. If this is the case, you gotta remember that it’s the disease talking, not your father.

Also sounds like respite care might not be a bad idea. If you need a break, you need a break. No matter why your father acts the way he acts, your feelings are valid and you have to remember that you can’t take good care of someone when you yourself are physically or mentally exhausted of them.

Sometimes a week’s rest can really set some things straight, for you and for your father.
It can be so emotionally draining. My mom only opens her mouth to complain. If I try to talk to her about anything she interrupts me to complain.
I think sometimes people in these situations resent the very act of being taken care of, especially by their children/children's spouses, or consider it humiliating. They may not even realize that, but it doesn't make it easier on you. What you're handling is a lot and it's understandable that you're so frustrated you're not feeling appreciated. I'm sorry that's happening.",2021-05-15 08:21:34,chronoistriggered,ncxnhd
,Caregiving job with pre-intermediate English,"My mother (58 years old) is moving to the US to be closer to my sister and I (we both live in the US) and her grandchildren. Due to our circumstances she will not be able to live with either of us. Once she moves, she wants to start working immediately. One of the options she is considering is becoming a live-in caregiver (she will need room and board).

A little bit of her background:

She's a doctor with decades of experience (generalist with certificates in cardiology) - I think this must be a big plus. Well, obviously, she will not be able to transfer her skills and work as a doctor here in the US.

She had taken care of her parents until they passed away.

She's very caring and extremely responsible and I'm 100% certain anyone will like her.

The thing that troubles me is that her English is very basic at this moment. And I don't think she will be able to hold a conversation, at least in the beginning. She's learning though and making some very good progress but I think it will take her some time to get comfortable with the language. She is Russian.

She has never driven a car - a big minus here in the US. This thing concerns me a little as I don't know if it's easy to learn to drive at her age. I'd definitely be uncomfortable with her driving on the highways.

Assuming that someone will hire her what level of compensation can she expect? We currently live in Northern Virginia (Washington DC metro).

How easy would it be for her to find a job?

Or is it not an option at all?

If it doesn't work out, she will just move back but we'd like her to stay and live in the US.","They have aps on phones for folks to use to translate, until they learn the language. 

It's always an option,  There is a shortage of good caregivers, as long as she's here legally. 

Because, private duty as well as agencies will do backgrounds, etc.

,"Where to even start,","how do you guys do this without pulling your eyes out. I’ve recently acquired this horrendous job and just when I thought corporate America was bad this is a million times worse. My wife has recently been diagnosed with RSD known as the suicide disease and a rare brain disease called IIH. She’s become wheelchairs bound and her leg is so sensitive with nerve pain that anything as light as a feather makes her scream in pain that it’s hard to even stand next to her while she’s screaming. Both my wife and I are 23 years old and where the normal people my age are out getting drunk and starting the next chapter of there lives after college, I’m home collecting my wife’s pee in a Starbucks venti cup, carrying her up and down the stairs, and everything in between. I basically have no family after my mother kicked my wife and I out of the house because I wouldn’t clean the gutters. (Mind you I’m a 5”3 female.) but the worse thing is she called my wife the N word, bitch slave while kicking us out. 

So again I know this may not even be the worse situation in world but how the hell do you guys stay? How do you guys not cry? How do you guys keep the little monsters out your head?","It's rough. Being a caregiver has been one of the hardest things I have ever done because there is no significant break.

Definitely look into support groups in your area, particularly ones that are closely associated with your wife's illness/disease. Look into resources that insurance covers like home help aides. Sometimes they allow for nurses to come out for a few hours to help. If you don't have insurance, there may be some free or low cost help. Seek out a therapist if you start to feel too emotionally overwhelmed.  It's not easy, but they can help you find ways to deal. There are some free or low cost options there too. Finally, try to make time for yourself. You need to be at your best to be there for her.

And honestly, I do just go have a good, hard cry. I have broken down in the bathroom for a minute because I'm human and I needed to. I remind myself that my grandparents need me, and I try my best to help. But sometimes, I need to just get it out too. It's not forever. At some point it will end, but when it does I'll know I did everything I could to make that time easier for them. I made sure they were taken care of and knew that I loved them and was looking out for them. 

Best of luck, OP.
Make friends with the monsters and cry whenever you feel like it. 

You need some help. Your job as caregiver is ensure your spouse gets access to the help they need as well as provide what you can give. Emphasis on the 'give'. Take what and whom you can get. 

 I write this aware of your age and that your financial situation may not be... ideal. But those stairs (for example) gotta go. They will kill you and possibly injure your spouse. 

Anything else that gets in the way of you caring for your spouse has to go. Maybe not forever, but simplify please. 

Then you can go to bed plagued by the sadness and the monsters, but not by guilt. 

Love and good luck from another spousal caregiver.
It's ok to cry and feel whatever emotion comes up. To echo what the previous replies have said, you need help. Don't try to do it alone. It can lead to burnout or compassion fatigue. Don't forget to make yourself a priority sometimes.
Have breakdown and cry a lot, get angry and the world and then try to give myself as much credit as possible. Notice that I'm not alone with this and it's okay to be angry. Appreciating all the good things I have in my life too. 

Your situation sounds extremely tough, and your mom on top of it all... that's shitty af.
I was thrust in a situation with my father recently, and neither of us were anticipating being in this position for many, many years. I cried a lot and still cry every now and then. It's a taxing, draining situation. I wish I had better answers for you. I talk to my therapist a lot about this situation. If you are able to, I would encourage you to look into therapy for yourself. You may also want to see if there are any disability services your wife would qualify for like an in home nurse to help alleviate some of your burden. 

I hope you can get things figured out and that things start to turn around soon for you!
your wife is lucky to have you. not the worse situation? it's all relative, but even if not, your situation sounds pretty near that point.

and so while getting stupid drunk sounds like something you should be doing, it's really overrated. seriously. it \*does\* suck that your next chapter out of college is not getting into the career you went to college for, but that can probably come later. your wife was recently diagnosed, so maybe her doctors haven't fully discussed possible treatments which can alleviate most of the symptoms of RSD, and possibly cure IIH. do some research and discuss what you find with her doctors.

those monsters never leave your head. they may hibernate for awhile but they sure as shit will pop up whenever they feel like it. i'm lucky though cuz it's mom that i am caregiving and unlike yours (who, sorry to say this, really sounds like a monster), i totally love me mum to  bits and am happy that i can care for her (most times--it's a roller coaster ride and the beginning was a definite learning curve, but at the core of it, i wouldn't have it any other way). good luck.",2021-05-09 22:28:32,Inwittsend,n8tmd6

If you don't have time to look up services that could help you, if you let me know your state, I could throw together some information that could be of use.

Its such a cruel position to be in. And it feels like nobody knows just how taxing it can be on the caregiver. It takes a village. You can't raise kids in a vacuum, and you can't care for the dying in a vacuum. Do not expect yourself to do the latter in a vacuum!!!

How are you? Learn anything new recently? What shampoo and conditioner do you use?
I'm saying this to you and myself: You have intrinsic value and you do not need to be a people pleaser. 
If the person you're caring for qualifies to be placed in a home, do it, and visit and make sure they are getting the care they need as often as it makes you happy.

,False Allegations,"Someone called APS and said that I and my grandfather are severely neglecting my grandmother. It could not be further from the truth! They said that we withhold her medicine, that she's lost over 100 lbs since December, that we starve her, that she's covered in bedsores. All lies! Out and out lies! 

She went to the hospital on Friday because she thought she was having a stroke. They didn't find any stroke evidence and believed she may have possibly had a TIA, which she has a history of, but that there was no damage and no last effects. I came home and the APS agent showed up then wanting to speak to her. I told her that she was at the hospital. The hospital pretty well backed me up, and my grandmother told them the truth. I talked to her then as well. 

Unfortunately, I'm trying to get into nursing school and these false accusations may well prevent me from getting in. Even when they are found to be untrue, it will still follow me and make it extremely difficult to get in and get my liscense. I've worked so hard and juggled so much to get here just to have it snatched away by malicious bullcrap.

I'm so angry, frustrated, and disheartened. I don't know what to do, and I just needed to rant. The role of caregiver is a hard one, and crap like this makes it 1000 times harder. At least I have the knowledge that my grandparents are in fact well taken care of. I make damn sure of that.","If she is being abused or neglected the Doctors and Nurses at the hospital would typically notice signs of abuse or neglect. That's not to say they catch everything but if she was being severely abused or neglected in the manner mentioned in the APS report I would expect to see some kind of medical evidence and I would also expect trained medical professionals to notice it. Anyone can file an APS report, they don't even really need evidence, it can be pretty subjective depending on who made the complaint. I would cooperate with APS so they can close the case and hopefully that will be the end of it. There should also be social workers at the hospital that you could speak to and maybe get some better advice on how to handle the situation.",2021-05-03 17:41:01,KuriKoi,n4867l

,Advice for a double whammy with an international twist...,"Hi all, I'm lost and hope some of you may know how to begin approaching this...

Four years ago I moved abroad, where I met and married my husband. I still live abroad as we get paperwork in order for my husband's visa. It takes about a year and he can't travel to the U.S. during processing.

At the time I left, my older sister was disabled and being cared for by our mother, who was taking over as caregiver from me after I'd done it for ten years. Sister has autoimmune disorder, takes a lot of pain meds as a result, and has some mental health issues that cause her to be angry and, well, just mean. Really spiteful. She can no longer wash herself, she often refuses to go to health appointments, etc. She needs things done a certain way or they aren't good enough, refuses to schedule or be responsible for her own healthcare, yadda yadda.

A few weeks ago my 65 y.o. mother contracted covid at work (she's a nurse). She tried to convalesce at home, got worse, and has been hospitalized for 2 weeks now. I was trying to avoid coming back because of covid restrictions on travel, and honestly because I have a lot of jarring emotional pain from dealing with my sister. My mom, when she was cognizant, had also told me to please not come because it's dangerous, I can't come visit her in the covid unit anyway, etc. The thought of returning really did a number on me, but eventually I couldn't avoid it. Mom is still in hospital, and sister refused to use meal/grocery delivery services even if I offer to do it from abroad, laid a heavy guilt trip about the cats suffering because she can't care for them, decried the state of the house, etc. A neighbor brought food for her but it wasn't what she normally eats so she refused to eat it. Sis also swears she has covid too. When I said I'd stay at a hotel instead of at the house  she told me I'm ""overthinking this covid stuff"" and that she's somehow simultaneously dying from it yet not contagious to me so I should get over myself. I arrived last night, tried to quickly get her a meal and clean up the worst of things while internally I was freaking out about getting covid with no health insurance here and being refused entry to go back home if I test positive for the mandatory preflight covid test. I wore a mask and gloves, but my sister refused to even after I brought a mask for her...told me her cough was that she swallowed a cookie wrong.

My mother may not recover. She's been unable to eat for weeks, has made no signs of recovery, just maintains at the edge of needing a ventilator. My aunt is telling me to prepare for the worst. I'm dealing with the emotions of that realization on top of the sister baggage. Last time mom was able to rasp out a phone call, she was confused and very very emotional, and asked me to help set up social security for her because she didn't think she could bounce back from this even if she recovered enough to go home. She cried and told me she can't handle taking care of my sister any more. She hates that someone has to help her go to the bathroom, she's on ativan to keep her calm...just all a big mess. I'm worried covid is bringing out some beginning signs of dementia, something my sister often attacks my mom with, that she's senile.

I'm lost. Cried out and feeling hollow. Recently my husband and I had talked about starting a family before it was too late (I'm 36), and now I'm dealing with the realization that I may be responsible for the care of two disabled family members...or one and the death of my mother. Feels like my chance at a normal life has been flushed down the toilet, and I'm so guilty for bringing this family trouble into my marriage with a normal guy whose parents and siblings are all spry and mentally sound. I have no current income to cover mom and sister, used my last savings just to make this trip. I had quit teaching English when covid started and had been planning to start working again when we moved to the U.S.

The most pressing concern is that I have to return abroad in 2 weeks (my spouse visa has to be renewed), and I don't know how to get any kind of care set up for my mom and sister during the time I have here. Sister has medicaid (if she hasn't been dropped for being noncompliant) and mom has basic insurance from work, but she took out all of her retirement money four years ago to help my sister with debt and...honestly I don't know where it all went, but her retirement is gone.

The house is in a state. Looks like a hoarder lives there, and my sister just has piles of garbage around her that she says she hasn't had the energy to throw away. I have to get it cleaned up so that a home health worker would even be able to walk around. Hopefully without getting sick myself while I try to do it. I also need to give my sister a home covid test. Sister refuses to go out and have one.

As evidenced by this crazy long, nonsensical, and ridiculously personal post, I'm a little emotionally compromised at the moment and I don't know where to start. My mother's family are all feeding me lines that basically equate to ""glad you're back, you're so strong and brave, let us know if you need something, but you know, not really."" I have no father to give me any direction or advice. I feel like a little lost kid and I don't know what step 1 is. Any ideas about resources, how to start, anything would be so helpful.

Edit: Thank you all for your advice, it's been a help. Mom succumbed to covid on 5/4. My sister continues to lash out after a brief period of being more kind/self aware than I thought she was capable of. Guess she was on best behavior or maybe in some way affected by mom's death. Yet tonight's meltdown was that I'm an asshole ""just like mom"" and that she's just waiting to kill herself and wouldn't that be a favor to me anyway, etc. I had to just walk out for the night, told her I'd be back tomorrow. I'm trying to get home health care arranged for her...and rent, utilities, everything. It's been a challenge, not to mention there's no opportunity to just grieve. Then walking into her room to check on her knowing that she's poised to pick at whatever's not good enough in the moment is daunting. I get it, she's sick and depressed. But I don't know how to tell her it's not my fault and I don't want this to be my life like it ended up being for mom. Crying on her deathbed that she couldn't do it anymore.

Anyway, if for any reason someone is reading this post and a loved one has passed due to covid, please check out the FEMA funeral assistance that may be available to you. If the death certificate lists covid as cause of death, you're probably eligible.","Wow.

Hats off to you for doing the ten year sister care.  At this point I would concentrate on your mother.  Talk to the hospital social worker, they should be able to start you in the right direction.  This is going to sound heartless, but seek custodial care for your sister.  Your mother can't safely come home while your sister is in the house.  See if you can get a home care agency to evaluate your mom: if they accept her as a client you will have a non-family contact to help.
I'm your age and also a caregiver. I've been at it for a while. I want to tell you honestly that no matter what happens with your mom, you SHOULD NOT take on care of your sister. It's very sad, and her life will be a mess, but if you try to take care of her, she's going to drown you along side of her. Don't ruin two lives. Save yourself. Even if she has to go to a group home, even if the worst happens to your mom and her last wish is that you take care of your sister, SAVE YOURSELF. Save the cats. Save your marriage.
Holy crap.  That's a lot.  I hope your mom recovers and is happy to breathe freely again.

About your sister... I'm going to go against the prevailing ideas in this subreddit.  You can't help someone who doesn't want help.  It's impossible.  They will find a way to be miserable and hurt themselves.  It seems like you're fighting to get her to being a happy, healthy, fun member of your family.  What if that never happens?  Cuz it sounds like it'll never happen. 

Also, you're setting yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.  Stop that.  And can you get vaccinated ASAP please?
Don't give up your chance for a normal life to care take your sister. There are companies that accept medicaid either to go to her home and care for her there or move her into a facility. At most all you should be responsible for is renewing her insurance and visiting but every day care is too much for one person.
This all seems impossible... because it is.  There is no way you can handle all this alone. Seek a patient advocate at the hospital, for your mother.  If she needs hospice care (I'm sorry), Medicare covers that in my state. And they are superb, very helpful not only for the patient, but for the family, too. 

Your sister, I'm sorry to say, cannot stay home any more. The hospital patient advocate and/or the hospice people will have viable suggestions for long term care for your sister. If nothing else, you may have to remand custody of her to the state, but that's a last ditch approach. I would start with her rheumatologist or whoever her specialist is. It could be that modifying her meds could modify her demands. Give this a chance. 

But don't sacrifice your life for them this way.  This cannot go on. Professional help is not just an optional thing here, it's essential immediately. 

Good luck, get vaccinated if you can, and good luck. Ps, be grateful your husband's family is healthy, or you would be doing this on two continents.
Please get some help with all of this. You are NOT responsible for your sister or mother for that matter. Help them as much as possible but you have done so much. I wish I could do more to help your situation. Please follow some of the advice of the others here. This situation is beyond one person’s ability. Trust us.",2021-04-30 11:13:21,,n1vygn
,Stubborn Grandma is driving family nuts,"Dear Reddit,
I (f) am having trouble getting my grandmother (97) to do or tolerate much of anything, even for her wellbeing. She is remarkably healthy for her age and strangers regularly comment on how young she looks. Her only physical hindrances are a pinched sciatic nerve (it's genetic) that she takes aspirin for and hearing loss. I believe she may be in the beginning stages of Alzheimer's, but she has been playing at frail-old-ditzy-lady 50+ years and its hard to tell. Lots of ""gotcha!"" moments that make me question if she really is hard of hearing. She plays it up when she gets upset and I have to use speech to text in those cases. The last time she went to the doctor he said she was fine and shoved an oxy prescription in her hand. We were not impressed.
She's also stubborn and can be quite mean, always has been always will be. It takes days of nagging and begging to get her in the tub to wash for which she refuses help and RIPS out any railing I install. She won't cleanse herself at all without some repeated prompting. I can only wish she would change clothing or wear her Depends as I end up cleaning her chair often.  Plagued by eczema, she scratches herself bloody raw and scrapes the very expensive cream off that I apply almost immediately. She won't let me clean the house, and I spend most late nights dusting and thowing away stacks and stacks of old broken junk that she values above all else. She flails, kicks and screams if anyone tries to make her do anything especially if it involves leaving the house. All she really wants is to sit in her chair, read, and play her crosswords. 
Just got her second shot yesterday and lets just say she fought us so hard that now I know she is not full of just hot air... Once she was clean and dressed she transformed into mild mannered grammy and went quietly to the car, talked and laughed with those in line, and even had fun with my Aunt and I on our little country drive. Like it never happened. She has always been an odd duck, but she's done this for the last two years. I'm exhaused!
I'd love to have a nurse or somthing come in to help, but I have a feeling that will go over like a lead balloon. We don't have the money to send her to a good care facility thanks to her embezzeling pastor, and there is no way I'm just handing her off to any old place. Is this anxiety? Desperately need advice!

TL;DR: My Grandma won't work with me and if this goes on I might get charged with neglect","Record her fits and behaviours and ask the doctor for advice.  It's very common for patients to behave weird at home and differently in public.
If she has Medicaid you may be able to get a PCA or HHA to come in and help out. She'll probably object to it and throw a fit. I would try and see if I could get a neruropsych exam ordered just to see what might be going on in that head of hers.
Thank you! I'll see if I can catch her without her being suspicious.
Im pretty sure if you try hard enough you can find an alzheimer test you can administer online somewhere for your own piece of mind. Hell I saw a doctor tell a patient to repeat 3 things back to her. When she couldnt he basically said she had alzheimer. 

 You should definitely try to hire a caregiver if you have the money. Just to see how it goes for the harder stuff like bathing. Someone with a lot of experience would really know how to better handle your mom in these situations.",2021-04-29 16:00:34,Feline_just_fine,n1ctgu
,Caregiving for Parents Sucks! I don't know where to draw the line...,"Here is my issue:


I have been taking care of my Mother since about 2010, and a bit from 08-09. I also took care of her when I was a little kid. I've been living with her since 2015 in a small apartment that is very, very, small. In 2009 she had cancer and wanted to make sure everything was taken care of and she signed a Power of Attorney making me her POA. Luckily I can't remember a time when I needed to invoke it except once at housing court when she was in the hospital and couldn't make it to court. Over the last 2-4 years she has been making large purchases without speaking with me. I do a budget at the beginning of the month and I ask that she loosely stick to it and if either of us wanted to make a large purchase we would discuss it as one of us spending a lot of money effects the other person's finances. I have been trying to keep her on a budget for years but she buys shit she doesn't need, she buys from scam sites, she makes mistakes in ordering, I could go on and on. 


She has her own checking account. We are both on disability, she get's more than I do yet every month on cue she is broke by week 2-3 and I get to pay for everything for her. Her food, her medicine, her medical bills, her transportation, I could keep going on. She ignores any financial advice I give and promises to stick to our budget then never does. I believe a promise is a promise. She makes these promises and doesn't stick to them or follow through with them. She got upset tonight because I told her that her word meant nothing to me because she can't agree to things she promised she would do as agreed upon by both of us. 


My question is: Is it time to invoke the POA and take over ALL her finances? I feel like it's kind of a scorched earth policy if I do that but it may be time. I had her evaluated by a neuropsychologist and she said my Mother's IQ is 71, just one point from making her mentally challenged. I don't want to have to take away what little financial freedom she has but every month it effects my bank account as I have to pay for/cover everything after she runs out of money. 


I spend hours a week taking care of her and have never even considered being financially compensated, it was just a labor of love and I know no one can take care of her better than I can. I just want us both to be happy and right now one of us is always unhappy and most of the time it is me. She's only 52 so she will probably fight me tooth and nail if I tried to take over her finances but she doesn't give a shit about money, if she thinks she might need it she will buy it. I don't want to get hardcore here, I already told her I would have some tough decisions to make when our lease is up since I'm just not happy with my/our current situation.","I dont know what you mean by invoking  A POA. That only happens if it makes you a POA by a certain event.

Being a  POA doesn't give you anything but what you are doing.  Able to sign for her.

You would have to take her to court and deem her incompetent and you her guardian. Or a Psychologist would have to insist that there is an indelible POA that cannot be revoked but You are STILL not in charge. But check your local laws or talk to an attorney.

I am POA for my mother and she is 82
Are there other ways you could go about limiting her spending before invoking the POA? Like, creating a separate checking and savings—and she only has access to the checking & a certain agreed-upon amount of money. You both contribute the relative portion of your incomes to the savings for shared living expenses. And, just to mention, if credit cards are involved—cut those up immediately. IANAL, but this is what I would think about doing by reading from your situation. Best of luck!
This is my advice if you want it. Set up an automatic check to be sent to you (or just set up an automatic transfer if you’re at the same bank) for her share of the household expenses (and/or if you can, have her share automatically sent to the landlord, etc.). Set up automatic payments for the bills that are hers only, to be paid from her account.  Make all of this happen every month right after her check comes in. Fix her account so there’s no overdraft protection and ask the bank not to fund or allow any overdrafts. That way, if she tries to spend more than she has, it will most likely be declined. Set up an automatic transfer to savings so she’ll have a little set aside in case she does manage to overspend. Then tell her that you have set everything up to be paid automatically, so she won’t have to “worry” about paying her bills. Your name on the account makes you a joint owner of the account and everything in it, so you have the right to do this. All of this is legit caregiving. If you weren’t there and she handled her own finances, she would be in serious trouble. She could change it back but she probably won’t. Fix it so you don’t get burned out and financially wiped out by her spending. Show her the phone number to call to check her balance so she knows what she has leftover to spend. Set an alert to text you when she buys something with her debit card so you have time to get her to cancel the order if she can’t pay for it. If she still buys things she can’t pay for, you can also send them back. You just need to help her learn that her money is all she can spend, and then don’t worry about it too much when she buys junk and let her decide what she buys. At least you won’t be paying for it and maybe she will begin to be more careful when she has no spending money because she blew it all. You’re good to care for her, but you can’t let your own finances get sucked into her habits, or eventually you won’t be able to help either of you. Be strong - you can do this! Hugs!
Thanks to everyone who put in their two cents, I am definitely going to take this info under advice. I get more support from strangers on Reddit than I do in real life!

,Patient with dementia thought they were abused and it really upset me,"It  was my second shift with a patient w/ dementia as a caregiver and it  was really really frustrating :/. I worked with another caregiver to  change their briefs, etc. and the whole time the patient was screaming  but we had to change it because it was dirty/soiled. After this, they  forgot who I was and told me that two workers hit them ""last night"" and  it made me upset that the experience was seemingly really traumatic for  them (also the risk of getting into trouble for a little thing). And  then an hour later I think they forgot but still felt sad/stressed and  it just upset me out so much. I vented to a caregiver and they said the  patient is basically always like that because they hate being changed  but it makes me so sad that this is normal. just wanted to vent :/","We take care of my MIL at home and every diaper change, every bath, and every transfer is totally distressing for her. I’m sure if she could use her words she would cry assault or worse. The screaming is really hard to take. 

Dementia is so terrible, they can’t understand that the care they are receiving is medically necessary. 

I do see a tiny little bit of relief wash over my MIL’s face when we finish cleaning her, get her fresh diaper on, and get her all settled into a clean bed. 
I hold on to that face, that somewhere deep down she does feel better being clean and dry. 

I know you are just venting but just remember that you are doing a good job! Despite what the patient may verbally say, their skin is grateful.
This is such a hard thing. It's terrible to have to go through-- the whole thing, for everyone involved. The saying ""when you're going through hell, keep on going"" rings true. Caregivers aren't superhumans who are born stronger or destined to do a Very Special Job. We're all just people doing what somebody has to do. When what needs done is hell, we just need to keep on going. You're all in my heart.",2021-04-23 23:57:05,Latter-Lie6597,mxc6dk
,Caregiving with Technology,"Hello All

I am a 27 year old caregiver to two elederly grandparents and two aunts with Parkinson’s. Me and my wife take turns feeding and helping around the house, I’ve noticed that Alexa has a lot of skills that could be useful for elderly folks. Asking for weather, time, calling family etc etc. I’m a self confessed techie and wanted to use that skill to help. I’ve created a few Alexa skills to help us around the house as well

I was wondering if there is any technology that anyone uses here to aid in Caregiving?","Alexa has been great for us too! My boyfriend (30m) became quadriplegic a few years ago, and we’ve really embraced the Echo in our house.
We use Eufy lightbulbs from Amazon with yellow-to-white options. So we can say “Alexa, turn bed lamp to white,” “Turn living room light to 100,” etc. We had the standard one at first, but the ability to have white light during the day and yellow light at night really made a difference 

We also have some compatible plugs for small appliances like the humidifier. And a fire tv for the bedroom, fire cube for the tv in the living room. That way both can turn on the tv and control volume through Alexa. 

What sort of skills have you made to help out around the house? We’re always looking for ways to make things a little easier :)
Elderly people often lose technological skills and abilities they had before. Your idea sounds great, but be prepared to be met with blank stares. But please give it a try, and keep us informed!
Technology is playing a major role in running businesses, carrying out day-to-day activities, and even in offering care. The home care agencies use home care software extensively to monitor the activities, location, care plan, schedules of the caregivers. Similarly, the caregivers use the technology to conduct virtual sessions with clients. This practice of virtual meetings just got a boost during the pandemic and now it has become a fashion. As you have mentioned, Alexa is truly a great companion as it helps in carrying out some of the basic tasks, making the life of a caregiver as well as the client easy. Caregivers nowadays prefer using multifaceted platforms to coordinate tasks and disseminate information. The market is flooded with home care software. As a caregiver, you just need to look for the one that meets your needs.",2021-04-23 16:15:21,itbeginner1,mx42of
,Advice for a new community carer?,"Hi everyone, I hope you’re all well! 

So a bit of background. I’m 21, and a biology student. I’m hoping to become a physician associate (physician assistant if you’re in America) so educationally I’m on track, but I really need to gain work experience. I worked in care home before, when I had just turned 18. I absolutely enjoyed working with the elderly residents, but couldn’t deal with the toxicity of some of the staff. 

I’m pretty aware of what the role consists of, but I just need advice. I live at home still, and am VERY lucky to have my dad cook for me and the family, and my mum
popping my washing in the washing machine. I’m guessing these are very much skills I have to pick up before I visit people! I’m also aware that I may have to cook for residents, which is a daunting task as I always avoid cooking meat as I’m terrified of giving someone food poisoning!

It’s probably best to practise, right? What kind of things do you guys cook for individuals? How often do you wash bedding/use the washing machine? Just general advice for care at home carers?

This may sound so silly but I just need advice for this. Please no negative comments, I’m really just here for advice. I’m very much aware of the challenges that are involved when working in care. ☺️

,Advice for Obese roommate with bad hygiene,"A long term friend of mine, who is also my roommate, has bad hygiene.   Rarely ever uses soap - he's never even bought his own.   Can't kick him out even if i wanted to, but i've been falling into the role (unwillingly, but it's my current lot in life) of his caregiver.  I don't bathe him, but his BO and the residue he leaves on surfaces is.. frankly more than i can take. 

I have bought him gentle soaps (he says rougher ones irritate his skin - and i believe it, his skin will likely react to anything that pulls oils and grime off), all sorts of cleaning wands, soft and hard bristle, etc.  

I need advice and don't know where to turn to.  I've sat down with him, discussed with him earnestly several times.  Today, for the first time, i offered to help him do a deep clean.  Just once.  Approached clinically.   He declined.

This is becoming an issue.  Can any of you give me advice to things i can do - maybe a soap/hibiclens soak he can just use in the tub that will help?  Or a way i can approach him to convince him to take time to actually cleanse himself in the shower?","Has he tried soaking in the tub with a bubble bath maybe
He'll need to address his underlying depression first. That's what has him disinterested in hygiene.
It feels absolutely wonderful to exfoliate with sugar after soaking in a warm bath for long enough to soften the skin. It removes layers of dry skin scale and grime and has antibacterial properties. Perhaps use it first, then have him see how soft your skin is, and offer him some? 

It is unlikely he will change anything without your explicit insistence, though. Unfortunately, someone that unaware of their own hygiene is likely impervious to subtle cues. I would de-personalize your approach somewhat by saying something about the filth left on the furniture, rather than the filth on him. They're one and the same issue, but he may respond better if he feels it isn't about him and his body, just a ""furniture issue"".

 Vinegar spray may help. Vinegar in the laundry helps decrud body oils. Any detergent with an enzyme like lipase and amylase. You can say, ""I noticed through cleaning that the stains on the furniture seem oil-based. Can we try and combat that in the shower, before it is even an issue in the main spaces?""
Hi. I would have him evaluated. Someone who is that neglectful of hygiene has a mental problem of some sort. 
Until you address the underlying mental problem. No amount of washing this man up is gonna really help. 
Good luck.",2021-04-19 15:00:50,orbitn,mu7t6z
,Bedbound client advice,I’ve been a caregiver for about a year now and most of my clients have been able bodied. I recently started working with a bedbound client and I feel really nervous and terrible because she is not able to communicate with me what she would like for me to help her with.  Any tips? Would really appreciate it!,"Can she not communicate at all? Or just nonverbal?

Can she answer 'Yes or No' questions? Perhaps with a blink? When my boyfriend was on a ventilator for some time, we communicated at first with eye blinks and a letter board. Eventually I was able to read his lips and he figured out how to make a 'clicking' sound to get the attention of nurses.

During that time, one of our favorite nurses recommended a short book called *The Diving Bell and the Butterfly*. It was written by a man named Jean-Dominique Bauby, using only his left eye to blink the words to his caretaker. If your client also has some form of locked-in syndrome, I highly recommend this book to you.

If communication truly isn't an option, do everything you can to keep her comfortable. Regular skin checks and pressure relief is so important, I can't stress it enough. Maybe find out from family if she has a favorite show or music you can play for her?

Best of luck with your new client!

,I am my aunts caregiver,"My Grandpa passed away 10 years ago. My grandmother has Alzheimer’s. My aunt has Lenox-Gaustaut epilepsy. Before my Grandpa passed I promised him it was ok to go. I would always take care of my aunt. She is 6 years older than me. She wears diapers, is mostly non verbal and has daily seizures. 
She had internal bleeding and was in the hospital, she’s been out almost 2 weeks, but she doesn’t seem to be getting much better. The bleeding was from an ulcer in her esophagus that ruptured. She is weak and falls every time she tries to walk. I talked to her doctor today and he said that she probably will never get all of the function she had before. I feel like I missed it and she didn’t go to the hospital soon enough. I have been her caregiver for 10 years full time and 20 years all together. I am so scared and feel so guilty for not noticing sooner that she was having problems. I feel like a failure.","We caregivers and family, not medical professionals (who, by the way, miss stuff all the time). It’s difficult to know when to call 911.   Even when we do sometimes the hospital can’t or doesn’t do much for my MIL (Late Stage Alzheimer’s). 

All we can do is our best. Forgive yourself and continue to do your best.
You obviously love her (and your late grandpa) a great deal or you wouldn’t feel the way you are feeling now. It sounds like you have sacrificed a lot over the past 20 years. I am my mother’s caregiver and, though she doesn’t have the medical problems your aunt does, it is difficult sometimes to ascertain whether her ailments are minor or something more severe. Over the years, almost all of them have been minor and didn’t require medical attention. I really depend on her to tell me, for example, whether the pain in her shoulders feels like arthritis or muscular pain or could be a heart attack. The day might come when I make the wrong call, but it won’t be because I don’t love her or don’t try to give her the very best care I can. 

Your aunt is mostly non-verbal and may not be able to tell you when something feels different from or more severe than her usual ailments. You can’t know everything that is going on with her condition, regardless of how much you care or how hard you try. You did take her to the hospital when you realized something was wrong. If you are giving her the loving, patient care she needs, you are certainly not a failure; you are a blessing.

My best to both you and your aunt.
It is always ridiculously hard to tell when you should escalate and bring in outside help. Especially when they are nonverbal sometimes you just don't know. One time (ok twice) I was sitting in a drs office with my Grandma and her DR was like ""you have a UTI. Does it hurt to pee?"" And my grandma was like, ""yup."" And I felt like I missed it. TWICE. 

You can only do the best you know how. If you saw signs and knew what they were, there is no excuse. But if you didn't see them, or didn't know what they were, join the club. We will never catch everything. We just do our best to catch what we humanly are capable of.",2021-04-18 13:23:47,kiffer1974,mth5mk
,Having a Hard Time With The Ending,"I've lived with my grandma for 8 years. She has finally moved from Stage 4 to Stage 5 Kidney Failure. She is mid-90s and is having some short term memory issues. 

She regularly gets frustrated and asks why she is so tired when she hasn't done anything. 

It breaks my heart because the answer is ""Because your kidneys are shutting down and you are going to get more and more sleepy until you just stop.""

It is very traumatic and heartbreaking and I don't know how to handle it...the doctor said it would probably be another 6 months to a year...or any time.","What you are doing is the most noble of kindnesses.  You are helping your grandmother exit this world. You are shouldering her burden so she can leave when it is her time.  It’s difficult carrying this burden while it is so painful to you but you do it because she cannot do this alone.  You are an angel and a rock star.
Achter is exactly right. Love her, let her tell you everything about her life. If you can be with her, record her telling stories of her youth. My favorite questions for older people (and watch her face, her eyes will go up and her wrinkles will seem to soften): ask her how she met your grandfather. How did he propose? How did she decide that he was the one? What did she wear when they got married? 

Hold her hand, caress her face, other reassuring touches if you can. Do you know any songs from her era? Sing them with her, or to her. 

Tell her jokes. Tell her how much she has meant to you. Tell her your memories of times with her. Tell her while you can.

,New job... can I quit after 1 day?,"I’ve been a caregiver for 3 years now. And I just started working at a facility with people who have dementia. I was APPALLED at what I saw today. First, I found out that every person in that facility has had covid. I had no idea. Thankfully iM vaccinated but you would think that’s something to disclose. A resident urinated on the floor and no one cleaned it up. One resident has a dog and they allow the dog to pee and poop all over their room, the smell is so horrific I gagged when they opened the door. Another resident doesn’t speak English or understand English, and not one person makes an effort to use google translate to talk to them. They walk around trying desperately to communicate and they can’t. Lastly, there is one resident who is dying, no comfort is offered to them, they spent the whole day alone in their room. I am disgusted and I don’t want to work here. I mean they don’t even have books, magazines, or puzzles!!!! Nothing!!! Just today’s hits playing. Should I quit???","I'd report them, and call APS&ASPCA, before I quit, but that's just me.
Yes quit. Report it after. As an aside what you saw is the reason a lot of we private family members became caregivers. I could not in good conscience put a loved one in one of those hell holes. And that's not to say the facilities don't TRY, some really do.. but it's just a hopeless situation when you consider the amount of care ONE person needs, then multiply it by the 20 or so patients the facility nurse has to try and care for. It's just impossible. I got my mom out as soon as I could and brought her home to be with me until she passed. It was eye opening, and sad. And, really, I blame it on us as citizens for being selfish and not taking care of our elderly, I think it's our duty to do so, not some organization or god forbid, government, to do so. I'm sorry you had to see that. 😩
Stay one more day and document everything with your cell phone.  And then report them.  This is heartbreaking and their families should know. Would you want your grandma there in those conditions?  Those people need rescuing.
Google the type of facility and the state you're in (if you're in the US) with the word ""accreditation organization"". For example: ""massachusetts nursing home accreditation"", or ""texas rest home accreditation"". While you should absolutely report to adult protective services I can tell you that oftentimes the accreditation agency has more teeth, is able to act faster, and will produce results. 

Without accreditation in good standing the facility can face fines, will be unable to collect from medicare/medicaid and will be restricted from admitting new patients until their violations are cleaned up.
Hi. Just FYI. Taping and recording anyone without their consent and knowledge can get you in hot water. Not a good idea. 
Sadly you can call all the agencies you want and report this kind of thing all day long. But I doubt anything will be done about it. This is not a unique or isolated situation. It’s widespread. 
If you feel you can’t make the situation better , I would look elsewhere for work.

,Advice for hiring a professional caregiver?,"I (22yo) need to hire someone to take over the minor care of my mother ASAP. She’s 42 years old and only needs help with very, very basic household things like occasional store trips (cigarettes/groceries/whatnot), light cleaning around the house and someone to walk her dog once a day. Sometimes she needs help making phone calls and scheduling doctors appointments and twice a month she needs someone to escort her home after ketamine infusions. I have absolutely no idea how to go about finding someone to do all these things or if any or all of these things are fair things to ask of a home attendant or caregiver.

Can I find one person to do all these things or will I need a dog walker, someone to clean and someone separate to care for those other needs not met by the other two people? Help!","Most care agencies will cover all the tasks except dog walking. 

Your best bet may be looking for a college student. If you have a university or college nearby I would place an ad in their employment website. I'm speaking from experience saying you will get plenty of interest and a lot of students would consider the doggo to be a plus.
Late reply but most caregiving agencies will cover all of that. The other commenter mentioned maybe not dog walking, but I think that depends on the agency and their insurance coverage. 


I have experience with only a few companies, but for the one I work for currently, shift must be a minimum of 4 hours long. The client pays 30 an hour, I make 15 an hour. 


The pros of a going through a company is that you know we have a background check, drug test, clean TB test, and fingerprint clearance. The cons is the red tape, ex: my company does not allow us to even pull weeds from the yard because out insurance doesn't cover it, and you can't work less than a four hour shift. Different companies are different of course, do your research and ask lots of question. 


It may be worth looking into hiring a private care giver, it doesn't cost much to run your own background check, overhead will be less money, and a private caregiver is less likely to have to fill a certain amount of hours. 


Ask too about their specific experience with the kind of things you'll need, caregiver don't all have the same training because a lot is learned on the job so we all end up with different skill sets.

i just got a job at a retirement residence, housing elderly people who simply need assistance with daily living, to people with Alzheimer’s or dementia. i’ve always thought about trying to go into this line of work because i have always wanted to be doing something where i am helping people who need it.

i have only ever really worked in customer service, things like restaurants and grocery stores. while i am thrilled and super super excited for this new experience and opportunity, i feel so so so nervous. i honestly have no idea what to expect here. 

if anybody could share with me just some things to expect, things they’ve personally experienced in this line of work, anything would be helpful!! thanks I’m advance ~","Not in the line of work but I care for my dementia father.

Basically: patience and a good sense of humor are very important. Don't take things personally. It's the disease talking, not the person. I have to constantly repeat to myself: it's the disease, it's the disease, it's the disease. 

Another important thing: do not argue with them. They will claim the sky is green and that they just saw Ronald Reagan in their bathroom. They will look you straight in the eye and claim they just bathed when you know they have not. Don't argue, don't force them into your reality. It is the other way around: you need to step into theirs. Agree with them. ""Oh really? wow, that's amazing!"" ""That's wonderful, I'm happy for you!"" And then distract or change the subject. Arguing with them will only ever make it worse.

Good luck. And thanks for being willing to do such a difficult job, those of us family members appreciate that you put love and care into looking after our loved ones.
I used to work in a nursing home as an RN and we had a few dementia patients.Have the rest of the staff been available for you to give you tips? Find a staff member who seems to really care for her patients (a few get burned out and go through the motions.)  Did you get a good orientation?

When I started working at a nursing home, I watched closely how other staff interacted w/the patients. You can learn a lot on both what works and what doesn't.

Smile a lot, be friendly and let the patients do most of the talking. Encourage this by asking them questions about their lives. Please don't question your choice, at least not yet! There is a learning curve for how to best manage each individual patient and learn what *they need*  as individuals.

Give yourself some time and some slack. You have chosen what can be a very rewarding profession.
Patience is key. 

Unless they're in immediate danger, ex, they think ""it's totally safe to stick my finger in this electric socket"" or something, I tend to just agree. 

They think I'm their cousin? Sure. I won't correct that. 


They ordered abc for breakfast but then it comes out and they say they actually ordered xys? Oh sorry, my mistake. Don't tell them they're wrong and that they actually said something else previously. There is no point in proving them wrong. There is no point in correcting them. Don't argue unless it's something important. 


Don't ask ""remember xyz?"" just remind. Don't disagree (when possible), agree and distract. Don't say ""you said that already,"" let them tell you the same story over and over if you can. 


Don't let them run all over you, you are in charge, not them. If you need to go take care of someone else, don't be afraid to just politely say ""oh hey xyz came up, I'll be back to talk to you later"" and just walk away. 


Don't take it personally when they are in a bad mood, because some will be. I got screamed at once because she wanted her bread untoasted and it came out toasted. Don't let them carry on about it, let them be mad, apologise, walk away, fix it, walk away. You WILL deal with unreasonably angry people.",2021-04-05 03:16:17,sixlittlelegs,mkex9x

I also suspect that after I put her to bed when I leave she isn’t being moved at all or changed for the 14 hours she’s in bed. Should I report this?","Yes.
Yes.
Yes and change her as needed no matter what they say
How is her skin?
Yes report it to your company and Adult services. That’s just cruel of her family.
Yes, even if there is no abuse it sounds like there may be potential neglect. That's not for you or your agency to decide, it is up to APS. Filing a report with APS is usually very easy, getting them to come out and make contact with the adult can sometimes be problematic; I ran into this with one of my relatives. Depending on your State and if you have any sort of license like PCA/HHA/CNA/LPN/RN then you may be mandated to report abuse or neglect to APS. Inform your superiors now and call APS or file a report online; if you have any photographic evidence that would go a long way with APS.
Report this!!!!! She’s developing bed sores and will definitely get an infection. This is abuse",2021-03-30 07:32:19,Arys_Nightshade,mgdv9l
,"Plz help,from 3rd world, possible dementia, neurologists and psychiatrists unable to give proper time and treatment due to covid","
Im in the most painful and complex situation of my life, father dementia worsened after couple of years and seems mother also apparently has some sort of dementia but so far no neurologist or psychiatrist have been able to properly diagnose.


Im only child and barely able to care for both due to fatigue and own mental health issues. Not much help from others as its chaos here due to covid and du to fear cant hire nurse and tbh cant afford it  



Im in a 3rd world country, Pakistan and due to covid, treatment and diagnosis almost impossible, dilemma is most experts advice antipsychotics for her extreme anxiety and agitation but im afraid as fda warnimg says it can be fatal if she actually has dementia. 



I have videos of her that i can share in pm to respect our privacy, hope to find proper treatment, memantine gives me hope but must check from a neurologist as mother also has comorbids  like hypertension and copd diabetes and donepezil an rivistagine patch is contraindicated etc




Unable to get MRI after repeated tries as she becomes agitated and sedation ia contraindicated due to copd. 




FOLLOWING NOTES FROM A BOOK



-Onset of depressive symptoms preceded much earlier, perhaps years than cognitive


impairment and memory problems




-Memory problems fairly sudden onset eg within 1 to 2 months of hospital admission october 2019 often



identifiable onset of cognitive impairment especially during and after hospital stay, which was definitely a shock as she never had to be hospitalized for so long and become so much dependent in life.




-Often emphasize inability to think,concentrate, and remember, especially when asked questions




-Signs and symptoms of depression include:




-loss of appetite.




-loss of interest in cooking, overseeing house cleaning and other chores she used to love.




-more silent




-less mobile or willingness to move




-less pain and discomfort tolerance probably and less temperature tolerance as evident by asking to switch on and off AC in short time




-much less patient than before




Much more 'i dont know' or 'not feeling well ' replies when trying to test cognition or memory

,I need help,"I am currently a caregiver for Synergy. I try my hardest to keep clients happy and satisfied with my job. Yesterday a client said to me about giving me a raise. I said no because i am already getting paid with the company but got a bit upset. Due to not having cash on him, he wants me to use his card and spend 100-200 dollars a month as a raise. I dont know what to do. Any suggestions? Thank you I will really appreciate it.","I think if you do this, it will only make you look bad and could get you in a lot of trouble.  It could be seen as elder financial abuse from an outsider, even if he wants you to do it.  If he truly wants to give you a raise, he'll have to figure out another way.
I would politely decline and say it's against company policy for you to accept anything from a client. Across the board I was always told you cannot accept money or other large items, depending on the client they could accuse you of theft/forget and you'd be up the creek. Small things, like a holiday card, were ok because they're trying to be nice, but money or anything else is a big no no. I've never worked for Synergy, so just in case I would recommend going back over company policy to cover your butt. And if for some reason they do allow you to accept things from clients I would make the client write it out and sign exactly what they're doing, preferably with a witness so as not to say they were coerced or influenced, etc.
This is not worth the risk. You likely would be barred from working in the industry in your entire state. Maybe suggest to the client that you could make a purchase together that you'd both enjoy - a meal, a game, an outing etc.
Politely decline it. As one of the others said, it can be seen as elderly financial abuse. As far as I know, it should be against company policy and you can get in trouble.",2021-03-24 10:25:00,Formula1Dude,mc70ep
,Mom requires hospice care now...I’m heartbroken,"My mom has had a horrible year so far. On top of the stage 4 cancer to became aggressive in September 2020, she broke her leg in January 2021. Two weeks after this, she needed emergency neurosurgery because a massive tumor was compressing her spine. She’s now declining rapidly, the tumor affected her ability to walk, she’s hardly eating or drinking, developed a horrible pressure ulcer, and is in immense pain. I know we’re going to have to transition to hospice now. 

I’m really devastated by all this. I’m an only child, dad died a few years back, and I left work in 2018 to be her primary caregiver. I’m beating myself up because I feel like I’ve failed my mom. I keep hoping she’ll bounce back, but I know it’s highly unlikely. What have others done to get through this? I feel like I’m going to have a breakdown.","i hope you feel the air around you being squeezed because i am sending the biggest hug ever.

YOU DID NOT FAIL YOUR MOM

YOU DID NOT FAIL YOUR MOM

YOU DID NOT FAIL YOUR MOM

would you like me to say it again? because i will until you believe it!

>I left work in 2018 to be her primary caregiver

already case and point. let alone every thing you listed that your mom is going through is a disease! you're fighting it together and it's very strong and you're doing your best. 

i don't like dwelling, but imagine where your mom may have ended up without you? we always see how much further we could've gone rather than how little we could've made it. 

i hope hospice brings your the breath of fresh air it did to me and my dad when my mom went. we were able to go back to being family instead of caregivers. it's not a failing at all. hospice is professionals! they went to school for so long to learn all this and you did it for this long just by living and observing! 

this is all so devastating. and it's so hard not to spiral and let your brain play all the mean games it likes to when you're down, but please try and be gentle with yourself. you deserve rest and love and reassurance. asking for help is such a strong and incredible thing. 

this is rambly but if you need me to ramble more in your direction about how you are doing your best and it's incredible and you are amazing for making it this far, this stranger is here for you!
You did all you could with what you have ! 

I'm an only child too and my mom has Alziehmer's, she lived with me and my son for 6 months until we realised it was too much for us and got a spot at a special facility. 

And you know what, I felt so so so guilty, the night before she had to move there she had a moment of clarity and reminded me what she's told me my whole life :  is she never wants to be a burden to me. Only now that i have my own kid do i know JUST HOW MUCH she means that ! Your mom probably feels the same way. So whatever is happening is NOT a FAILURE ! It's what every caregiver has to do at some point is pass it on to professionals. 

We are not professionals, we don't clock out. It's not something we can do forever. Now she can get quality time with you, you won't grow resentful. 

I still think about how much more I could have been nicer to her, more patient, or just how much more i could have done. Like iseewhatyoudidthere said be gentle with yourself. 

Take the time to forgive yourself and face this new part of your journey together. There's a lot you can still do for her. just the set is changing.

You are loved, you are brave, you are tired and mourning your old ""normal"". ((((BIG HUG))))
You did not fail her. You are not failing her. Her body is failing her which is ok. Sad to watch but it is ok. Part of the process of life.
 Losing both parents and living through that is heartbreaking. Hugs.
I really want to thank you all for these kind words and support. I’m still trying to wrap my brain around all this. But I’ve been able to spend more quality time with my mom now. But I’m still trying to get used to all these changes.",2021-03-23 22:11:55,Shalar79,mbv19k

,"I need some advise, please advise me."," 👵👩‍⚕️I graduated high school a few years ago, and have only worked entry-level jobs in healthcare.  

I have done some kitchen work at two retirement homes, and I realized that I get along and connect very well with the elderly... especially those with dementia.

Basically, I'm interested in becoming a caregiver.  However, I have some minor health issues, and can comfortably work only 3-6 hours.  In addition to that, I weigh very little, and can life no more than 80 pounds.  Also I'm very slow-paced, and hate fast-paced work (I can still make split-second decisions).

What kind of caregiver jobs are right for me?

Edit: I need help knowing which IN-HOME caregiver jobs are best for me.","I can't speculate which type of caregiver you are suited to become ... So I suggest that you do some volunteer time at your local hospital. They have the experience in placing people to their advantage while you get some great experience for your resume!
Dog sitter?
Become a nurse at a skilled nursing. You’ll have CNA helping you all the way so no need to do the heavy lifting. Caregivers: you need to choose your patients and only chose the one that only need driving to grocery stores and such. But a lot of the times, I find that they tell you the patient is ok just a little mobility issues and I come the patient is paralyzed. So, be careful and protect your back.
[deleted]
Consider going into occupational or speech therapy? That way you won't be the person responsible for possibly picking up a 100+ pound person from the floor, but you can still be involved in improving people's lives and functionality. There are therapists like that who make house calls. 

Maybe try volunteering for Meals on Wheels if you want to see if sitting and chatting with the elderly is something you want to do more of, they may have some advice on what kind of work you could do.
I'm in the same boat, except I'm still in highschool. You should research different companies and talk to people from those companies to get a grasp on the experiences. I work with children and adults, but due to school, I only work 3-4 hours for three days a week.

,Denied by multiple skilled nursing facilities. Is there some trick to getting in? Are there there different types?,"Hello,

My mom is sick with a rare, serious bacterial infection. Shes on multiple antibiotics + PICC line. 

She has kidney damage from one of the meds and needs regular monitoring for it. (The most effective antibiotic for the infection) 

She's been doing home care for months, but recently took a bad turn.

She's currently in the hospital due to delerium/confusion (about 2 weeks so far). The infection might be in her brain, but unknown for now. She's a fall risk, and the infection has made it to her eyes so she has vision problems.

(Adding: she's also recovering from cardiac surgery where they attempted to clean the site of infection)

Her doctor wants her in a skilled nursing facility. She needs 24hr monitoring.

However, every facility we apply to rejects her. They claim they don't have the resources to care for her. We've been looking at places in 2 states (Kansas and Minnesota)

I'm not sure what specialized care she needs that even a skilled facility couldn't provide it.

I think my dad is going to try to get her on Medicare or Medicaid -- could that be why she gets rejected? 

(My dads insurance doesn't cover long term care)

Is there some trick to getting in? The hospital social worker is helping, but getting nowhere. 

What happens if every place rejects her? The hospital is waiting to discharge her. 

Is there a specific type of skilled facility we should look for? 

Thank you!","I am not a doctor, a licensed nurse, nor have I ever worked in admissions in any SNF. I did work in a few SNF’s as a CNA (anything past CNA I did was not in a strictly skilled facility). I also no longer work in caregiving and haven’t in a couple of years so my take on this may be outdated. I’ve never been to Kansas or Minnesota.

Now that the heavy disclaimer is out of the way...

In my personal experience I’ve rarely seen skilled nursing facilities take anyone with a PICC line —- it’s not like I’ve NEVER seen it happen, but I wouldn’t call it common. Now let’s combine this with the fact that your mother has an infection that is also causing delirium and visual problems: your mother is likely a huge fall risk.

With the potential for falls so high, the skilled nursing facility is likely concerned she’ll need 1:1 monitoring, and they may not have the staffing to make that happen. Their ratios may be more like 4:1, 8:1, or even 12:1. (That isn’t a fake number; the most permissive SNF facility I’ve worked at in regards to staffing rations had a 12:1 bed ratio for CNAs, accounting for full staffing. This was a place that was very permissive with their admissions. Obviously that ratio drops a bit when you account for nurses working as well, but at best you’ll see a nurse for every 2-3 CNA’s so it won’t be an outrageous drop.

It is virtually impossible to maintain this ratio and provide 1:1 care to make sure a high risk fall patient doesn’t fall. These situations will result in  one of three things happening:

1. A CNA will have to be delegated to just that one person, increasing the demand to everyone else. A lot of facilities can’t justify that kind of delegation for more than emergency situations.

2. The high-risk patient will be kept in a central area whenever possible. While this means more flexibility in “1:1” watch over a high-risk patient, it means a decrease in that person’s quality of life. Every time you don’t need to go to the bathroom or change clothes, you need to be taken back to the room to get proper care and then immediately taken back to this common area. Privacy concerns are gonna pop up very quickly. People with dementia or delirium may be hard to actually KEEP in that common area without turning into situation 1. Either way, this doesn’t tend to last because it’s also very hard to justify.

3. Some facilities will just try and “wing it”. I really hope there’s a place out there that has a good “wing-it” strategy for patients who should have 1:1 monitoring and don’t....but all the stories I’ve seen with that kind of thing sadly end in tears.

^^^ And this is why I personally think that so many of these places are rejecting your applications. They do not to invite any of those situations, and unfortunately this puts you in a rough situation.

When I did private care, I remember a case where the client was only allowed to stay in the same facility as their spouse because they had me to do the 1:1 care to take the demand off their on-site staff. This person had amazing insurance who were apparently quite considerate of the extra expense being incurred, but it allowed that patient to remain with their spouse in that same facility until the end. That could be one solution.

Another would be to see if you can reach out to whoever it is processing admissions at these places you are applying to. See if you can find out WHY your mother is being denied specifically —- I may not be correct and maybe the resource concern is from some other place. Knowing why the denial is happening is a lot of that problem right there.

Check with social workers at this hospital and see what else they may be recommending as well. I guarantee you that your mother is not the first person the hospital has had to wait to discharge because of situations like this, and someone who has experience in that hospital dealing with these situations might be able to help facilitate this discharge and help you get your mother somewhere that will take good care of her.
Your mom could possibly need a LTAC (long-term care acute) hospital not a SNF (skilled nursing facility). But, the other issue is delirium and if they are placing your mom in restraints, this is an automatic rejection for SNFs. They are not allowed to restrain folks so if that is what the hospital is doing to keep your mom “safe” then the social worker will not get any SNF to take her.  But, could easily be the timing and number of infusions she needs in her PICC or the PICC itself. What I would do is call one of the places that rejected her as too much to say, “wanting to understand when she will be appropriate for SNF so could you tell me what makes my mom’s care not appropriate for your facility.” The hospital may make this feel like this is your “problem” but if she is that sick and the doctor wants 24/7 care - then it’s on the hospital to make the safest discharge plan for her. You could ask if your mom would qualify for a LTAC or what is the constrain on the hospital end to discharge her. Could be insurance constraints and if you can find out you may do the docs, nurse and social workers a world of good spending the hours listening to hold music to get authorization to move your mom. She sounds like her level of care will be increasing or not lessening so would definitely pursue options of getting on Medicaid (state program) or Medicare(federal for 65+ or someone with end stage renal disease).
On the insurance front, if helpful: Medicare would cover her in a SNF for 100 days (max) at once, and most SNFs are very happy to take Medicare patients, but Medicaid would indefinitely cover her, if needed, (but the rate is very very low).
Unfortunately, you’ll have to keep trying until you can find a place that will take her. If the facility doesn’t think I can safely, or cost effectively enough care for your loved one, they won’t accept them. This happened to us.  

We ended up bringing our loved one to live at home with aide coverage there 12 hours a day.
From experience in the field it almost always comes down to the finances. SNF’s are usually the last line of care that can accept almost any patient because of the nursing staff. Every time I’ve seen someone get denied is always because of the finance aspect. Here in South Florida I believe it’s about $5k per month for a nursing home. If the patient has Medicaid and Medicare it’s almost always covered. In the event that the patient has lots of assets under their name and cannot apply for Medicaid or Medicare, some nursing homes will actually ask you to forfeit the assets to them in lieu of payments. As for the falls, I’ve seen them place foam mats on the bedside plenty of times. Also, one on one care is usually very expensive if using a certified staff. That could be another route, but it can get expensive.",2021-03-04 22:44:30,FightJustCuz,ly37hg
,Why aren’t family members who quit their jobs to care for their parent paid?,"I had to quit an 80K/yr job and start early SS so I could care for my Mom, who needs constant watching.  Why will her Medicare Advantage pay for home health to come in, but won’t pay me?  I’m in Texas.","Because your state is kind of awful towards caring/tending stuff.  There are no laws in place to pay caregivers... you can work to make them law, but it'll be a few years/decades until it happens even if you start now.  

Also because we don't have Universal Healthcare, though with the shit the Boomers are about to endure that might change.  Probably too late for us to take care of the Boomers properly, though.  

So we have the US' insufficient system filtered through Texas' basically hostile system and you get... shafted.  You have my sympathy, u/Sissy63.
You could work for an agency and only work with your mom and get paid that way...but you won't even get half of what you were used to. There's just no way of getting paid directly that I know of...well unless she has long term insurance and even still you have to have some type of license or certificate. I work as a home health aide and the most I've ever made was $15/hr.
It depends on where you are. I was paid as a family member here in Pennsylvania, but it certainly wasn't enough to make up for the loss of income. You might be better off continuing to work and hiring someone with Medicare Advantage.
i also had to quit my high paying job but i’m trying desperately to hold onto a part time remote job that pays much less, even though it’s stressful to do (not the job, but the conflict between the job and taking care of someone) to keep my sanity (i get to communicate with other adultish adults!) and pay my own bills.

i don’t think i could get paid either, for caregiving, unless my mother paid me directly.

i also question if being an official caregiver, like through an agency or even freelancing on your own, would be allowed for insurance purposes, considering it might be a “conflict of interest” (like, you could provide substandard care just so that she continues to need care thereby ensuring your continued paycheck but you’re family so she won’t complain about you) ... but i honestly don’t know - anyone know if that’s an issue?

(that’s an interesting idea i hadn’t considered before, getting licensed in order to get paid through insurance, i’ll have to look at my mother’s insurance policies now...)
I’m disabled and my husband is employed as my full time live in caregiver. However, he’s only allowed to be paid for 35.25 hours/week, average of just over 5 hours/week. He is paid through Iris, the program that oversees my disability services. Iris (in WI) was one of three agencies I was told by the ADRC to choose from to manage my care and is very member driven. I don’t get any SSI or disability financial visits as I have six kids who are currently ages 5-24 and I was/“am” a stay at home mom. No job= no paying taxes into the system= no SSI. But my functional screen says my physical & Neurocognitive disabilities and their impact on my quality of life and ability to preform Tasks of Daily Living are “severe” enough to require a caregiver. My husband’s income as my caregiver is nowhere near what we need to live, but it allows him to be home 24/7 365 and help w the kids-and I’m still able to do things for them, just in a very modified way. Does your mom have such an “agency”? I also get things like reimbursement for certain OTC medications (I have several chronic GI issues so some examples are Metamucil, Fiber, Probiotics that I get reimbursed for but only after my gastroenterologist wrote a letter of the medical necessity of those things for me and it being approved and how it fits into my overall budget. It’s just a sad sad situation for our family. I was in perfect health as far as I knew when I gave birth to the now 7 & 5 year old kiddos in ‘13 and ‘15. Husband worked full time outside, made enough $ to support us, have health insurance and no need for benefits. Then my health took an overnight nosedive in Jan 2017 when I severely herniated a disc in my back and was in too much pain to move, let alone care for a 2 & 4 year old. He did FMLA for awhile as we kept hoping the 3 different back surgeries were going to allow me to get back to our original “roles” but my back is forever screwed, and I managed to get Dx’d with a slew of additional issues (lots of GI chronic stuff which all likely would have appeared regardless of my back due to a gastric bypass way back in 2006 that led to gal bladder removal, bad IBS & a pancreas that does not make enough enzymes for me to properly digest my food so I have to take pig enzyme meds every time I eat. I had the baby when I was 37. Never ever could have seen this coming. 
My main point is..look for a source outside Medicare like an agency who is in charge of her Medicare. TBH I’m on Medicaid due to low income status and have earned some extra “privileges” with my disability Dx but I’m still quite unfamiliar with Medicaid.
PS Iris allowed me to hire anyone I wanted (they had to pass background checks, but that’s it) to be my caregiver. My husband does my personal care which is literally often hands on assistance w showers, dressing etc and I feel very blessed it’s him who’s able to do it. My dad helps manage my meds and he’s on “my payroll” as well and gets $9/hour for helping out with stuff like the Med management. I pray you have something similar in TX. I’m mentally aware enough to report to my caseworker that yes, my husband does do XYZ but they are taking me at my word-as well as in home check-ins (COVID put a big damper on that) but even Zoom they can see that I’m groomed and “look taken care of”. The ADRC checks in too for similar checks-to see if 1) I still qualify for disability services (not sure what about the word CHRONIC they don’t understand, LOL) and 2) make sure I’m taken care of, the house is clean, I have access to food & water etc. which are in place for good reason-to protect me. I did ALSO get a Dx of Neurocognitive Disorder at 39 yrs old which will likely turn into full on dementia at some point and the 2 program’s “check in & yearly evaluations” are there to make sure my husband is doing his job, if I would need to move into a home etc. because sadly there are too many occasions of family members taking advantage of caring for a disabled parent, spouse, child. You might have to dig deep...the government isn’t great at advertising programs that cost them money.
If your Mom is the widow of a US Veteran you might have an option.

I found a company that pays family caregivers .. .[https://www.aidaly.com/](https://www.aidaly.com/)

They find you programs that pay you to be a caregiver and then do all the paperwork so it doesnt take as long to get paid ... They told me I qualify but I haven't had my onboarding call yet... this would be such a gamechanger for me. I'm already barely making ends meet but my mom needs full time care and it's so tough ... we cant afford full time care so it has to be me. :-/
I hate to resurrect an old thread, but I am currently going through something very similar with my Father. Due to having worked in healthcare for a bit over 20 years (mostly nursing homes), knowing how these places can be, and how they are worse now with covid and staffing issues...I refuse to send my father to a nursing home.

Problem is, his dementia is so bad, he needs around the clock care. I cannot leave him alone. If I need to do anything outside the house, there has to be someone to sit with him. I only have a couple people who can do this, and very limited on when they can (they work, have kids, etc).

So because of this, I cannot currently work. We are having to survive on my Dad's income. While it is not horrible, it just barely covers monthly expenses...without factoring in copays for things.

His medical care is through the VA. Because my son and I are not his spouse or dependents he can claim on a tax return, they can ONLY count him as a household of 1 on his income...so even though he would need wheelchair transport to medical rides (he cannot walk), he does not qualify. He did not qualify for helping getting a wheelchair van because his main disability was not service connected.

But back to the main topic...

The VA has a program where I could be paid to be his caregiver, BUT his main disability has to be 70% or more service connected, which his isn't, so he doesn't qualify. Next step was our state's Medicaid. And even with their extended income cutoffs, he makes \~$200 more each month to qualify.

So I definitely understand and feel your pain. :( I am trying to find an online job that can be flexible with hours/work time...but not having much luck.",2021-02-23 14:14:36,Sissy63,lqqfj2

,Do they not like to bathe????,"Hi. Me again. My 68-year-old father has an infection in his legs, because he hasn’t showered even once in the maybe three weeks he’s been home from the nursing home. He complains of leg pain, but will not take a shower, and even swears and screams sometimes when somebody suggests it, even in a polite tone of voice. 

Is this an elderly thing? Is it an illness/handicapped thing? Is it a boomer thing?? LOL. Whatever it is, it’s driving me insane. He also won’t go to doctors or hospital even tho last week a nurse said the leg infection warrants ER.

Edit: we have tried calling 911, but he doesn’t go with them, and they don’t make him because he is “of sound mind“","Does he have dementia? This is a common symptom: fear of bathing.
I'd be more worried about the infection than his not showering.  He really needs to go to the er or he'll end up with sepsis or some kind of systemic thing that he won't be able to conquer.  Does he go to the market or anywhere outside the house?  Can you get him in the car to do that and then drive to the er?  Would he believe his doctor if you called the doctor for a heads up and the doc would call him to convince him to come in?
With my father it was fear and anxiety based. Getting undressed, into the shower, back out of the shower and dressed in fresh clothes is a major effort at that age. There’s a fear of falling, it’s hard to stand and often they feel very self conscious about asking for help. Problems like dementia mean that simple tasks that were once everyday ones become overwhelming. Suddenly they can’t recall how to turn the shower on, or how to unbuckle or unbutton clothing, wash hair etc. But they generally won’t tell you that, they’ll just refuse the shower. He’s not trying to be a pain, there’s a lot of reasons why he may be avoiding it, but it’s really not uncommon. Keeping his wound clean is first priority and bathing with a washcloth is totally sufficient for now.
My mom has not had a bath or shower in more than 10 years.

But she gets a clean, warm, wet washcloth 2-3 times a day (bathroom visits) where she can clean herself as much as she's comfortable, and gets help from me for the rest, which includes wipedown of the legs. As for hair and feet, usually once a week.

Baths are out for her. Can't navigate the tub. Same for the shower. It's ""spit baths"" all the time. Maybe that could work for your dad if he's not getting it done already. There are gentile soaps available for elders, but I don't bother with them.

Good luck with your dad. Dementia sucks, don't get too frustrated trying to make sense of his oddities, sometimes there's no sense to it.
Is there an adult social services office you can call?   

Depression and other mental health issues can cause a person to give up bathing.
HHA here. He needs to go to the ER asap. If he refuses, call 911.  I had to do this recently with a patient who has Gangrene. It sounds like a Dementia thing to me. My Dementia patients hate bathing. When he gets back, you can try filling a tub with hot water and soap and use a soapy washcloth, then clean off, and on other days use bath wipes.
Will he listen to doctors? Can you do a telehealth appointment and show them his leg? Maybe they can convince him to go. If not you need to find a way to force him, or bring in a home nurse or find a doctor who does house calls. He needs antibiotics by IV but pills would be better than nothing. A telehealth doctor may find him to be not of sound mind and an ambulance will take him or you can get power of attorney over health to get the paramedics to take him but this may take too much time. Taking a shower will not cure his infection, in fact I doubt not showering is the actual cause of the infection. If his legs truly hurt that bad standing for a shower could be why he is refusing. If the nerves are affected at all the water on his legs would be excruciatingly painful. If the infection doesn’t get treated and he goes septic it can be fatal. Please keep trying to get him to the hospital!
I’ve had clients that refuse to bathe. I had one that adamantly refused for years. For patients with dementia it can be very scary and uncomfortable. My client that consistently refused actually had cellulitis in her legs because a cut had become infected. I don’t think just refusing to shower would necessarily induce an infection in his legs though. Would have to be some open sore or wound. As others have mentioned, that probably needs to be addressed by a medical professional. Either a virtual visit or perhaps having a nurse or doctor come to the house (have had to do this for clients before that wouldn’t go out). 

For the future, I’d recommend filling a container with warm water and using towels to give him a sponge bath. Doesn’t even have to be his whole body in one day. With the client I previously mentioned that refused to bathe, I would do just her legs and feet one day. Maybe her arms another day. For her, it was a routine that didn’t make her feel exposed or uncomfortable and allowed me to help her with hygiene. It can be hard, especially since it might not be your preferred standard of hygiene. But a modified shower is important not just for hygiene but also being able to check his skin. Best of luck!
I would get him to the ER because if it is cellulitis or another sepsis on his legs, he will need Intravenous antibiotics. They can have him cleaned up while he is in the hospital, even if it is just a sponge bath.
well, for my mom, it's a dementia thing, so all i can do is use wet wipes (preferably heated, like microwave it for 7 seconds; when mom was in SNFs, they had packets of wet wipes sitting on top of the heater so that they'd be warm when they used them on the patients; we don't have that kind of heater at home and besides, it seems somewhat dangerous but what do i know) or a warm towel. 

but when there's an infection, it should be treated. if he is adamantly against seeing a doctor, or going to urgent care, maybe you can  call his insurance's 24/7 advice nurse line (if they feel it warrants a visit to the ER, that would make a better case to get them to come to the house, or sometimes, those rn's on the line will call an ambulance over), or at the very least, ask a pharmacist what their recommendations for over the counter meds, lotions, ointments, etc. would be.

all the best.

,Young people need to hear these experiences; they know nothing of what is in store for them.," I think the first thing you learn in caregiving is that what you see on those “Visiting Angel” commercials is utter BS. Happy smiling seniors painting pictures or playing a guitar or helping their “Visiting Angel” in the kitchen to prepare a meal; totally devoid of reality.

My wife and I are struggling to care for her 95 year old mother since 2018 in her home that she doesn’t want to leave. The doctor says she’s in “remarkable” health despite her moderate dementia and inability to use her arms, hands or legs. She requires physical contact and effort to move her to the bathroom as she is incontinent and needs to visit the bathroom at least every two hours, 24/7. 

This “moment to moment” caregiving is damaging my wife’s health as she is battling depression and sleep disorders from her wrecked sleep cycle. She’s been able to hire help which is a godsend, but coverage is spotty and we can’t plan or commit to anything because a single phone call will change everything.

When you get to this situation, this is when you find out if your family is there for you. My wife and I have been making huge sacrifices trying to care for her mother even though we live over 100 miles away. Meanwhile, my wife’s older brother lives right next door and is barely in the picture. He did show up recently when one of the hired caregivers called him because his mother had fallen to the floor during an attempted transfer from the bed to wheelchair and the caregiver couldn’t lift her up; but other than that, they rarely call or visit, maybe once or twice a year. That includes her adult grand daughter that lives directly across the street on land her ailing grandmother gave her on the condition that they mow her yard. They reneged on that after a couple of years and now we have to pay someone to mow. 

Just felt the need to rant, I don’t know how much more of this my wife can take. On a brighter note, my wife’s mother will get her second COVID vaccine in a couple of weeks. I don’t believe that she can be safely cared for in the home anymore.  My wife doesn’t agree and believes that if her mother goes to a nursing home, she’ll lose the will to live and pass shortly after. There may be some truth to that. 

We come to these forums because we’re in this situation and we’ve experienced these issues. But people with parents who are still independent really need to hear the experiences here; and never promise a parent that they won’t ever have to go to a nursing home. Caregiving is a taxing and health diminishing endeavor; my wife is doing this purely on devotion and possibly beyond what she may be physically capable.","I'm going to ask you the question that occurred to me.  Why does her desire to stay in her home override everyone's safety, your wife's emotional well-being, yours, and the entirely unproven assumption that she wouldn't do well in a more appropriate setting?  Isn't there considerable risk of your wife, or both of you, getting hurt enough that you won't have any choices left?  The brother's attitude is  a major factor here, too, in my opinion.  He's no real help, right?  Does your ladylove think that her brother might be difficult if she is moved to somewhere with care that isn't completely provided by...his sister?  


I could be wrong about all of this, but...just wow.
Wow, really well said...that slap in the face from reality hits pretty damn hard and I wish I would have read this a year ago. I’m 25 and have been caring for my 63 y/o mother for the past year or so...she has a neurological disorder with symptoms very similar to the ones you have described. And just as you said, she doesn’t have much help other than me due to family issues etc. AND much like your wife, I’ve been feeling pretty disillusioned with reality and have been dealing with some pretty severe depression...I thought I had what it took to take care of my mom.  But the truth is it takes a village, and neither her mother nor my own mother will be able to receive the proper care they deserve if they continue to stay in their homes. At a certain point I’m worried I’m going to burn out and not be able to guarantee her safety. If your wife is anything like myself, she’s probably feeling very numb and doesn’t know how to process it all and just wants to try to take control of the situation and make everything okay. I know my mom is happier at home too, and always said she never wants to end up in some facility, but at a certain point I had to at least accept that I can’t do this alone. And that’s what I’ve been working on recently. Mom is currently still at home with me but we have at least been trying to discuss options and accept that it’s unfortunately not totally feasible for me to take all this on by myself. I always thought that I’d be able to step up in a situation like this, but in reality this shit is difficult and draining and heartbreaking.

I hope this doesn’t come off as me giving unsolicited advice or making this about me or anything haha. I’m just in awe at how similar our situations are, and my heart hurts for you and your wife. She’s lucky to have a supportive partner by her side and I can tell you from experience that that kind of support will be remembered forever; I’m sure she’s extremely grateful for you. Thank you for posting this and I wish you and your family the best.
This is such a hard situation. No-one tells you how gruelling and miserable it is. I'm currently caring for my dad with dementia remotely as his power of attorney. I'm an only child so the team is me,  200 miles away, and his common-law wife who is erratic, emotionally volatile and very demanding. 

For the first few months my partner and I both took a huge hit. We were so exhausted and stressed, and I began to feel despair over my dad's caring situation. I considered assisted living but figured he would lose the will to live too. 


That said, things got a lot easier for me when I instructed the care agency to visit on a schedule. They also do assessments regularly, and have been able to adapt around his hospital visits. They send me notes every day too. 

I also got to a place, in of myself, where I realised there is only so much I can do. I focus on the positive. For example, this week he was in hospital after a fall, but a few days earlier he was enjoying the reclining chair I organised and the new heaters. He didn't say anything of course, but I know objectively these things have made him more comfortable. He's fine after the fall, although who knows what will happen after the next. No-one appreciates you as a carer, so you need to give that to yourself. 

I remind myself I'm doing everything I humanly can, but that also, it's fair for me to live my life. I was caring for him at the cost of caring for myself. I started taking respite days, trusting that the carers could take care of things, and now I have things setup in such a way that I can work again and have a social life. 

There are blimps and disasters of course, but I feel a lot better having taken some space for me. There are calm days where he's alright and the days where it all goes to hell don't screw me up as much. I also have accepted that it's his life and his death, I can improve his comfort, safety and ensure he gets medical care, but I can't stop him dying. 

It's really hard, but you both need some space and time for you. Is there anyway you could get respite, like having the carers come in and take over for a few weeks short-term? 

Things that have helped us also include therapy (can rant at therapist about it), listening phone lines and working with local age and dementia charities and social services.
Ya it’s unfortunate but caregivers aren’t paid a living wage so that is why the care is spotty and not the best. Nation wide laws need to change to force employers to pay adequately to caregivers. Caregivers are high burn out. I won’t work with people who I have to lift, because I can get paid the same to not break my back. Children of the baby boomers generation should advocate for caregivers to be able to afford to live. No one can care about another human being if they can’t fully take care of themselves.
First and foremost, the selfless service your wife and you are providing to her mother is commendable. It is rarely seen elders being duly taken care of by their wards. But, the concern here is about your wife’s and your own mental and physical health. Neglecting your health will do good neither to your mother nor you. Taking care of yourself is important because if you too are not healthy, you won’t be able to extend help to your wife’s mother. Other than this, if you have apprehensions regarding nursing homes then shed all of those and make extra efforts in finding a genuine one. But, above everything, take good care of yourself first because you cannot pour anything from an empty cup. Here is the source you might want to open and read to know the pros and cons of hiring private caregivers or agency caregivers.

Wow. I can definitely relate. Took care of my mom exclusively for six years. Was her full time caregiver. Received no compensation. Gave up a career. Become horribly depressed. And I thought something was wrong with me because I couldn’t continue on towards the end. Being burned out is an understatement. Couldn’t have a social life. Or friendships. Couldn’t date or be in a relationship. Many relationships prior to her falling ill were torn asunder because of my divided focus. Not complaining. Don’t want to give that impression. I don’t regret at all being there for my mom. But realize anyone who is in this caregiving situation. You can’t do it all. Yes. You do make sacrifices. The depression is real. The isolation is real. It’s not you. Nobody can adequately care for another human being constantly to the point of neglecting their own needs. They will drag you down with them. It’s okay to admit you can’t do it. It’s okay to put your parent in a home. I wish I would have realized this early on. It’s not noble to give up your life to help an ailing parent. It’s just not. You will never get that time back. Just be aware. There are options. You are not alone. You don’t have to do it alone.
This is a common experience many adult children suffer with when their parents become unable to live on their own anymore. Thank you for sharing your experience.",2021-02-12 19:01:17,waysafe,liodlz
,Advice or a product?,My mom just came home from an extensive surgery. She has no knee in her leg and cannot put weight on her right leg at all. We are having trouble getting her to the bathroom. She can go in with a wheelchair but claims the chair is too low to stand from. I got her in with a walker that you can sit on but now they're telling me she can't get it in the bathroom again. Is there anything I can do at this point?,"Have a Occupational Therapist assess her and her home. They will be able to advise you on what is needed.
I would suggest a commode. It may not be ideal, but it would help reduce the amount of movement back and forth,

An occupational therapist assesses and advises how to adapt to doing everyday things. They help with getting medical equipment as well. My husband had a leg amputation in 2011 and the other in 2020. Each time we needed to learn how to deal with bathroom and shower issues, so the therapist was invaluable to work with these problems. Check out a possibility for your mom to use a transfer board to move from a wheelchair to a toilet or bedside commode. It will be much safer. I believe the walker could be a big safety hazard, so I suggest the bedside commode or a commode that goes over a toilet and has strong handles to prevent slippage.",2021-02-10 12:58:13,Momcantsleepthesaga,lgzfdz
,"""Caregiver's Journey "" - Podcast for us.","I understand the rules and know about asking for feedback for things, but I hope you see that this post is meant to help, meant to band together and I apologize if it doesn't come across that way. I'm really struggling myself and hoping this helps me learn and helps voices be heard thst wouldn't otherwise be:



I've been thinking for a long time that there isn't enough for us Caregivers out in internet land. We occupy small pockets of online platforms and really need more love than we get. I've started working on a Podcast Idea called ""Caregivers Journey"", and it's aimed at wanting to talk to you all out there, share your stories and hopefully learn from each other, or at least feel like we're a community of people working together.

I'll be making the first episode about my own journey as a caregiver to my wife with PPMS over the last few years, and in future episodes would like to have a discussion with some of you via Zoom or Facebook or Google or whatever the heck.

If you're interested, please reach out. I think the Podcasting world deserves a place where people can talk about their lives, vent, cry, be emotional, get out what it feels like to watch their loved one's body betray them, and feel like they have support. 

And I'm hoping it finds someone out there who doesn't yet know that there is some support for them.","It took me forever to find this site and I don't even know if it is the right site for me. Most Caregivers support groups are on facebook and I don't use facebook. Other links for support groups were either geographic specific, or had broken links. I would love to find some type of forum for those unpaid, family caregivers that are simply burnt out. If you know of any please comment. Thanks
Sounds like a great idea. There are multiple podcasts out there for the longterm care businesses, but one dedicated to individual family caregivers sharing their stories would be a welcome addition to the space.
Are you including caregivers who work for an agency? I haven’t had a lot of time to listen to podcasts, but it may be a different perspective when you have been doing this for a few years and you form some friendships with clients and then they move on to nursing homes or pass away.  There becomes a need for some grief healing and counseling for caregivers, when you help several people in a row and then they just end up dead. A lot of emotional labor is involved, even when you do your best to distance yourself and maintain proper professional boundaries.

I’ve suggestions for you. A podcast for caregivers is a great idea to connect and hear out their experiences, be a part of smiles, and cry. I am saying what I think about podcasts. Caregivers hardly find time to listen to long pods of 20-30 minutes, and just stop listening in the middle of it. What you think of making it shorter, maybe in smaller pieces of 40-60 seconds with just one topic at a time. People will be interested in listening to a problem they faced and its solution, not the story around it. This will also save their time and you will be covering a lot of main points separately. This is what I think and I might be wrong about it, but all the luck to you to make it a success…cheers.
Update on this project?

,Need help with negotiating for higher hourly wage from care agency,"(X-posted to r/caregiversupport, r/offmychest, r/caregiving)
Hi. So I’ve been working as a professional caregiver for a huge international care agency for about 8 months. In that time, I’ve had a handful of clients, and I’ve always made the same hourly amount of $16. At one clients house, I glimpsed the hourly rate that the client pays the agency, and saw that it's $36/hr... So I'm not even getting 50%. 

The way I see it, we caregivers are always caring for those who are most vulnerable. The agency, in addition to being a networking resource, ought to view us caregivers as their lifeblood, and advocate for us. They should act as our ""agent"", make sure we are being treated well, mediate, facilitate transparent communication, enforce high standards of treatment in both directions.. But they should be in our corner. The agency that I work for, does not seem to share my viewpoint. I am often kept in the dark, left on read when I ask questions they don't feel like answering, expected to be thankful for whatever scraps I'm given and to keep my mouth shut. 16/hr is not a live able wage in this part of California.

TODAY I was contacted by a staffing manager, (WHILE I was on duty at a clients house, but that's another issue) and was told they want to pull me from this client and put me on a new one, starting tomorrow. They gave me a very brief summary of the clients needs, hours, their name, hourly wage and asked me to confirm. I noticed that the wage was $18, and the clients name is Japanese. So I responded by saying I will not be available to start until later in the week, and does this client require a Japanese speaking caregiver (which I am.) they responded that yes, they do.

I don't know how much extra the client is charged for that service, but Im damn certain it's more than $2/hr. I feel like the wool has been pulled over my eyes to an extent, and I'm done being taken advantage of. At the time I was hired, I know for a fact I was the first Japanese speaking employee on payroll for this location. I'd like to strongly request a higher wage, but I'm not sure how to go about that appropriately. Can anyone share some insight or tips on how I can/should respond?
Time is of the essence in this case. Thank you very much, reddit.","I'm in a similar boat and also preparing for a meeting to discuss my wage. 

The last time I received a raise, albeit +$0.20/hr, we had a meeting to discuss my performance. It was all great points and a perfect score according to their scale. Now, the manager was the one leading the entire conversation and at the end I just authorized the raise. When it comes to asking for a raise, I get the feeling they'll want to take control too but I'm going to try and not let that happen. 

I've made several points as to why I am deserving of a raise. Such as a change in family circumstances, gas mileage and car depreciation, frequently working overtime and outside my availability, and a few other personal points. Recently I've even begun searching for a new job as it is starting to feel like it's not worth the effort. I would hate to leave because all our clients are amazing and the staff is amazing, but the pay is not enough (I'm at $13.20/hr). And it's about the same rate for our clients some pay $35 others up to $52 depending on how many hours they're requesting. It made me upset to hear they pay so much. 

We definitely deserve more for the work we do. It is stressful and emotionally taxing. Advocate for yourself! I wish you the best of luck!
Be careful. Today I hit a realization point in my eyes that the term “nice people ALWAYS finish last” is 100% true. We do everything for these people. Our lives are their lives. We sacrifice everything and frankly get taken advantage of 100%. Today I was fired because I asked for a fair pay rate... let me explain. I was working for a client with autism roughly almost 6 years. My start pay was 12 bucks and then overtime I reached to almost 18 bucks an hour. Frankly due to Covid hitting, the regional center is no longer paying anyone overtime. I live off of overtime pay. I would get paid almost 28 bucks an hour for overtime. The company I work for gives 200 hours to the patients family. Since again I cannot get paid over time, I offered the family a new agreement plan. A deal that will benifit them because I’ll be working long shifts and it’ll benifit me because I can get my hours and get paid for the full time I’m there. Since I can no longer get paid 28 dollars anymore because no overtime pay anymore, I’m back down to 18. I asked the family to use their 200 hours and pay me full 24 hour shifts (since I’m there for 24 hours) but the family would never pay me 24 hours. They refused and let me go just like that... I asked for a fair cutt again I’m there 24 hours a day... so I asked to get paid for the full hours I’m working since I won’t get paid overtime anymore. The family has full control how they want to spend their hours... but after 6 long years of cleaning up shit and puke and dealing with screaming and hitting, lack of sleep.... I was fired cause I asked for what was right and this is why being caring and nice gets you nowhere because after everything I’ve sacrificed for them. I have no job now. Maybe that’s a good thing. Maybe caregiving isn’t my calling anymore. I don’t know where life will take me as of right now.
Holy S***! You’re getting $16 an hour base pay? I’ve been working for 4 years for my homecare agency and just reached $12 per hour. They won’t raise anyone more than $.25 per year. I have asked for a bigger raise every time I get a review, but they never give it. They state there is a ceiling of $.25 per year and that I am getting the highest raise they allow. I know I’m getting taken advantage of. Almost none of the clients can pay out of pocket, though, and so their insurance companies are paying a lower amount based on the client’s state benefits. They know how dependable I am, but that doesn’t matter. Keeping the company alive is what matters, and I am certain that some weeks we are lucky they can make payroll at all. Overtime always has to get approval before we can get it.

,"Scared, frustrated and want to scream","I’m feeling really overwhelmed. I’ve been caring for my mom who has stage 4 colon cancer with mets to lung and bone for the past 3 years. Two weeks ago she fell and broke her femur. She had surgery and we brought her home. My husband and I noticed the past few days she was losing motor function in her other leg. MRI shows the cancer is in her spine, and compressing it. Since she’s not mobile, she can’t do chemo therapy. I’m having a hard time accepting this is it for her. My dad died a few years ago and I have no siblings.

We just found out they will do an emergency surgery on my mom’s spine now. The surgery is the only option she has to keep her mobility. However she’s at an increased risk of surgery complications due to her health. My husband and I just left to hospital to discuss her final wishes if she doesn’t make it. I just feel numb.","I just finished caring for my grandmother in her final days, with something very similar. Believe me I know what you're going through, it's very hard. She is very lucky to have you. Keep up the good work. Hang in there
So hard for all of you.  You're going to need to go somewhere quiet, close your eyes and just breathe.  I know it sounds simplistic, but it really helps to disengage the ""OMG"" part of your brain.  Let some of that stress response calm down.  If you can't do that right now, just know that your mom is travelling a road we all take.  I'm not religious at all, but I find it comforting that people I love dearly have already gone before me.  You are a good daughter.  Your good care has already been a blessing to your mother.  Follow your heart and do what seems best and leave the rest to her body.  Thinking of you all, best wishes.",2021-02-02 08:25:53,Shalar79,laveae
,Tips to Prevent Age-Related Weight Gain," Hello there, 

I hope that you are keeping well and staying safe. Today I wanted to share a few tips to prevent age-related weight gain. As a caregiver, weight gain plays a significant part in most of the lifestyle diseases among older adults. Before we get into the tips to prevent age-related weight gain, a quick fact round-up:

ü As we age, loosing weight is more challenging as our bodies respond differently to our weight loss efforts due to reduced metabolic function resulting from hormonal changes.

ü After the age of 30, natural lean muscle begins to decline by 3% to 8% per decade.

ü Lean muscle uses more calories than fat. 

Here are a few tips that can help keep the weight at bay allowing you or your loved one to lead a healthy life.

· Stay Physically Active- Physical activity ranges from strength training to cardio exercises like aerobics and simple household chores/home activities. Each of these depend on the individuals physical state and ability. 

· Prioritize Healthy Eating- Focus on low calorie, high volume foods that will keep you energized and fuller for longer hours. Limit the intake of trans fats from junk and processed foods. Keeping a diet diary can also help in portion control as it is easy to monitor what you are consuming and the effects these foods have on your body.

· Stay Hydrated- Drink your water regularly for an increased metabolism, perfect way to support fat breakdown. 

· Get Enough Sleep- Seven to nine hours of sleep will ensure that you wake up feeling energized, stay active throughout the day and burn calories in the process. Rest. You Need It. 

· Stay Mentally and Socially Active- Puzzles and boardgames will keep you mentally active keeping the stress away which in turn prevents stress related weight gain. Social engagements might be limiting due to the pandemic, but we can always use technology to stay connected with friends and family. This prevents loneliness and depression which could cause stress. 

· Monitor Your Health Regularly- Being informed and aware of your health status helps you maintain a healthy lifestyle that can prevent age-related health complications. It helps you make more intentional and healthy dietary choices that will meet your body’s needs. 

Please share any other tips you have and feel free to comment on which ones you or an elderly loved one has lived by. Stay safe, stay healthy.",,2021-01-26 12:51:01,ImmaculateHCS_MA,l5jas1

,Living in site home; a coverup for slumlords,"I live in a sitehome in Iowa (through a program for people with mental health problems). My rent and utilities are paid for through county; county pays for my services. 

Since I've came here, I've been denied medical care access for months on end; despite the fact my funding (SEIA) is supposed to cover my rent (and I have a lease), the service provider (the same ones that own the property) have exercised their authority to threaten my livelihood for minor infractions (not putting my kitchen appliances where staff thinks they ""ought to go"", not doing dishes, etc.). 

They threw a fit about mold on the wall, and suggested it was up to the clients to scrub it off the walls; I was already denied a move into community housing because the place I found (that was willing to accept me) has mold, and my care coordinator said county funding would never pay for a place with mold. 

I already called an Ombudsman, and it never went anywhere. The first person I talked to said that I was describing ""infringements on human rights"", but when she transferred me to the Ombudsman in charge of my housing, she said she could only make an inquiry to the provider, and I never heard anything after. 

My care coordinator (the person in charge of my county funding) is becoming half as sympathetic each day. 

I feel as though I could have this place shut down for mold, alone, but I'm afraid of what would happen to my housing if I did. 

What should I do? 

I'm already about ready to graduate from the program into my own community housing; I've been looking for housing for months, but I have an eviction from two years ago, and a minimal budget for housing/utilities (not to mention a care coordinator that seems to be spiraling into a deeper and deeper hole with each passing day), so it's been hard to find housing, aside. 

Please, I don't even know what good posting here is going to do...I have nowhere else to go, and between the way I'm treated, and my own limitations (physical/mental disabilities), I'm about ready to just report whatever, and let the chips (my housing) fall where it may. 

I don't know what else to do. If I say nothing, I'm a coward, and I allow suboptimal care for the people that come after. 

If I say something (which would require me pushing ""up the ladder""), I could end up making myself more vulnerable...","It appears that your situation is perilous and the people who are supposed to help you are tapped out.  That kind of makes sense, the world is very difficult right now. 

If I were you I'd stop contacting the people who are supposed to help you constantly (You're calling them daily, right) and instead see what you could do for yourself.  You're supposed to ""graduate"" from this situation?  What happens then?  Where do you go?  Where do people go who graduated in the past?  If you can find these out you may have a path to investigate.",2021-01-19 22:18:07,OrdanCoal,l10gyk
,"I'm two days into being a caregiver, and I'm already terrified. What advice do you have for a newbie?",,"Wow you're doing a lot and you're very strong and caring for doing this and for reaching out asking for help! 

I would try and talk to your grandmother? Leaving things better than when you found it is very honourable and kind. However when you're in the middle of it, try and remember that in situations like this, 'better than when you found it' may just mean 'not as much of a shit show as it could've been.' it's hard to see your small victories as such when you're up against so much. i would say focus on the changes that give you back some space and help. the depends sounds great and you can get ones that closely resemble underwear so the change may not even be noticed. and the hardest one for me to remember: you can pour from an empty cup. sending you love and light
What's your legal position?  Do you have a poa?  Who is your Uncle's legal guardian, you or your grandmother? Is there other family involved?  What's going to happen to your uncle when your grandmother dies? Who is taking over in April, and can you consult with them?

Leaving things better than you found them is going to be quite a project.  Don't forget to take care of yourself; most caregivers neglect themselves, sometimes grievously. You are performing a valiant service for your family, be proud.
One day at a time, what you are doing  is not for any accolades or appreciation, it’s OK to vent (just not at the person you are helping) if believe in God, only God knows what you are doing and going through AND that is enough, don’t worry and accept what you are doing is enough (even if it isn’t) don’t depend on others’ appreciation, say thank you and move on, let negative opinions in one ear and out the other, don’t let conversations about infirmity be the center of your life and line up people to give you a break ( and don’t feel guilty from within or from others [my wife became sick in the mid 80’s] and seeking counseling is OK

,How do you get a POA over a dementia patient that refuses to give POA?,"My father is lucid more often than he's not which is part of the problem. He literally has no idea that there's anything wrong with him. He won't talk to an Elder Law attorney, he won't grant me POA, he won't do anything really. He thinks he's fine. I'm his full time caretaker now and he's mean and belligerent. He has meds that need picked up and has to pay out of pocket because he let his prescription coverage lapse. He won't give me permission to do so and I can't afford it. He knows they're there, he just... doesn't care? I'm not sure. We've talked about it several times. Money is a non-issue on his part but I can't spend his money without his permission. Bills are going to be coming due soon and I worry about getting checks written and sent out. He doesn't even know what year it is. On all the checks he wrote as gifts for Christmas, he put the year as 2090. If he does that on the checks he sends for bills, they won't get paid.","You need to petition the court for guardianship and conservatorship. Process will vary from state to state but an attorney will be able to get it started.

Edit There are implications if you do this as caregiver and  getting paid by the state to do so.
You're going to have to lie to him. 

I know this sounds harsh. I was in the same situation as you. He thought he was fine, meanwhile he was overpaying bills by hundreds, he couldn't write out a check because he didn't know the date, etc. 

I talked to his accountant and his doctor. Both agreed it needed to be done. The doctor wrote a letter describing his condition. I also talked to the lady at the bank who knew him pretty well and knew his condition too. By coincidence there was a tax issue that his accountant made me aware of, just a simple correction that was needed on his tax returns and was delaying his refund. Under that premise, I took my dad to the accountant who told him there was some paperwork coming that he needed to sign for his refund to come. I drew up a POA. Told him the banker has the thing he needs to sign, so we went there and the banker had him sign it and she notarized it.

I felt huge guilt, because he trusted me and I was not being 100% truthful. But his trust and his dementia meant that he didn't even bother reading what he was signing. 

See if there is some situation similar to that that you can come up with that he'll believe and work with someone to get it done. You have to get it notarized and hopefully you'll find someone sympathetic who can go along with you. Good luck.
In my state you need two physician evaluations to prove they are not cognitively able to make decisions for themselves. If they live in a facility, the admin or Director of Nursing may also perform a mini-psych evaluation. This usually helps physicians in their assessments.
If you're in the US, look up your county's area agency on aging. They're a great resource for everything you're dealing with, including helping your dad find prescription coverage.
Good advice given on this post. Good luck to you. It is a difficult road, but definitely in the best interest of your F.",2021-01-17 01:58:02,m00nf1r3,kz1l6p
,Are there any virtual support groups for young family caregivers?,"**Does anyone know of any virtual support groups for young (\~early 20s) family caregivers, or would anyone here want to create one (maybe a group chat or something)? Any good books on this topic would be useful too!**

It's odd to think of myself in those terms, but I suppose I am (23F). My mom (59) has some chronic health issues, and it's been more than a year now where I feel stuck, as though my life has been put on hold. The pandemic has definitely worsened it all (but it worsened everything for everyone so I can't really complain). I've been dealing with a lot of my own personal issues on top of this lately (e.g. depression, breakup), and I really feel like I'm drowning. 

I have good friends, but it's hard to talk about this with them because 1) I want to escape from this when we talk, 2) I really hate talking about it because it's sad/talking about it won't change anything so why bother, 3) they can't really understand what I'm dealing with, for the most part they're all able to live their lives, make their own plans. A lot of them don't really know the extent of what's going on because I don't share, and I don't really intend to.

...but I think it could be helpful to talk with others in the same boat, especially internet strangers --somehow I think it'd be easier to share with them.","Not a group but I’m only 27 and have helped both my parents as caregivers since I was 12 if you’d ever like to talk.

,Need to admit somewhere I’ve failed,"Ive never felt like this

I’ve been trying to work up the courage to post this somewhere. And after last night I’m ready to snap. 

I am the sole caregiver of my father. He is in extremely poor health and I’m all he has. Before the pandemic I was doing just fine. I was able to pay all the bills and make sure he had to food to eat. I didn’t and still do not care about me, he’s all that matters. Covid hit, I lost my job. In some sort of sick joke the universe pulled on me, he lost his health care because I didn’t re-enroll him but I never received the letter they swear they sent telling me I had to and why I had to. Now I have to pay for his medications. I was able to pull myself some work, so I stopped getting my own medications and started getting his. As I said, screw me he is the important one. Now I have no work until the last week in January. I apparently had to apply for the stimulus check and I didn’t know that so I don’t get that. My dad opened the fridge this morning and looked at me with such disappointment. I’m failing him. I’ve reached out to community resources, neighbors, and programs. When I couldn’t get any help or immediate help from them I finally called his sister. His sister is a vile human. When their parents were dying in hospice she somehow managed to switch everything over to her. And all my dad wanted was the vintage car him and his dad refurbished together. She didn’t even give him that. She told me that my father “isn’t worth it” and that I should “just let him go and live your life. Do yourself the favor. No one will ever make money caring for another”. I then asked if I could do any work at all for her and she replied with an extremely nasty remark and hung up laughing at me. 

I am supposed to be the man of the house. I am supposed to be the one handling everything. I have the landlord and electricity down my throat. I’ve had so many extensions. I tried just expressing how I felt to others and was mocked because “men don’t talk about this stuff dude”. I give up.","[deleted]

,"Are we keeping her home for us, or for her?","Hi, all. I could use some perspective here.

My grandmother is 101. Up until about 9 days ago, she was remarkably capable for her age. She's not independent by any means—she's lived with my uncle for the last 6-ish years—but she could walk around, handle all her bathroom business, eat food she's given, hold conversations, etc. For years her doctors have said she's one of the healthiest elders they've ever cared for. (No idea why...she's survived mostly on hot dogs and coffee her whole life! Ha.)

Things changed right around Christmas, though. Drs thought she might have a UTI so treated her for that, but it turns out she didn't have one, so we're not sure what ""caused"" the change. (I say ""caused"" because I'm pretty sure it's just her body shutting down due to old age, but most of my family is still reaching for other answers). She's immensely uncomfortable all the time (sometimes she describes it as pain, mostly she can't say specifically what's wrong), when she's awake she's either catatonic or inconsolably agitated, she's lost all independent mobility, barely eats or drinks (and absolutely nothing solid), and can't use the bathroom or bathe on her own. She begs us to kill her, poison her, shoot her, end her life, etc.

This has been difficult for my uncle to adjust to as he's essentially gone from being someone with a dependent roommate to being a full time caretaker for someone who is losing their will to live. He's not equipped for it. Neither am I. I don't live in the same city as them but I came down to support my uncle; I'm here to help him both come to terms with her new quality of life and make an actionable plan for a hiring professional caregiver. It should be noted that my uncle still thinks she'll ""bounce back"" from this because she's had a few remarkable recoveries in the past...but I don't share this belief.

We're meeting with a potential part time caregiver tomorrow (or, well, today I guess...been up all night), so this isn't about whether or not we need to hire someone to help out—we definitely do, and we are. I guess my question is this...is that the right move, actually? Or maybe what I mean is: is it *enough*? The majority of my family (all of whom live far away and unable to travel for various reasons, most of them COVID-related) fears taking her to the hospital, and understandably so. It's scary taking someone as old as she is into a hospital, but it's especially scary considering the state of the world right now. If we take her in, she'd be alone due to COVID protocols. That sounds so, so awful for my sweet grandmother, who is the nucleus of joy for our family and who values family above all else. But the way she feels right now...it's horrible to watch. The whole point of keeping her home is to keep her comfortable and close to family...but she's not comfortable, and she doesn't seem to care at all about family right now. Maybe we're just keeping her home because *we* want her home.

I don't know. Maybe I just wanted to write all this down to process the feelings. But I'd also love to hear an thoughts anyone has on this. Advice, perspective, anything. Thank you.","I'm sorry, sounds like a tough situation.

But you are touching on an important point: who benefits from keeping her home? It is such a difficult idea to come to terms with losing someone that often we'll deny it and instead focus on prolonging the inevitable to the detriment of the person who is actually suffering. (It's something I saw often when I worked in the veterinary field, where beloved pets were put through unnecessary treatments because their owners could not process letting go. I know your grandma is not a pet, but the concept is the same.) Letting go is so difficult. 

It is complicated with Covid. Maybe a live-in part-time nurse would be an option until you guys can find someplace where she  can live full-time. But maybe it won't even get to that point, if she's 101 and things are shutting down like you describe, maybe her time is closer than your uncle is willing to admit. 

I guess the focus should be to do what needs to be done to keep her clean, comfortable and out of pain. There probably are ways to do that while keeping her at home and not at the hospital. There should be resources out there. Maybe ask via a local hospice?
Sorry for all your family is going through.  I would suggest that your grandmother will not be better off in a nursing home, but your family will be more comfortable if they don't have to witness her suffering.   She is dying, and she can suffer and die at home with her family, or suffer and die in a nursing home.  If you decide you can't stand her anguish, that's a valid response.  Whatever you decide will be hard.  Forgive yourself.
We know that our elders get better care at home.  They live longer and healthier with people who pay attention.  Of course, caregivers burn out a lot.  That sucks.

A home for a bedridden elder here would be around $12,000 to $30,000 a month, depending on what else she needs.  Easily 100K a year.  And they won't take her until she's stable and medicated.
Have you contacted your local hospice?
I know the dilemma and the truth is no one will care for you as well as family, the care in some of the assisted living places is not really great except on interview day. I know because prior to Covid i made surprise visits to places and geez, patients left yelling in bed for help, no one coming,dirty diapers etc.

 I have a similar situation with my 97 year old mom, she used to fool people on her age by decades, at 94 she was driving to her twice weekly bowling league  and a big rainstorm came up-and bang car accident. i took her to pt for a year and she recovered enough with a walker, she is still sharp mentally sharp but took a fall this Christmas and is afraid to walk with even a walker, trying in home PT, she hasn't given up the will to give but getting help in home in CA is super expensive now as everything over 9 hours is overtime,less helpers due to Covid scare  and my siblings are not really stepping up. The stress is something that I can't escape. So I guess there is no easy answer-just know others are in similar situation

,"(39/f) In need of tips for confronting sensitive, defensive man (78/m).","I am the COVID house companion for a male relative, 78/m, whom I love and care deeply about but with whom interaction is sometimes challenging. Over recent years, the man has shown an increasing level of defensiveness and insecurity, and deals with it an increasing childlike manner to the point that our interactions sometimes do not resemble adult interactions. 
Tonight I approach the man as he was washing dishes.  He was cleaning with a sponge tipped wand, cold water and not looking at the dishes, indeed, he was not wearing his glasses. I picked up one of the bowls in the drying rack and found, predictably, that the inside remained covered with food since he was neither looking at them nor using the better tool (a washcloth).  I have confronted him before about how dishes are remaining dirty when he does not bother to look at them and tries to use a sponge wand. 
He was unable to receive this information.  When I tried to show him that the dishes remained dirty, he refused to look, became upset and left the house. When he feels criticized he has started to say, ""it's not what you say, it's how you say it,"" but he cannot answer how it is wrong when I objectively tell him that the dishes are not clean and that the wand is not cleaning them fully. I tell him that there is nothing mean or abusive about the necessity of pointing out that he is not washing dishes in a way that cleans them, but that I feel that he has a very high level of defensiveness and sensitivity. This sequence has recurred on multiple nights regarding dishes and also is replicated in other contexts. 
I would love to hear advice or tips about how to deal with defensiveness, sensitivity, and childlike response to being confronted about things that need improvement or correction.","Long time professional elder caretaker here, from what you described it sounds it may be more beneficial to switch up the chore routines of the house. If he’s not washing dishes correctly, maybe he could be in charge of putting them away, or doing the laundry, or one of the chores you currently do that would be appropriate for his age and physical limitations (not being able to see if food is still on the dishes due to wearing glasses). 

You mention childlike reactions so maybe treat it as you would with a child and find something for him to do that he feels he is proficient at, or get him a better tool to use for the job like a scouring pad. The wand may be easier for him if he has arthritis in his wrists, but if it’s old it may need to be replaced. I also like to use stronger dish soap with my elderly clientele, like Dawn Powerwash spray, it just makes my job easier but also makes the process more efficient so they can contribute without feeling like they are “bad” at the job you’ve asked them to do or becoming not useful as a person, which I suspect is where his sensitivity is stemming from. 

Additionally, 78 is getting up there in years so it may be that he’s experiencing some sort of mental delay such as sundowners, which can increase tendencies towards frustration and defensiveness. Respect to you for being patient and trying to help, but unfortunately in situations such as this you should accept the possibility that he’s experiencing the natural decline that comes with age and facilitate creative solutions rather than expect him to change. Old dog, new tricks and all that.
Also, try to lovingly state just the facts.  ""There is dried food on this bowl,"" factual. Done. 

 Avoid "" You aren't scrubbing adequately.""   ""You"" puts people on the defensive no matter how reasonable the request. 

Try the observational fact route, leave the ""you"" out of it. 

Good luck!",2021-01-02 19:01:55,NDStarchase,kp91jh
,"This time being a caregiver is tougher bc she’s struggling with independence, I’d love any advice/tips from anyone.","I was a caregiver for my boyfriend’s dad with vascular dementia until very recently when he went into hospice in a memory care unit at a nursing home.

As a last “ef you” from 2020, my mom (65F, also has fibromyalgia and Rheumatoid Arthritis) fell on ice while trying to get into a truck, and fractured her hip. She’s completely immobile and finds out on Monday whether she needs surgery. She’s a tough cookie but is in a ton of pain and having a difficult time accepting that she needs help (who wouldn’t, it’s such a tricky time!). 

I (27F) live about 20 min from my parents. My dad is taking care of her the next few days, but unfortunately struggling with money and work, so he has to go in most of next week. I’m going to move in there for a while because she needs someone there 24/7. Their house has 2 floors and right now she’s confined to one room, and we’re working on making her a ramp to get in and out of that room to go to the bathroom, etc. I’m working remotely, but I do have calls that are several hours long during which I’m unable to help her. 

No shower on 1st floor so my bf is trying to plan out a way to rig one up in our back sunroom area. It’s helpful that we’ve spent so much time caregiving for his dad but that was different as he was not as mentally sound or aware as my mom is.

Do you have any tips to make a first floor more accessible for someone using a walker/
wheelchair? 

I have a reacher and toilet seat guard on the way, and her walker is decent. I want to do everything I can to help her feel as independent as possible, bc she’s really struggling with the change.

Any hacks or tricks to making this easier on her (and me when I can’t be right next to her)?
Thanks so much, I’m very thankful for this community.","Dignity is so important. I bought a whole portable toilet seat thing for my dad so he didn’t have to walk far at all. Basically, they go to the bathroom in that and then you remove the bottom to clean. I rented a hospital bed (surprisingly inexpensive) which meant he could raise it to help him getting up and out of bed. I got him overnight depends for when it was too hard or painful to get up. They detach at the sides so she could change it herself. They sell pads to put on the bed so the sheets aren’t soiled. (Like puppy pads- I’m not sure which is cheaper.) They sell dry shampoo but she won’t need to shampoo very often and this, too, can be done with a small basin of water. A kitchen sink is easy to wash your hair once she can walk. She can brush her teeth if you provide a bowl and toothbrush. I’ll also add that my mom has terrible arthritis and ramps are really hard for her. We installed a stair lift for her. I also installed handrails in the bathroom so she could pull herself up rather than rely on her painful hip and knees. We hired a plumber to do it but you could do it yourself - just make sure you’re in a stud so it doesn’t pull out. There are also videos online for exercises that a bedridden person can do. My dad felt they gave him some control. Obviously, check with your doctor about this. If my reacher, you mean one of those grabbers that can grab things in the ground? My mom loves that thing. I also bought her a contraption to get her socks on without bending over. That is super useful to her as well. Good luck",2021-01-02 14:04:04,thebrucekwayne,kp3dmk
,"I'm looking at him, and we're talking, and all I can think is to NOT cry because I miss him so much.","Posting this here because I'm his full time caretaker. I need to get this out, somewhere, and certainly will never say this to my SO!


I'm fortunate; my husband should (mostly) eventually recover (stroke). We both know that he is different though and may always be so. I'm lucky he's competent. I'm lucky we can talk to each other and hold conversations. I'm lucky he's young (-ish) and should mostly recover even though this was classified as a major stroke. I'm incredibly lucky to still have this man at my side. I'm so incredibly fortunate in so many ways and I know it!


And yet... It doesn't stop me from missing my husband, my best friend, my partner. He's not the same person. The personality changes are subtle, but they are real, and I'm starting to think they may be permanent. I don't love him any less and I'll adjust and we'll make new memories and we'll create new ties. And this will become just another life difficulty that we went through together.


But, I miss the one person that could have made this easier, that would have understood, the one who knew me better at times than I know myself. The one that would have made hilarious comments, the one that gently pointed out my unrealistic fears while telling me they were legitimate feelings to have, the one that made me feel like I --WE-- could overcome anything together. I miss him, even as I look into his eyes, the same eyes I've been adoring for more than 25 years.","My husband of 49 years had a major stroke 15 years ago.  He recovered well, but he was 59, and shortly his department was reorganized and he was laid off.  He was never able to find full time work, but thankfully he qualified for social security.  He did well with a part time summer job for about ten years, then he suddenly lost function.  Now he can't get out of bed or out of a chair without my help.  His short term memory is shot, but he still recognizes family and old friends.  I retired early to care for him, but as you say, he is not the same person.  There are occasional flashes of his personality, but they're rare.  I keep him fed and clean, I take him to his medical appointments, I'm kind--but it's not the same and we both know it.  It's heartbreaking, but we face it with as much courage as we can muster.  Best of luck to you and your spouse, and to all of us caught up in a similar situation.
I'm my spouses caregiver as well. She's had two brain aneurysms. I miss her too some days. Like today she's spaced out and sleepy. Yesterday funny and sassy as usual. 

It's been three years and I still grieve. Give yourself time. Recovery will be long, so find joy in the small wins.

Most caregiver jobs are not live-in jobs, and if it is advertised a live-in job, I would really question the whole setup, because it would be signing up to basically be a slave.

,I couldn't get her off the floor.....,"TLDR: I feel like I needed to get this out and share my struggle as a new caregiver. Wife came home for LTD a week before Covid shut down the world. 

-----
The recent snowfall coincided with my wife's PPMS progressing. Pain keeps her awake at night and wreaks havoc on her emotionally and physically. This means that I've become hyper-aware of where Danielle's going and what she's doing while I'm working from home. As soon as I hear a noise I'm paying attention. I'm waiting to hear the next sound. It's become my new normal. 75% of the time things are fine, but that 25%....

We have a higher bed (like three feet high!). Imagine you've got legs that (depending on the day) are either stiff like bricks or feel like jello. This on top of the exhaustion from not sleeping due to pain and MS fatigue and now you need to get into bed. It's an impossible task. The last two nights Danielle has not been able to get in our bed and ends up falling backward onto the floor. Imagine walking into a situation where your love, your person, is on the floor in pain and full of emotion. All you want to do is turn into Superman and pick her up and lay her back down, dry her tears, and tell her it's going to be okay. But you forget you're not packed full of muscles. So when you try to deadweight lift someone three feet off the ground and into a chair, it's going to hurt them. A lot.

Enough where she has to crawl to the living room on all fours, sometimes slipping like Bambi on ice because she's so spent of energy. She's lying there on the kitchen floor trying to get energy back, but she just can't. And all you can do is watch. Wipe the hair from her face. Dry her tears. And then hook your hands under her arms and slide her back the last five feet on her butt. All of this takes over an hour because you've never done this before and you're scared you'll hurt her.

Through all of this she's hyper emotional because... imagine what it's like losing the ability to get up off the floor and stand. Imagine that for a minute. You can't. It's something you'll hopefully never experience. I don't know how to deal with the fallout. It's impossible to be positive and helpful the whole time.  It's hard on me in ways I don't even think I understand yet. I try to push my way through the situation and deal with pent up emotion later. But dealing with my emotions gets lost because I don't take time to myself -  instead I just go to the next household chore I'm behind on. In the last two nights, I lost my cool. It took a long time for me to be the patient person I normally am. I was pushy, upset, and too quick. I didn't let her rest, I didn't let her calm down, I didn't let her tell me what she needed, I dictated it. And it made the situation worse. And I didn't realize this until halfway through. The aftermath of that is complete sadness. Complete failure. Shame. How could it not? It displays my shortcomings and makes me realize I need to do more. I need to start working out, building muscle, and finding more patience. But sometimes that gets lost in the swamp of having to be the house-runner because she can't.
 
For those of you who think this post is going to have a happy ending, it's not. I'm also not looking for pity or whatever goes with a post like this. I think this post will help me deal with my emotions. Maybe just getting stuff out into the universe will help me somehow? Isn't that a thing people say? ""Put it out into the universe"". Well, I'm doing that, universe. The least you can do is send over some light from Andromeda and give me more strength and patience please. Oh, and muscles. Like Jean-Claude Van Damme. I don't need to do the splits over the kitchen counter, but you know.. I'll take what I can.","Hey OP. Spouse of wife with SPMS. I'm sorry to say, I have been there and experienced the same anguish/frustrations/short-temperedness as you, and I am so, so sorry you are going through it. I cannot offer any brilliant advice nor insight, but I can make one suggestion: look into a [hoyer lift](https://www.amazon.com/hoyer-lift/s?k=hoyer+lift). They're not cheap, but if your wife has insurance or is on medicare/aide (in the States, she absolutely should be) they will cover most (if not all) of the cost. It will save you both a lot of pain. Then meet with a PT or OT (depending on what is available to you) and learn how to properly do lifts/assists - your back will thank you! I also suggest a [gait belt](https://www.amazon.com/Gait-Belt/s?k=Gait+Belt), as it will be another back saver.

There's tons of other things I can suggest from our experience, but I don't know if you need any (more) suggestions. But if you just need someone to vent to, there's a bunch of us here listening, brother.

,Would like some advice on difficult issue with mother,"My mother is 65. About 10 years ago she gained weight after the death of our grandmother. She was diagnosed with diabetes and was determined to lose the weight. Well she was pushing herself a little too hard and being a lifelong smoker, she had an aneurysm.

She survived. Was walking with a cane for awhile...but....shes a VERY stubborn person and refused to get up to do anything.  My father was very close to retirement which meant she would be unsupervised in the day time for about a year.  She gained more weight and her legs got weaker from not walking.

Where we're at now is a very bad place.  I moved in 10 years ago because the plan at the time was for them to travel the states when my dad retired and I look after the house. But that never happened and honestly I'm scared to leave because my dads old and my mother is a huge handfull.  As I mentioned, she's very stubborn and always gets her way. My dad can't say no (he does ... until she wears him down) to her which causes him to explode with anger every few days/weeks.  I'm able to avoid her by locking myself in my room many times because she's just going to ask me to do something she should be doing herself like give her something 5 feet away. It's extremely stressfull.

She expects us to entertain her but she never wants to do anything. She refuses to exercise or eat right. She says she is, but she isn't. Getting up to use the restroom is all she does most days.  She even demands my dad to prepare her meds for her, she won't even get up to do it herself.

This situation isn't new. It's been going on for a few years now.  Heart to heart talks, putting our foot down, none of it has worked. She's going to continue down this path until she has a heart attack or her body has had enough....

I'm at my wits end. I've been wondering if a short term stay at some kind of living facility will help. Some place that can strictly control her diet and has semi regular activities for her to do.  As of now she does nothing but having something going on down the hall from her will eventually pull her in.  Hopefully get her back to the point where she can get up on her own and move around independently.  I'm thinking somewhere between 6 to 9 months. I would even help them pay for it.

Is this idea even feasible?  I'm sorry I'm really clueless when it comes to this sort of thing. The whole situation has taken a mental and emotional toll on everyone and it feels like my own life is wasting away being stuck in this situation.  I'm not even taking care of myself as I should.

I'm really grasping at this point.","Rehab would help, but she can refuse to go.   It sounds like your dad could use some extra support as well--try your local senior center.   They will likely have lots of information. Or her doctor, if you're on her ""you can talk to this person"" list. 

My mother did this.  Depression.  She would sit on the couch, eat chocolate and cheese puffs, and move around only as much as she had to.   We talked to her, bought her simple exercise equipment,  offered to take her out, she would have none of any of it.  She died in a nursing home.

Don't forget to take care of you.
It seems like it's not feasible to send her anywhere for treatment because the problem is that she is determined to keep things the same. She doesn't want to get up and take a walk. She doesn't want to handle her own medication routine. She doesn't want to change her diet or to find ways of amusing herself or to become more independent. If she wanted to do things, you could help her, but this is exactly the opposite situation. It sounds like you've been offering her plenty of opportunities and solutions and she is choosing to reject them all.   

You may have more luck if you try to think of anhedonia, disinterest, lack of motivation, etc. as symptoms to speak with her doctor about. Could there be a depression component? Even the start of dementia? Perhaps there's a senior center with a sedentary activity group (books, puzzles, etc) she could get involved with. You can't help her if she doesn't want to be helped, but maybe there's something that will remind her that there is life beyond being unhappy and bossing her family around.
This is a tough battle OP, I'm sorry you're going through this. You can try to see if a short term stay in a facility will help, but I don't know if it will. Any sort of assisted living facility sounds like it would make it worse, so your best bet would be to look for an independent living facility. I know someone who works in one such facility and one of their residents is exactly like this. They'll sit around and ask other people to do things that they're perfectly capable on their own of doing, they just don't want to. Staff have to intervene all the time and it's always a fight because they insist they're helpless or there's no issue with treating people like servants. Your best bet would be to find some sort of senior apartment where she would truly have to live alone which would force her to either have to do things or where she would stop taking care of herself and then eventually end up in  an assisted living facility...
You can also try to get a personal care aide which may help to releive the stress of being ordered around as servants. However it might make it worse as there is an extra person to be ordered around. 
I would recommend talking with a doctor as one of the other commentors mentioned, this way this issue can be approached from a clinical perspective. This should help to find if there are actually any physical issues and/or if it's all behavioral in which case you can get a referral to therapist to work on that behavior. It does sound like she likes the attention of being served on hand and foot.
Worst case scenario she refuses all this. If that happens I would like to remind you you are her family not servants, neither you nor your dad have to get her anything nor manage her medications they are her responsibility. You also don't have to put up with her garbage behavior and can confront her about it. So long as there isn't any abuse/neglect there is no reason for you guys to take her garbage lying down. As of right now she is defined as living independently which means she is fully capable of doing everything she should be able to do to live on her own. Which means putting your foot down. The downside of putting your foot down is that you have to keep it down or she'll walk all over you. You have to refuse to do these things and then you have to keep refusing. And it will be an uphill battle until she learns that you're not going to cave eventually. There will be confrontation, there will be conflict, this is a fact. You have to stick to your guns and not cave. 
That being said, being confrontational every time you refuse is not the best tactic. When she asks you to get something you can tell her she can do it. If she gets nasty, walk away. Take your dad for some bonding time and go for a stroll around the block. Explain that if she wants something she needs to get it to get her exercise in to lose weight for the diabetes. Explain that if she continues on this path she will end up in a home as she is emotionally abusing both you and your dad to that point. Explain the same will happen if she refuses to manage her own medications she'll end up hospitalized.  Do this every time. Every. Time. And again, keep the foot down. As soon as you or your dad cave, she's learned how far to push you to make you do what she wants. Again, you can leave when she gets nasty. Go for a walk, don't talk to her the rest of the day, etc. You do not have to take the abuse. Because that's what she's doing to you. Taking abuse is not a part of caregiving. I repeat myself: TAKING ABUSE IS NOT A PART OF CAREGIVING. Hold her accountable for her actions. Do not be afraid of confrontation. Take care of you.
This will be a long uphill battle and it will take time. Not just the way she's behaving but any process of getting into a facility or the work that has to be done with a therapist and/or doctor. Have patience, take care of yourself and good luck.",2020-12-19 05:10:01,nachobreeze99,kg5be4
,Rollator Advice Please,"My mom is to the point of needing a mobility aid.  She gets out of breath easily and needs to stop and sit.  Apparently I do not understand rollators.  I thought one held their hands on the handles to make it go and as soon as the handles released it would not roll anymore so if someone was falling it could brace them.  I have since learned those ""handles"" are the brakes and must be held to stop the rolling.  So I just don't really understand. Can an elderly person grab those brakes quickly in order to prevent a fall?  If the person was falling how would the rollator assist them?  Would it be useless going down a slight incline?  Can they get away from the person walking or go too fast I should say?  Any info would be appreciated because they just don't make sense to me.  But I realize I am clearly just not understanding how they work because there are thousands of reviews on Amazon raving about how people love their rollators.","This is absolutely not an answer to your question, but your question brought back a funny memory that makes me smile. 

My grandma passed away in Feb at 93 (thankfully before covid arrived). She was always feisty and funny and wonderful. When she was 91, she had a stroke and recovered wonderfully, but had a four wheeled walker afterwards. She went to rehab and learned how to use it properly and so forth. She lived in her own apartment in a big complex with graduated care. She was out and about often, having coffee and playing cards, going to the Cafe, etc. Apparently, she decided it was more fun to sit on the walker and pull herself with the railings in the hallway, and also kick off the wall and get some speed up. Someone from health care happened across her while she was doing this, and yelled at her that it was NOT safe, so she stopped doing it and went back to ""walking like an old person"".
Many have the brakes that can be set by pushing down, and then the user can brace or sit on the rollator. It provides more support than a cane, but similarly needs the user to have the ability to learn how to use it. I guess the user may have an issue going down a steep hill? My grandma had to learn how to properly brake when going to the bathroom and using it to brace herself, but otherwise didn't have many problems with 'rolling away.'",2020-12-16 18:22:53,Shelly432432,kekqi1

My grandmother-in-law is living with us. Her Parkinson’s has been progressing for years but she only finally got the official diagnosis about a week ago. She started having hallucinations and delusions about 5 months ago. I know that with hallucinations, you should generally go along with them so they don’t get so worked up and upset. I can understand that to some degree with some hallucinations, like if she sees a cat in the hallway we can tell her “ok I’m sorry I’ll get the cat outside” or something. The problem is that her hallucinations are unhealthy and concerning. She is seeing small people in her room, including a man. She says the people are always moving her stuff around, doing bizarre things that are completely illogical and impossible (like a giant eraser that was making squares on her bedspread). She says there’s a man in her room that steals her bed and stares at her and messes with her TV and it makes her very uncomfortable. Her anxiety has skyrocketed and she is getting extremely angry at us because we are allowing people in her room and invading her privacy and she doesn’t deserve to live like this. She is starting to hate us over it (and other things but this is making things much worse). I honestly have no clue what to do. We try to tell her we aren’t letting anybody in the room, we are right outside the hallway and see nobody. The doors are locked and the windows are locked. I’ve tried going in there to “catch them” and everything. But now she says that they are magical or something, or they have mirrors that help them disappear or they can “sense our vibrations” when we are coming and scurry away through the walls are shrink down and hide into holes in her furniture or whatever. I need some suggestions. Please. The neurologist had prescribed Nuplazid but she has only had 2 doses so far. I have no idea how long it takes for it to work but she is getting super agitated. Also, before anyone asks, it isn’t related to lighting or the specific room because she believes we have a babysitter for our newborn even though we don’t allow anybody near him. Thoughts on how to handle this?","I’m going through the exact same situation with my father. He’s delusions are quite dark and worrisome He says there’s men in the closet with a knife, or blood on the floor, amongst many of the ones u mentioned. I’m honestly looking for anything that can be a possible solution.",2020-12-12 22:17:46,Abirdie15,kc35ag

,My grandma is not well,"My dear Oma is now 87 and has gradually been going downhill over the past few year, but has gotten particularly worse over the last few months. Her walking is pretty terrible, and her hearing is effectively all but gone - even one one on conversations with her in a quiet room are now almost futile. I suspect she’s severely depressed, she lost her husband about 15 years ago when I was 5, and since then has lived alone in a retirement village and she doesn’t really make an effort with socialising, so she gets very lonely. This is made worse by her deteriorating hearing, since even when she does have company she can’t really engage in the conversation. I feel so bad for her, she told me today she didn’t want to be here anymore. I feel so helpless, because there’s really not much I can do other than try to visit her and take care of her. It’s also taken a toll on my mum (her daughter) as she’s her primary caretaker and I think it’s made her quite resentful of her since she’s so deaf and impossible to talk to. My parents are now considering moving her into a home, which I think is probably the best thing for her at this point. So I guess I was just wondering if any one here had any advice for my situation, or any treatments or medications that helped something similar? I though cbd oil might be worth looking into, for its pain relief and antidepressant properties..? Idk, I’m just not sure what I can do and it’s hard to see her like this. Thanks so much <3","How about writing her letters?  Maybe you could print out pictures to go with?
is she against wearing hearing aids? or they don't work for her kind of hearing loss? insurances usually don't cover hearing aids but if they motivate her to get back into the world of the living, then any price would be worth it, but then whether the aid is any good or not will be the important thing to look into.

moving her to a home has two possibilities:  
\- she thrives because they have various activities that she might take to, as well as the company of others  
\- she becomes more despondent because she's not interested in any of the above and can't wait to die

u/plotthick's suggestion is good--sometimes seeing visual things like old pictures might bring back fond memories that she may be happy about and having something tangible like a letter for her to hold onto and process might stimulate her mind.

if she can go out, it might be nice to take her out to a garden (if open during covid) or just have a drive around (dunno where you are but in the States, there's a lot of ppl starting to put out christmas lights and the colorful bright lights make my mom happy). you don't need your hearing sense to enjoy these kinds of things (a nice sunset is good too).

all the best.",2020-12-07 21:19:02,,k8vanq
,"Seeking advice: FASD adult, chores","Hi all. Thanks for allowing me into this group. I currently provide care for an adult. When referring to my client, I will use gender-neutral pronouns and changed initials to protect their identity so that I don’t violate HIPAA. 

I am seeking some support. LS is considered high-functioning but is still in need of service because they have a hard time performing daily tasks. As such, they live with family. My client’s family has recently mentioned to me that LS needs help especially with contributing to the cleanliness of the house because they do make a mess. 

My question to the caregivers/support workers is this: what have you found successful in helping your client improve on doing chores? I am new to this and haven’t received in-depth education/training so I welcome all advice. 

Thanks in advance!","There is such a wide range of skill levels, age appropriateness, communication styles, learning styles and family cultures it would be hard to make a suggestion without knowing more.",2020-12-06 18:00:59,Yuwego19,k846bg

,An empowerment seminar?,"The woman I care for is so....Unempowered? Like if I asked her, would you like ice cream, cake, or pickled pigs feet? She would say the pigs feet bc it was mentioned last. If I misheard what she wants for lunch, she won't repeat and just says ""I'm fine."" She can have anything she wants but her room is still decorated like a child's bc she won't speak up to her mom who likes it that way. I wish she or I or both of us had some exercises to get her to start speaking up for her self instead of just going along with everything. One day she'll be in a group house and without these skills she's going to get run the f over.","Is your client autistic? bc those are two things I've seen in autistic people - choosing the thing listed last, and having no sense of agency, that they can influence their environment. The first one is a speech planning issue, and you can help them learn not to just say the last thing by offering, say, a potato chip or some crumpled paper... make a game of it... chip or paper? eventually they might still say paper, but then quickly say no, chip!! and then one day they will pause for a while and then say just chip. That's the ideal anyway. The second thing, the agency, is more tricky. Takes a lot of support. Try the smallest possible steps - like when you know they want something, get them to take some sort of action to get it. Like maybe they're used to you turning on the TV for them but just pretend to be a bit forgetful or distracted until they hand you the remote. Or maybe leave a desired item nearby but pretend not to notice it, maybe they'll ask for it. Baby steps! but you're right, it's super important. Took my son years.

,Options for elderly care situation,"So long story short, my mothers side has a history of Alzheimer's disease and my father, who used to keep his back problem under control with exercise, had to go in for foot surgery and now is in a walker and can't even exercise anymore.  He lost strength in his grip and arms from what I can tell in the process.  It takes them from 6am all the way to 10am to get up in the morning and I do not know how long it takes them to actually go to bed.

The conversation sounds like my dad is worried that going to a living facility will drain all the savings he has from his life as an engineer, but right now they are dependent on myself and my brother to do basic tasks like get the news paper in from the driveway and even house cleaning to an extent.  Got a little roomba running around the house to help with vacuuming but my dad keeps finding new tasks that I never knew had to get done to throw on me.  Neither parent can go into the basement without extreme difficulty and the walkway is way too narrow to put in a lift for that.

My brother and I obviously have to move out at some point here just to keep our work lives moving forward so I'm wondering if anyone has had a similar experience and might have some insight into what worked out.  The only pro I can think of trying to ride this out until they die is that maybe we got money in the house to split three ways between my older brother, myself, and my twin.  But it also landlocks me into a kind of rough location to work from.  probably looking at hour commute both ways so that is going to put a lot of strain on caretaking.","What is his prognosis?  Does he need PT to get better?  What does his doctor say?
The first step is to contact his primary doctor, and also his foot doctor and back doctor if different, and make sure they have all his disabilities and difficulties documented and see what referrals they can give for help, such as home health aides or PT and OT.  Also call his insurance and have a long conversation with someone knowledgeable about assistance they provide - it may take you a few tries to get to right person.  They may be able to provide a case manager, especially if he has Medicare or Medicaid, which would help tremendously because they can coordinate care.  The doctors need to be advised of how his conditions are affecting his quality of life because they are the ones who order care and services and can qualify him for disability if needed.
Have you looked into any home health agencies?
Based on your description, your father needs care in home or at a facility. Yes, costs are a concern but the money he has should be used for his care. You don’t speak to your mother’s current level of function. Does she also need help? 
Explore local not for profit senior agencies that can assist you in determining your parents‘ eligibility for veteran, federal or local benefits. 
You will need to weigh the pros and cons of providing in home care yourself, organizing care through an agency or moving one or both parents to another home or facility where care can be provided. 
I would also suggest consultation with an attorney specializing in elder law to understand and prepare for relevant family decisions.

,Declining a Feeding Tube?,"My Dad just had his second stroke a few days ago and thus far his condition hasn't improved much from when I found him and called the paramedics for him. He's unresponsive, doesn't seem to register anything when his eyes are open, can't talk, can't swallow, has a temporary feeding tube inserted, and can barely move. He maybe sees people when he opens his eyes, but there's just nothing there.

Before this, my Dad had had a stroke about two years ago and I watched as his personality slowly faded away. His days revolved around laying in bed all day, hobbling to the restroom, vaguely watching Netflix, and sometimes eating food that was brought to him. Not much of a life, but something he could vaguely handle himself. What I saw of him after this new stroke, there's just nothing really there and it hasn't sounded like he's really improved since then.

It's still early and I know he can still improve and I know this is going to sound incredibly heartless, I'm crying thinking about it, but assuming his condition doesn't improve, is it legal to tell the medical staff to withhold a feeding tube from him and let him die ""naturally""? He just didn't have a great quality of life before and what I imagine his life after this sure as hell isn't going to be any better. I just know that this isn't the life he would've wanted. He would've wanted the cord pulled if he was on life support, and in my mind this isn't much different from that.

I know these things take time to recover from and there's always still a chance, but it just feels like at this point all the discussions we're having are about prolonging the life of his body. Honestly, my Dad has been gone for awhile now and I don't see him coming back anytime soon. Just seeing him in that state in the emergency room and what I'm hearing from the nurses is a gut punch everytime. I can't imagine him and us going through this for multiple years, just keeping him alive for the sake of feeling like we did everything we could to keep him alive when he's really not living.","OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. Truly a terrible situation to be placed in, and my heart breaks for you. But having said that: this is not the place to seek *legal* advice. You'll want to talk to an actual lawyer about that, not internet strangers, you know? But know that we're here for you if you just want to talk or want to vent!
They’re going to ask if he has a healthcare proxy (a person,probably you) and/or an advance directive or living will sort of document. IANAL but these are questions that come up with routine medical care for my dad.
Talk to the nurses. Ask them if he seems to be a candidate for hospice. They usually know. Or ask the doctor.

Anyone who has used a hospice service knows the Golden value of that. They can guide and assure both you and your father through a hard path.

Remember that your father is likely still hearing everything, so please make all interactions sweet, at least in front of him. Talk to him. Tell him of all the good he has done in his life. Remember silly times.

Hold his hand, even if it's something you've never done. Since he's keeping his eyes closed, tell him, dad, I'm holding your hand now because I love you.
It seems you are thinking logically and with thought to what lies ahead for your father. I had to make this exact choice for my father. The hospital staff was very kind. Best wishes to you. Stay strong.",2020-11-20 17:31:52,No_Good_Decisions,jxz200
,What to do when the person you’re caring is getting worse?,"This is my first time posting on Reddit and I’m doing it from my phone so sorry for any formatting errors. 

I am my mom’s caregiver. She has dementia plus she has problems with mobility. It was easier when my dad was still alive but since he passed away it’s been getting harder and harder. She keeps having hallucinations. It would be easy if they were the type were I can play along and pretend that there real but they’re not. There the type of hallucinations that if they were real then you would call the cops. According to her the neighbors are threatening her and now somehow my dad is not dead to her and is joining in on the threats. 

Unfortunately I have to work to support myself, which makes everything harder. And when I am home, everything I do is wrong in her eyes. And now she has not been letting get much sleep. I’m lucky if I get 5 hours. I’m so exhausted from trying to take care of her and it feeling like it’s not enough. I need help but she’s oppose to me hiring anyone or going in a nursing home. She’s already threaten to cut contact if I put her in a home but I don’t know what else to do. 

She refuses to go to the doctor as well. She had a fall yesterday while I was at work. The good thing was a neighbor I trust got a hold of me and had me talk to one of the paramedics. She refused to go to the hospital so they advised her seeing her doctor. I made her appointment for today and now she’s refusing to go and is planning to cancel as soon as his office opens. I don’t know what to do. Do I force her to go to the doctor? Do I force her into a nursing home so she can get around the clock care? She fights me on everything and no one else in my family helps. I don’t have any siblings to try to get to help, so the of the family sees this as my responsibility. 

Sorry if this seems all over the place but I feel like I have no one to turn to. Any advice would be appreciated","I'm in a similar situation so my advice is: contact legal aid to begin setting up these things: POA bc she clearly, legally qualifies as non compos mentis - then get her on Medicaid and qualified for home health (100% free in-home medical visits and caregiver hours), dementia and anxiety meds such as seroquel, ativan or haldol to help her anxiety and confusion so people can actually help her. A medical social worker could probably help with a lot of this too - call the local council on aging or her doctor/hospital group for referrals to get the balls rolling.
Please see if you can get help with her care.  The doctors should be able to point you in the right way.
You need to get some help in the home or send her to a nursing home-**it will not get easier**.  What does she do when you are at work-she shouldn't be home alone.  My Mom had dementia and COPD-some days it was AWFUL.  Other days not so bad....she needs to go to a doctor and you should be there with her.  My Mom would fight me on most things but fortunately I had a sister who would help when I needed it.  Our caregiver was awesome (we had some crappy ones) and would sit with Mom for hours, bathe her and make lunch for her.  Could not have done it without her.
For a start, don't be apologizing for being human, caregiving is exhausting, you be as all over the place as you need to be.

Do you have power of attorney? (or the equivalent in your country) You cannot do much without this for a start so work on getting it before everything else. There is a good chance that the hallucinations come and go in cycles, my mother is always worse in the winter/spring, they disappear in the summer. Try playing music, preferably from her era. It can help snap them out of a funk. To combat the sleep deprivation I moved my mother into my bedroom, I sleep in a chair right next to her so if she wanders I will wake up. Start getting used to power naps, 10mins here, 20mins there, it will help. Contact your local care team if your country has one. In my country we call the local nurses, they provide us with support in the form of respite, flu shots, medical check ups at home and also will refer to the local fire department to have fire alarms and carbon monoxide alarms to be fitted. We are also very lucky to get free lifeline equipment so if my mother starts a fire or floods the kitchen we have sensors that link to emergency services. I do hope your local area has some form of support you can reach out to. I am just a little past where you are now so if you need any other advice please reach out to me, I know it is tough but once you figure out a routine that works for both you and your mother you get into a rhythm, at least until a change occurs.",2020-11-18 10:34:23,NoAcanthocephala2727,jwhvi7
,Glad to have found this sub,"Hi all. Found myself in a bit of a sour mood this morning and stumbled into this subreddit. Seems like a nice and welcoming place, where we all feel a little less alone. Looking forward to reading and participating.

My background:
I have been with my gf, now fiancee, for the last 7 years. We are both 25. She had a few concussions around 2016, which culminated into a TBI diagnosis and Post Concussive Syndrome. She lost her cashier job as a result and had to drop out of university. We were both intelligent and driven, I have since then received my Bachelor's degree, got a decent job, and we've lived together since 2017 or so. 

Her brain injury symptoms are mostly invisible to the public, but people close to her can tell. She needs consistency, quiet, and multiple naps throughout the day. She also has a myriad of other health problems unrelated to the TBI. Type 1 Diabetes and pretty intense scoliosis/kyphosis being the most common interferences in her every day life. This makes working very hard for her. Jobs that are quiet and consistent generally require more brain function. And jobs that require little brain power generally require manual labor and are noisy. 

We've been going through the SSDI process since 2017, it has been fucking awful as I'm sure you're aware. Especially for a 20 something with an invisible illness. We finally had a court date for this last June, with years of documentation, neurospych evals, multiple doctors statements. And it got postponed indefinitely due to Covid-19. Hopefully that just makes our case better as we will have more documents by then. 

2017-2019 was very hard. I love her very much, even with her fundamentally changed brain. Even with the doctors appointments an hour away, multiple times per week. Even with the tons of medications that eventually started interacting with each other, causing seizures and hospital trips. While I was finishing up my degree and working full time night shifts. 

2020 has actually been amazing for us. She has had much more time to rest. I'm partly working at home so I've been able to help much more with housework and the dog. We've grown a lot closer as a couple and I finally popped the question after months of introspection as a person and a partner. I know she will never fully heal, but 2020 is damn close to a perfect environment for her brain.

I don't really have a point to this post. I just never meet anyone my age in this situation and I know it will be understood here. I've had to come to terms with a lot of things, including not having the typical middle to upper-middle class lifestyle I wanted. To being the sole bread winner in a world with out of control housing and insurance costs. It's been a whole transformation, really. And I'm still scared.

I am in awe at how intense and how long others in this board have had to take care of their loved ones. Looking forward to receiving and giving support here","Thanks for posting and sharing your story. It's so moving to hear about your commitment to your gf, bless you, you are an awesome person for doing this. I'm caring for my dad (early onset dementia) and my brother (schizophrenia). Im not the sole carer, my mum, step mum and sister are around too but even still its a huge toll to take and its had a huge impact on my own health and wellbeing. Some days I feel like I can't cope but things like online forums, groups, facebook groups, support groups etc are really helpful for me.

,Did they miss anything? Came up on my IG feed since I follow #caregivers. Number 2 is especially hard for me,,"I was told, after my father died, that I should treat caring for my mother almost like a business: keep organized, take breaks and vacations when appropriate, communicate with others doing similar work, and delegate where necessary. I love my her very much, but taking this attitude has helped me a lot. I was laid-off from my fulltime employer during this time, so I basically transferred many practices to the new Caregiving job.

Having a set schedule also made it easier on her, so she knows when I will be there - it gets to be a routine. As for #7, I set her up with Wifi and Amazon Echo because she often neglected to answer her phone. I printed out just 4 commands on a large 11x17 board visible from her bed:

 \- Alexa what's on my Calendar

 \- Alexa what time is it

 \- Alexa call \[my name\]

 \- Alexa what's the weather today

Also I set her phone up with Conditional Call Forwarding, so I could quickly respond to important messages. Way over half were scams so I set her phone to ring only when a known number called.

As her condition deteriorated, I got a Lawyer to help with some LTC insurance issues, and also set up Power Of Attorney. Now I could forward her mail to a UPS store near me, access her bank and utility accounts by internet so she doesn't lose water and power because of late payments. Also set up a ""Ring"" device on her front door so I could answer it and screen visitors (surprisingly helpful while she was being evaluated for LTC, so I could keep track of DOS and billing). I found a fax-to-email service (efax, intellicomm) to be immensely helpful as doctors/legal will accept faxed signatures but often reject email communication. 

For #8, it's helpful to have a 2 page PDF file with her relevant medical history, medicine list, and providers' phone#s - not only for my reference but whenever she sees a new provider they always want that information. Much of the remote work I did at a nice Starbucks right near the ocean, so it was full of other people on their laptops, yet not a stressful situation in a dirty house. I think that helped with #9.

Since those days she did move to Assisted Living, and I have rescued many photos from the house and had some digitally restored. She loves nothing more than seeing these old photos of long-lost family, and I'm doing her paperwork while she's staring at a paper printout of a PDF of a scanned photo.

,"Not telling Husband I'm Leaving for ""Vacation""","My husband had a stroke over a year ago. He has really bad memory, so for example he asks what day it is like 10 times a day and goes to check the mail multiple times per day. Also could ask what is for dinner 30 minutes after eating. I quit my job to stay home with him, to make sure he is okay.

Needless to stay, I enjoy getting away, ALONE from time to time. Back in March I took a road trip to Virginia. What I did was literally just leave without telling him. When I was gone I had his number blocked so he wouldn't bother me and I could truly escape.

I'm going for another trip soon and basically I thought about doing the same thing. Just leaving super early am before he wakes up. Blocking his number, and just completely unwinding and relaxing.

He will have family at the house watching him, so that isn't a big deal. I COULD tell him I was leaving, but I likely would have to tell him every single day and he would get mad at me every single day and it would increase his anxiety. His brain cannot comprehend that I need time away from him. He can't understand how much work it is to take care of him.  Him going with me would not give me the ""break"" I need from him. That's also why I block his number, because he wold harass me constantly and ask me when I was getting home (he likely would think I'm at work, even though I quit 100+ days ago), also perhaps trying to guilt me for being gone and making me feel bad. I'd rather just completely free my mind of the stress he causes me and let him be taken care of by his family that is staying at our house. At the end of the day it really shouldn't matter, since an hour after I'm back home he won't even remember I was gone.

What are you thoughts on this? Anyone do anything similar?","I think it’s fantastic! It really is guilt free for you bc of his memory issues. 
Does he ask where you are of the family members who are with him? Or does he have no memory of you?
You said he has family staying at the house. You should inform them.
God I wish I could get away like this.
Do it!!
I had a friend do this, too. Mom was in a local memory care home. Daughter regularly visited every day. When daughter needed a vacation she had her son, the grandson, visit daily. He could not tell grandma mom was on vacation. He told grandma mom was at the dentist, or something similar. Grandma was secure, knowing her daughter was nearby. She could be told the same story daily (or hourly!) but it eased grandmas anxiety doing it this way. White lies are sometimes the best all around.",2020-11-09 13:10:22,jjudk001,jr2sr3

The things I loved so fucking much are gone. We can't hang out because he can't talk. I just miss him. He was my person, the one. Why did this fucking happen? I will never have him back. I can't take it. I'm so sad.","I'm so sorry.  My husband had his ""big"" stroke fifteen years ago, and a little one six years ago.  He went from being a big hearty guy who loved working on our house and yard to a skinny old guy who can't get out of bed or a chair without help.  So I totally get it.

I deal with it by flipping it.  If I were the one that had the stroke, what would he do?  I *know* what he would do: he would put all his energy into helping me recover as much as possible and caring for me as much as necessary.

You are not alone.
My Dad had a stroke about 2 years ago and again just a few days ago. The first stroke slowly killed off his personality, to where he was just an empty shell of who he was before, just this being that only lived for cigarettes and soda. For the past year now he's just been a body I've been caring for that happened to have my Dad's face, but my Dad's been gone for awhile now. Now with the second stroke, there's just nothing there. He doesn't look or respond to anything. He's ""recovering"" at the hospital, but I'm not really sure what his chances are even going back to the minimal ""living"" he was doing before.

He could easily read the instructions, or do ""trial and error"" (which is what I ultimately do for him). 99% of the time, I don't actually know any more than he does (and sometimes less), but he has started calling me  without even bothering to try. I have started refusing to help him if he has not made an effort first himself to find the answer.  I have pointed out that he is equally situated to try the ""trial and error"" approach as I am.   I have complained repeatedly and he just keeps with this behavior as if I never mentioned it.  I am about ready to pull my hair out with annoyance of these stupid questions and mental vacuuousness. What's going on here?","My question to you is: When's the last time he saw his doctor?  Now might be a good time.  All I'm saying is first rule out a physical cause.  There may be a reason other then stubbornness for his constant questions. Good luck, OP.
He could be lonely and want a friend.  This is NOT a way to make a friend, but a lot of old men are clueless in more way than one.
I wonder how well he's managing when you aren't there to see.  This sounds like the beginning of dementia to me.  When my husband started to slip, the first thing that raised alarm bells was ""loss of executive function.""  He could no longer remember the steps to complete simple tasks.  Get your family member evaluated...if you can arrange it.  I think continuing to encourage him to do things on his own is a great idea, but  he really may not be able to think it through.
My 62 year old wife is like this. She's got mild dementia from brain radiation, but it's all I can do to stay patient with her. All of our conversations consist of me explaining things to her.",2020-11-08 10:18:50,NDStarchase,jqdc7e
,Psychically helping my Boyfriend too much is taking a toll on his mental health. What o i do?,"My boyfriend has epilepsy and chronic migraines. But recently it has become worse than ever. He may be had a grand mal seizure once a year before but now he has one every month and mall seizure almost everyday. His migraine also knows no bounds. 

Now he CAN walk but we got him a wheelchair so that its easier for him and also me to do the moving around. E is never not in pain but sometimes if he feels a bit better he would try to walk out of the chair. He is a very very very independent person. And a very physical person.He will crawl around the house if need be. Grab different things for support.But he is seriously in pain. He insists that i simply stand and watch him fall and walk like a baby. He says that thought difficult, just to bring the water bottle alone gives him peace of mind. He gets rather angry if i forcably help. Thats understandable. 

I don't want him to get hurt physically but that peace of mind bit is also important. One day he was having a really bad day but i had important work(WFH). I was struggling,ngl. He probably realised that,the next day he woke up and said thank and sorry to me and started crying uncontrollably. I felt so bad and helpless. What do i do? How do i balance both his sides?","I feel you.  I've been taking care of my husband post-strokes for 7 years, and it's a mental struggle for both of us.  He can walk with a walker, but can't get out of the chair without help.  It kills him to see me bringing in groceries or going to the dump.  If you can, find a therapist --for you, to help you care for yourself.  Your boyfriend's struggle to contend with his new physical reality is so hard on both of you.  Unfortunately it's one of those situations that nobody else can really help with.
There is a lot he's feeling that he won't share. It's a guy thing. Be sure that you are being his girlfriend first, and caregiver second.  He could always hire a caregiver. He can't hire someone to love him.
My husband and I struggled with this too. We fought about it almost everyday for the past 2-3 years. He also has epilepsy, and is fiercely independent. I had to learn to let go and let him struggle, and he had to learn to ask for help. It was really hard, REALLY HARD. We should have went to therapy so we could have got our life back sooner.",2020-11-05 11:07:46,alee_191,joleka
,Social Service Systems,"My dad is difficult to deal with and as he's gotten older, he's gotten more aggressive.   He believes that he is all wise, that he's the closest man to God, and that he was sent here to teach others how to behave.   He resents that I took control of his social security funds, both because it's an affront to his independence and because he says he's a professional investor and I don't know the first thing about money.  My dad and I, we fight often when we see one another.  Partially this is because I resent having to do multiple things for him, and often because I end up in complicated and frustrating situations as a result of being by his side.  I do love him, but Im pretty sure he gave me Covid, and he's also suing me for fraud, again cuz of the social security funds.  Long story short...  I'm wondering what kind of care services are most important for a man of his age (78), who refuses to believe he has any issues with mental health.  What kinds of support have made the most difference in the lives of the ones you love and in your own sanity.   How do you keep your elderly, socially mercurial, loved ones entertained, cared for?  And what boundaries do you set up?  I live in Minnesota.  Our social services are strong, but I still haven't gotten to the place where he has regular care that makes sense, beyond his basic needs.","Are you your Father's Representative Payee for his Social Security funds because if not, and if there is no Power of Attorney or anything then taking his money may be fraud. Has he been diagnosed with any neurological or psychological conditions? I don't know what his health is like, he may need to be evaluated for mental competency. You really need to speak with his Primary Care Physician or whomever is most familiar with your Fathers care. Explain to the Doctor everything you have explained here and the Doctor may order evaluations to see what level of care he would need if you took a more distant role. This could result in (1) You Father may qualify for a Home Health Aid or Personal Care Attendant to tend to him (2) If he is medically stable enough to be in an Assisted Living facility that may be an option and (3) a nursing home if he is ill enough. It all depends on his health and what heath insurance he has, I am assuming Medicare. He would probably need Medicaid to get some of the services I listed. You may also want to consider getting some help for yourself. Taking care of an ill family member can be very draining, believe me I've been there, you may want to consider therapy or counseling for yourself. I hope everything works out for you. Good Luck!
Consult an attorney that specializes in elder law, if you haven't already.  Call a home care agency and talk to them: they've heard it all and can help you navigate the options.  As already advised, talk to his doctor.",2020-11-04 22:19:59,journophile,jobatq
,Dying grandma,"Ill keep this as short as I can- My grandma has severe copd, shes had it for 3 years now. Im 21 years old, I've been living with her for over a year, taking care of her and doing whatever she asks. I love her to death, but shes just so stubborn and I get so mad at her because of how she is (not her illness, but how she treats me), shes quite rude and controlling. I've cried many many many times because of how she treats me. My mother legit just stuck me here and told me I'll have to live with her until she dies or goes into a home, and I dont want to live here until she does, I've already gotten a stress ulcer because of her (and work as well). Mom lives 10 minutes away and hardly ever comes over to see me or her. I'm a cna so I'm, in a way, working for my grandma too, but between work and grandma, I feel like I'm going to explode. I want to move into an apartment with my boyfriend, but I need to get grandma a full time caretaker first. Shes still able to do some things, just needs some supervision. My question is this- should I continue staying here until she passes, or look for a full time caretaker and move out when I find a good one? I dont want to stay until she dies, I need to live my life..","If Grandma is on Medicaid she can possibly get a regular caregiver but if you need full time care you could speak to her Primary Care Physican or the Doctor most familiar with her care and ask the Doctor if your Grandmother may be ready to move on to an Assisted Living facility or a rest home. You may love your Grandma but you shouldn't be burdened with this. No offense but your mom is a true piece of shit for dumping all this on you! You need to move on if that's what you want. You can't spend your days watching the clock waiting for someone to die, you need to put yourself first.
Bail.  This is not your responsibility.  Call an elder services agency and ask about home care.  Home care is available through medicare, not just medicaid.  Start the process, then hand it to your mom.  You are too young for this duty.  I suspect your mom and grandmother have some unsettled issues, but this is not on you.

Does anyone have any reccos for apps or some sort of system that's worked for them and their family? Would be much appreciated..","I'm a big fan of [Google Duo](https://duo.google.com/about/).

,Dealing with a Non-Compliant Parent? At what point is it considered neglect?,"I've been helping with my Dad (64) for the past few years now, as he's grown increasingly isolated and won't do even the most basic things to care for himself. He suffered a minor stroke a few years back (he was still relatively functional even after that), has diabetes, and heart issues. If I didn't stop by his place multiple times a day and bring him food, he'd probably starve to death, despite living in a house with my brother's family and food being plentiful in the house, he just doesn't do anything anymore except stays in his room and sleeps for good parts of the day. Since I started helping out, he's just retreated more and more and does less and less for himself, even basic things that I thought anybody would do, I now have to constantly remind him to do.

Things have started devolving here within the past month though as he's developed some sort of chronic itch all over his body that seems to be getting worse and worse. I've been applying anti-itch cream to the affected areas and was trying to get him to shower, as I started to suspect he wasn't doing even this basic thing anymore. That or it's related to us forcing him to quit smoking around the same time this started getting worse due to nicotine withdrawal. If so, I'm hoping it'll sort itself out eventually. I was able to get him to shower and direct him where to clean for awhile, but now he's refusing to do even this and this itching is just getting worse with each week. 

But it does have me worried at what point does an older parent's condition get referred to some state agency and I get blamed for neglect, even though I'm doing everything I can to try to help him. I can't force him to do basic things like that, but what options do I even have? Do I refer him to some state agency and have them put him in a home where assisted living workers can deal with him? I'm just afraid that his non-compliance will reflect back on me and I get blamed for him more or less acting like a child.","First of all, I'm sorry that you're dealing with that. Taking care of parent in declining health can be extremely difficult on many levels. So I hope you can give yourself some compassion around the situation in general.

I can't speak to the legal implications because I'm not knowledgeable in that area. Are you his legally assigned caregiver? His struggles seem medical/cognitive and you're not to blame for his situation. If you are legally responsible for him, I'd reach out for help now. 

For your and your dad's sake, it may be time to brainstorm how you can get some assistance. My grandfather suffered a series of mini strokes resulting in vascular dementia (basically a progressive dementia caused by strokes). His ability to care for himself went downhill over the course of a few years and eventually he would just sit there unable to do almost anything for himself. Depression and dementia can snowball on each other, as well. His insurance paid for a home health aide, and my family supplemented his care by hiring nurses to stop by once or twice a day. We could barely afford this and eventually had to place him in assisted living. Even if my mother and I had literally moved in to care for him 24 hours a day, it wild have been impossible to keep him safe and meet all his needs. I guess I'm telling you this as a reminder that there are some things you can't deal with on your own. 

Lastly, I'm not a medical doctor but all-over itching can be a symptom of an underlying illness, possibly liver related. I'd take him to a doctor ASAP to get it checked out. Blood work will show if it's something internal. Could also simply be an allergy or something topical. I've never heard of itching being related to nicotine withdrawal though.

Best of luck.

Yeesh, what a state of affairs.  I'd start by sending his doc an email listing your concerns.  Make it clear that you see yourself as being part of a team with the doc towards getting your dad well, and make it VERY clear what basic stuff Dad is refusing to do. 

Dr, 

Since quitting smoking, my dad has begun to ignore his hygiene.  I've tried directing him while showering (because he missed spots) but now he's refusing to shower at all.  He's itchy and he smells.  He also will sleep all day and night, and won't eat unless I bring his food to him and put it in his hands.  I think he's really depressed.  How can we handle this?
Share these concerns with his doctor.  My patient has itchy skin associated with cirrhosis--lotions and baths help, but the doctor also prescribed hydroxyzine, which helps a lot.

He seems depressed.  Can you get a referral to a social worker and sit with him through a  telehealth visit?   

Also it seems a referral to palliative care or hospice might be appropriate.  I found them to be wonderfully caring and knowledgeable about a huge range of caregiving problems.",2020-11-01 18:27:07,ShinyHappyMeeples,jmchg2
,Questions for Grandparents Providing Childcare,"I’m preparing for an interview with a grandmother who provides childcare for her working son and wife regularly.

Ask her how her life would be different if not for the responsibility. (I’m a caregiver grandma)
Don't ask how if affects her, instead ask how she handles it when it affects her or wears on her. You are already assuming it does. Don't put her in a position where she might feel the need to lie about it. You'll get a more informative answer.
I would ask about emergencies.  Depending on the age of the kids, the schedule she works for you there may be times where she could need to be in both places at the same time.

,Recommendation for low bed/railings?,"Hi, full-time caregiver here. My charge (68m) is my father. He's in pretty bad shape! He's currently undergoing physical care/rehab. We were super worried about that in the current climate, but simply couldn't meet his needs at home. I am hoping to get him back, but only after he's healed up - at this point, more physical trauma is the more immediate physical concern.

While I'm waiting for the other sword of damocles to drop, I'm trying to plan into the future.

I was wondering what kind of (fairly low, like the height of a chair) beds might exist that are also weight-resilient (300-350+lbs would be ideal) and comfortable. 

Further great would rails, light railing rather then incomplete railing, more as a guide then a preventative. Low cost for all of this would be great, but I'm prepared to spend more for comfort and safety.

My caregiver resources in the area all suggested amazon over local suppliers. I was loath to go with that, but...

Well, my local medical supply stores and furniture stores have been VERY hard to work with.

Rather then just give up and get something off amazon, at least without a second opinion, I thought I'd ask the other people here. Thanks so much for your time.

Stay hearty, stay hydrated, stay healthy - and thanks for all you do, too.","Is he eligible for Medicare? Medicare just provided a hospital bed for my mom.

,"93M, suggestions please for activities/strategies to keep him positive/optimistic","93M, difficulty w self care (bilateral rotator cuff), weak heart so stairs are almost impossible for him. Hates being dependent on anyone. Purple Heart USMC infantry WW2 Okinawa invasion, everybody loves him, his nurses all dote on him. Cute old guy, super friendly. He had CHF from renal failure but LAsix helped a LOT, he's not swelling anymore. He went in the hospital asking for euthanasia (they refused his request) and now is being sent home w Hospice referral because he is going to refuse all meds, he just wants to go.

However, since the Lasix worked so well, he is feeling so much brighter, wants to see Trump re-elected, and is looking forward to having a house full of children and grand and great grand children.

First question: What strategies work to maintain momentum in a case like this ?

Is it wise to say to to hell with the lockdown and let the kids climb all over him and let him enjoy them? That's what he wants but the family is reluctant, no body wants to be the one who carried the virus to him- but he wants to go anyway

Second question - he misses the grand and great grandkids a LOT.    some of the family are staying distant, even though they know he wants to see them. He doesn't care if he gets sick as long as he can live life while he has it.  What can we say to the family members who are reluctant to visit?

third question: what questions should I be asking/ what issues am I not seeing ? What would you all do in a case like this?","If everybody gets together, can't they end up making it a superspreader event, regardless of the 93M's resistance? (I understand a lot of 90+ get very mild cases, if they get it at all.  The 50-70 range is in most danger, especially if they're obese.)  There were articles about these nonagenarians and centenarians possibly having immunity from a coronavirus in their younger years, something similar enough that it provided lasting immunity.  I don't know if there's been any verification on that.  


Is there some way to let him visit with SOME of his family, a bit at a time?  I totally understand his thinking, and I'm sure it's the right decision for him.  But his children and older grandchildren are in more vulnerable age brackets;  he surely will understand that and not insist they be exposed to each other.  He needs every single one of them.
Dang, that's a tough one. It hurts so much when patients want to discuss end of life on their terms and it isn't even allowed - first up, understand that you being concerned and talking to him about it means a lot, even if not enough.

I'd have a talk with him about the following:

I. politically, he's not looking very likely to see Trump re-elected. He needs to be prepared for that, and you as a caregiver need to be prepared for his reactions. You know your patient best - figure out if he'll be depressed, angry, acceptant, confused - any of a number of things.

II. his immediate family, that's gonna be a tricky one. I really would prefer getting a PROFESSIONAL caregiver's opinion, but I think what InAHundredYears suggested is a good start. Discussing rotating the older family members in is a possibility. However, caveat;

II.a. how will he be effected if one of his healthy grandkids is intubated? I've seen way too many 'resilient' low-risk people facing long-term complications to have any faith in safety, here. If there were two skittles in a bowl of one hundred, and eating one of those two skittles could lead to paralysis, weakened bronchyiae, etc, not for him but for his grandkids - and it was his fault - how would the patient feel?

III. possible solution - I've had great luck encouraging regular calls, e-hangouts, and surprise 'care boxes.' Not just that, but trying to reach out to some of his hold acquaintances, if any are still going, is a great way to surprise and really make his day. Even if it's a one-off 'zoom' meeting where none of the participants are capable of interacting too well without caregiver help, it can make a lot of people very happy.

IV. momentum is gonna be hard at 93, I'm assuming he has a lot of medication in addition to what you've mentioned? It might be worth discussing that with his GP or pharmacists, and seeing if there are things that can be worked on, minimised, or removed.

V. you probably can't convince the family to work with him and that's okay; they and their kids are their top priority. but in line with your third question, you can work this into something for him!  asking his family what they'd like to talk to him about and getting ideas from them can give a lot of topics you might not have discussed with him.

a lot of older patients really just want someone to listen; I've found they say it's family, and they would LOVE for it be family, but bringing up something from their family/friend connections and letting them talk about it can be important.

finally, remember to take a break and not let it weigh on you too much. to care for him for the max, you have to care for yourself, too. hopefully this gives you some help.

edited to add, as an example! my patient and I had a long, long talk about fishing. that's a good example because there's tonnes I know about the subject, so while he trailed off or tried to get his words together, I could help give him a root to use. basically, you want to dig out subjects that you and the patient share you aren't familiar with. this can also help you, maybe patient has an interest in WWI history, and it's an excuse to brush up on that; perhaps he's got a secret love of poetry. look for new connections you can make; feeling like his life has extra meaning will help patient & you, lots.
I know a lot of older people who don’t have tech. And a few who do. If he doesn’t, you could be one to set up family zoom calls or something similar, so he can still see and hear his family members. Encourage family members to send cards and pictures. Encourage him with compliments and let him know that he is still here for a reason and that God is apparently not done with him here yet. He still has a purpose here, until he goes home. 

I definitely do not advise allowing any large family get together, especially if they have to travel in a plane or mass transit to get there. I would maybe allow one at a time if they have been tested negative immediately before the visit, and agree to keep mask on. And no, as much as he wants the children climbing on him, I don’t advise that at all, especially since school started up. 

Are you the wife or one of the children? I ask because you need to be looking out for your own health as well, and making sure you are not in over your head with the job of caregiving. You could probably use a break, so don’t be afraid to consider help from a caregiving agency. Your insurance may even provide it.
Thank you to all who responded, he just took a sharp turn for the worse and hospice has him inpatient now, we expect the end in the next week.

,Food pickiness,"My 79yo mother lives with my DH and I. She contributes towards the grocery and utility bills. She is not able to cook full meals for herself and I do my best to make them for her. Today I'm making turkey soup (it was just Canadian Thanksgiving).

She asks what I'm putting in my soup and I tell her ""the usual things"" but for the starch I'm adding rice (vs. pasta or potatoes). She says, ""You just killed it for me."" I ask why and she says she's never liked rice in soup. This might be true but she does eat rice so it's not like it's an ingredient that she loathes, or can't eat due to allergies, etc. 

I'm also mom/stepmom to adult children and would not have accommodated any of them under these circumstances. They would have been free to choose the dinner I made or hunger LOL. If I do the rice, then she won't eat it and will have only a Glucerna meal replacement (with maybe an ice cream bar) for supper. Knowing this, is it still alright to add the rice and ignore her pickiness?

How do you guys deal with food pickiness?","I make it the way my mother wants it. I’d rather her eat. It can be exhausting, but that’s what I do! :)
Older people sometimes lose their sense of taste, have problems swallowing certain things, and also have a hard time losing their independence. It’s easier to just drink a Boost instead of trying something she’s never eaten that doesn’t sound good to her.  I’m not eating rice in soup, either.  

She’s not trying to be difficult and she’s not a child.  She’s lost her independence and her meal is probably the only thing she looks forward to.  Get out an old cookbook and sit down with her discussing her favorite dishes, what she craves, involve her.
I have the same issue with my husband, only sometimes he will eat what I make him and sometimes he won't, and the dishes and excuses vary.  He always eats breakfast and lunch, so I lean on those--and glucerna (boost for diabetics).  Also, he will always eat a ""snack plate"" with cheese and crackers and fruit, or ham and cheese slices rolled up, so you might try that approach with your mom.  My guy has quit eating vegetables entirely, except for peas and salad with thousand island dressing, but we do what we can.
I do my best to accommodate my clients when it comes to their food choices, even if it isn’t the healthiest stuff, because I would rather have them eat something than nothing. I figure that once a person’s health is going downhill, I should do everything possible that allows them to enjoy life, including eating things they prefer.",2020-10-14 10:56:23,debbie666,jb27iv
,"New here, can I vent?","Hello and thank you for being here. I (F44) moved out of my house with my bf in June, into my Mom's (F68) house about 1.5 hours away. She was diagnosed with a cervical cancer in May and I've been with her since June. I also lived with her for a few months last year because she had a spinal cord injury. I was paying for home health care 3 days a week, mostly to keep her company but covid put a stop to that. I'm an only child.

Her house is cluttered and it bugs me to no end. She likes to have multiples of everything so all her cabinets are full, the counters are full and the table is covered. I worked hard last year to clear all her floors.  Her bedroom was so bad at one point that you couldn't see carpet and I'd slip and slide tryng to get in and out. 

This year, I waited until she finished chemo before I started in on cleaning. I've purchased storage furniture for her room and kitchen. She loves them but hasn't tried to fill anything. I try to sort her stuff and she wants to keep everything (11 bottles of bbq sauce, bins filled of lotions, bags of sodas, etc.)

I'm suffering. Her clutter consumes me and its hard to be fun and happy with her when I'm disgusted with her house. There is a second bedroom but its full so I have to sleep with her (that part is actually sweet because she loves it). I try to go home on the weekend but I worry so much. She has back problems and isn't stable, she now uses a walker (because I made her). Did I mention that she's stubborn and chain smokes? She suffers in pain but won't try any of the creams I but when I do apply them, she feels better. 

She's not old and I believe she could releive her back pain if she would do more that lay in bed and sit all day. Evetything is now a fight. Its horrible and where once we had lots of fun, I fight with her every day.

We still have a surgery and radiation coming up. I have no patience. It's her world and I'm dying every day, but I want to do all I can to help her. I beg her to move back to our hometown where her friends ar but she won't consider it. I feel trapped and I'm alone. She doesn't have serious discussions and lives in the past (childhood trauma). I'm changing in a way that I do not want. So much so I'm thinking of braking off an 8 year relationship because 1) im psychology now and 2)how will I ever be able to leave my Mom? (And 3 covid has put such a strain on us. Im just not available to him and he is lonely.)

Have you seen Beloved? I feel like Setha and she's Beloved. 

TLDR: Living with my Mom who's fighting cancer but she's a hoarder who is taking advantage of her loving doting daughter.","Hi. I've been a caregiver since '09. I won't pretend to understand your situation, and if you want to vent fine. I hear you. Caring for someone is a challenge, and it's draining.

O.K. I'm done with validation. If you want my opinion, read on. 

You are making this much harder on yourself than it needs to be. 

First of all, who's house is it? Did your mother ask you to clean? Yes, it sounds like a disaster in there, and you should deal with it to the extent that your safety is assured, but in the best of all possible worlds you move back out and your mom goes back to what she's been doing. All your hard work goes right in the dumpster. So you're a neat freak. That's you're hang up. Fight the battles that are important to your mother and leave the cosmetic nonsense for when she's feeling better.

Second of all, you're an only child, adult, single in a relationship. You didn't mention children so I'm assuming you don't have any. This is going to sound cold, but you have to decide now how much of your personal Titanic you want to run into that iceberg. Mom is pushing 70. She could last another 15 years (although the lifestyle you describe says she's not going to last longer than that). Do you really want to do this for another 15 years? That means you'll be 60 ish when this is all over if you ""stick it out"". Do the math.

This isn't a happy picture I'm painting here, but in our Health Care Dystopia the calculus is cold and harsh and there are no happy endings. Talk with her doctors. Talk to an elder attorney. Figure out what you are capable of doing, and what you are capable of giving up. Then make your decision.

Well. That got cold real quick. Did the AC come on or something?

I AM NOT A DOCTOR. I AM NOT A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL. I'm giving you my  personal opinion, and I am speaking from some experience. What you're doing is tough, especially if the person you are caring for is ""living in the past."" I wish you luck, just make sure that whatever you decide is right for both your mother AND yourself.
I feel your pain! It is very hard for me to relax or be happy in a cluttered disorganized environment and it sounds like your mom has hoarding tendencies. I think you should try telling her that you love her and are glad you can be there with her, but for such a long stay, you need to have some space of your own there. You might be fine with it now, but sharing a bed when there is a spare room isn’t fair to you. Maybe she’ll agree to “temporarily” move the non-essential stuff in the second bedroom to an attic/basement/storage unit so you can have a comfortable place to hole up in when needed. Given enough time as caregiver, you WILL need it. 

If you are otherwise happy in your relationship, I wouldn’t give it up preemptively. My boyfriend and I are long-distance and I can never go to him because if caregiving responsibilities. We watch movies “together” at the same time, have a two-person book club, cook easy meals on FaceTime etc. Check with her doctor or hospital social worker to see if she qualifies for any home care, physical therapy, etc. You also should look up caregiver resources in your area. Most bigger cities have free social programs like adult rec centers that are basically daycare, or respite volunteers that will send someone for a few hours to give you a break so you can take personal time.
Will your mom negotiate at all?  I would cast my eye at that spare bedroom.  Having one spot for you in the chaos would make life easier for you.

I'm six years into caring for my husband.  He has vascular dementia and mobility issues.  It's gradually wearing me down, but I'm determined to see it through.  He's good natured, so no severe behavioral issues.  The care he gets at home makes his life tolerable, and it's a gift I'm content to give him.  **The care you give your mom can't be bought at any price.**  

They say you don't have to set yourself on fire to keep others warm, but sometimes there's no other fuel available.",2020-10-09 20:23:18,Deedeeblacktiger,j8apmb
,HELP! Caregivers Don't Feel Safe in Client's Home,"  

I am an in-home caregiver in the US (specifically NC), that works the graveyard shift, and I’m looking for speedy advice. Here’s the situation:

Nearly all the caregivers that work in the home have had some negative (and at times frightening experience) with a male neighbor who just moved in next door.

One has reported seeing him peeking through a glass door, and has heard loud footsteps on the ramp leading to the back door. Another has been yelled at by this same neighbor on her way to shift change, but wasn’t able to make out what he said. This same caregiver reported a worrying phone call. She picked up the house’s landline telephone, and heard heavy breathing on the line before the caller hung up. I myself have never seen anything happen, but did hear loud gunfire that seemed to be very close. The most frightening thing to happen so far was the discovery of a window screen that had been partially popped out of the frame, with black scuff marks abound the edge that suggest the use of some sort of pry-bar.

All of these incidents have been reported to the agency, and to the family of the client. Both are in favor of increased safety measures, such as blackout curtains, and security lights, but are resistant to the idea of installing a security system or making a formal complaint to police.

Frankly, we are all scared shitless. We deserve to feel safe in the workplace, and in my opinion, the relatively low pay we receive is not worth the potential danger. We’ve agreed amongst ourselves that something more needs to be done, but aren’t sure what to do. We worry that if we report the issue directly to police, we might face retaliation (we work for a small private agency that has no HR department, and from what I’ve heard, caregivers have been re-assigned, or even terminated, for less).

Some caregivers have considered leaving, as the situation has gotten progressively worse. I don't want to leave my client - I've been with her for four years, and love her like my own grandmother - but I become anxious before work, and as the night goes on, every bump and rattle nearly gives me a panic attack. We have planned to make one more strong appeal to the owner of our agency to intercede with the family, but if this is not successful in producing effective action, what should we do?","First and foremost, I'm so sorry this is happening and that you aren't being heard by your agency or the family. You deserve to feel safe, and there are clear indications of danger here.

Is there a way for you to explain the situation to the police, and ask them just to drive by and check on things every so often for the foreseeable future? They might be ok with not letting the family know, especially if there is no formal complaint. So no chance of retaliation unless you tell your agency or the family that you spoke with police.

I don't understand why they would retaliate, anyway. Why would the family be upset? Don't they also want their family member to be safe?

Edit: are there locks on the doors and windows? If so, for extra protection, there are removable security sirens that you can put on a window or door. Basically, one part sticks to the wall, the other to the door or window frame, and if the invisible ""seal"" is broken (ie the window or door is opened) it lets off a loud siren. You could take them with you when you go so the family never knows, but might give you piece of mind.

Other safety advice: can you ask the police or a friend to escort you to your car after your shift each night? Are you legally allowed to carry anything for self defence (mace, etc.)

Trust your gut. This neighbor seems off, and from what you wrote, if it is escalating to a potential break-in attempt, you are not crazy to be fearful.
Your caregiver agency should be dealing with this with the local police. The agency is at a huge liability risk if this behavior from the neighbor does anything to physically/mentally injure yourself or one of your fellow employee's and the patient as well. If your agency fails to provide you and your coworkers with a safe working environment I would stop going to the patients property until something is done to make the home safe for everyone. If you have a crazy neighbor who keeps trying to break in or is on the patient's property then THEY NEED TO INSTALL CAMERAS! Until they provide video cameras outside of the property the police can't really do anything unless you have him on camera trespassing or they see it first hand. If you have cameras and video proof your caregiver agency should be working with the police/local court to have him charged with trespassing or menacing. If all else fails a restraining order might be necessary. You may also speak with the local police or sheriff's office yourself on behalf of your client about parking an empty patrol car on your patient's property to discourage anyone from trespassing or doing anything improper. The pepper spray is a good thing to carry, idk if tasers/stun guns are legal in your State but that might be something to consider. Also you can get some kind of whistle or really loud panic button that emits a loud ear-piercing alarm, that would probably scare the perv off as well.
I'm so sorry this is happening! I would express once more to the family your discomfort with the situation- but be firm and united as a night shift with one person speaking for the group or in an email. ""These are the events that have happened, we are concerned this person is watching your mom/grandma/aunt etc and us in vulnerable moments to take advantage. We are trying to keep her safe which is why you have us here. I'm telling you you have a peeping Tom. The situation is escalating. You need to call the police or I will."" 

You've tried being nice and they aren't responding. Part of your job as a caretaker is to be their eyes when they aren't around. They need to respect what you're telling them you see. You also 100% deserve to feel safe at work. They can't replace all of you and you're coming from a place of concern not malice. You aren't going to tell the police how to do their job but at least it will be on their radar while your job increases security measures.
you might also get some additional practical advice on r/legaladvice

you're right that you deserve to feel safe in the workplace and i'm thinking the legal subreddit may have some know-how that might help you and your coworkers move forward to getting some help.

be safe and take care...
I would be calling the non-emergency police number, myself. We have one in the UK that puts you through to the local station. Not sure how it works in the US. Good luck!
As an in home caregiver, I have been in a similar situation a few times. The best things you can do, besides calling your agency is to call the local police and make reports every single time it happens, and also call any apartment managers to let them know what’s going on.  Also, advise your caregiving staff to bring their own self protection and keep it on themselves at all times. (Pepper spray, taser, whatever is legal in your area). It also sounds like your client may also be in danger from this neighbor, so you may be able to get them to consider moving if the police and apartment manager can’t get rid of the neighbor. If you really think that your employer is (excuse my French) shitty enough to refuse to protect you caregivers, maybe you need to look for another better agency for employment.",2020-10-05 15:08:04,SpookedCaregiver,j5pocb
,Healthy dinners,"I don't know if this is the right sub for this..

I'm a care provider for a young woman with DS. Her family wants her to eat healthier. She doesn't necessarily eat ""bad"" things, but mostly portion control is the issue. She's also a very picky eater. With my new work schedule, I'm with her 3x a week for the ""dinner shift"" so my question is, do you guys have any suggestions for some healthy dinner meals?

The only veggies she will eat, are the frozen or canned mixed veggies. She likes chicken nuggets but we're trying to stay away from those. She doesn't like fish. Chicken is really the only meat she will eat. She doesn't have any allergies or intolerances.

Any follow up questions, please ask. Thanks in advance.

Edit: she will also eat hamburger/ground turkey meat.","If she likes pasta & broccoli then you could try this.

1lbs of ground turkey / meat of your choice |
1 box of pasta |
1 can of pasta sauce |
Frozen broccoli ~ 2 bags |

In a frying/ sauce pan start with about a Tbs of olive oil. Turn it up to medium heat and throw in a bullion cube, crush it in the oil as it comes up to temp. Brown the ground meat. While the meat is browning, put an appropriate amount of water in a pot add a healthy dash of salt and turn on high heat. Once the meat is browned dump in the can of pasta sauce. Let that simmer between medium and low. At this point you can get a third pot or pan. If there isn’t another then wait for the meat & sauce to simmer for a bit and transfer it to another container. For the broccoli add a bit of olive oil to the pan and a clove or two of sliced garlic. Just barely brown the garlic and add the frozen broccoli. Cover that and let it sit for 10 min or so on medium/low heat, stirring occasionally. When the water starts to boil add the pasta and cook for the minimum recommended time, turn down to medium/ high heat to avoid splashing water. Once the broccoli is cooked, plate immediately. At this point the pasta should be cooked. Drain the pasta and add the sauce mixture. Give it a stir and plate.

Fat is very satiating. So for portioning you could do a half or less of a box of pasta and bump up the portion of meat sauce and veg. This is always a very satisfying meal for me. Hope it helps
So she needs to eat more veg.  What about giving her a range of dipping sauces to try and some veg to dip them into?  How about fruits?  Fresh seasonal fruit (soft ones since she seems to like that), cut up and ready to eat, would be just the ticket.
this might:

a) backfire

b) cause problems

c) work

assuming she's not gonna be able to look in the freezer to check, but there are some veggie burgers that are tasty so she might not be turned off that it's a veggie burger, especially if you just treat it like a regular burger--kind of a ""don't ask, don't tell"" type of deal. i suppose if she found out you were feeding her veggies in this manner, then there might be ramifications, but if you don't specifically say anything, then you might just think you didn't try to fool her; you just didn't say much of anything...

here's a link to one review of veggie burgers; you can probably find more, but on this one, the beyond meat, beyond burger sounds good...

,Looking for ideas on engaging activities,"I've recently become the primary caregiver to my dad (m/70). He is in debilitating pain that restricts his daily activities to browsing facebook, and moving between the couch, the bathroom, and bed.

All his life (until two months ago) he was very active, working as a mechanic and engaging in physically demanding activities where he could use his skills to create things (think home improvement, repairing engines, etc.) He is no longer able to do these things.

What are some activities he might find engaging that he can do from a reclined position on the couch? He's decently tech savvy, but his fine motor skills are not great.

Thank you for any help you can offer!","I introduced my dad to ham radio when he was in his 70's. It also became a new way for us to communicate, and a way for him to meet some really good people.
Hi, I'm an occupational therapist. The first thought that comes to my head is that your dad's going to feel more chronic pain with limited to no movement whatsoever. The motion is the lotion. Movement keeps us able to do our daily activities. No movement will lead to more pain, more weakness, more illness, depression.

I hope you're able to encourage him to do a little movement throughout the day, like going outside for a short walk, or other physical activities he likes to do (i.e. Bocce ball, yoga, lawn darts, any kind of stretches, hiking, cycling, swimming). Maybe now is a good time to try something new.

Is there some sort of less physically intensive home improvement thing he can do around the house? Like organizing the closet or repairing that kitchen drawer that doesn't seem to close right? Finding a home improvement activity that allows your dad to sit will help with pain management and conserve energy. Plus, he's doing what he's good at, which is a confidence boost, and working on improving his fine motor skills.

If he's tech-savvy, is he interested in making the home smarter with devices like Alexa or Ring? You mentioned his fine motor skills are not so great, so setting up voice-activated technology on Facebook or other devices will be helpful when he's trying to use social media or browse the interwebs.

I hope this helps!
Try video games or computer games, it even if he hasn't played them before.  Facebook has games for free he can try.
Your dad sounds like my dad was! Here are a few [ideas](http://blog.waysandwane.com/dementia-activities/) for you that I just posted the other day, including coin sorting.
what about directing / coaching you on how to fix or build something?  He might especially enjoy that because you are his kid
Dictate his life story for a book.
Would he like Words With Friends?  Or, are there some subreddits related to his mechanical background where he could offer advice?
Can't think of anything not already mentioned, but from a health standpoint, make sure he's repositioning or getting up to move around a bit at least every 2 hours. You do NOT want him to develop pressure ulcers. I'd look into those rubber waffle cushions to sit on.

We are in Oregon and just went through a potential evacuation situation with our dementia mom due to encroaching wildfires. Luckily we did not have to evacuate but it got me wondering if any caregivers out there in areas that face natural disasters on a yearly basis have tips for those of us who don't.

[Stumped Town Dementia](https://www.stumpedtowndementia.com/)","Howdy, neighbor!  Down here in CA, not the first time we've lived through Firestorms. 

First, fireproof your house: do the complete landscaping thing as per Cal Fire.  That'll take a few years. 

Then, get your house insured properly against fire.  You'll need jewelrey estimates.  Then take pics of everything electronic or expensive in your house, and email it to your insurance agent as proof of ownership in case you need to replace them (get model numbers). 

Then, all the kits.  They've all got to last 3 days.  First aid, medicines, toiletries, clothing, pet supplies, complete medical records, electronic devices and chargers, financial records.  Get your pet's microchip numbers on their collars and their rabies shots records. 

Put all of this gobbley-de-gook into a box or multiple boxes, and load them into the trunk of the car every night.  Then, when you use the car, remove them so you're not paying to drive them around (and you certainly don't want them stolen).

I’m sorry this happened to your husband. However, I can tell you from first hand experience that it is possible to stay as a couple through a stroke.

My wife had a stroke at 28, after having our first child. We are still married and have 3 other kids over 8 years later.

Our relationship has its problems, but that’s to be expected with every relationship. I’d say our problems are significantly different than they were before.

At least for me, it wound up being important for me to get counseling to deal with her stroke. I had PTSD from it for a while. Getting counseling to fix that and learn to deal with our new normal better was very important for my mental health.
That dude has a bad attitude and feels guilty.  Their relationship will fail if they don't start communicating.
I have seen a lot of marriages made very difficult when one partner needs a caregiver. If it goes on very long without getting outside help and having some relief it soon becomes a situation where the caregiver gets burnout and starts resenting their role.

Anyways, I'm hesitant even talking about this because any frustration or resentment I carry makes me feel incredibly guilty. That guilt makes me feel like it's going to take away my grandmother from me. I love her like nobody else and I see what I do more as a duty and love towards her than work. The last thing I want to hear is that ""it's not your job"" or ""you should be focusing on building your life"". My family situations and circumstance are different to yours. I'm here just looking for support as I vent my feelings.

I'd basically ended up helping my gran out with bathing or helping or put her clothes on. Then I had to do more and more. The older I got, the more I learned about her and essentially the more I could help her. My dad is the only breadwinner ans luckily we've managed to make ends meet. So he works, and I take care of my gran (his mother). He's always needed me to be his helping hand and I've never had a problem with it. Of course, most people support it but I've had a few instances (when I was younger) where people have said that it shouldn't be my job.. which i beg to differ because that's not how I see it.

My dad has done all that he can to ensure I still have my social freedom. I still get to be with friends, have sleepovers and go out now and again. I'm happy and genuinely blessed to have the family I do. I've learned a lot doing what I've done growing up and do feel a sense of pride because it doesn't get any easier. 

What I wanted to talk about was the fact that these days I just feel so frustrated about doing anything. I get angry at my grandmother when I need to take her to the bathroom at night because I have to wake up from sleep. I get angry at her when I bathe her because she's weak and can't do anything. I get angry at her for almost anything. She doesn't deserve it one bit. I don't deserve how much I allow the anger and frustration to eat me up from the inside. I've spoken to a close and empathetic friend of mine. She always let's me know that it's perhaps because I haven't gone out with friend or have done any self-care thing to feel good. But I do and I've realized it makes no difference.. not one bit.

At this point I don't know what to do to help myself so that I don't allow my anger and frustration don't cause me to lash at at someone who I love so much.

I've always been a short-tempered and impatient individual which is not a good thing for a caregiver to be but I've surprisingly made it through a good few years of caregiving without having things get to me too much but somehow it feels like a breaking point for me as of the past couple weeks.

I need advice regarding my feelings and what I can do about all this. Thank you to everyone.","What you are feeling nurses call compassion fatigue or burnout. The best of nurses experience this all the time. It’s the giving of yourself to care for others, but nothing gets “better”. As well, the needs of others only grow and require more of you to give. Nurses, can walk away or change jobs, but family caregivers do not have this option. I hear you being grateful for what you are learning and your supportive family, which is wonderful. I also hear your grandmother’s health is changing. It’s disrupting your sleep. It’s requiring more of you to give at a time you need to process all of these emotions. It’s also emotionally hard to process a loved one becoming more frail. Being a nurse, I experienced burnout in the ICU. I saw the same problems, the same people at times and started to mentally blame my patients for their situation. I knew that was wrong so left the bedside to help families in my community with older adults by coordinating care, resources, and help them communicate with their medical team. I do not know your country, insurance, age or conditions of your grandma, but changes happening could be discussed with a primary care provider. Can you reduce water intake 4 hours before bed to see if can get less disruption overnight. Is there a medication causing her to go at night that you can change the timing? As for the decreased strength, is this something where you can get an order for physical therapy or occupational therapy to help give your grandma strength? 

And, while you take great pride in caring for her and feel grateful for being allowed to be social, you may need a bigger break to just recharge. There are adult day care programs that can provide this break or maybe a family member can take over care for a long weekend and let you just be away for a bit. You give a lot but you are experiencing burnout and if you do not recharge and fill back up your pitcher, you’ll have nothing to pour into the cup of taking care of your grandmother. Seek inspiration and be creative in how to better solve the things requiring more care and assistance from you! Keep processing all of this as normal and do not let the guilt consume you into a deeper hole. You knew enough to reach out here and ask for help and that shows how incredible of a caregiver you are already.
Wow, caregiver burnout at 21.  That's the earliest I've ever heard of it.  I experienced adult situations well before I was ""adult"" enough to process them too, and let me tell you: you will be praised, and *different* from everyone else, and feel things differently, all your life.  And you'll be better off for it.  Your maturity will help you see things more clearly and understand what's coming more easily.  You might even have very little patience for people who do dumb things and then are shocked when they get bad results... but you'll have compassion for them. 

So yeah.  This will be a good thing for you, in the long run, but only if you take care of yourself now.  Reach out to local places and things, like your area Agency on Aging and your grandma's doctor.  Tell them you need more support to take care of her, that you're 21 with 4+ years under your belt and she now needs more care than just you can provide.  If they tell you they can't help, ask them where to call next and then call that organization.  You're doing amazing work and it should build you up, not break you down.  You deserve at least that.
I'm 21 and will be getting a place with my grandmother soon.  I have a feeling I will begin to experience the same thing as you someday, as I am helping only part time atm, so my only advice is reach out to your dad and tell him you are feeling burnt out and need a few days of good sleep and recharge time.  See if there are any caregiver support groups in your area and try to meet with them too. If you can do an adult daycare, or if your dad has FMLA (US) then maybe he can take a few days off to care for her so you can get the rest you need.  

You'll be okay.  Eventually these feelings will pass but you definitely should get a break asap.
I look at it as you are not irritated or annoyed with what your Grandmother is doing (or not doing) but your are annoyed or mad at the illness(es) or even just the natural process of aging that may be causing the problematic and sometimes frustrating behaviors or actions. You should talk to your father about getting some extra help so you can have some more  time to yourself and it might lighten the load on your shoulders. If she is on Medicaid (not Medicare) then she may qualify to have someone come into the home like a Home Health Aid or a Personal Care Assistant and they will be paid for by Medicaid. They usually do an evaluation to  see how your Grandmother is functioning, what she need's help with and how many hours a day she needs help. Programs like these are usually run by local charities or services especially if it is for Seniors. They usually have some sort of local Elder Services or Council on Aging (the names vary as do the services offered) who can help get you some more support like respite care or help at home to make your life a little easier. If they can get her on Medicaid that would really open up the amount of resources out there that can help you take care of your Grandmother. Some states allow a family member like you be a paid caregiver paid by the State to take care of your Grandmother. This doesn't lighten your load but you would at least be paid for helping take care of her and you can usually have more than one PCA for scheduling reasons so there would be someone there helping her out when you are not ""on the clock"" so to speak.
Yeah it does sound a lot like compassion fatigue. There are basically two types of stress. Good stress and bad stress. Good stress is things that sort of motivate you to be better such as stressing about your final and buying your first house. That kind of stress is okay for you because it has a definite end in sight. You won’t be stressed after your final, you won’t be stressed one you close the deal on your house. But bad stress is the kind of stress where there isn’t an end in sight. You don’t know how you’ll make ends meet this month or next, your car broke down and you have no clue how you’re gonna fix it. It’s very very important to relax and help yourself. People go overboard on the “self care” for EVERYTHING. Don’t go and spend hundreds of dollars on soap because you saw it on a blog but do actual self care. Take a walk if it’s what makes you happy. Cook a nice dinner if that’s what you enjoy. Do something that makes you content and makes you happy to relieve yourself. Because if you don’t help yourself with the burnout it will only get worse and you can spiral. Maybe take a week off from helping your mom, there are companies that do short term at home health. “You can’t help others if you’re not helping yourself”
Contact your local government for senior services. There's a lot of benefits. Also contact a local elder care attorney. I can't stress how important an attorney is.
I completely understand what you're feeling. I see a lot of people gave good advice, I've heard as well that meditation is a good way to calm down or relieve stress.  But I just want you to know that your feelings are valid and you are doing a lot of hard work despite what anyone's opinions are. I found myself to be a full time student while taking care of my mother at home. I was able to apply to my county's in home support services job under the government so I will start getting paid to take care of my mother, maybe you can look into your county and see if there's something similar available. Hope you have a nice day",2020-09-12 04:39:25,PepsiColaPussy7860,ir90yw
,Struggling,I’ve been a caregiver for almost 3 years now. When I first met ... let’s call him “John Doe “ he was in poor health. He’d been abandoned by his step daughter here in Arkansas after his wife passed away. They exhausted his funds and kicked a 69yr old Veteran to the curb. I stepped into this position by chance although I’ve always been a caregiver at heart. In the beginning it was fun. John D was very mobile and I basically just accompanied him to make sure all went well. Now I find myself lost in his world. I’ve separated myself from everyone. His condition is dwindling by the day. It’s very sad to see it happen but I’m glad I can be here for him. At the same time I feel selfish because I know he’ll be leaving soon and I have no idea where I’ll be because I’ve been too worried about him to care about myself. I’m only 41. Looking for advice for anyone who cares to read this,"That sounds so tough. I’m sure you have, but have you looked into hospice care or palliative care? It might be able to help both of you.
Hugs to you! It sounds as though you have been a dream caregiver, at your own expense.

Not all clients are like this and, hopefully, you can land a less intensive case in the next go-round. 

The good news is that as a caregiver, you can go anywhere and make decent money. 

Maybe a change of scenery is in order? Take care of you and enjoy life!
As a person's health declines their quality of life usually takes a big hit. I never thought I would be in a caregiver role for as long as I have. It's a weird role because one day I wouldn't have to help the person do too much and then there are other days where I have to literally hand feed the person because of tremors or help with glucose checks because they don't/can't do it themselves. It's an odd role and a at times a challenging one but you just have to keep moving on and just take it a day at a time. Try to give him as much independence as possible, that may help with depression. Unfortunately the only silver lining is this man now has someone to take care of him properly without having to be in a facility. Is he on Medicaid? Can you get paid by his health insurance to be his caregiver? You should start planning for the inevitable future because this has one of two outcomes: (1) He dies, you'll be miserable and left without money or a place to live (I am assuming based on your post) or (2) You get some help through different Elder Services organizations to take some of the burden off your shoulders so you can enjoy what time he has left and it will allow you to start planning for the next phase in your life.

You sound like a great person and I don't even know this man but I am happy that he has someone like you taking care of him. Many people end up with shitty caregivers, usually people who feel underpaid or underappreciated or people that don't have the requisite experience to take care of a particular patient. I think if you brought in some resources it could be of help to both of you. I know it's hard but just take it one day at a time and just look towards the future- his and yours.
He doesn’t want hospice. Everything you said is spot on. It makes me feel better to know I’m not alone or at least I’m understood by someone. I’m pretty sure my family thinks I don’t work hard but this is the toughest position I’ve ever filled. Plus it gave me a lot to think about. Thanks very much for your insight!",2020-09-10 16:23:20,Readytolearn870,iqbhkf
,I'm so precious. So so precious. And so so sick of hearing it,"Background: My uncle died earlier this year and he was my grandma's sole caretaker. We have a small/aging family so I'm the only one able to take over, and she can't come to CA for a bunch of reasons. I moved from Los Angeles to a very rural area in TN, into a dilapidated, infested, hoarded house on ten acres of swampy overgrown wilderness. I really can't exaggerate how awful this house was/is; there is a hidden obstacle to everything. Pipes leak, appliances are broken, parts of the floor are mushy, and everything is just kind of rotting. There was nowhere clean or comfortable to sit, let alone sleep. The refrigerator was full of bugs and sloshy gloop. Her mattress was moldy. Rat shit everywhere. I was out here for two full months just cleaning and hauling stuff to the dump before actually moving here, and it's still just barely habitable. I can upload pics, but if you've seen Hoarders, you have an idea. 

Amazingly, these are not the things making me question my decision to come out here. I can accept not being comfortable for a while. It's a frustrating place to live, but I can make it better. It's getting better. No, the thing that really terrifies me about living here is my grandma. I was so focused on the vast amount of physical labor ahead that I completely underestimated the emotional work my grandma demands. 

I can prepare meals, dispense meds, give her a shower and put cream on her butt. I can take her to the doctor, feed her pets, do her laundry and adjust her pillows. But her talking, the incessant talking, is draining my patience at a truly alarming rate. She literally never stops talking. Ever. On the toilet, in bed, doing her puzzles, watching TV... it's the same thing every day. She has maybe 6 or 7 things she talks about, and one of them is me. She can barely remember my name, doesn't know what I do for a living,  is totally oblivious to even the most basic facts about my life. But I am PRECIOUS. Oh, am I PRECIOUS. She loves me SO much, so MUCH honey. Oh Grandma is SOO lucky, so LUCKY. LOVE you, darlin, you precious little booger you! Did you know I'm SO blessed? What did I DO to DESERVE you?? God was SO good to me, he gave me SUCH a PRECIOUS granddaughter, oh HONEY. 

No matter how small a task - find the remote? Bring her dentures? Peel a banana? Oh I LOVE YOUUU HONEY, SO PRECIOUS - and it starts again. You'd think I was fucking Florence Nightingale for adjusting the fan speed. 

I know it's totally ridiculous that this of all things is what's getting to me, but... oh my god. Oh my god. Please, make it stop

EDIT  Just realized, she talks to me the same way she talks to her dog. Almost verbatim","Is there something specific she was known for? Her sewing, gardens, cooking, baking, dancing, etc? Anything? My gram was known for baking bread. She developed a pretty nasty case of dementia. She’d build to a rage, the care giver would ask her what did i do wrong, my bread was xyz . . . Didn’t matter what they said, just something about their bread. Boom, temper gone and she’d very carefully walk through did you do this? Was the dough like this when you did that? 

Maybe with a little trial and error you can find a way to redirect the conversation and if you’re really lucky, maybe learn a few things about her and the family while you’re at it.

Good luck.
My grandpa is a non-stop story teller, and the stories he's retained are repeated, boring(focusing on engineer minutiae, etc) or meandering. Half my caretaking job is now just being a listener, so I've become adept at listening with one ear, responding, and hiding my phone for casual scrolling. It's a special skill I didn't know I'd have to master, lol. Best of luck!
Get noise blocking headphones and listen to podcasts.
She's probably going to get worse as she ages. It might be best to put her in a care facility and visit regularly. Trust me when I say that this will wear you the f out in no time. Save yourself, you said she hardly knows who you are. It's not worth giving up your life when a professional can do what they are trained to do. From an exhausted caregiver.
Edited to correct grammar.
You are doing a good thing and sometimes doing what's right is annoying. Life is short and truly is precious. I wish you and your grandpa the best.",2020-09-09 21:14:58,bromanski,iptheo
,Caregivers with Mental illness,"Does anyone else have mental illness and are currently caring for others? Starting to feel like I can’t come up and get enough air, if that makes sense.","Same here. Really hard to take care of a loved one and yourself. It's exhausting and making my mental health worse, but I will never regret being a caregiver. 

I wish I had advice on how to manage it all but I'm not doing so great myself. Wishing you the best of luck and sending you strength, you're certainly not alone.
Yes, and I'm not in great shape. I've spent the past couple days obsessing over suicide. I'm not cut out for this.
Yup. Depression and ADHD makes it difficult to do the things I need to do. Anxiety drives me in circles and insomnia means it's impossible to get me and Dad on a schedule. He has insomnia too, so he kinda gets it.
My Mother's Primary Care Physician told me seven years ago that I should put my Mother into Assisted Living. She was 45 at the time so there was no way I was going to let that happen. I've been taking care of my Mother to some degree for the last 20 years, ever since my early teens. I was a caretaker before I had the mental illness. I've got Bipolar I, Social Anxiety Disorder w/Panic Disorder, ADD, addiction issues and agoraphobia. I didn't start getting mentally unwell until around age 19 or 20 when the Bipolar went into hyper-drive. There were times over the years when I was a less than perfect caregiver and those were usually times where I was unwell. It can be very overwhelming and difficult especially when the person your taking care of is a family member. It also makes it a bit easier because you love the person you are taking care of whereas a random PCA/HHA wouldn't do as good a job as myself because their only incentive is the $17 an hour Medicaid pays. The responsibility of taking care of someone with several serious medical conditions has been hard and when it get's difficult I sometimes neglect my own mental health but having this caregiver role actually encourages me to take better care of my physical and mental health since I know she depends on me. I'm the only one around who can take care of her and she is NOT going into any kind of facility as long as I am able to provide her care at home. Being her caregiver has also brought us together more as Mother and Son because we share a lot of moments that other people like my Sister or Uncle don't get to experience. It can be very overwhelming and sometimes you have to take a step back and remove yourself from the situation for a few minutes until you have calmed down. I never prepared or thought I would end up in this role but it's a role I've kind of grown into as I got older and she got sicker.
I think every family caregiver struggles trying to meet their own needs, but we mostly manage to keep on.  People will say that you don't need to set yourself on fire to keep others warm, but sometimes there's no other fuel.
Yup, it is the most difficult thing I have ever faced. I haven't had a day off in 5 years. Every few months or so I completely lose the plot, sleep for 48 hours and reset. Ad infinitum.

Can I just say as much as it may be viewed as heroic or selfless, I do not want this role. I am grateful that my family member will make a full recovery however, in the future I understand that this is not a role I want to take on indefinitely. I think we need to normalize that for others. Caregiving is NOT for everyone and it is OKAY if it’s not for you. My heart goes out to everyone who is a FT permanent caregiver, may you find time to fill your cup and find some joy somewhere that honours your needs.
Bipolar and ADHD and full time caregiver to my mom who’s on hospice for cancer. I don’t have the energy or focus to take as good care of her as I feel I should, and I feel constant guilt because of it. I’m forgetful, tired, and get irritable. It’s a real struggle, and I always feel like she deserves better care than I can give her.
I suffer from anxiety and chronic depression, and was also forced to care for my parents when they were ill. I didn’t choose to, but there was no other choice. I often felt trapped and suffocated, and would tell my dr that I didn’t know how I was going to help them when I couldn’t even help myself. But I did it. Not always gracefully, never perfectly, but I did my best and I got through it. I’m still caring for my mom after my dad’s passing, and it’s still hard at times. But I’ve learned so much, not only about my capacity for love, but about my immense reserve of strength. I didn’t even know it was there. I know it doesn’t feel like you have it in you now, but you do. Take it one day at a time, and ask for help if you can. My well wishes go with you! If you need any advice or want to chat, I’m here. Big hugs ❤️
I have severe anxiety that comes and goes. It started after I gave birth 5 years ago. I live with and care for my disabled grandpa full time. It’s really hard to explain to him when I’m struggling because he’s so old school(?) about mental health. He thinks I should pick myself up by my boot straps and just be happy. If only it were that easy lol. I micro dose with THC gummies as needed and it really helps. It’s legal here and I won’t drive if I’ve taken any in the day. My grandpa even takes THC chocolate at night to help him sleep without pain.",2020-09-06 02:11:10,stardustnmagick,inh1p0
,Need Help With Father Please,"Hello caregivers, my husband and I can use all the help we can get. My dad has been living with us since we were married, 5 years ago. Before that, he was on his own and his quality of life was deteriorating drastically. Since he's been with us, he's become mostly immobile. He *can* walk but it's extremely slowly, with crutches (he refuses to use a walker or a wheelchair), and he gets winded very easily. 

You have to understand, as I'm sure some of you have dealt with, this is an extremely ornery, stubborn man. And when he needs help with something, he lashes out. He's normally extremely nice and passive, but the more help he needs, the more he lashes out. We need some things to help him be more independent.

In the last few days, he has fallen twice. He recently had a kidney surgery, and post surgery he wasn't feeling very well. He wouldn't call the doctor or let me call the doctor, instead insisting it was just a stomach bug. He stood up to go to the bathroom and fell over. No injuries, but he did knock over quite a bit of things. He is overweight and has absolutely no use of his legs, so my husband and I were trying to lift him and it was basically dead weight. We ended up having to call the paramedics. They checked him out, checked for signs of stroke, things like that, got him back up into his chair.

This morning, we awoke to banging from his room downstairs and went down to find he had slid out of his bed and onto the floor. We tried again to lift him, but ended up again needing to call the paramedics.

Here is what we do have: a semi-hospital type bed. The head and feet adjust, but the bed does not move up and down, nor does it have rails on the side. A reclining chair that also lifts so he can stand easily. A walk in shower, with a stand up pole in the shower for him to hold onto while he showers. 

We try to give him as much privacy as possible, so we bought a house with a downstairs room and his own bathroom. His room has a mini-fridge, toaster, and microwave so he can snack or make himself small meals. I'm afraid his room isn't accessible enough, and to make matters worse, my husband is having surgery soon and if my dad falls while he is in recovery, there's absolutely nothing we can do about it. I need to get my dad some items to try and prevent falls and help him be more independent soon, in the next few days. 

Also, he staunchly refuses to shower regularly or change his clothes, so he smells all the time. I'm working on getting him in physical therapy to regain some of ability to walk and move around, though according to him, his legs are just stiff so he doesn't need therapy. I'm sort of at a loss here. He won't help himself, so we're left with just reacting to him when things do happen, but when something bad does happen, we can't help him very well. Does anyone have any suggestions for equipment I can buy or ways to trick him into going to physical therapy? Thank you!","That's a really tough spot.  When the person you care for is that uncooperative there's no way to make everybody happy.  I would contact a home care agency for advice from an experienced case manager.  The elder law attorney is also a great suggestion.  It's really good of you to care for your dad like this, but at some point his orneriness and his bad decisions are going to catch up to him.  Don't forget to take care of yourselves as well.
Contact your local government, there's probably senior services available. Contact a local elder care attorney, especially if he has assets.
If you’re in the U.S., call his doctor and see if they can order home health for him. As long as he needs some type of skilled nursing care (PT counts as skilled) then he should qualify for a bath aide as well. They can send in OT (occupational therapy) also, who will ask questions and look at his living area and make suggestions of what could be improved to help his mobility/health/etc.
Ask his doc to order a better hospital bed. The doc will need to detail why his condition requires bars, moving up and down, etc. Medicare should pay.

Does your dad have an easy to use cell phone he can carry on him and maybe just speak your name, others names to make calls?

Maybe the doc would order a wheel chair too, he should and you can sit it around and he will probably use it eventually. Maybe you could sit in it occasionally like its a spare chair so he sees others using it.

Does your dad have a tablet or computer to use?

Maybe put a baby monitor in his room so you can hear him if he needs something and maybe a hotel type bell he can ding if he needs he help that you can hear on the monitor


Maybe make sure any wheelchair is skinny enough to get through doors.

Maybe horizontal bars along the walls like they have in nursing home halls.

Maybe some wet wipes and spray body wash that doesnt need rinsed when showering seems too hard

Maybe some no rinse shampoo too.

Maybe leave some premade food in the fridge that is easy for him to access and eat.",2020-09-04 08:44:54,Sc1F1Sup3rM0m,imf9hs
,"""Short""-term caregiver for an extended illness","Hi, all! I hope I'm not encroaching here, as it looks like a lot of you are facing much longer-term situations, but the truth is I don't actually know how ""short"" term our situation is—going on four months with as many steps back as forward, and I'm starting to feel lost and desperate.

My partner is suffering from ""post-covid syndrome"" and went from spending 12 hours a week in the gym to being unable to walk to the kitchen without getting winded and dizzy. He initially got sick in mid-April, and has been housebound since, with the exception of three covid-related hospital visits.

As of July, he was cleared to exit quarantine, but all he can manage is to come along while I walk the dog (after dark, if it's cooled off below 75°f) for about a half block, using his cane. That's a bit of a deviation from the 8-minute mile he was running last year this time, so he's understandably upset and frustrated. This is even aside from half of his family being Covid-deniers despite him be very open about his struggle with the long-term, non-death effects of the disease.

There's nothing I can do to actually help him other than fetch things, and meanwhile I'm doing all of the cooking, cleaning, shopping (on foot; we live in the city but transit is expensive), walking the dog 3-5/day, plus job hunting while I work part-time because my hours are about to drop again in October. We used to share chores pretty evenly, so my workload has doubled on top of now taking care of him.

We both started out with mental health issues and dietary restrictions, and this situation has done neither of us favors. I'm no stranger to exhaustion, but the mental strain lately has me losing time at home and making dumb mistakes at work. My boss is mercifully understanding, but understanding only goes so far.

I'm not sure if anyone has any advice, but I'd welcome hearing it if you have it. How do I transition my mindset from ""this is a temporary setback"" to ""how do we rebuild our lives around this limitation""? Because I don't think its going away soon and we're both early 30s—there's a lot of life left in us still. I'm hopeful of course, but not actually very optimistic.","""Someone else has it worse."" Although true, is a sentiment that needs to go out the window as a caretaker. It's guilt relativism at its finest, not all experiences are equivalent and some have it tougher than others but can handle it better or worse. If you go down that road there's no end to that spiral. Being a caretaker, can be rewarding don't get me wrong, but it can also be a mountain of suck. Burnout is a real thing, and it sounds like you're heading there pretty quick. Some short-cuts? Paper plates forks and knives, saving on that clean up time seems inconsequential but when you get home from work and a mountain of dishes is waiting for you it makes that ""second shift"" all the harder. Laundry everyday if possible; instead of waiting for a pile, put it in the washer before you leave and turn it over when you get home. I understand your significant other is recovering, but small chores they can help out with? Folding the laundry, wiping down the table, making the bed, etc. Not all at once, maybe one chore a day on a rotating basis. Not only does it help out, but it gives that feeling of accomplishment. See if your partner can help financially, as in extreme couponing, apps that save and earn money, or taking surveys to earn money. Sounds like nonsense but if you're paycheck to paycheck even a few bucks sometimes can brighten your day.  On the heavier duty end of things:  Adjusting your pace and your expectations. This is less of a marathon and more traveling the world on foot only. High expectations or comparing your partner to how they used to be will only increase your frustrations. You said you've acknowledged it might not be as short term as you think. I would really sit yourself down and think about what would happen if it were indefinite. Your situation may not be, but it also can be. It's ok to be mad. Its ok to be frustrated. Its also ok to admit this isn't something you want to do. Not everyone wants to be a caretaker, not all caretakers can do it forever. There's no shame in realizing you can't do it anymore, everyone's breaking point is different. And as I've seen other posters, take time for you. Specifically a day or two off. Familiarity breeds contempt and absence makes the heart grow fonder. Take time off from being their caretaker. Maybe go so far as to stay at a family or friends place for a night or two every week. If they physically need someone on premises, ask friends and family to chip in. There are precautions they can take if there are any willing to help. You mentioned your partner has health insurance, what about an official caretaker? I would also keep in check fantasies of getting away from ""this"", vacation or thoughts of the balcony you want. Though a nice escape, if you dwell on it too much that resentment you have will fester unconsciously. Last but not least, and probably the hardest: personal responsibility. No one dragged you kicking and screaming into this situation. You chose to be their caretaker. Would everyone think you're garbage for stepping down? Probably. But how many would step up in your absence? Point is you chose to do this and no one is putting a gun to your head forcing you to keep doing this. Like I said, this one's the hardest one.
I know this response may not be what you want it to be, but I hope it helps irregardless.
The only advice I have is make sure you’re setting aside time for yourself everyday. Something as simple as a cup of coffee on the stoop where you have no demands on you can really help your mental health. I hope that things get smoother soon. It’s hard accepting that it might not be as short term as you originally thought. It’s hard watching someone you love lose their independence. It may feel selfish to admit you’re pissed it’s all fallen on you. After all you aren’t the one who’s sick but it’s important to recognize that your life has changed too and because of that you’re missing out too. If you don’t acknowledge it it will turn into resentment and possibly effect your relationship long term. Im here if you ever need to vent to someone who understands.
Once you both really accept your situation you will find it easier.  All we really have is today--one day at a time works for other challenges beside alcoholism.  It sounds like your partner's recovery will take a while--look for incremental victories.  Any small improvement is still an improvement, and you are young enough that your body can heal.  Have you considered having a house cleaner come in once a week?  That would give you a little break.  If you can afford it, get more meals delivered so you have less cleanup after meals.  Give yourself little treats.  Take the big cookie sometimes.  Any way you can keep your outlook positive is worth doing.  Meditation. Your favorite music.  Watch some Bob Ross. Remember that you are both stronger than you feel right now.  

 Rooting for you from my own, definitely long term caregiving gig.
What helped me a lot was lowering my standards and expectations.  Your house is not going to be as clean as it was all the time, you won't get everything accomplished, and sometimes it's a victory if you get through the day without throttling each other.  I got us both, ( my husband and I), bathed today.  Victory!  We both got fed, bathed, and I'm calling it a day.  Community binge on Netflix is the only other thing that's happening and I'm fine with that.  We do spend a lot of time fetching and picking up and feeding and taking care of pets and...on and on, the little things that are there every time you turn around.
The most important thing is to be kind to each other.  Take a breath if you need and remember you are doing the most important thing - you are taking care of him and helping him get better (even if ever so slowly), everything else is secondary.",2020-09-03 09:55:32,Timely_Cheesecake_40,iltuci
,I don't matter anymore,"My husband had a massive stroke last November. Ever since then I exist only for other people. I can't get sick. I can't go out. I can't take a mental health day (I'm severely depressed). But it doesn't matter.  I am just a servant now. And now school started and we've chosen to keep the kids doing distance learning, so that's just another thing for me to do. 

Everyone is looking to me to get him better. I'm not a physical therapist, occupational therapist, or a speech therapist. Idk what they're expecting me to do. I'm one fucking person and I'm spread too thin. I have no help. Idk even know what to ask for help with even if I did. 

I can't do this but I have no choice.","First off, take a deep breath.  Second, let me welcome you to the world of family caregiving where we never make the right decision, fast enough, and didn't ask before we made it, even though when we NEEDED them to be around to ask, they were nowhere to be found. We ALL live it, we all hate it, we're ALL depressed, ate UP with anxiety and fear, and there ain't a goddamned thing that can be done for us. Because nobody wanted the job we have in the FIRST place.
I'm sorry for your situation. I have no wisdom to impart, just my experience. I was my wife's caregiver for 10 years, 5 years bed bound. I spent most of my time in bed with her, eating, watching Netflix, and over the years I lost 60 lbs. I used to be muscular, but I've lost muscle mass in my arms and legs. 

I too was tied to the house, room, bed. Once I set up her laptop in the bed, called her from my cell, and ran to the store. When she didn't answer, I raced home to find she went to sleep. I was in complete response mode and couldn't make any plans at all. Innumerable cancellations the day of. When the power went out and the oxygen concentrator stopped, I scrambled to get the oxygen tanks hooked up, fast. Meds every 3 hours around the clock for 4 years. My doc said he didn't know how I was still standing with no REM sleep for years. 

You may already have tried this, but can you get help from a ""Choices for Care"" type program? If he's nursing home eligible, you may get the help. They were here 20 hours a week. It gave me time to crash in the spare room. I'm almost 2 years in, and I don't regret going through that hell just to be with my life partner as much as I could.

PM any time. Best to you. You're not alone (as much as that helps).
If you need to talk to someone I've been doing this for 17 years. I'm on my third and last family member. Send me a message and I'll reply. Just remember you are IMPORTANT, SPECIAL, and INDESPENSEABLE.
Now. What I do is this. I try the best I can to prioritize. And I DO try and get a little time in for me. It's never very much, most times a few hours in an afternoon, but it helps. Depending on your husbands diagnosis, therapy may or may not be able to help. I always always try and do the very best I can and let the rest go. And nobody notices unless we fuck up. Which we will. Because we aren't professionals. And lemme tell you, I've seen some professionals I wouldn't let alone with a A dog much less with my loved one.
How do you get respite? It's almost a year for me taking care of my mom. No help from family or friends
I also greatly empathize. Please remember you are valid, your emotions are valid, and you deserve something in your life for yourself. Your health and wellbeing are important. Do you mind if I ask the general area of the country where you live? Feel free to DM me. There are normally respite services in the area available, but the hard part is finding them and then enrolling. I would love to see you get some relief, however temporary.
This is a difficult life, and a lot of us didn't choose it either. We understand. It's impossible. It's not just hard; it's crushing. You're not exaggerating at all. This completely  sucks. But the sun will keep coming up, and we've just got to keep going on. And some days will be worse than others, and sometimes all of the bad things come at once, but time just keeps moving forward. Keep waking up, keep breathing, keep getting though the day, and we'll be right there with you doing the same thing for the people we love. It's not fair. It's terrible. But somebody's got to do it, and nothing lasts forever. You have all of my hugs and sympathy.
My sister writes a blog for caregivers:   [https://bossyspa.com/author/deborah-simmons2/](https://bossyspa.com/author/deborah-simmons2/) .  She lives on a ranch in central Texas and loves plants. If you are a caregiver who likes plants, take a look.  There are hundreds of encouraging archived posts.  They are accessible any time, even if you are up at night for your patient and everyone else is sleeping

I feel for ya, it's brutal. I had a relative dropped
on my doorstep. I got very little help, no financial support, it it about killed me. Fortunately I live in an area where there are services available. It was a lot of work to get them but I'm past the worst of it and have a ton of help. When I got it I used to have nightmares that they'd take it away. Fortunately I was able to use the law to my advantage to lock it in. 

I'm now slowly rebuilding my life. COVID isn't helping but it's easier than caregiving. 

See if you can get some of his friends and other family members to do some research to see what services you can get in your area. Most, if not all, of it can be done in-line. It's pretty hard for people to say they can't spare an hour for their brother.
The first couple years are the hardest. The ways I’ve found to cope are:
1) find a creative social outlet. I use tiktok. I created an act to share information about My brothers severe brain injury. 
2) join a church or other social group (book club, support group, anything) where you may run into people born to help. 
3) check out the free app ianacare. It’s a lifesaver. 
4) research grants for caregivers. My bro is on a federal grant that covers 25hrs of in home care a week. It’s not a ton, but my god it helps.
5) keep posting here. Or find an active group on fb (i can send you a few if you need them) where you can vent and find folks in similar situations. You’re definitely not alone!
Please try to look into your local home health companies. Most companies will offer respite care for the family caregiver to be able to go out and do things while someone stays with their loved one. It truly makes a world of difference, even if you can get a homemaker to come in and clean up your house that would help take off some of the weight.
I’m homeschooling my daughter while caring for my disabled and elderly grandpa around the clock. He also had a stroke but it was many, many years ago before I was born. It’s ROUGH. My grandpa’s in a wheelchair and needs help with almost everything you can think of. I completely understand the exhaustion and hopelessness ❤️ 

You are doing the absolute best you can. Please don’t be so hard on yourself. Some things will have to be pushed aside. I realized very quickly I couldn’t keep a super organized, sparkling house while fulfilling the role of caregiver. My child also has to play on her own a fair bit more then before we moved in with him. I have a lot of guilt for not being able to do it all. And it’s so stupid bc I completely put that pressure on myself! I’m working on being more realistic about our situation and being more forgiving with myself. 

Take a few moments for yourself whenever you can. I know that easier said then done as a caregiver. Don’t be afraid to be selfish once in a while and possibly hire someone for an hour so you can grab a coffee or just go drive and sing in the car. I do that sometimes.",2020-08-31 15:12:38,MoreMoats,ik4fhz
,My fiancé is amazing.,"I just wanted to give a quick shoutout post to my fiancé. She is a full time mom, and my caregiver, I have epilepsy, am losing vision, and I don’t walk well without a walker or cane. Every morning this woman gets up like clockwork, changes me, helps me shower, and then makes our daughter breakfast. Idk how she does it day in and day out. I know it’s hard on her physically and mentally so reddit, what’s a good surprise I can get her as a token of thanks? I was thinking of paying for a day of beauty for her, spa day, haircut, and aromatherapy. Any suggestions from you guys?","That’s a fantastic idea for her, I’d suggest a note telling her how much you love and appreciate her as well♥️
Spa day sounds good.  Flowers are nice. Dinner out for her and a friend would be fun.  I'm full time caregiver for my husband who has similar challenges, and really, after 6 years I'd be most thrilled to have a weekend off.  My husband is kind and appreciative and it sounds like you are, too. That makes it easier.  Your fiancé is certainly a trooper and you are a very, very lucky person.  There is no substitute for loving care at home.",2020-08-31 10:13:13,Epileptic-dan,ijypx7
,Feel guilty no matter what I do,"My dad got an anoxic brain injury back in October and has been in hospitals/ a nursing home since then. He's 67 and is total care. His health has been fragile recently and he has a stage 4 sacral wound. More than anything I wish my dad could be home. What's hard is my mom and sister wouldn't help. I'm 27 and still barely started my life and have some physical/mental health issues as well. 

Everyone is trying to convince me to bring him home and I feel like it's not possible and I feel guilty. I don't know if it would be fully safe for him. I don't live at home and there's no room in my apartment. I'm scared something could happen and I'll blame myself. But at the same time I feel horrible having my dad in a nursing home. I know how they are. I do my best to stay on top of everything, I call multiple times a day and try and get status updates throughout the day. Even this by itself is exhausting. 

I would most likely be the only one taking care of him if he were to come home. I know my mom isn't comfortable with strangers in the house so I don't know how it would go with hiring nurses or aides. 
Life really sucks. I feel like I'm abandoning him no matter what I do. I already live in guilt","It definitely sounds like he belongs in a nursing home right now. That’s what they're for. You can't possibly take care of him 24/7 by yourself. And if your family refuses to help, they have no right to criticize.
I'm very sorry for your Dad's health troubles.  It sounds like you have no place to bring your Dad ""home"" to.  If your mom won't give him house room and allow medical help in, your hands are tied.   Your mother is ultimately responsible for your father's care--she took a vow: in sickness and in health.  Your duty is to help, but with physical and mental issues of your own you can't assume primary responsibility.  Trust me, you would feel guilty even if you were taking care of him full time--there is no perfect in trying to care for someone.  Calling for multiple updates daily is just going to piss off the staff and add to your anxiety level.  If you have transport, go see him every day.  Bring his nurses candy.  Ask them to call you if there's a significant change.  And breathe.
Hi!! I’m so sorry to hear that you’re so stressed, and I know these kind of decisions can be very hard :( but don’t worry you’re not alone! Have you looked into places where you can hire a caregiver during the day and night to watch over your father in his own home?",2020-08-31 09:52:29,Vm278vm278,ijyd3z
,I've been a caregiver ever since I was a minor.,"Note: This is probably TL;DR so if you want the super short version: I'm my little brother's caregiver and we have on top of his challenges we have irresponsible parents which has made life exponentially harder for the both of us.  


I don't want to repeat what I've written on another sub or in my profile (it's the same post lol). At the time of those writings, I didn't realize this sub existed, so if it's okay let me write about my life as a caregiver some here. Everything that I'm about to say is 100% true. If you have any questions that won't make me give away any of my IRL details, I'll be happy to answer them.  


I'm 34 years old. I have a younger brother, who is 4 years younger than me and just turned 30 in June. And, I've been his caregiver ever since I was 14 years old. Really, I've helped in various ways ever since I was a young child myself, but once I became a teenager I took on the bulk of his daily care needs, and eventually all of them as time progressed.  


He's legally blind. He \*can\* see stuff if he buries his face into it, but otherwise not really. He also has the mental and emotional capacity of maybe a 10 year old? Probably younger if I'm being honest about it. He can't prepare his own food, or bathe himself. He can somewhat dress himself, but not particularly well. He's not even able to do basic hygiene tasks. All of these things, among others are and have been my charge for the last 20+ years. And they likely, almost certainly will be until my dying day.  


I don't mind doing that either. He's my little brother, you know? In a lot of ways, because my parents didn't really do much to raise him and it fell to me to do that, I view him as a son as strange as that sounds. My father at least tried to help out when he had the time, but he worked a full time night shift job so he understandably couldn't put in as much as he'd have liked. My mother, never ever and to this day still never lifted a finger to help him at all.  


As kids, my dad would go to work at night, my mom would go gambling and leave me alone at home to tend to my brother. My father made good money because he worked at the post office, but my mother would gamble with it and we'd end up not having a lot of simple things that people take for granted (Such as hot water or a washing machine).

We're both adults now, but for my brother he's still a child in an adult's body. We both live with our parents, who are retired and are in fading health. Neither of us work. He's disabled so of course he can't work, and I being his full time 24/7 caregiver can't work because someone has to be on call to tend to his various needs. Even if my parents wanted to take this role from me (and they don't), neither is in good enough physical shape to do so. My dad's a stroke victim with numerous spinal issues and my mom has diabetes, severe heart disease (she's had one surgery, probably needs another). They're both opioid addicts as well. I can't leave him in their care. Would you? Of course not. But despite all of that, and despite the shame of being my age and still living at home, at least my brother does have food and shelter, and hot water. Those things are an upgrade over how we had it as kids. Still no washing machine though.   


It's not an issue of amount of money coming in. My parents and brother all get some sort of fixed income monthly so as it as when we were kids, we should be living comfortably. But, like how it was back then - my bad with money management gambling addict mother still controls the family purse. And, as it was when I was a kid, my dad is passive and doesn't challenge her on any of it. I'd do so myself, but if I blow up our family, there's nowhere I can send my brother. I don't care about me. I wouldn't care if I was homeless, but I do care about him.   


(Note: I absolutely am not asking for any sort of financial aid. My posting about my life on Reddit is the first time in 34 years I've mentioned any of this in any way to anybody outside of my family who already knows it all. I've never been one to talk about these things, and I'm not one to ask for help either. I'll come up with a way for us to make it as we go.)  


I'd like to get a job, have a normal life and all that. I gave all of that up to be my brother's caregiver. I dropped out of high school with one semester left to take that role, because I knew that my brother's condition was never going to improve, and the idea of leaving him with parents who would have neglected him, possibly to death, was too much for me to be okay with.

I don't regret doing that, because he's my little brother. If I could go back to when I made the choice to give up my own ambitions, pursuits and my own life to help him live his, I'd make the same choice.  


So, yeah. That's maybe 1/100th of the story. At this point in my life, it's hard to shoulder all of this alone psychologically. To that end, I started looking around for support groups and ended up here. I'm holding up okay, although my body is beginning to betray me a bit. I haven't been to a doctor in probably 20 years, but that's another topic for another time.  


If you managed to make it this far, thank you for reading. I'm largely venting, and trying to find a place online where maybe I can find a single person that can understand me and my life. I have a lifetime of things to say, because for my entire life I've never said anything. I didn't want to come across as a complainer, or someone that's ungrateful for at least having food and shelter.  


Okay, that's all I have for now. Thanks for letting me vent.","That sounds exhausting. I wonder if there are groups at your local hospital (especially if you live in a city with a big academic hospital - or they might be virtual now) for siblings of sick children.... On the other hand, I guess you're adults now so that might not exactly match your situation... either way, I wonder if some sort of therapy could help you process all you've been through.
My state has resources for caregivers, with the intent of reducing the amount of people that end up in nursing homes or as wards of the state.  It seems likely you could qualify for caregiver support.  There are a number of programs, including one that gives some money to people who stay home and take care of someone like your brother.  They also have some housekeeping services, and/or meal service.  Additionally, there is a caregiver support group, which meets with masks in the park due to COVID.  You must be very lonely.  I think the caregiver support group would really help, and they could link you up with some of the other services.

It may be that you can find a small job and/or a way to socialize with someone outside your family.  My daughter-in-law got a job for teaching Spanish to elementary school students by Zoom--it's just ten hours a week, and she will be working from home.  Since your family members are all relatively dependent on you, I imagine that having having someone your age to be friends or even work colleagues would be great.

Best wishes for finding a way to open your life to having more of your own needs met!
You are an amazing person even if you humbly disagree. I think you are a superwoman. I truly hope and pray at some point you get to take care of yourself and start to fill up your own cup. You deserve it! We all deserve to live a life we love ❤️",2020-08-21 18:49:26,hb42286,ie75sq
,Unsafe bathtub,"My bathtub, a 1960s era nightmare, is very unsafe for me, and our new shower seat is the round-seat kind with no back, and it feels shaky.  I cannot get in and out by myself since a procedure on my back went awry, leaving me with very weak legs.  My husband never gets around to helping me shower.  Even then, I worry about hurting his back if I slip and fall.  So I'm letting it go, and my skin is starting to punish me for it.

I need an alternative way to get clean, really clean, but I'm very weak.  Everything is suddenly so much harder.  I can't carry water around, or stand at the sink.

Are there techniques I could learn to make a DITY sponge bath more effective?  Inexpensive products that won't leave me sticky with soap residue?  It seems there are a lot of ""scammy"" sites marketing wipes and other dubious products.

There really isn't room in that shower to put a grab bar, and the long wall of it is full of wiring for the kitchen anyway.  My husband won't pay anybody to do anything, and we can't afford to replace the tub with an accessible shower.

Aging and Adult Care might also know of funds/grants that you can use to remodel your bathtub area so it is safe for you.
Call your local Area Agency on Aging.  They are a government funded (so free and unbiased) group that is the clearinghouse for all senior stuff.  Tell them you need help with bathing and ask if you are eligible to have a bath aide come in and help you shower once or twice a week.  They can also help you figure out if your are eligible (and then help you apply for) government funds to help pay for the bath aide.
What about a wide shower chair that extends outside of the tub (over the tub wall - [something like this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NGUD94/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_x_EvzpFbXTD45WN))? Those are usually much more stable and easier to get in/out of. That particular model features a sliding seat, but there are also shower ""benches"" that are one solid piece if you can scoot across it? Not sure if that's still too difficult for you?

We used that  - kind of messy because the shower curtain obviously can't hang down with the bench in the way, but if it's your only option, maybe throw down some extra towels and you're set?

If that doesn't work, how about no-rinse bath wipes? I know that costs money so it might not be a good solution, but throwing out ideas here, not sure what will/won't work for you?
Contact your local government, they may be able to put you in contact with community senior services. There are programs to help.
This might be helpful for getting in and out the tub. We have one of the and it’s pretty sturdy and relatively cheap. Also you might want to look into getting a sliding shower bench that you sit and slid into the shower.

Reading through this thread, I'd have to say that you are being neglected at best, and abused at worst. Your husband's heart may have been in the right place and after seeing what it's going to take to give you the care that you need and deserve, he's simply not up to the task. I don't know the guy so I don't have a frame of reference to work with.  


I'm not in the business of telling people to leave their family. I have my own family issues, and understand that it's not easy. But, what I will tell you is this: You've done nothing wrong. You have nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed about. There are an, at least to me unknown amount of people out there who need varying degrees of caregiving or assisted living or whatever else.  


And it's my firm belief that every single person that needs care is entitled to it. Nobody wants to be in a situation where they have to have someone else take care of them. But those that are in that situation deserve to have their needs met, because whether you're physically disabled, mentally disabled or both you still have a right to life and to as much comfort as can be obtained given your condition(s).  


With respect to your bathtub, there are remodeling services you can use and you could get a bath tub that has a stable seat inside and a door on the side so you don't have to step in and out. However, that kind of remodeling isn't the cheapest thing in the world. My state offers nothing for nobody, so if you live where I do (Alabama) you might have a hard time finding any sort of government funding/care assistance.
I suppose it's too late to include a photo in this, but I will try.

,I don't know if there's an answer but today's problem: re-explaining the catheter to someone with dementia.,"Usually starts with him explaining that he has to get up and go someplace and needs to make sure the path is clear. Where? The bathroom. ""If you just have to pee,  you have a catheter."" Sometimes he gets it right away. Sometimes he keeps telling me he ""understands"" but that I'm not telling him where the thing is (I assume like a bedpan or something). Pretty strange arguing with your Dad over how to pee.","Oh boy, do I understand!! This has been my daily battle for years with my father. When he first got it, he was on a Marijuana medication which claimed to have no THC, but he stayed looped all the time. Hallucinations, the whole thing.

He would not leave the catheter alone. No matter what, he was always touching it, playing with it.

We got him off the weed, but he still has dementia, still perseverates on it, talks about it, has mystical routines with it.

So, lots of UTIs, right?

He'll be going in soon for a suprapubic catheter. I'm hoping that will alleviate at least some of his problems. I'm not sure it won't kick it into high gear, though.

That dang thing will be the death of one, or both, of us.
My dad had bladder cancer and they removed his bladder and prostate and put in a urostomy (they re-routed the ureters from his kidneys to an opening in his abdomen that was created with a piece of his small intestine, like a little mouth. The kidneys empty into a bag that is attached). 

We spent months going over and over and over why he has this bag. Why this was the only option for him, or he would have died. That we tricked him into this weird contraption. To find him a doctor who will give him a second opinion and cut it out of his body. The circular conversations are just such fun, aren't they! Sometimes they click, sometimes they don't.
I wonder if you could do our an easy read page about it?  Because something with that basic and pictorial format would definitely help me understand better than someone telling me for something that was a bit complicated",2020-08-10 02:00:00,dan_jeffers,i6zd5f
,So I'm a volunteer for an Adult Children of Aging Parents resource group.,"I see so many of you bravely caring for elderly parents and other aging family members. Kudos! I know it's not easy.

I have an 87 year old step mom and a 62 yo sister with early onset dementia. I know the road you are all on.

It doesn't get better, but you grow some and learn about your own strengths.

This Tuesday evening we are having a free, zoom workshop that you might be interested in. 

[The topic is ""Caring for the Caregiver"".](http://imgur.com/gallery/C3GGgXN)

,Need advice for a man trying to get a woman with alzheimer's to do her personal care.,"In my current placement, I handle the husband with vascular  dementias needs, while a female carer handles the wife with alzheimer's needs, but the new carer after the last one left is useless, I've contacted our manager and the NOK telling them she needs to be replaced ASAP,  the service user hasn't washed or changed clothes for 4 days now. She has hemorrhoids and wears a pad which also hasn't been changed for that time, I can't wait for another carer, I need to get this done today. I can get her to take her medication, which the female carer tries to do once and gives up, but she typically doesn't respond to men trying to help her with personal care. 

She handles her own personal care, but she was a teacher, and responds better to childlike personalities asking her to do things, which I can't do, the husband responds better to polite, intelligent professionals, which is why I work well for him, but not so much his wife. That's not a character I could put on, and if I tried, it would be uncomfortable for everybody. The last carer hasn't responded to my messages,  I was hoping her advice could help me handle this myself. 

For context, the new carer, forgot to order medication after being told no less than 5 times that she needs to the day the last carer left, tries for less than a minute to get through to the wife and gives up, I do all of the cooking and shopping, literally all she does is clean, and ask once or twice for the wife to handle personal care, take medication, or change clothes. I'm taking the reigns as much as possible so that her needs are met, but I've just been trying my best to encourage the other carer to keep trying to get the wife to handle her personal care and change clothes. She's an old fashioned lady, so a man trying to get her to change clothes makes her uncomfortable. 

Any advice that could help, or ways to handle this, if you've had a similar experience would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: I've ordered the medication myself and asked them to put an urgent on it, but she is going to miss her sleeping pills tonight at least, if the surgery hasn't put it through urgently, she won't have any until Monday.","Put it to her like it her making the choice ” I know you have has a wash but it's just that you might have missed a bit... Would it be ok if... Start walking in conversation to the bathroom once there engage her in conversations about her fav subject is times gone by stories of when she was happiest she would have told it a billion times... As she tells it...start taking clothes off slowly if she becomes argumentative engage her some more and say she wanted to you to help.....always distract with stories...untill done and compliment her sense of fashion this will be valuable when it comes to choosing outfit

Compliment her hair style and if all above fail say she is not having a wash but just washing her hair and she has to take her clothes off otherwise it will get wet... Then go from there

But it takes a lot of patience 

Good job Praise God for you
The pad is the most important I know time is limited call through to office inform perhaps they can get someone else for your next call so you don't have to stress about time rushing, it will only frustrate you
Ideally, It should be a female handling her
The medication till Monday??? Wow that's a long time. She will be up most of the night praise she doesn't wonder or get hurt

My thoughts and prayers are with you
Sometimes the bathroom is cold, so have a robe or blanket to wrap around her before and after she gets out of the bath.  Possibly, play music she likes to help calm her.  Don’t ask her to get a bath or change her pad.  Just get everything ready, run the bath water ahead of time, and then head her toward the bath, and tell her it’s time for your bath. While bathing her, note any bruise, cuts and sores.

After you wash her arms, shoulders, chest & back - wrap a towel around her shoulders, so she doesn’t get cold sitting there.  Wash her legs & feet before you tackle her hair.  When you wash her hair Do. Not. Pour. Water. On. Her. Head.  This will freak her out.  Wet a wash rag and use that to dampen her hair.  Then put some shampoo on the wash rag and rub it through her hair.  Rinse by using the same wash rag over and over. It’s a pain but it will keep her calmer that way.

Stand her up now, like you are going to get her out of the tub.  But clean her genital area instead. Do it quickly but as thoroughly as you can. Be sure to rinse, since the soap can start a rash.  To dry her off, have her sit on a towel on the commode lid with a towel around her shoulders. Rub her hair of excess water, then dry her legs and feet.  Take the towel off her shoulders and dress the top part of her. Then stand her up and dry her genital area and bottom, then sit her down and dress her bottom half.  In case she’s cold, let her put her robe on over her clothes if she wants. 

Give her one of her favorite treats when she’s all done so it ends with a positive experience.  Good luck!
God is faithful
No God did not give them the disease. God does not steal, kill and destroy someone's life. That is satan, the devil.

But God does heal, mend, and bounds the injuries scars...

He turns or uses the bad caused in to a good. Because He cares for all. Hence the Drs coming up with the medication that works. But if the scientific community continue to deny Gods existence the further away they will be from finding a cure. Even more so now... 

Only advancing in the thief's destruction and killing. God is a gentleman, He steps back when you lead or do not want Him. He is not a rapist like satan sneaking up on you and forcing himself on you...disease....

God always forgives. It doesn't matter what you have done, like a good Father he will always wait, for you with open arms ready for that big welcome home.

With satan the more you suffer the happier he is. Kicks you when your down, never forgiving but an eye for a head so to speak...tit for tat

God is faithful! Why don't you talk to Him about what's on your mind? He is always listening...speak from the heart and He will answer you...thats His promise He will never turn away anyone who comes to Him, calls on Him... Just be honest you can't hide from Him all is in plain sight to Him even secret desire or pain what ever... But like I said, He is not a rapist to force Himself upon anyone. You have free will to go to Him or not. But if you don't, you only have satan forcing himself on you while God tries to protect you from harm...it not a coincidence you are here.

Talk to Him Christ is always listening

I thank God for you, God bless always",2020-08-06 04:46:44,mogley1992,i4o64s
,What kind of advance directive have you done?,"The very day my dad was to move into his own little house rental he fell in my bathroom and broke his hip. As the paramedics were arriving, my teenage son was frantically trying to search online and print out a healthcare power of attorney form. 

Of course, getting this form signed had been on my to-do list. We found one, printed it, and asked the paramedics to be the two witnesses required. Apparently, they are not allowed to do that. At the hospital, we ended up asking my dad’s roommate and his wife to sign as the witnesses. Two complete strangers! \[[read more](http://blog.waysandwane.com/the-best-way-to-be-ready-for-your-dads-devastating-fall/)\]","Good advice, though more could be done to hide those witness details in the image.

,What do you do while watching your geriatric patients?,"Hey everyone I just started my caregiving job for a 85 year old woman! She is absolutely wonderful! Although She can’t do much so she watches a lot of tv, and takes naps. What are some things I could do to keep myself busy and her?  TYIA","Does she have hand function? If so, and if mental function is adequate you could try coloring, playing dominoes or cards, big piece puzzles (dollar tree has great ones with 24-48 pieces). I liked to read to my granny, listen to her favorite music, write letters/cards to family members, talk about whatever was on TV, talk about her life, etc. I did a few craft projects that were portable, homework, read books, listened to podcasts, etc... when she was sleeping
Myself, I read, draw, and I have one of the new xbox game pads that can connect to your phone with bluetooth and a little clip to attach my phone to it. 

For activities you can do together, if they have mental capacity, I usually ask them to help me with little tasks as it makes them feel more useful, which is important to a lot of service users, things like folding clothes, putting cutlery away, or getting me the odd thing while I'm cooking. Aside from that, it depends on the service user. My last service user enjoyed chess, so I'd play with him  once or twice a day, and he loved gardening, so I would take him outside on nice days, he would tell me what to do, and I'd do the gardening work, i could have worked it out, but I let him feel like a large part of the operation, my current service user used to be a computer engineer, and also has vascular dementia, so I've taught him about modern computers a few times which he finds fascinating, he reads the times, so that gives me a hint about his political pov, so I can talk to him about them. Card games are almost always a win. A lot of the time, they'll like talking about their kids/grandkids and their past. One user used to be a programmer then later a math teacher, so I introduced her to sudoku. 

So i guess mostly, learn more about the service user, and something will come to you. I'm lucky I've got varied interests.
My one patient has severe dementia and is blind. She gets anxious when she thinks she is alone. I talk to her about the weather and the positivities in my life. I explain what food i made for dinner and my dogs (age breed,etc) i play music for her and we sing together and although i am not religious, i do prayers with her as well. She also loves audiobooks. Sometimes i will play old shows from youtube that she seems to remember here and there.

My other patient is in a coma. I do a lot of range of motion, music, and in the mornings i play the online church services for her(her family gave me her back story/beliefs) I talk to her and tell her about random things going on today (always focusing on the positive) i dont know if she can actually hear me but i think it helps keep her calm.(keeps her pulse at a steady level) 

In my free time (when they are sleeping or getting a breathing treatment) i download shows and movies on my phone or do my budgeting on my computer. I do research on politics to find out what is true and what the media is lying about. I also always keep a book to read and a sudoku book as well in my purse. In a big house that i can step away for a minute i call my doctor for appointments and what not since they are only open during my working hours. I also journal abut my thoughts, emotions, and struggles.
I do the cooking, light housekeeping, and laundry for my clients, as well as sometimes planning outings and doing errands to the store. I find out their interests and then try to work with their individual personal needs. If they are in a physical therapy program, I work with them and the PT to help them do their exercises. Sometimes they have a speech or memory therapist and I work on that using games or other activities they enjoy.",2020-07-29 21:03:34,peanutbvtterNjealous,i0cpc8
,Neighbor is no longer fit to live alone.,"(EDIT: Thanks to people who gave advice, I'll contact APS.)

I have a neighbor who is my dad's friend and lives two houses down the street. I've seen her condition getting worse over the years.

Lately, she has stopped being able to walk around. She has been subsisting by relying on a long-time renter for care. He has been getting very fed up because he doesn't want to be a caregiver.

She's been calling my dad lately, crying, telling him she's starving. Her family is doing nothing about the situation. They're all moved away and don't want anything to do with her.

I am in almost as bad of health as her, so I can't help. The reason I'm asking is that it seems like she's in for a horrible death of neglect, maybe starvation. I'm in WA, USA. Is there some authority that I can call about her?

She already gets all of the independent living services and meal delivery, but she can't cook it because she can't move freely around her home. Also she's a hoarder and you can't see the floor of her house without putting in serious effort. Anyways sorry about rambling.","I would still call APS.  You can’t let her die, not when you know that she needs help.  How cruel would that be.  You also don’t know what her mental status is, maybe she has dementia setting in.  Tell them she is unable to prepare any meals and she is calling around saying she is hungry.  At least they will bring her some food that doesn’t need preparation.  At best they will take her to be better safer place to live.
This is going to sound harsh..... maybe her family stays away for a reason. She’s going to have to arrange for her own care.
You need to call Adult Protective Services.    [https://www.dshs.wa.gov/altsa/home-and-community-services/report-concerns-involving-vulnerable-adults](https://www.dshs.wa.gov/altsa/home-and-community-services/report-concerns-involving-vulnerable-adults) 

You can either phone or make a report online.

They will talk to her,  her doctors, family and probably her renter and neighbors to find out what type of help she needs.  She can decline to talk to them, but APS investigators are good at making friends and gaining someone's confidence.

Since you asked what would happen if she declined services.

If after talking to everyone and they think she's suffering from lack of insight (some people with dementia have insight problems, meaning they don't see they can't cope even though they can't live safely), then they could go to the court system and apply to have her declared legally incapacitated.  Then a family member or Washington state would become her legal guardian.

That is not something that is done lightly, because it strips her of the ability to make her own decisions.  Washington state and other states have recently passed laws to regulate legal guardians's power.  They can be and are prosecuted if they abuse their position.   

Here's a link that shows what a guardian can and can't do and shows there are designated people to call if a guardian isn't doing their job right.     [https://www.disabilityrightswa.org/publications/how-avoid-guardianship-pitfalls/](https://www.disabilityrightswa.org/publications/how-avoid-guardianship-pitfalls/) 

I don't remember the court procedure for determining if a person needs a guardian, but I do know your neighbor gets her own lawyer and psychiatrists interview her and have to testify in court.
Adult Protective Services.   But they’ll kill her off in about a year.
r/hoarding is useful for me as I don't feel so alone.  My husband is a hoarder.  It helps me to see what I have power to do, and what I don't.  I also benefited from watching Youtuber Curiosity Incorporated buy, clean out, repair, and resell a hoarder's house.  Many treasures were found, and the artist who had lived there was rediscovered and honored as a result.  Her neighbors might have only known her as a hoarder, and her family was probably beyond overwhelmed, but this guy came in unburdened by emotional baggage.  He found most of the kitchen floor in only the first few hours!  He removed so much garbage from the house, and found money, lots of gorgeous pottery with high resale value, even a secret room!  And while he was doing it, he found keepsakes for the family and set them aside.  If they had had to do that themselves, they'd have probably never made it that far.  The property then became a home for a family again.  Now I know if my husband somehow dies before me, I won't be trying to clean this place myself.  (Impossible anyway.)  I will sell it as is to someone who is a professional.  They'll get several valuable old lathes in pieces, and who knows what all else, and I won't have to deal.  That crap has ruined my life for over 20 years since the military stopped telling him how much stuff he could have (retirement.)  I'm not free of it, but one way or other I will be!

Here's the link to the start of these videos.  I promise that it turned out to be a whole lot better and more humane than I expected it to be.  This guy isn't just a profiteer on other people's pain and failure.   He is more an archaeologist of a woman's vibrant and successful past.

Maybe this will help you and your dad realize that her hoarding doesn't have to kill her.  She can be separated from it, like the potter was.  She didn't have to die there alone, but she was able to be reunited with her family in a comfortable, safe place.  (Maybe her kids are estranged from her situation more than from her.)

I'm glad this lady has your dad, but obviously adult protective services has to come in and help her get into a better place so she doesn't starve!  I once saw the feet of a lady who had been neglected for perhaps thirty years.  She had stopped removing her shoes at all, and her toenails grew back and under her feet.  Terrible.  Young healthy people don't think of how it could become too hard to take off shoes, wash feet, and trim toenails.",2020-07-28 19:19:26,KLWiz1987,hzpfap
,Seniors Guide on how to get up from a Fall," 

Seniors Guide on how to get up from a Fall.  


More than 1 in 4 people age 65 and older fall each year, according to the CDC, and falling once doubles the chances of falling again.  


After an older adult falls, lying on the floor for a long time or getting up incorrectly could cause additional injury – even if they weren’t seriously injured from the fall itself.  


Many people who fall, even if they’re not injured, become afraid of falling.  
This fear could cause them to avoid everyday activities. And if they’re less active, they’ll become weaker, which then increases their chances of falling.  


To combat this, seniors can proactively learn safe techniques for how to get up from a fall.  


Knowing what to do if a fall does occur and practicing ahead of time will give them confidence that they’ll be able to help themselves and minimize injuries.  


**Step-by-step guide for how to get up from a fall safely:**  


* Stay calm and still. Don’t move for a few minutes because moving too quickly can cause more harm.
* Figure out if you’re injured. Slowly move hands and feet, arms and legs to check for pain.
* If there are no injuries, slowly roll onto your side, starting the movement with your head and moving down your body toward your feet. Take a moment to rest.
* Slowly push up into a crawling position and crawl slowly on hands and knees toward a sturdy chair or piece of furniture. Don’t rush and rest as needed. Place your hands on the seat of the chair, one at a time.
* Supporting yourself with the chair, bring your strongest leg up to a 90-degree angle by putting that foot flat on the ground. The other leg stays in kneeling position. Slowly push up to standing using both arms and legs.
* Slowly turn around and lower yourself onto the chair. Sit and catch your breath for a few minutes before doing anything else.

**How to call for help when there are injuries**  


* Stay calm and rest for a few moments. Figure out what parts of your body are injured.
* If you have one, use an emergency medical alert device or mobile phone to call 911 or a family member for help. Tell them about your injuries.
* If there’s a pillow nearby, put it under your head. If there’s a blanket or some clothing nearby, use it to keep yourself warm while you wait for help.
* If you don’t have a medical alert device or a phone nearby, start yelling for help. If you can’t yell, grab something nearby and use it to bang on the floor or on nearby furniture to make noise and attract attention.

**Safety warning:** always assess injuries before moving  
Seniors should only consider getting up if they’re not injured or dizzy from the fall. 

* If you find that your older adult has been injured in a fall, don’t move them – that could make their injuries worse. Instead, call 911, keep them as warm and comfortable as possible, and wait for emergency responders to arrive.

**Important:** Seniors with serious health conditions or limited mobility should always consult their doctor or physical therapist for advice on what to do in case of a fall in order to prevent further injury.","As a previous retirement home worker and the child of elderly parents, I can't thank you enough for this post. Keeping calm and having a plan for situations like this helps to save lives ❤
Mother in law is almost 96.  I and My wife, mother in laws youngest child, and another sibling have been personally caring for her for several years now.  

In a nursing home is out of the question for the family's 4 siblings.  But this last 18+ months things have declined drastically.  

 Argumentive with many menial tasks as eating and bedtime, etc...

Her brain not really processing these tasks.  ""Change your blouse"" turns into a 15 minute lecture of what she needs to do and how to do it.  My wife would go they the steps with her.  

Sometimes I would be there and almost do the work for her.  Reaching into the sleeve to gently guide her arm thru the sleeve to put on her PJ's, night gown.  

It just stresses my wife out to see her mom ""so much out of it"".   I try to help my wife and encourage her, but it's a personal thing with her and her mom.  I can, and say so much.  


She demands bedtime only hours after getting up, or hours before dinner time.  Then during the night she is up almost every hour.  Last night she did well, stayed in bed and we all kinda slept in till almost 9 this Saturday.

,How to help my dad with his caregiving duties,"My 69-year-old dad is the sole caregiver of my 92-year-old grandmother. What can I do to help him out or give him a break? I work in healthcare so I have not been visiting her. I have also gathered phone numbers for elderly resources in his county (Southern U.S.) to give him a starting point. Of course, he doesn't think he needs help yet and my grandmother refused the one home health aide they tried to have come to the house.","Since you can’t visit, you could take over all of the paperwork (bill paying, appointment making, etc.).  You could make meals in portioned containers that your dad could pick up for your grandmother to eat.  Or, if they live together, make a big pot of chili or spaghetti or a casserole and a dessert.  You could do their grocery shopping, whether in person/pickup/delivery.  Anything you can think of to make your dad’s life a little easier.

If you want to try an aide again, tell your grandmother that a friend of yours just lost her job and really needs a little money.  Ask her if it would be ok if she came over once in awhile and did a little cleaning to earn enough to buy some school clothes for her son.  A story like that has been known to work.  Once the aide gets in the door, your grandmother will probably grow to love her.
I can relate to the refusal of help. Frustrating as all hell.  


Does he live with her? They’d both likely qualify for meals on wheels so daily hot food is a good help. Ordering groceries in for them would be a big help too. Can he tell g-ma that using home aides is for him, not her? It’s not a lie. They’ll help with things like laundry and light housekeeping, which would help him tremendously and she’d almost certainly qualify for those services. She’d probably hate it if someone showed up to bathe her so don’t schedule those services (though she might eventually agree to having her fingernails and toenails cut). You might provide a personal billpaying service to him and her both (like receiving e-bills to lessen the amount of mail they receive and/or set up direct pays from their accounts). Are they on meds? How are the meds delivered or do they have to go get them? Can someone be paid to cut the grass? Any one thing your dad doesn’t have to do or think about is helpful to him. 

May I be blunt? Gathering numbers for your dad  is nice and all but he doesn’t really have time for that. He’s elderly too. 


You’re being a good child and grandchild. This is not easy for any of you.
My mom is in the same situation as your dad, caring for their parent alone. What I can say is, just be there for your dad. He will eventually need you. Maybe call and try to find some in home help, as well. 

My grandma refuses to hire help. She refuses to eat the meals on wheels. She refuses to do her physical therapy.

What I did for my mom is get her monthly  massages (pre-covid) and sometimes I just “listen” to her rant on the phone. Sometimes people just want to be heard. Also,  I often have Uber eats  delivered. Just the little things. 

Good luck!  I know it can get rough.
We went through about a dozen aids to find a fit. If it wasn't done her (92), it was the wrong way. It took at least 2-3 rotations for the aids to get in sink. Lots of patience.",2020-07-14 21:24:09,greenebean78,hreccu
,Reaching the end of care,"I got the word today that my mother only has days left. I'm going to stay with her in the hospice until the end. After days and days of terrifying hallucinations they finally admitted her the hospice and got them under control. Now she's just peacefully asleep. I just hope she's having beautiful dreams.

 I wanted to thank the community here for its kind words and advice, I wish I had come to you all earlier. My time as a caregiver is coming to an end. My time with my mother is coming to an end. As desperate as I was to see an ending in sight now that it's here all I want to do is run from it. For all those still taking care of the ones you love stay strong. Make the best of the time you have left-even if it's just holding thier hand until the end.","I went thru this in April - mom only had 6 weeks on hospice and I slept with her every night. It was extremely difficult and I’m still struggling. Please take care of yourself - see a grief counselor - get some grief books or join a support group. I wish you and your family peace.
my hands got sweaty just reading this. i'm sending you so much love right now. you're going through such a transition. trying to soak up as much love and warmth and time with her even while she may not be aware of it. the guilt and fear of 'please let this be your last breath' and 'please breathe again.' the anticipatory grief turning into real grief. 

i'm sure you've imagined the end and the future a million times but i want you to be aware you still can't imagine all the emotions (good and bad) that will go through you. please be gentle with yourself. even through you may have seen this coming, it doesn't alleviate your grief, it just prepares you for feeling it more. 

now that your mom is silent and less demanding (as you spoke in earlier posts) i suggest taking a few moments and sitting/cuddling with her in a way you used to/ that's comfortable for you. the hardest thing for me was remembering 'not sick' mom after she passed. i still find it hard, but i can more easily go back to that moment with her hand on my head and feel her warmth and life. 

seems like we're on similar paths in some regards. if you want someone who has just picked her way through this path a few months a head of you, please reach out <3

,Any suggestions of a good dressing for a sacral area bedsore?,I've tried one the local medical supply store had and it was worthless.  Supposed to be shower safe and it doesn't stay put for even a few hours.  I've been making my own with gauze and tape but it's not working well either.,"They make specific sacral pads (which may be what you’re talking about trying) but they are made from paper tape. My mom is allergic to most other bandage tape/adhesive and these must be triple blasted in adhesive because they last through showers and activity (she also has some for feet). They are Areza brand and I find them on Amazon because the Med store charges 2x for them.
Home health brought us Mepilex sacral dressings, and they were very helpful. The official name is Mepilex Border Sacrum. It’s foam, waterproof, and is made to stay on for several days until it comes off on its own.
Aquaphor covered with Saran Wrap. It’s the only thing that works for us.
How deep/big is it?  Is it oozing fluids?
If it was smaller, I'd recommend Band-Aid brand HydroGel hydrocolloid bandages- from my experience they work better than some of the really expensive bedsore dressings.

You might also try Always brand Infinity Flex-foam pads. They are thin, absorb, and don't stick. We used them as a dressing for a large skin tear on my mother-in-law's arm.",2020-07-05 12:31:03,Annakha,hlpg9x

,How to Scale Back Caregiver Duties,"i have been taking care of my mother for almost two decades and for the last few years this has preoccupied most of my time. I have lived with her since 2009 as she cannot live alone. I can't leave the house for more than a few hours without her texting me that she is having problems but the scary thing is sometimes she is so far off neurologically she doesn't even realize anything is wrong with her even if she can't figure out how to use her cellphone to call for help. She has no idea how to do her meds, she needs help sorting her meds for the week and scheduling when to take them otherwise we risk her forgetting to take her meds or taking them incorrectly this is why I take care of them. I manage all her medications, I have a large pillbox that I fill once a week and I go over and figure out what scripts she needs called in/picked up from the pharmacy so she never runs out of medications. She is usually pretty good about taking her meds if I do them for her in a pillbox. I still have to lock up her pain meds and she has to ask me for her AM pain pill and her PM one. I also lockup her benzo and I usually give her a bottle with a three or four day supply at a time so she really can't take more than what is prescribed. She is on oxygen and a CPAP and I make sure she has oxygen tubing and travel/backup O2 cylinders. She has no license to get to and from medical appointments (nor do I) so we take cabs and I go to every doctors appointment no matter how trivial. She is also diabetic and cannot do her own glucose sticks because of tremors in her hands so I have no idea how to get her to be able to do that. I also take care of her household bills and most of her banking as well. I am her health care proxy and POA as well as her only son. She tells me she feels bad that I have to take care of her especially since she is only 52. Some of her illnesses are progressive and will never get better, only worse.  


How can I scale back my duties a bit without compromising my Mother's care? The only close family we have all live out of state. She needs more supervision and medical services than an assisted living setup would provide (not that we could afford it) and she does not qualify for a nursing home (which I wouldn't want to do) or for Medicaid. We're both on SSDI so we have no money, thousands in medical bills and our credit is shot. I wanted to bail on her 10 years ago but I just hoped things would eventually get better but they have only gotten worse and the level of care she requires has only increased. I am nervous because I have my own serious mental health situation and the fact I'm in recovery and can't deal with large amounts of stress right now doesn't help the situation. Even if I had to go to the psych ward for like a week I would have to make sure I had everything in place for her and even then it would be difficult. I have two or three family members who could come and check on her and see how she is doing but they wouldn't know how to take vitals or check blood sugar levels. I am trying to figure out a way to possibly scale back her dependency upon me for day to day care. I would love to get my license back, get a job or a car and maybe even my own apartment. I don't know how to do all this with my caretaking duties. If she had Medicaid then I could get paid a stipend for the care I provide, right now I am doing it all out of love for my mother as she has no one else who can take care of her properly. Any advice or anything you might think of which may be of use for us would be greatly appreciated! I'm also interested in anyone who has been in a similar situation that I am in and how you deal with it while still having a life of my own.","It sounds like you need legal help to apply for medicaid.  If you are both on SSDI with no other money coming in you should be eligible.  Agencies for elders often work with people with disabilities, so be sure to check them out, you should be able to find some home care.  Call visiting nurses: they may be able to help.  I'm a full time caregiver, but for my husband, and he's 74, so not your situation.  I'm sorry for your troubles...thank you for being such a good child and caring for your mother.
Have you given occupational therapy a go? They would likely have strategies to help her become a bit more independent. There are even visiting home ones!
I would see if there is something like a council on aging in your area. I know my area has one and they have assistance with home health aides and transportation to and from appointments and to grocery stores. If that isn't available, find an advocacy group for elderly or any place with social workers and explain your situation. I think social workers could connect you with services that can help. I hope this helps!
Try contacting a social worker is your area or try catholic charities! I believe they can try to help with paying for an CNA to come by and help you. Obviously a CNA can only help you so much but maybe you can take care of everything the CNA can’t do an hour a head of time and then the CNA can take care of the rest so you can get a break. Hope this helps.
Can you request a meeting with a hospital social worker? Often they can help you figure out solutions to your problems and give some good ideas and advice. Perhaps she can have in-home caregivers from an agency come in to take care of her everyday needs. She may qualify to have these services provided if you can acquire Medicare.",2020-06-30 03:22:50,incandesantlite,hiii1b
,How do you handle the anger/resentment?,"Hello, I (51f) moved back home January 2016 to take care of my mother (76f). I am an only child, and my father passed away Oct 2010. Late 2015, my mother suffered from congestive heart failure,  and she agreed with me, at that time, that I should move back home.

I took a part time job where I make my own hours, so that I could be available whenever she needed me, for dr appts, running errands, etc. 

When I moved back home, there were only 2 things I wanted her to do, 1. Make dinner 2, dishes. Whereas I did everything else. Now, for the record. This is not a small home, nor a small yard. This house was too big when it was just the two of them, and way more than my mom could ever take care of by herself. She refuses to sell because it was their ""dream house"". I do the mowing, gardening, take the garbage/recycling  out, the vacuuming,  sweeping, you name it. She also has 2 dogs, and I have 3 cats.

Now, mom also has osteoarthritis of the hips, bad. And I had already made mention that me moving back home wasn't helping her, as ""she"" no longer was walking.  No longer checking the mail, not taking garbage out, not taking recycling out. Think you get the picture.  Even the dr told her that she needed to walk around the house more.

Then, February/March she got put on oxygen. Since then, she acts as though she is completely helpless, and now I have to do ""everything "" while she sits in her recliner all day, watching game shows. 

It's  this ""I'm totally helpless"" is getting to me, because I know she's  not. Yes, I know that there are things she can't do, but there are things she can, yet leaves it to me to do.  Like just yesterday,  I'm like  ""why are there cheerios all over the counter?"" She spilled them, and couldn't be bothered to sweep them into the sink.  And then there's MY pet peeve of garbage in the sink... 

I went out and bought a roomba to help with the floors, which doesn't work because shes constantly dropping paper towels and tissues on the floor.

She's constantly on my case that I'm not doing enough, criticizes what I like to watch on my tv upstairs,  she's angry at my dad and takes it out on me because I'm like him (she has admitted to this!), so I end up paying for my father's mistakes.  I don't go out, barely have any friends, can't go on a vacation,  and I'm  just getting stressed out and have started resenting her. I literally am sick to death of her yelling at me, and am about to throw the phone, that she uses as an intercom,  out the window.

How do people cope with this???

Thanks in advance.","I just hope you don’t get the answer I did. “ That’s how old people get at end of life, you just have to learn how to manage it.”  I care for an 82 year old uncle in my home he does nothing except eat and watch tv. Steals my food when I am not watching because dementia, according to the doctor. Nothing can be done bar putting a lock on the pantry when I am not I there. My mother was nearer to yours, she insisted I do everything my Dad did (he passed in 2003, her in 2017) . Exhausting. I saw my Mom decline mentally and my uncle is doing the same. Sounds like yours is too. My mom was a gentle soul her whole life, near the end she cursed, yelled, ordered like a field general. I know the heartbreak. Other caregivers assured me their experiences were similar. I never accepted that and I still don’t.  But the doctors don’t have an answer, nor do I. This is destroying us mentally and physically. By us I mean caregivers. I know caregivers that are 10 years past and still are broken mentally after counseling and self reflection, I don’t want that to be me, but it is. 😞
SO familiar. 🥺
[deleted]
I care for my 75 year old husband who has very limited mobility (can walk with a walker, can't get out of a chair or bed) and dementia (mostly memory problems.)  I know the situation, but it's very different caring for a parent.  Your mother is not going to get better.  She's not going to walk around more, she's not going to clean up after herself.  Expecting/hoping for her to be better is making you more frustrated.  You didn't mention your legal status.  Do you have power of attorney?  Are you her health care proxy?  As she declines you will need both those documents, especially the proxy.  This is not easy to hear, but only you can make you more content.  Take the concrete actions you can--see if she's eligible for some home care, which will give you a break--and try to accept that your mom is now your client.  I'm more fortunate than you in that my husband is good-natured and grateful, but I would take a friendly, ""here's what we're doing today and it's okay, I love you."" approach to your mom.  Also, during the day when you're in and out, just remind her of the stuff you do.  ""Hey, I just mowed the lawn, want to come see?""  Then when she says no, say okay and give her a smile.  Even though she's given up on herself, she still needs encouragement.  Take things as they happen and let the frustrating stuff blow off your shoulders.  Meditation helps a lot.

What you are doing for your mom is an act of love and care that can not be bought for any price.  You are a good person, doing a good work.  Thank you for your service.
My mother and I have been in this same exact cycle for the last several years, dealing with my grandmother. My mom was a daddy’s girl, too. My grandmother has multiple progressive lung issues and is on oxygen full time. She quit driving in August 2018 and has been dependent on us to bring her everything.

The only difference is we don’t live with her (though she would have loved that!) We would come to take care of things each day, and walk in to find bowls of dried cat food everywhere. Her trash can is literally on the way from the kitchen back to her chair, yet she “couldn’t breathe” and so she’d leave her empty cans and trash on the counter or in the sink. She has a walker she can sit down on, but somehow she “couldn’t sit long enough” to microwave the one dinner she was willing to eat. She always managed to make it to the bathroom, or from the living room to her bedroom, but somehow was unable to do any other basic functions. It was infuriating, because it was so obviously manipulative.

The thing I want to say to you is that your help is not helping her. Every single time you clean up her spilled Cheerios, it reinforces to her that you will do what she won’t. Getting a roomba to clean the floors tells her she doesn’t have to worry about them getting dirty. She can drop paper towels and tissues without fear because she knows you can’t stand leaving them there and will pick them up. 

Lord knows I know how insanely difficult this is, so please don’t think I’m being flippant here, but you have to stop doing so much for her. Make it clear that you are her daughter and love her and want to help, but that you refuse to let her continue taking advantage of you. If she chooses to live in filth when you know full well that she is capable of doing otherwise, then you have not failed. She is an adult and capable of making her own decisions. Your job as a caregiver is to make sure her basic needs are being met and that you are providing food (if she refuses to eat it, you can’t force her, and it’s unreasonable for her to demand you make something else; that’s just another way to keep control over you) and making her environment safe for her.

Definitely check in to other options. Can she afford outside paid help? Are there ANY assisted living facilities nearby that might be financially feasible? (My grandmother has been in assisted living for a week now, and I have to tell you that though the work has not stopped, it has been the best week I’ve had in 3 years.) Look into a social worker that could explain your options. 

Please feel free to PM me if you need anything, even if it’s just to vent.
I failed to mention,  she was put on oxygen in February/March 2019. This year February/March,  she was put on a low sodium diet, so now I have to cook everything from scratch.. :(
I know I have tried to talk to her about seeing someone for her anger issues, but... no lie.... she just gets angry with me...
Lots going on there. Not to sound snarky, but how do you know she's not helpless? Decreased oxygen saturation can cause confusion and more.
I/we coped by admitting that I needed help with chores and taking care of my mom. You need some breathing room, it's the only way.",2020-06-28 22:04:13,LadyAhz,hhr8ow
,Dealing with unreasonable request / neediness as a primary cargiver,"I (26) have been my mother's (61) primary and often only caregiver since she entered hospice care in early April. At first she was fairly functional but after a fall has become entirety dependant on me for all of her needs. Because of this (on top of Covid) I am with her almost 24 hours a day. 

Taking care of her constantly is running me absolutely ragged. Getting family to help has proven difficult, and the hospice has extremely limited respite care. I understand she needs help, I understand she can no longer do basic care for herself and I don't begrudge that fact but she is often extremely demanding or down right unreasonable in her requests. From making me remake food or drinks multiple times to demanding I dye her sheets a different color any denial or even questioning of these requests are often meet with tears.

If I try to step away from her she'll suddenly need something, or many things, right that minute. This is especially bad when I try to call or video chat with my partner. She will inturpt multiple times to use the restroom. The thing is she uses diapers and when I ask if she's ready to be changed she'll say she hasn't gone yet. This continues until either I or he give up on the call, and no she usually doesn't need to be changed at any point. Getting her to pee or poop has become an ordeal in itself as I have to coax her into it. My day revolves around her needs and often ends with me down right begging her to let me sleep.

Frustratingly she doesn't seem to do this to others who watch her. She'll quietly chat or rest when others are around but once I'm alone with her the demands start up. I feel gaslight and guilty that I can't have the same peaceful interactions with her that my rarely present family get. I just don't know how to deal with her anymore. The load has worn my patience down to splinters. I don't know if I need advice or just some commiserating but has anyone else dealt with this when caring for a terminally ill parent?","Well, she's forced you to a point where you have to make some choices.  You could deal with her like you deal with dogs: reward good behavior, leave when they're being bad.  How about saying ""This is an unreasonable request.  I'm leaving for 5 minutes.  When I get back I will expect you to be reasonable.  Don't cry wolf or I'll just learn that I have to ignore you even when you might really be having an emergency."" 

Then take your 5 minutes.  

""That is an unreasonable request.  If you don't want to eat, don't eat."" 

""That is an unreasonable request.  If you don't want to pee, don't.  I'll be back in half an hour."" 

""Those are crocodile tears.  I'll come back in 20 minutes, give you time to stop being manipulative.""
My Mother was like that, but not to your extreme. It was a helluva year and a half for me. I wish I had good news for you, maybe someone will have more ideas for the both of us because I have my 82 year old uncle and he's getting worse mentally by the day.
Hey, so I don't know if this comment will help you at all, but I just wanted to let you know, *I've been there.* I took care of my mom for years (she passed this May, she was 65 and I'm 28) and she was SO needy towards the end. Sometimes I swore she was doing things just to piss me off or just to argue with me, but I also knew it wasn't really her fault. I had to keep reminding myself that she really couldn't help it. She occupied the downstairs and I the upstairs. I would be finished getting her all set up and come upstairs and I swear she knew the second I sat down because she would call me for something she ""forgot"". She only really seemed to to it to me because she knew she could get away with it with me. I started therapy because I felt I really needed it and it has helped a lot. Best wishes xo
My best advice is to look at it as if she were a stranger. She doesn’t do this with others - that indicates a dysfunctional relationship or manipulation on her part. 

My grandmother is a narcissist and has been this way to me and my mother for the past 3 years. The needs, wants, requests, demands have been constant, despite the fact that she IS able to do for herself. 

She has survived the last 6 months - by her own choice - on hamburgers (plain except for an inhuman amount of raw white onion) and a smear of peanut butter on a couple of crackers. We tried EVERYTHING to get her to eat more/better variety, but she would cry and say “nothing sounds good” and “if it doesn’t sound good I can’t swallow it.” We offered to bring her anything and everything, and she refused. 

We got her into an assisted living place last week, where they give only two options for each meal, and she has cleaned her plate every single meal except for one, which was a food she has always genuinely hated. I’m supposed to believe something just suddenly “sounded good”? Each day I realize more and more how much of her behavior was manipulative. 

So my advice to you is this - make sure your mom’s absolute needs are taken care of. Make food you know she likes and can tolerate, and if she refuses it, you know you provided her with the chance to eat. Make sure she has a way to use the bathroom safely and with as much dignity as possible - which it sounds like you already do with the adult underwear. Get her an emergency alert button. Make sure she’s given reasonable opportunities to have certain needs met, but that those opportunities fit with your schedule, not hers. If she decides she wants her hair washed today, so what? You don’t have to jump when she says jump, over something that is not vital to her health and well-being. 

Then, when her immediate needs (not wants) are met, step away. Step outside so you can’t hear her cry, if needed. It’s like dealing with a child - if you know they are safe, not in pain, and their basic needs are met, then it’s not abuse to let them cry a bit or put off giving them something they want.
I'm currently going through something similar myself. Hope you get some great advice,  so I can borrow  it :)

Just know, you're not alone, and at least you have some family members... I have none. :(",2020-06-26 20:10:38,Bespokebuttons,hgj9si
,Grandpa dying of pancreatic cancer refuses to live with family to take care of him,"My grandpa was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in March and is getting chemo but will likely not survive the disease. Him and his wife have increasingly become unable to take care of themselves. Their house was full of roaches, stoves were being left on for hours unattended, falls were happening, and his wife has become completely unaware of what is going on at all times. His wife’s son made the choice to put her in assisted living and thus needs to sell their home to pay for it. My grandpa needs to move out to live with my mom, not just because the house needs sold, but because he can’t keep clean, is completely in denial that he is even sick, he can’t walk more than a few feet at a time, and he is getting worse every day. My mom got him to go to her place for a few days, but he demanded that she take him back home. My mom refused, knowing it was not safe for him, but he managed to get to a neighbors house and have them call an Uber to get him home. He now refuses to speak to his family at all. He is unable to drive or go anywhere to buy food, go to doctors appointments, or any necessary things of that sort. His house is unfit for a human to live in. The house also needs to be cleared in a few days. What in the world can we do? He’s competent enough to not be clearly needing of care, but is so stubborn and in denial that he WILL ultimately die an early and painful death if he continues on like this. What rights do we have if any??","Your version of competent on the courts versions of confidence are two different things. You need to call Adult Protective Services immediately and report him. If he was actually competent he would not be living the way he is.
You need to find out if you have any local Council on Aging or Adult Protective Services and have them intervene.

Unfortunately, it's not likely that he will live much longer.
Why cant he be with his wife in the assisted living place???
You definitely need to call APS, and you can also have your local authorities do a welfare check if need be. Really hoping for the best possible outcome here OP ❤️
What about a live-in caregiver or housekeeper? I know that can be expensive. If he owns his own house, he could do a reverse mortgage to draw money out of it.",2020-06-22 16:26:29,paigeedickey,he03c8
,I (24M) am doing full time care for my grandma (82F) post stroke.,"My grandma has been home for a week from her IRU and I have moved into being her full time care person. Not only am I fully unqualified in any aspects of nursing, but I’m also worried that I may not have enough tools/ideas to keep her happy and content. Anyone with experience dealing with stroke patients have any mellow ideas for stuff to incorporate? Doesn’t need to be exclusively recovery based but also just for fun.

Edit: My mom's a stroke survivor. It's really hard. Her partner is her caregiver, and I caregive for my husband. Big hugs❤
Rituals and routines, bike pedal machine with a VR app like BitGym, an occasional movie, magic tricks,  having friends video chat, memory card games like Go Fish. Pizza for dinner :)) Trivia/memory quizzes (naming the presidents backwards, naming family members, siblings) Alexa for conversation. Best of luck to you. 7 years in here.
I took care of my grandma after she suffered a stroke for a few months. Were there any routines or pastimes she enjoyed? You can still incorporate those into her life in a modified way. My grandmother loved to bake and I would set everything up, pre-measured and such, and encourage her to pour things and mix. We used to play the war card game too because it doesn’t take strategy or anything, just figuring out which card beats which. Best of luck!
Take a deep breath.  Don't forget to take care of yourself, too.  How mobile is your grandmother?  How is her mental state?  My husband had a stroke that left him with limited mobility and dementia, but he still enjoys looking at magazines and old photos.  One of the things that will be good for both of you is to talk about her early memories...what was her grandmother like?  My husband is like tv guy, and I feel bad about that, but he doesn't.  Sometimes you have to go with whatever works.  Also, find out what home care is available in her area.  Medicare pays for a lot, home care wise.  My old guy was going to a day program 3 days a week, which helped both of us, although he does grumble sometimes.  Good for you, doing this hard thing for your family.
My mom had several strokes in her life. She recovered from each one but each time she lost a bit of motor function. Since her strokes were in her occipital lobe, she also lost a bit of sight with each one. 

There are a lot of great ideas in this thread from folks way wiser than me.  There were things that my sister and I did for my mom when she was in the rough part of her recovery that she told us that she had dearly loved. 

--We talked to her about everything we were doing, whether it was what we were doing at the moment with her or our own lives.  We talked about good things, like small successes with our families or that a new flower had bloomed on our rose bush.  We shared little things that bothered us, like not being able to find our scissors that morning or burning the toast.  Later, my mom said that when we'd bring a small problem it would make her try to fix it and she would get really focused on getting her speech back so she could point out the obvious to us.

--We touched her a lot.  We brushed her hair, we put on hand and foot cream, we rubbed her shoulders.  Not with a spirit of this is my next task, but we would slow down and kind of treat her like we would treat a nervous child, slowly and gently. She said later on that she would close her eyes and feel peaceful when we brushed her hair. 

--Read to her.  It's one of the few things that both of you can enjoy.  

My mom got through all her strokes.  While she did pass a few months ago, she had two decades of joyful life after having her first stroke.  Hang in there and please do keep us posted on how you're doing.",2020-06-20 14:30:26,howweusedtowas,hcr8n8
,Recovering from tumor removal?,"I don't post often and I'm on mobile. Please excuse formatting and lack of Reddit etiquette in general. In desperate for some help or guidance. 

My mom (60 years old) finally got a huge tumor removed from her rectum after years of doctors missing it. It was causing very excessive bleeding and just overall uncomfort. Finally she was diagnosed with a prolapsed uterus and was finally able to get an appt to have it fixed. Once she was under anesthesia, they noticed the growth and couldn't proceed. The doctor told her he was 99.999 % sure it was cancerous and after weeks of stress, angst, preparation, and planning we found out it was not. It was hard to schedule an appointment for surgery for removal due to pandemic. Finally she was able to get surgery. I was elated that she was not going to be in pain anymore. But now she's seemingly worse. She has not had a bowel movement in over a week and after getting probed by the doc yesterday she's in more pain than ever. It's hard to get a hold of anyone who can help because of the pandemic. Everyone is busier than normal. And a lot of people(doctors)  not even in town. (We live in a tiny Town where doctors usually come once a week or so to handle business) 

She's in more pain than I can stand seeing her in. I'm doing everything for her. And it's starting to rlly take a toll on my mental health. I'm almost 30 female currently unemployed (thanks covid) with a tiny savings no income, no kids and single. I'm finding myself in a dark place. And I just feel so helpless. 

First things first: does anyone have any advice for the recovery process for my mom?","I found this, I hope it helps.

,Suddenly primary c/g for FIL with dementia,"Hi, newcomer here. Very new - my sweet mother-in-law who was also my best friend passed away suddenly 2 weeks ago. My father-in-law (Pop) is disabled with a rebuilt shoulder, steel cage around his spine and having suffered numerous strokes - he also has dementia. We're very close and I currently work from home so it was natural for me to become his caregiver. Our permanent plan is for him to move in with us in NC, he's in VA right now. We will not be doing this quickly in order to not overwhelm him so for the time being I'm staying with him while my family is at our home and back to regular work.

Y'all this is so hard. I only just went back to work Tuesday, I have a pretty demanding full time job. His dementia is pretty mild, but he does require 24/7 care and supervision. Trying to work 8 hours and help him, take care of their dog, make sure he eats, takes medicine, doesn't wander off or try and take his truck and leave is just... a lot harder than I had hoped.

I've spent the last 3 days in an epic panic attack trying to keep everything up. The slightest thing will make me sob. I miss my friend and Momma. I know we will settle in more and it will get easier but I'm just so scared right now about how I will maintain an income and still take the best care of him and be his companion.

I just came to vent a bit to some folks I'm sure would understand. Happy to hear any advice or words of encouragement! Thank you.","What a horrible situation to have suddenly thrown on you.  Would you be able to take the distributor cap off his truck, so you can enable it if you need to drive it, but it's undriveable otherwise?  And maybe get an alarm on all the doors so you can know if he leaves the house?
Check out the home care situation in NC.  Even though you work from home, you're going to need a regular break where you can get out of the house.   [https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/daas](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/daas)  should have all the relevant information.  

  I'm sole caregiver for my husband, who has had numerous strokes, has dementia, and can't get out of a chair by himself, so I know where you are.  It's a tough place for both of you.  The good news is it gets easier once things settle down.  I grew up on a farm and had a horse, so I was already used to large animal care with all its sanitary challenges. (Walk in shower is a necessity).
My standard answer is: Talk to an elder care attorney. They will have a better handle on his and your rights.
Hey u/dbsgirl, I'm sorry for your loss. I can imagine how  overwhelming it must feel to manage caring for your FIL, your job, and  everything else. It's thoughtful and compassionate of you to think about  how to make things easier for your FIL. 

I  suggest looking into your local Area Agency on Aging to find local  resources. You should be able to find that here for North Carolina: [https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/aging-and-adult-services/adult-day-services/daas-area-agencies-aging](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/aging-and-adult-services/adult-day-services/daas-area-agencies-aging)

You  can call to find out what resources are available to you (e.g. things  like respite care, homemaker services, transportation, and caregiver  support groups/therapy). That last one is important. Please take care of  yourself. Support groups and therapy, both online and in-person,  provide a safe space to talk openly and cope with these challenges. It  can really make a difference. 

If you need help while you're still in Virginia you can find the local Area Agency on Aging here: [https://www.vda.virginia.gov/aaamap.htm](https://www.vda.virginia.gov/aaamap.htm)

Hope that is helpful, feel free to message me with any other questions. ",2020-06-19 09:50:38,dbsgirl,hc10xk
,Group home for adults with DD - activities?,"So I work with five adults with DD. They’re all at an increased risk for complications if they were to contract covid. My program manager is trying to relax the restrictions for them (they’ve been home except for one on one walks and van rides), suggesting trips to the store one on one and visits with family. 

I personally think this is a terrible idea since cases are still on the rise in my state and everyone I care for is elderly. Additionally they have a difficult time keeping masks on, maintaining distance, and not touching their faces. So I have been tasked with keeping the folks occupied during the day.  

The problem is that the activities I’m doing (coloring, puzzles, exercise, bingo) are what they were already doing in their day programs. Most of the time they are uninterested. They simply want to be in the community and spending their own money.  

I’m at a loss. Can anyone offer any guidance or suggestions?","I work in the exact same setting and have been having the exact same problems! Most of my residents are slipping into dementia as well and all they care about in the world are their day trips, but they’ve been stuck inside since March :/ I started looking into caregiving for adults with DD AND dementia and found that doing activities which engage their logical/reasoning thought processes should improve mood swings and depression, if done consistently. So I started looking into educational kids toys. I got pop-up books with big, colorful pictures. I got toddler’s jigsaw puzzles and I’ve been trying to teach them how to fit the pieces together. I got a Simon says game with those flashing lights and they all just love it. I’m still looking for more but basically the point is to actually get them using their mind for problem solving rather than just distracting them with mindless stuff! I hope this helps :)
If there are parks that are closed locally, you could contact your local Parks and Rec department and ask if they could open one for Seniors to hike through.  An hour wandering through a fenced rose garden or succulent enclave might be just the thing... and you could coordinate with other homes so that they get the mornings, you get lunchtime, and then another home gets the afternoon... and the Ranger only has to open/close one gate, once.",2020-06-16 14:18:59,,ha9h6y

,"Care user refusing their medication, just had the police visit because a family member that they're being safeguarded from reported them missing; care user tried telling the police we haven't given him his medication. Should we be concerned?","There are 9 of us in a hotel that's being used as a care facility during the covid pandemic in the UK, caring for 3 service users. One user has tried to hide medication on one occasion and outright refused to take it on others. Luckily the police were understanding as we gave them some info about how he has been since he has been here and we're currently giving him meds from a blister pack from before he came here as he hadn't been taking them, he is abusive to staff in a few ways, but everyone has remained completely professional and the senior carer herself who is effectively our boss here has had him refuse his medication with herself administering it, and he went as far as threatening to have her sacked. Him trying to get us in trouble has raised concerns for us all. We can't record interactions, and have essentially no evidence to back us up. The general understanding is that the service user is always believed over the care giver.

TL:DR abusive care user threatened to get people fired, and refuses his meds, and at his first opportunity seeing the police tried to tell them that we're not giving them to him.

Can anybody who has had this problem before give any advice on how they handled the situation?","Can you use a notebook to just document? It can be very basic. We used to do this with a client that was frequently violent and almost always refused care. We would just say what we offered, if it was refused, any important details.

,A Safe Space for Mental Health Caregivers,"Hi everyone,

I’m the caregiver to my fiancé with a psychotic disorder - and a professional in the psychological field. I’ve been using reddit for about a year and have been pretty involved with a lot of the mental health threads and have found so many caregivers searching for resources, hope and experience. 

Awhile back I posted asking what caregivers for individuals with mental health need in terms of support and got some answers. I’ve built a blog with permission and involvement with my fiancé with the goal of creating a safe space for mental health caregivers. People can communicate with one another, find resources and hope with one another. I plan on it covering everything from our experiences with SSI and how to navigate that process, to day to day stressors and coping skills for mental health caregivers, to how to manage hospitalizations and avoid some of the awful experiences that can come with it. Reddit has been a huge resource for me, but I’ve seen that a lot of people really need some hope that it gets better in responses I’ve received and if I can help give back by providing some insight and hope to people who need it I want to do it.

The blog is live at astoriedmindandthe.wixsite.com/website

So far there’s only one introductory post and a second post about managing expectations in day to day experiences will go live tomorrow morning around 9am EST. 

If this can help anyone I will be thrilled, we all need support and if this can encourage caregivers to connect with one another and be a solid support system that’s all I want.",,2020-06-06 14:13:36,Pandaswife95,gxw11e

*\*You're not obligated to come every week, you can contact me the week-of and I will give you login information and you can just join as you please each week - but please commit to the whole session which will last from 7-8:30 pm EST\**

So this was born out of my 'Ask the Good Death Doula' Event last night. It seemed one of the most poignant moments was the moment of silence when I held space for myself and the participants to feel grief: for whatever and whomever they may be grieving in that moment .

I realize something I \*CAN\* do right now is hold space for people of all communities dialoguing about our grief and mortality; which makes perfect sense, because that's kind of my specialty, and seems to be in great need right now.

*I may not understand each individual, and each community's unique experiences, but I understand how to support people through grief and I understand how to hold space - and I understand how to know when \*I don't know,\* and how to learn.*

,Any tips or tricks to help convince an old lady she needs to either take a shower or let me clear her?,"My mother has not showered in almost two weeks. I live in a world of horrible smells now. I have been trying for days to convince her to shower, she claims she needs no help, she has everything set up to do it as easily as possible in her shower and has been up until this last stint but no matter how I have tried over days upon days to convince her to let me help her or just try herself she refuses. I am lost.","Set her up for success.  Take away her day clothes and lay out sponge, towel, and make it easy for her to just step in as soon as she wakes up.  If you see her when she wakes up, tell her you'll have her (favorite food) ready for when she's out of the shower.
I had to navigate this issue too. Don’t give her a option, just take her in the bathroom and just say this is what we need to do. Remind her how warm the water is an how good it will feel. I would trade showers for desserts. Or tell her if we shower we can go get a dessert somewhere fun. Trade for something she likes and work it back into your routine. Baby steps 1x a week. Then add another day. Good Luck, if all else fails car air fresheners smell good.
Thank you for taking such good care of your mom.  I know it's hard.  Hang in there, and don't forget to treat yourself sometimes.",2020-06-05 18:16:34,WeAreClouds,gxed3d
,Saying goodbye to someone you've been caring for as an HHA,"I had previously been caregiving for 2+ years, but mostly just part time on weekends. Around March, I was laid off from my main 9-5 job and thus picked up as many caregiving shifts as I could to fill the void.

Fellow caregivers who work as HHAs, how do you mourn the loss of a client when they pass away? Sometimes it can seem quite unexpected, albeit yes, people who require caregiving are certainly vulnerable to passing away; even though you still wish you perhaps got to spend just a bit more time caring for that person. I was with a client for just a bit over two months and although it's not nearly as long as I've been with some others and yes, they're were very very old (over 100), I am still very saddened by their passing.

My question is, how have you worked to find closure from a client's passing? I very much valued the time I spent with them, albeit I don't feel close enough where I should attend a funeral or anything, particularly with everything going on in the world right now. How do you mourn a client's passing? I keep googling and looking for the obituary. Yes, death is a natural part of life - particularly when someone is over 100, but it's still very very hard.","As a caregiver, you are in very close contact with the person for, you are literally taking care of them.  You become a “member” of the family.  You develop a bond with the person you care for, so of course you mourn when they die.  It really doesn’t matter how long you cared for them or their age, once that bond has formed, it’s a hard blow when they’re gone.  In normal times. I’ve attended funerals of people I cared for, the family expected me to be there.  The longer you are a caregiver, the easier each death will be.  Not much easier, but a little bit.",2020-06-04 17:52:52,,gwr59y

,Can I afford a caregiver?,My grandmother is getting to the point where she needs more care at home. Shes pretty independent but just needs help with cleaning and cooking and someone to keep an eye out for her for the most part. I have offered to let her live with me multiple times but she refuses. I am pretty sure she doesn't want to feel like shes causing me more stress even though I am already stressed because I worry about her by herself. I am also angry that none of her kids are stepping up to help. As an alternative I have been thinking of trying to get her a caregiver during the day. I think I would rather have a private caregiver who I will thoroughly vet than go through an agency because I feel like agencies probably cost more. (My grandma does not have a lot of assets to sell to pay for care.) I have been asking around for advice on what types of costs I am looking at but haven't gotten any definitive answers. My coworker says she does private pay to a family friend for her mom and pays them $15 an hour. I feel like if I paid less than that it wouldn't be quality care? Does everyone do private pay? I live in central Florida.,"Her insurance may cover an aide.
Reach out to local county services.  They will know what's available and help you find a solution, maybe just meals delivered occasionally, a ranking/history of care services, etc.
But don't be surprised if she doesn't want a ""stranger"" in her home.
Do you have any nursing programs at universities or community colleges in your area? A lot of students preparing to graduate are looking to get practical experience before needing to apply for jobs, and they are usually willing to accept less per hour because they aren't quite as skilled and it's good experience for them. It might be a good fit for your grandmother, if she's only needing minimal assistance right now.
http://elderaffairs.state.fl.us/doea/arc.php

I would apply for Medicare elderly wavier program.
There are income and financial resources limits but they provide certain amount of home aide health and other programs.

Each state program varies but are pretty similar. You will to provide the state with a list of income, properties and other resources she may have.
Most insurance plans do not cover this type of care, though there are a few that do. If she or a spouse ever served in the military she may be eligible for benefits there. I'm also in Central FL (Lakeland) and we used the private route for a bit and ended up with an agency because it made more sense and seemed the safer more convenient route. Be very careful about who you hire. There are some great people who work outside of agencies and if that best suits you there is nothing wrong with it if you approach it the right way, but you should be aware of the following:

* You are responsible for their payroll taxes, even if they are an independent contractor, once the amount you pay them in any fiscal year goes above a certain amount (somewhere in the neighborhood of $1500).
* Make sure anyone you hire is properly insured for this type of work. This protects you and them. If they injure themselves while caring for you grandmother you could be held liable. 
* Make sure the person you hire is completely background checked. It's not a hard process. Get references and check them.
* Provide your caregiver with a written agreement. Again, to protect them and you. Everyone will know what is expected and there will be no surprises.
* A consideration: If the personality of a caregiver does not suit you or grandma, if you are using an agency it is an easy fix. They send someone else. Also, if your caregiver calls out sick, the agency will send someone to fill in. With a private person you are just out of luck. That was a big reason we made the switch. In the end, we ended up with loving caregivers that were a perfect fit for our family and the agency handled all of the headaches.

I've been doing this for 27 years and have seem all kinds of crazy situations. People are always well intentioned and when there is a problem it is usually because of something they simply were not aware of, so just look at the pros and cons of each scenario and decide what is right for you.

There may be local programs that offer limited home care if your grandmother qualifies. You can also look into programs for meal delivery, transportation to medical appointments and more. I publish a senior resource guide for Polk County. [wwwPolkElderCare.com](https://wwwPolkElderCare.com). There is a lot of good information there you will benefit from.

Also, you should connect with your area agency on Aging because they can connect you to so many community programs that could be helpful at low/no cost and they can help you find out what benefits your grandmother might be eligible for. If you are in the Orlando area your agency is the Senior Resource Alliance -   [http://www.sraflorida.org](http://www.sraflorida.org/) 

If you are in the Tampa area, your agency is The Senior Connection Center -  [https://seniorconnectioncenter.org/](https://seniorconnectioncenter.org/) 

Outside of Central FL, in case anyone else is interested, you can search for your agency by city and state here -  [https://eldercare.acl.gov/Public/index.aspx](https://eldercare.acl.gov/Public/index.aspx) 

Hope that helps! Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
Look into care.com. You post what kind of help you are looking for and interested candidates send in their info for you to review online. No names or contact info needed other than an email address (as I remember). If you decide to pursue further is up to you.
Is she on disability? A hospital social worker may be able to help sort out what care she can afford and find insurance options which can help.
If she's independent, make sure she is comfortable with a in-home caregiver
I worked in a group home for years and also helped care for both my grandmother and my mother-in-law toward the end of their lives. I currently help two separate elderly ladies through care.com.

I know your post is about a month old, but if you do go the private route, like through care.com, if your grandmother doesn't feel comfortable having someone right there with her all the time (if there's space) maybe the caregiver could hang out in a different part of the house so your grandmother still feels like she has privacy. It's kind of like hiring a personal cook, in a way, with the added bonus of knowing someone is there, just in case. 

Hope all is going well & best of luck!",2020-05-31 15:49:20,CornIzGud,gu5lsm

I've taken her to a neuropsychologist and her physician, she's on meds that are supposed to help (I haven't seen it yet), but it's getting worse. 

Her memory loss is all short-term. She knows who she is, who her family is, remembers all of her childhood, her marriage, my and my sisters childhood, and mostly everything up until about a year ago. Things start getting fuzzy for her then. (That was before we got her into AL.) She's basically having oodles of trouble making new memories. Hard to predict whether something will stick. Like she knows the names of her CNA's at the AL facility, despite having only met them in the last few months. But she doesn't remember being hospitalized last year, doesn't remember why she's in AL, and sometimes she'll call me for a fourth time at 6 PM because she's forgotten that she's already called me at 10 AM, 1 PM, and 2:30 PM. 

I'm not here looking for a diagnosis. I'm looking for resources for help/guidance for myself and my sisters and how to deal with an aging parent experiencing this kind of short-term memory/memory creation issue.

* [Positive Approach to Care:](https://teepasnow.com/) Teepa Snow is amazing. her web site will be helpful, but you'll also want to search for her videos on YouTube. I've had the opportunity to attend two seminars of hers and her teaching really helped.

Best of luck to you!
I'm sorry, this is very difficult.  There is no way to fix the problem, but there are things you can do to treat the symptoms.  

If she calls you for the same thing every time, put a whiteboard up above her phone which has the answers she needs to hear.   If she forgets why she's in AL, you know what the best answer is for that, probably ""You're recovering, you'll go home soon"" and put that on the whiteboard.
If there is a teaching hospital or other large medical facility, call and ask if they have a family support group or a geriatric department that can guide you.  A local neurologist's office will also have referrals.   I've found the local (well, an hour away) group at our major university to be a life saver in terms of understanding what to expect, and even how to think about things.  I haven't reached the stage you mentioned, but talked the other day with several people who are going through similar things and they really seemed to be helping each other.

Edit: I should clarify - ask if they have a support grp for dementia related issues. I'm sorry if I sounded too general.",2020-05-29 18:50:40,authorious,gt33s1

Definitely call someone even if it’s just an able bodied neighbor, unless the fall was more drastic requiring you to call an ambulance. I know it’s not what your mother wants, it’s for her own good. Also, depending on your mother’s health insurance, you can get a wheelchair or transition chair at little to no cost to you.
You need to get a hospital social worker to come and discuss options and possibilities with Medicare, insurance, and disability. You may be able to get necessary equipment which can help a lot, such as beds, wheelchairs, sit to stand machines, and other equipment. Also, getting a emergency call button (such as lifeline) she can wear will give her confidence that if you aren’t there she can still get help. Her insurance may be able to get her some caregivers to come and take shifts to help out.",2020-05-29 15:19:09,WeAreClouds,gszc07
,Tired and resentful,"I have been the sole caregiver to my 86 year old Grandmother for the past six months whilst also studying for entry to university and over the last few weeks, I have been feeling increasingly resentful towards her and my mother. I don't feel that they care about me at all.

 Over the last month, I have coordinated her move into a more suitable house. I've also been very busy with college work as my course has had to finish two months early because of this sodding coronavirus, which has stopped me from being able to actually go to college (or work, for that matter) and has left me completely isolated from my friends. I've been doing all of this on top of providing the daily care that my grandmother needs. 

The problem is the way that my mother and grandmother treat me, they are just so rude and dismissive to me as a person. Whenever I was doing my college work or just taking some time out they would say that I was lazy and selfish. If I ever try to mention going to University they just dismiss it and say that I should go back to working in one of the factories in town, but I'm too lazy to do any ""real"" work. Yesterday, they said that I should be homeless if not for them and that I might have been a better person if mum had throw me out when I was 18. I've grown to hate the way my grandmother calls for me when she needs something, it's like she's calling a dog. 

I'm supposed to be going to university in Septemberto study nursing, but the first trimester is going to be online now and it's not clear if the accommodation hall will be open before January. I had decided that I was leaving for University in September and I really don't want to be stuck here til January. I want to get out now and start a new life far away from here. 

There isn't really a point to this post, I just wanted to get that off my chest.","I’m really sorry you’re being treated this way. I don’t have much to offer except being a caregiver is very hard and will burn you out quickly. I hope you can become self-sufficient, so that you can have your freedom. Also, it seems your mom has a problem with you being there which I think they will appreciate your help more once it’s no longer available to them. Remember, self-care is important amidst studies and waiting on others. I wish you the best.
I went through (almost) the same kind of situation. When I took care of my mom I began to get really resentful and angry because she would boss me around with little to no regard to how I felt. At one point I was doing full time college, part time work, and taking care of her. I remember her asking me to move around my work schedule and saying that I ""didn't even work a lot anyways"" so it wouldn't matter if I had to rearrange everything just for her. She made comments about me barely doing anything sometimes and meanwhile I was exhausted from working, going to school, and taking care of her 24/7. I hated when she called my name as well. We got her into a nursing home last year and she  passed away about two weeks ago. Even though I often felt resentful or was so exhausted from doing everything for her - I miss her indescribably. I feel like the time I took care of her went by so fast. The time you have right now is all you have with your family and things can change suddenly. It's ok to feel angry and resentful, but remember those feelings (hopefully) won't last forever.
I'm so sorry they can't see how wonderful you are. Their behavior is abusive. I wonder if you can get help on a counseling forum.
Weird how so many families are mean to the caregiver.  It only gets worse.  I'm happy for you that you want to get away.  Best of luck in school.

,Nutrition Drink Advice?,"My mom isn't really eating or holding down food right now, so I'm looking for a good nutrition drink that she could use to supplement the little that she does eat. She tried Ensure but doesn't like the taste so she won't drink it. Any good-tasting **non-dairy** suggestions that we can try?

Thanks for the help!","Hopefully, you’ll get more advice, since Ensure is the only one I know.  Just wanted to mention that my Dad didn’t like the taste either, so we made milkshakes with it.  It’s a good way to pack in calories.  Ensure, milk, ice cream, and whatever her favorite flavor is.  We made all kinds of fruit shakes, peanut butter (with PB powder), malted, even coffee (with espresso powder mixed in the milk first).  If she’s not eating, any calorie is a good calorie, so don’t limit her to healthy choices.  For some reason, sweet seems to be the prominent taste.
Two options - The magic bullet type knockoffs are less than $20 you can mix ( frozen berries bananas  and juices) you can make chocolate peanut butter oatmilk, bananas and chocolate - so many variations tomato or ease broccoli soup erc- next I don't know how you are for finds and groceries but a juicer can be very healing you have to juice a lot like a bag of carrots and celery and apples cal last 2 days and you clean it out after but people swear or heals all kinds of ailments and your own skin can glow if you get into it with her 
Finally - Orgain or muscle milk ( you can ask the pharmacist ) also I like the ones I scoop myself like protein greens powders - I just got one from amazon there are lots to choose from - err sorry your mom is not doing well she is so lucky to have you
Boost Juice.  You can get it on Amazon  and many pharmacy's carry it.    it comes in 3 flavors, orange, grape and peach i think.
You could also try non dairy protein powders, vegan ones should be completely without dairy. Mixing that with other foods and/or supplements (with doctor’s clearance) could help and possibly be cheaper in the the long run.",2020-05-27 22:50:14,Monkeysloth2,gry0j5
,Help me..pleasee,"



Hey... My moms been in hospital in and out a lot. She's had multiple surgeries and complications. They want her on IV food liquid diet now (TPN) so they want her to go to a ""skilled nursing facility"" for 4 weeks until she heals which is like a nursing home right? But I'm scared because those places are having a lot of coronavirus right? Like people dieing left and right in nursung homes (in the US) She is high risk.. I'm terrified.

I'm my only support. No other family.
They wont let me tour the nursing places because Covid. and in our state its not required for them to tell how many cases they have in the homes. They are allowed to lie. and most do. because of money.

 They are getting sued right now because of lying to families about how many cases they have. The only thing I can base a decision on is Google reviews.
Its trouble because the doctor recommends it for short term (4 weeks) because shes on IV Nutrition and they need to monitor her electrolyte and other levels constantly, and she has a WoundVac which is a machine that sucks a large open wound closed so it can heal.

But when I tried to work with the Home Health nurses at home, it was a living hell because it kept malfunctioning. Day and night.
Im just so torn because I work, but it is a lot of complications and cumbersome to deal with alone at home..The nurses kept having to come back every 4 hours to fix it because the machine kept malfunctioning. everyday..and now she'll gave an IV that requires extra troubleshooting.

I really dont want my mom to die..she is extremely high risk if she does get COVID..They are waiting for me to make a decision as shes mentally not competent.

Maybe I should quit my job and take care of her at home fulltime?....Please help me...","SNIFs have trained professionals, which is obviously what your mom needs with her problems and tricky machinery.  Get her into a SNIF as soon as possible: the sooner she's in, the soonner she's out. 

If you quit your job, you'll be home with no support and terrified of any in-home help because of C19 in what's probably one of the worst recessions/depressions we're going to see in our lifetimes.  

Stay employed.  Find a way to get training on her new equipment/meds if you can before she comes home.  Get your in-home support ironed out now, ahead of time, so everything is ready for her when she comes home.
My mother is in a SNF and they are taking serious precautions much more than she or I could at home. Unfortunately it is lonely for her but she's not gotten the disease yet.  A few under 1% of residents did test positive for covid19 but they have all recovered, average age around 85.

 I got this SNF recommendation from an Attorney who has customers in many of these assisted living places, so she has seen them from the inside.
If she needs care that you can't provide yourself, then she needs to be in the skilled nursing facility. Yes, it's scary right now but I'm pretty sure most place are taking the threat very seriously and have all the precautions and protocols in place to make it as safe as possible.

Don't quit your job. You can't be without an income right now.

Let the professionals do their job and trust your doctor's advice.
I think your biggest problem here is your own feelings of guilt.  I get that: I've been caring for my husband post-stroke for 15 years, 6 years intensely.  I can't be everything to him, and I feel bad about it, but I do my best.  You have done all you can do at home: she needs more than you can provide now.  I know you are afraid for her, but imagine if she died at home from a technical mishap?  She needs a snf.  And that's okay.  You're an awesome daughter.  Get her (and you) the help she needs.",2020-05-22 02:20:26,tocopheryl-acetate,godzc5
,For those of you who needed to start working from home - how did you find work?,"I'm a teacher, but my wife is at the point where it is absolutely within the realm of possibility that I'll need to quit my job unless she starts getting better. Currently, my job provides a lot of financial stability for us because I'm salary paid, but if I need to quit and work from home in order to stay with her all the time, I'm not sure how I am going to be able to have an income. So, for those of you have done this (or have ideas), if I need to work from home how do I find a job that accommodates that?","this is a big question with lots of possible answers!  Depending on your skillset, it can be easy or hard.  Some jobs are more in demand working from home than others.  And even though you’re a teacher, don’t limit yourself to just finding teaching jobs.

At first, start searching on your regular job hunting sites for: “online”, “work from home”, and “remote”.

On craigslist, indeed.com, and all the other sites, don’t just search in your area - search in some of the big cities (it is a work from home position, after all!) and look for those keywords.

You’ll find some scammy looking job posts, and many posts for tech support positions for which those employees would need to “support users remotely” (ironically, even though that support job itself may not be a work from home position).

The Penny Hoarder blog has some wonderful posts about how to avoid the sketchy jobs/companies, and fascinating lists of legitimate work from home companies and job posting sites.  In their blog postings, also search for “side gigs” or “on the side income”.  Some of the suggestions, although legitimate, don’t pay well at all - some of them are things that you’d do while waiting in line somewhere, when you really have nothing else to do - avoid those.  That’s like picking up all the pennies you find on the street.  But some of the suggestions are actually great.  They write about everything in a really upbeat way, which is nice, but some of the jobs they talk about are not THAT easy to break into right away.  Just a word of caution.

Flexjobs.com is a yearly subscription ($50?) for lots of postings, all legitimate, most are work from home, lots if search filters, and searching is free.  They seem to have a lot of online teaching jobs, FYI.

idealist.com is a lovely place to find meaningful work, and they have a separate “remote possible” search selection criteria.  (I wonder if more sites will start doing that now?  that would be nice!)

Tutoring jobs can pay well, but you might need many individual students to make the same pay on salary.

If you’re working for a company that provides you with clients/work for you, you’re all set.  If you work on your own, you’ll need to set aside some of your “work” time for “finding work” - you will have to advertise a bit to get clients, basically (imagine posting a “tutor available” sign on a campus bulletin board, just many times over!).  Look online for advice on finding clients, self-employment, running your own business, entrepreneurship, and marketing yourself.

And, lastly, about practical things, make sure you have a good computer and internet connection!

One BIG THING to remember is that although you’re working from home and would be more available to your wife, you are still WORKING.  So YOU have to set the boundaries on time spent working and time spent being available to your wife.  If she’s totally fine doing her own thing for most of the day, you’ll have it easier.

Guilt in these situations can be a big factor for some people: guilt at not spending as much time with your loved one as they want, or you want, or you think you should.  Just because you’re at home does NOT mean you’re ACTUALLY available 24/7.  Your work still has to get done, because someone’s still expecting you to put in the hours and deliver on something.

Please read up on suggestions for work-life balance when working from home!  (there’s lots on the internet for this, it’s a big issue!)

What you’re planning, even though it may not seem like it, could be lke any other job change - it might take more time and effort than you expect, so go easy on yourself!!

And reddit has other subs that are helpful and encouraging for job changes, career changes, looking for work, specific careers, etc.

I wish you the best of luck!  I had to decrease my own hours and ultimately switch careers (to a much lower paying one) to be available at home more often for my parent.  But it’s worth it.",2020-05-15 21:50:45,pjsans,gkmbhf
,My mother is in ICU and I can’t visit,"I am the full time caregiver to my mother because insurance won’t cover skilled care. She has a myriad of health issues, but is the most caring and patient woman I’ve ever met.

This morning as I was getting her dressed, she seemed out of it. Usually she anticipates our next step as this has been our morning routine for almost 2 years. I did a basic stroke assessment and when I discovered she couldn’t feel her right leg called 911. Initially, they said I couldn’t go to the ER to give her history. Then an EMT said I was able after they contacted the ER since I know her history, which is extensive. 

By the time she got back from her CT, her right leg and hand was paralyzed and she has no feeling on the entire right side of her body. She’s confused but alert. Then I got the inevitable diagnosis: brain bleed. Going to ICU where no visitors are allowed due to covid. 

She’s had many hospitalizations before and I’ve always been there. The times she’s had altered mental status, I’ve been there to repeatedly tell her what’s going on and reassure her when she’s scared. She can’t even use her call button due to paralysis. She just had a nurse call me and she keeps forgetting her diagnosis and doesn’t know why I’m not there. 

If this is her time to go, I don’t want her to be alone. I don’t want her to lose even more awareness and think she’s just dying without loved ones who couldn’t care less. I just want to be there for her.

My entire adult life I’ve had to be her advocate through our terribly flawed healthcare system. And I’ve been her primary caregiver for the past 2 years since she can no longer stand. I just don’t know what to do now. Any prayers, positive energy or support would be appreciated. Thanks for reading.","I'm so sorry! I know several others who are dealing with this now also. I know there are no words that can make this any easier for the two of you, but I'm sending positive thoughts your way and wishing your mom comfort and peace. What a lucky mom she is to have a devoted daughter like you <3
Did you speak to the hospital administrator or director of nursing? The hospital I work at isn't currently allowing visitors, except for a few exceptions. If a patient has altered mental status, dementia, confusion, etc. and really needs their family member we will let a family member stay if they pass the screening process.  Doesn't hurt to ask and explain the situation

I'm so sorry and I am praying for you and your mom.  I am my husband's caretaker and have to do the same thing; he is disabled and doesn't remember all his medical history and can't articulate what he needs.  He had to go to the ER recently and I couldn't go with him.  It was really scary, and he didn't get the treatment he needed because he couldn't explain all of his history and conditions.  (Thank God it wasn't serious that time.). It has to be terrifying and heart-wrenching for you.  You said your mom is religious, so take comfort in the fact that she has comfort in her Lord and doesn't feel as alone with her faith.
I'm so sorry that you are going through this. For what it is worth (and I hate that I can't do more), you have my thoughts and prayers, friend.
Type out his medical history and list of medications. With your phone number in bold. Have copies ready in case you need to call 911. You can jot down the circumstances for the specific call on the page, too.
Pin one copy to his clothes and hand one to the EMTs. We don’t know how long this pandemic will last and need to be prepared. It’s not as good as verbal discussion but it’s better than nothing. And of course, call the hospital after an appropriate amount of time has passed.

Thank you for the prayers. If anyone is getting into heaven, it’s my mom. Just not sure if now’s the right time for her to go. And if it is I want it to be with the love and dignity she deserves
I'm dealing with the same thing pretty much. Hang in there.",2020-05-12 16:49:39,Shutinneedout,gik354

,Question for those taking care of elderly men.,"My father had a stroke and is now a little paralyzed on his right side. I realized that shaving is a little difficult for him and when I tried, I had to be careful not to nick him. His electric razor no longer works and I want to get him a new one instead of the plastic disposables we use. I'd be open to suggestions! I researched and it looks like the Gillette TREO might be an option.","One of the guys I take care of uses a Philip's Electric dry razor. It's a pretty old version but any with those 3 heads with rings around them are fantastic. I've never gotten any nicks, I only use it on his face.
Norelco is a good brand. They have been around forever. You dont need the fancy ones with tons of bells and whstles.  Just make sure you get one you can use that charges so you can use it without the cord plugged in. Also get one that has a sideburn trimmer that flips down that you can use it on sideburns or maybe some stray hairs here and there.
I guess practice would make it better eventually. Be gentle and take your time with it. Don't be nervous at all. But of you're really looking for a good razor, Giletter Mach 3 turbo could be a good option.",2020-05-08 22:36:44,,gg75xx
,Walking Away From a Toxic Job,"*posting from my phone*
looking for moral support and potential advice


Since graduating, I (25F) exclusively provide daily living assistance to adults with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, and most often physical disabilities as well. It has been my passion, motivation, and HONOR to do so. I have learned so much from my individuals, had countless belly laughs. All of my belly laughs tbh. I have made a network here. A family. My life. My love. 

My kryptonite.

Because this is my passion, I have been taken advantage of by my employers and coworkers since day 1. I have always picked up any slack, and have never complained about doing so. (If anything, I would like to at least oversee how/when certain things are done because a lot of the people who are hired in this field have no medical experience or training whatsoever, not to mention common sense.) I have worked hundreds of hours of OT, if not thousands. I have been mandated through a union, I have provided private care, and child care/less than 24hr care. Like I said, it's been my honor and I've loved every second. But I've only just now realized how much of a doormat I am. 

I've hopped companies 3 times, advocated for their (and my) rights, I have went up and down the ladder, and side to side. It's all the same. These people are not being taken care of properly, if at all. Almost all of them have DHHR appointed guardians, so their veteran caregivers are *essentially* their only ties to a family or social life. 95% of their staff treat them subhuman; harass and berate them almost constantly. Exploit their few necessities and routinely steal their petty cash (big $ is handled by credit unions). 

My managers have effectively used me to resolve potential APS cases, intentionally used me as a scapegoat, and constantly pitted me against my superiors/coworkers. Some individuals who are not being properly behaviorally rehabilitated are having increasingly violent daily outbursts that injure staff, and waste vital emergency services. Months long history of sexual harassment and violence, property destruction, elopement, false accusations, and self harm/suicidal tendencies in individuals. Threatening harm to their own safety, as well as their staff/housemate(s).

I have pages and pages of daily notes on neglect and potential abuse, photos, text messages, and screenshots. All of this has, when discovered, been reported to my superiors in the proper hierarchy. Nothing. I have even went to APS. Case open and closed. I am at an utter loss. I'm about to write a fucking Senator. 

This morning, I texted my (new) supervisor my immediate resignation. I've tried to take the proper avenues, and be the good person I try to be for my individuals - now my mental health is at the end of its perpetual swinging rope. (Yes, I am diagnosed with a mental illness and am being properly and efficiently treated) So, I just had to do it.

I've had a part time job that has morphed into full time, so job searching isn't an issue. 

If I didn't get that off of my chest I might have evaporated.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.","Sending hugs and moral support! I worked a caregiving job temporarily as the same type of group home help which was hired out by my caregiving agency. It was the most toxic place I have ever worked. I still work for my agency in several homes and apartments, but I absolutely refuse to go back to that group home. I had coworkers stealing out of my purse, since there was no lockers to put our stuff in, and I had to report injuries which looked like abuse to my caregiving agency, which led to an investigation of other permanent caregivers at the group homes. Yeah, although they kept trying to increase the pay to get caregivers over there, I refuse to go where it is toxic and I get my money stolen.",2020-05-06 11:42:11,,gemebz
,Questions about SSDI and Medicaid (specifically California's MediCal program),"Hey all,

My brother is disabled and currently taking in about $800/ month from SSDI and on Medicaid (MediCal). He just now became eligible for Medicare (after the two year post accident waiting period) and, as some of you know, Medicare is not cheap. My question, do I have to sign him up for Medicare or can he simply keep is current Medicaid (MediCal) insurance? I very much want to keep him on the Medicaid program as it is much, much cheaper. Obviously, with making $800/ month, he is low income, so I would imagine he could keep Medicaid, but I can't find a good source on the subject. Thanks for the help!","Have you talked with his Medicaid caseworker?  I'm not in CA, sorry, just saw you didn't get a reply yet from someone who is, so I'm just throwing out my experience.  I'm in AZ and my husband has both Medicare and Medicaid, and his Medicaid benefit pays for his Medicare.  His Medicare premium was automatically taken out of his SSDI payment, and when he got Medicaid they took over that payment and he got his full SSDI payment.  Your brother's Medicaid caseworker should be able to answer that I believe.  Good luck!

,Thinking about leaving a client...super unsure.,"Hi, I am a 19 year old student who has been working for a senior company that provides at home care. I have been working for the company for over half a year now and got assigned a regular client once my trainings were over. He is a 74 year old man who I have established a good relationship with. Although there have been a couple of things accumulating over the past few months that have been making me decide if this is a good fit for me. The first few instances would have the be the racist comments my client would make towards Black and Asian people, I explained to him how uncomfortable those type of comments make me uncomfortable & he said he was understanding & apologized for it, although he still makes racist comments just more subtle. He also continues to bring up politics which I mentioned wasn’t allowed to be talked about in the workplace but he ignored that so at this point I let him go on his political rants and I just agree with most of it to avoid disagreements. He has three other roommates in his house who I don’t work for but basically clean up after  they’re all elder as well except one who is in his 30’s so I try and help out a bit for them but it has made them neglect their household duties now that they have me doing their dishes, & cleaning their living and dining room messes. There is another care giver who comes on the weekends which I don’t work and my client doesn’t make her do half difficult duties he makes me do. My client also completely ignores my advice and what I have to say I’ve been trying to encourage him not to eat fatty foods everyday since he loves to go out and have fast food he’s recently trigged c-diff and has had uncontrollable bowls, I’ve suggested a b.r.a.t diet & cutting dairy but he continues to ignore my advice and has been soiling himself & somehow the floor almost everyday from his lack of nutritional care. My partner says that enough is enough and that I should ask for a new client. But I’m not sure if these are good enough reasons to change clients...I feel like it’s time to change clients because all of these things make me dread work but I’m stuck. What would you guys do in this situation? Am I just exaggerating or something?

(Sorry for the terrible grammar and mistakes you’ll find/found not much time to write this before bed🙁)","If you feel the workload is too much for you, you should ask to switch clients.  If you feel that the other housemates are taking advantage of you, I’m not sure what the answer to that would be.  You definitely should talk to the 30 year old, he can pull his own weight, but the other elders may not be able to as much.  You could ask your client to draw up a list of chores for the week, so they can be split between you and the other aide.  Then you would only have to do your share.

But you will never get a client to change their views, no matter what they are. They are usually so deeply ingrained, they don’t even realize what they say.  That certainly doesn’t make it right.  If it bothers you too much, ask to switch to someone else, as that’s probably the only solution.  You can’t tell your client how to talk, or what to do - even if you have their best interests at heart.  This situation just may not be a good fit.

You need to look at the area (I know, the fun never ends) to see what it looks like.  Is there a rash?  Is there a wound?  You need to be able to explain it to the doctor.

,Feeling of anger - 22 Year Old Caregiver,"Hey all. 
Short background, i am a 22 year old male who has been caring for his mum since he was 13. She is a the stage where she cant do much anymore, this includes personal care, food and jobs around the house. I also work full time.

Recently, i have been feeling angry whenever she asks me to do something as i feel it has to be exactly her way, almost using me as her hands and not as someone do just do the job. It frustrates me to no end, silly jobs even like hoovering is annoying me to no end. Jobs where i can be left alone and do entirely by myself, i feel fine doing and i even quite enjoy them. I feel like im developing an aversion to any form of control and someone telling me how to do something, not sure if im just being an asshole.

Our relationship is very very good and we are very close so im not entirely sure why i am acting like this, any insight and tips would be amazing. Tbh i hardly understand why i think the way i do. 

Thanks Everyone","You need to get her into a care facility if you can or have someone to come in.  You are angry because you don't have a life. You are trying to feel your independence as an adult and she is treating you like a kid.  Its your natural response to needing to fly the nest and start your own life.
Not the asshole. You're a loving human being whose space is being invaded. That's a normal reaction. You need space and boundaries.

You're a good person.
I took care of my mom from 12 to 27 (I'm 28 now, and she's in a care home now). It's totally normal to feel angry... Trust me, I was angry all the time. I worked PT, went to school FT, and had to take care of my mom at one point. It sucks, especially when you feel like she can do the things you're asking or you feel she's taking advantage of you, also normal feelings. I started going to therapy which helped. It is a lot of work taking care of a parent, and sometimes you need someone to talk to or help you understand what you're going through.
A little help may be what you need to rekindle that loving desire to care for your mom. Your faithful attention for so many years shows your generosity and selflessness.

,Moving in to care for a parent?,"My father has Alzheimers but is continuing to worsen. We don't want to put him in a home yet (especially not right now) and I'm the closest one that is able to take care of him. I live about 30 minutes away and will likely need to move in with him for the forseeable future until things settle down. 

For anyone who has had to move in to help care for a family member do you have any advice and also is there anything I need to do to update my residence address in case this ends up being longer term? I'm currently renting an apartment so even though I wouldn't be living there it is still under my name.","I lived with my parent when they developed symptoms and cared for them by myself for over 4 years, despite having sibligs nearby. So here's my advice:

You cannot be his caregiver 24/7. You will need breaks, frequently. I'm talking whole days off. You will burn out quickly if you assume you'll be able to do it all. If you can afford a nurse for even one day a week, do whatever you can to do that.

If the house doesn't have an alarm, try to get one. That way if he begins to wander at night you'll be able to hear him leave. We got my parent a activity tracker early on. Some allow you to ""find"" the device using an app on the phone. Install that app on your phone so that if he's wearing the Fitbit you can find that. I would also suggest getting TILE. You can put the fobs inside things that he wears often or on his keys, and then find them later. This was helpful when my parent started hiding things. I also sewed a few in the lining of their favorite purses and wallet. It was extremely helpful when they insisted I stole their wallet, only to find out they hid it in the fridge.

If your father forget something, try not to point out that they forgot it. It really tends to make them angry because it reminds them of their condition. Just get used to repeating yourself. 

Be patient. With him and with yourself. This is a lot to handle. If you can get a therapist or join a support group, please do. It was such a relief to find other people near me who are experiencing the same thing. 

On the legal side of things, you probably need to have power of attorney and he needs to decide his advance directives. You need to make sure to do all this legal stuff while he can still coherently make decisions. How are his finances? He will probably need help keeping up with the bills. you'll probably have to add your name to some of his accounts or at least have access to them. My parent kept opening new accounts because they forgot about the old ones. It was a mess.

Lastly, make sure there are no firearms in the house. A friend of mine had a grandmother who developed Alzheimer's, and they neglected to take her gun saying that she felt safer having it. One day she didn't recognize her nephew when he had to come for a visit and she fired at him. He was okay. but it did make the family realize that they needed to take her gun away. Do a search of your father's house and make sure there are no firearms. Best case scenario he forgets who you are and shoots a warning shot. Worst case scenario... I leave up to your imagination. 

Good luck!",2020-04-24 17:34:29,LaterDistrict,g7h5fj
,Update on Dad,"The last couple days have been really tiresome. I'll start from the beginning.


My dad laid down to go to bed Wednesday evening and around 11:45pm my mom said that he just suddenly shot up and rolled off of the bed. This is immediately concerning because my dad has a bad back and spends most of the time in a wheelchair or using forearm crutches. 


My dad has had 10 (now 11) heart attacks and he has nitro, so he took 2 even though he said his chest didn't hurt. Mom said a few seconds later he was throwing up, and I guess he couldn't stop long enough to catch his breath. My mom called the ambulance and by the time they got here, my dad was back on the bed and he was a really strange color, his lips were discolored, and he could do little more than moan in response to any of us.


The ambulance got him on some kind of oxygen mask and off they went. I waited an hour and then called the ER at about 12:45am and the ER doctor said my dad wasn't stable and that he was pretty sick. He said he had to hang up, but that he'd call me back to talk to me. Half an hour later he did. 


At around 1:30am they put my dad on a ventilator. He was heavily sedated, but his vitals were getting better. He had ""extremely high"" blood pressure (no numbers, but his pressure is normally low) and he wasn't getting enough oxygen. They had found fluid in his heart and lungs, but at the time they didn't think he'd had a heart attack. They had tested him for covid-19 but the doctor said based on his symptoms it was unlikely.


They moved my dad up to ICU after I called around 3am with a report of steadily improving vitals. 


From 4am-6am, there was no change and the ICU nurse said he was stable and told me to go to bed, so I slept for 2 hours before I was up again.


They took dad off the ventilator early yesterday morning, but he's still wearing some kind of breathing aid. He talked to his heart doctor, and they determined that he did have a heart attack -- lucky number 11, right? They have to do a heart cath, but they can't do that until dad's covid-19 results come back along with some strength. 


By the end of yesterday, dad was cracking jokes and asking me to bring him snacks. 


This morning they said it will be at least Monday or Tuesday before they can even consider the heart cath, which means we have to be without him for almost a week. But he is doing okay now and slowly he's getting back to normal. 


He told my mom he was afraid he was going to die, but pappy (his dad, who passed away this past January) was there and told him no. Dad said the first thing that he thought when he woke up was ""fuck, I'm in trouble,"" so he fought. I'm glad he did. 


I'm exhausted now, it's hard sleeping without dad here but I think I feel good enough to do so. Thanks for your kind thoughts and prayers, everyone. Stay safe and healthy. ♡","OMG, my heart goes out to you. I think all/most of us here can relate to that fear you're feeling along with that sensation of being emotionally wiped out. I've been thinking about you since your first post and am glad things seem stable now. Keep getting that rest, if you can. At this point, all you can do is check in periodically with the doctors and wait for time to pass, and the best way to pass time right now is to try to give your mind and body a break. Play chill music, read a book that distracts your mind from the present reality, get a hot shower, drink a glass of water, make sure that you've eaten something even if you have no appetite at all, take a nap. We are all hoping for the best for all of you!",2020-04-24 14:07:36,,g7dbso
,"My dad just had to be taken away by an ambulance. Not sure if this is a heart attack (his 11th, if it is) or what is wrong. He's normally in a wheelchair, and it's usually me encouraging him to do wheelies. I'm a caregiver. I'm terrified. Good thoughts, prayers or whatever you can send please?",,"**Update #1**

My dad was taken away by ambulance at 11:43pm. It's been an hour and I just called the ER. 

They said that they're still working on getting him stabilized, and I don't know if that's normal or not. My dad has congestive heart failure (heart working at 20% functionality), and a very aggressive form of degenerative disc disease. He has had 10 heart attacks within the last 3-4 years. 

We're hoping this isn't number 11.

I guess he's been complaining to my mom -- not me -- about being short of breath the last few days and tonight he was asleep and just suddenly jolted out of bed (which is excruciating for him) and dropped (or fell, idk) onto the floor. He started throwing up and my mom asked if he wanted me to take him to the ER or if she should call the ambulance. He chose 911, which isn't like him at all. 

I've ***NEVER*** in my life seen my dad the way how I did tonight. I am shaken to my core right now. I was able to talk to the doctor that's working on him, but I got ""he's pretty sick"" and nothing more before he had to leave to help my dad. 

I'll update as I know more. This is going to be a really long night.
**Update #2**

I just talked to the doctor, and my dad is really sick. 

They're testing him for CoVID-19 but are doubtful given his symptoms that he's got it. They think it *might* be pneumonia, based on some fluid in his lungs, but they're waiting on more labs. 1 of his heart enzymes are elevated a little bit, but doc said that it was really unlike he'd had another heart attack.

When he got to the ER his blood pressure -- which is normally in the low/perfect range -- was extremely high and his oxygen was extremely low. They think the fluid in his lungs may be the cause, but they don't know. 

They put him on a ventilator, which honestly has me terrified. We can't go see him, and even though he's heavily sedated and wouldn't know if we were there or not, I can't stop thinking about *what if*. 

What if something happens and this was our last time seeing him?

They're moving him to the ICU soon, within the next hour. I'm going to call them in an hour and check since I have their direct line now. Doc said depending on the situation maybe one of us can see him tomorrow.

I can't stop crying. I'm so scared. Please pray with me.
I really hope he’s ok.
This is such a stressful time and can fill you with fear! Lord, please give this loving daughter the peace and confidence that only you can give. Give her the wisdom to know what to do next and the right questions to ask. Let your love come through her so that her dad knows how much you love him. Blessings, Debbie
Prayers that everything will be okay and positive energy being sent your way. I’m so sorry this happened.
Sending prayers for you, your father, and your family!
I hope everything is okay! Praying for your dad, you and your family! <3",2020-04-23 00:06:38,,g6fzcu

Come up with a weekly ""care tracker"". Identify tasks/goals for the caregiver to work on with your parent (like individualservice plan goals), and have them initial off each daily task(s).

,Looking for advice,"So I’m an independent cna for an 85 year old in their home. I’ve still been working normal hours and last Tuesday her daughter called me in the morning to say she was coming to pick up her mom and bring her home. No warning or discussion it just happened and I figured they would keep her there for a bit. So today they called and said they want to bring her back now. I told them that since they are now bringing her back from a large city and made grocery store trips that my client would have to quarantine when she got back to be safe and ensure she isn’t sick. Unfortunately for an elderly person that’s not really possible, being alone for two weeks. But her family doesn’t think quarantine is necessary — they still have her cleaner and other people coming over for errands. Were she to be infected and transmit anything to me, I would then be transmitting to the three people I live with, and the others coming into the house as well. Personally I think she should stay with her family since they decided to travel for Easter weekend, anyone else have input? I don’t know if I’m just being overly cautious/paranoid

Update: thank you everyone for your insight and responses. It means a lot and it much appreciated. I voiced my concerns to the family, who still is determined to bring her back, which they are doing tomorrow. I told them I would need a two week period where I just deliver meals and have no contact. We’ll see how it goes!","Nope, you’re important. Your health matters. I would not take the job. It’s not worth it. Specially, when the city has higher rates of people with the virus.
I would not do it. The family is not acting with caution in regards to others safety. You are important. I would say no and I would report it.
I also wouldn't take the job until after the 2 weeks is up. You have the right to protect yourself since there is no way to know who all she has been exposed to. They should have thought about that before they took her.
Unfortunately you have to assume the housekeepers and those others coming in could have the virus. She obviously can't quarantine every time they come in, so what is the plan? Honestly, you could even have it and not know it and pass to her as well. Again, it's about both of your safety. I'm sure you're using safely protocol and ppe, but what""s the total plan with her? I don't think it's safe to have housekeepers and random people in the house with an 85 yo in the middle of a pandemic unless absolutely, positively essential and I would tell the family that.

You obviously need to protect yourself, but she's the client and at a much higher risk than you. She's not a caregiver, so you're expected to have the knowledge about safety for both of you.

Also, her going with her family is their fault, not hers. If it's appropriate to quarantine her they should make sure she has a personal alarm system (if she doesn't already) to add to her personal safety. Maybe you could offer to be one of the phone contacts in the system.",2020-04-14 02:10:39,velveteen_ant,g105hm
,Is A Break Too Much To Ask For?,I’ve been taking care of my dad for almost two months now. He had a mild stroke and can’t dos stuff for himself. I take care of him alone 24/7. I would love to have a break. I would for someone to stay with him for a few hours. Is it wrong to want a break? I posted about it online {not here} and strangers acted like I’m this horrible person. I was told my boyfriend should break up with me. Why am I so horrible for wanting a break?,"One of the most important things for us caregivers is making time for ourselves, so no, there is nothing wrong with wanting a few hours to yourself.  There will always be trolls online who will go out of their way to make others feel bad, try not to let them get to you, you're doing an amazing job!

Here (Ontario, Canada) there are different groups set up to help with elderly care, and those who have suffered strokes.  They also have a respite program where they can send someone to your house for a few hours every couple of days to give you a break.  Maybe look in your area, and speak to the local doctors, to see if there is anything similar set up to help.
There is nothing wrong with needing a break. It is very important to take care of yourself. Internet trolls are the worst - try not to take their words to heart. It is ok to need a break, or several breaks - do whatever you need to do to take care of yourself. Most people have no idea how difficult caregiving is. They would need a break in your shoes, too.
You are so generous to step into that gap and honor your dad by caring well for him! 

It's so hard for aging parents when their independence is slipping away; it makes them want to hold on tightly to control. 

I read about establishing a family caregiver agreement where you state what you can help with. Then you can ask what else he would like help with (that you are not providing). House maintenance? Yard work? Cleaning? Maybe ease into the more personal items. You may have a list ready of services you think he should hire AFTER he proposes some. 

It all starts with you stating what you are able to provide and going from there.

Blessings to you as you navigate this difficult conversation! Debbie
You have to be kidding me. Those idiots are complete assholes. And ignorant. I've been a caregiver almost 5 years and it is absolutely normal and healthy to have time to live your own life and take breaks. Why do so many people who aren't caregivers think people need to sacrifice all for someone else. That isnt healthy or fair. Get any help you can. Burnout is real. I ended up in the er at age 32. I work full time and take care of my disabled gma. It is hard work.

People online just don't understand until they've been in your situation.

Years ago I posted about my worry that I wouldn't be able to contribute to my IRA while caring for my father.  The most upvoted answer complained that I talked too much about myself and that I should just live my own life instead of caring for my dad.  Complete lack of understanding, just like the responses I'm sure you received.  It's absolutely not wrong to want a break, once you reach out to some local agencies that's one of their main concerns: caring for the caregiver.  Just keep following your heart and doing what you know is right.
You are not being devious enough.  See how many hours Dad would qualify for - almost all insurance coverage some home aides, or he can private pay.  Once that’s figured out - You may have to show Dad that’s he’s wrong, that he’s not as fine as he thinks he is.  Depending on how bad off he is, pick a time to be gone, even a couple hours when he would normally need you there (make sure he’s safe though). Let him see that he can’t get through it alone. Then when you get back, tell him that someone will be coming in xx hours a week because you can’t be there.  Make up some reason to be gone (a class, physical therapy, etc).",2020-04-13 16:28:52,,g0qy5v

,Report or Watch Behavior?,"Hey I’m new here, so I’m hoping this is the right place for this.

\*Background: This is my first job working as a caregiver in an assisted living home. I’m a 22 F with no CNA license, and basically stepped in last minute as an independent contract caregiver for a friend who lost her caregiver suddenly due to medical reasons. All I have to do right now is  sit with her, bring her items, and help her to the bathroom since she is quarantined to her room.  She is still pretty independent and cognizant despite stage one dementia.

\*My dilemma: My first shift was Wednesday. I had minimal information about how the facility operates, and I basically just got the schedule of her day. A male caregiver who works for the facility showed me to her room and sat down for a while chatting with me. I thought  he was just trying to make me comfortable. He was here for about 10 minutes, but he kept coming back every 30 minutes or so to “check in”. He made a comment about how it’s impossible to be fired here, and how he’s cussed out management and never been written up. Also he asked me a lot about my dating life which has historically been a sign of a creep from my experience. Anyways, the last time he came in before his shift was over he stayed for at least 20 minutes, and sat down on the couch with my resident. The  resident made a comment on his buttcrack showing, and then he proceeded to pull his pants down to show more of it saying “Can you see it better now?”

\*I was so shocked I didn’t know what to do. He talked a few minutes longer and then left. I talked with the resident and asked her if she wanted me to report him to her daughter or administration, but she said she didn't want to worry her daughter or cause drama in the home. She wanted to see if he would continue the behavior. I told another caregiver today what had happened, and she told me he shouldn’t have even been sitting in the room longer than to just check her vitals or give her a bath. Apparently he has never caused any trouble before, and is a valued employee because he is strong enough to lift residents for bathing and does maintenance work not required under his job title. This is a small privately run home in a small town, so I doubt anything would be done other than a meeting with him. That is a shitty reason to not report, but there isn't really a way to avoid him since he is the only person she lets bathe her.

\*Do you have any advice/What would you do?



\*Edit:formatting and spelling","I think I might try to intervene next time he does something like that. Tell him to pull his pants up and that it’s inappropriate. And when he stays too long, say something like, “Thanks for checking on her, I’ll call you if Resident need anything else.”

I think I’d find it hard to go behind the back of the person you’re taking care of and report it to the facility when they explicitly asked you not to, because they likely have very little control over their own circumstances and this is one thing they can control.
As a former caregiver supervisor, document everything.  Just like a note in your phone or on paper after you leave shift. Honestly it sounds very much like he’s just trying to creep on you and using your resident as an excuse. It’s also not a good sign that he feels like it’s ok to share that he is disrespectful to superiors. In my experience, if someone thinks they can get away with inappropriate behavior it will only continue to get worse. If it does, you may need to report him. 

As a caregiver, there are personal boundaries that shouldn’t be crossed, in the name of professionalism. Even without your CNA, you are a caregiving professional and have the responsibility to protect your client if behavior like this on his part continues. 

I would also gently reach out to your friend and ask if she ever had any other interactions like this. A lot of time it gets swept under the rug because the offending employee has senior status or is considered valuable for the reasons you listed. That doesn’t mean it’s ok.

There’s a high risk for elder abuse within the industry and even if he was trying to make a joke in poor taste, but it also reads like he may be counting on the fact that her memory disorder and unwillingness to rock the boat will keep her from making trouble.

In the end it comes down to his being inappropriate on a professional level... it made you uncomfortable and it made your client uncomfortable and that’s not ok. Also, think about it in the context as if it were a daycare center and a little kid made a silly comment about someone’s buttcrack showing, would it be ok if that person in turn pulled their pants down? 

Memory disorders essentially remove many of the social boundaries that people have as adults. People forget that being elderly does not mean you have to put up with people’s BS. Chances are your client wouldn’t have made that comment before her memory started to decline, but since she did now she has to see more of something that made her uncomfortable in the first place? I’m honestly pretty appalled and if I were his supervisor it would be time for a serious chat. 

Good luck and feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
Unfortunately caregiving is a under appreciated job and because of that you meet some of the worst people you can try reporting him but I have seen some serious shit and nothing ever happened when I brought it up to my supervisor wish you luck you are one of the good ones.",2020-04-10 10:00:20,letsanalyzethat,fygb2u
,I made a song for us,"Hi community. I cared for my mom during her decade with early-onset AD--she was diagnose when I was 20 and passed away when I was almost 30. The entire time she was sick, I played music for her and with her. In the end of her life, she didn't know me as her daughter, but she still knew my songs (I had recorded my first CD in 2014 right in the middle of caring for her, and she memorized the songs and never forgot them). It turned out that the same month she passed away, I began a graduate school program for music. I NEEDED to go deeper with music. I have spent the last 2.5 years getting my degree and making an album of songs in her memory and honor...but the music is FOR us. The caregivers. I've been sending love and energy to all of you.

My caregiving journey for my mom has been done for awhile, but it's changed me. I just released the first single from my still-unreleased album, and when I scheduled its release, I didn't realize we'd be dealing with a totally different kind of illness now all over the world. We who are caregivers know the feeling of being scared, isolated, and out of control over a long period of time, and I know that the world right now adds to those feelings. So while the song is resonating for everybody right now more than it perhaps usually would, it's one that truly I wrote FOR us who know about caregiving for the long term.

So I want to share Love Comes, my song, that starts with an acoustic guitar, a lone voice, and a plucked cello, and opens into a chorale of thirty voices, horns and string orchestra. It is the love song I wrote to myself when I didn't know if I was going to make it through the caregiving and I needed to feel better. I hope it does so for someone who reads this and listens. It's here: [http://smarturl.it/9lskgv](http://smarturl.it/9lskgv)

It says, ""at the end of the long night, at the end of the pyrrhic fight / you lost your left and then you lost your right / at the end of the long day when she has drifted away, you find there's nothing more to say / just rest now, you'll figure it out. don't let it cast a shadow on all that you do. cause you talk too much, you try to plan too much / just wait. love comes when you need it to / don't you know that love will come when you need it to.""

And it will! Sending lots of love to the community. L","It's lovely. Thanks for sharing, and caring.
Oh, bless your heart. Both you and your mother, too young to go through that.

,"Advice, my mom has terminal cancer and she’s gotten to the point where she needs some help washing her hair in the shower, but doesn’t want to be naked in front of me or any of my siblings. What can she wear in the bath (not a bathing suit) that protects her modesty?",,"You could try a bathing suit cover up, they are usually designed of a material to dry quickly and are usually fairly billowy so easy to get on/off. 

If she has a shower chair she could always sit backwards on it and lean back a bit safely while you wash her hair from behind. She could wrap a towel around her, they also have towels that have a button or velcro to help them stay closed. If you have a handheld showerhead (can usually find these very cheap online and and are super easy to install) it would be easier to keep whatever she is wearing a bit drier. 

There are also caps that you can use to wash hair outside of the shower, they're called Drench, I believe. My grandma likes those the best out of what we've tried. There are also, shelf-like things that you can attach to a sink or wheelchair that will mimic a hair washing sink at a salon, if that makes sense. They are removable, you just use them while washing her hair. We haven't tried those as our sinks are too high for that to work.
You could find a sports bra type top that clasps in the front (so she can easily remove it after being helped, with some biking shorts or a skirt of some sort?

Do you have a sink in your home that she could sit in front of or bend down into while you help her?

If you aren't finding the right solutions it may just be time to consider this... this is the first step in needing more help with tasks that will compromise modesty (if looked at that way) so it might be time to sit down and have a very sweet, gentle, and loving conversation about moving forward.  
Needing help washing hair may be followed by needing help being wiped, needing help washing hard to reach places, help being dressed etc... now might be the time to start being more comfortable with nudity around her primary caregiver.

Maybe find out how she feels about outside help with this versus you/the family. That may be somewhat eye opening to the fact that these things are commonplace and either family can help, or a paid stranger can.

I don't know how close y'all are, or what your relationship is like so it's hard to advise on how to approach the convo, but you will know the best route to take. Keep it light, loving, and factual.

Good luck!!!
My wife found some dry shampoo and some of this liquid that works similar too it the dry shampoo is a spray and the liquid she said she found on the aisle with a bunch of elderly things but it helps when she needs to wash it but can’t
Honestly a towel might be your best bet — I use flannels over the peri area, but a full or half sized towel might provide more modesty. She will obviously need to be sitting for this. Otherwise a basin while sitting clothed will work, probably more of a two man job though since one person will need to hold the basin while the other washes
Alternatively you could wash her hair in the sink.
Honestly, a light rain poncho. Easy to throw on, no sleeves or anything difficult, just hang it up to dry afterwards. It’s a bit silly but the easiest option in my experience.
Another option: CNA. My mom had a lady come by and giver her a shower 3 times a week. It helps give you a little free time.  Paid for my hospice/Medicare.
a black or any color (just not clear) plastic hairdressing cape. would totally cover, plus all she’d have to do is pull at the neck to take it off if she wanted to wash other places after the hair wash was finished. then she could have a towel nearby to cover when done
You could try No Rinse shampoo. She can sit in a chair and you can comb it in before the shower. She can rinse it out when she gets in. 

And thinking outside the box a wicking fishing shirt might be good. It is a snap front, and is quick drying. If you get it a size or 2 bigger it might be long enough to cover everything up.

,Wife v. Family,"My wife has a few chronic illnesses and I knew this from not too long from when we started dating. When I told my family about it it seemed to bother my mom her mom and my older sister. 

Their concern was that she’ll become a burden on me and want me to be happy or something like that. We have a pretty close family (except grandma she’s from another generation so she’s got her own issues) and they support us because we’re their family. (My dad has chronic pain and works so he is a hard-ass on anyone with chronic pain but her cause “she’s your wife and part of the family”)

Today my wife finished a comic she made to show her frustration with people complaining about being stuck in the house and the sudden accessibility of companies. (She posted it on the disability subreddit and her Facebook)

My older sister saw it on Facebook and commented or reacted too it in a positive way but I tried to show it to my mom who looked over it but couldn’t really see it on my phone so I explained what the message was to her and she said: ”Some companies let you work from home; Call centers can work from home.” 

I said not everyone can work in a call center and she said in a very condescending tone: Wife is her own person and can do whatever she wants.

I’m pissed and kinda don’t feel like seeing her for a little while","This is my wife’s

,Thoughts?,"I've never posted here, so we'll see how helpful this is. I moved home about two weeks ago to assist my Mom with caregiving of my Dad while we are quarantined in rural Missouri. Dad has early/mid level stages of dementia, and spends a lot of time tying to hide his confusion (and has been very unwilling to admit that he has dementia -- though on my first day back, he told me that he did, and that he wanted me to know, most of the time he will tell my mom that he doesn't, he's just had a few concussions and that he doesn't want to hear the word 'dementia). 

They've got an appointment at a memory center in June -- they were reluctant to do anything despite my sister and I encouraging it over the last two years -- and we anticipate that there will be some medication and other options to help with his frequent agitation, anxiousness, and boredom. I could really use some tips/thoughts/concerns while we try to maintain safety for him and  Mom in the middle of this crisis. 

I've gotten pretty good at responding to his nonsensical thoughts so that he doesn't think I know he is saying something nonsensical. Mom really struggles with wanting to correct him -- and he, like many folks with dementia, struggles with specific triggers (recently it has been the Census, of all things), including things like upcoming doctor appointments, finances and money, etc. Any thoughts or suggestions would be great...","My best advice is to roll with his reality. If he insists something is true, agree. Arguing will only agitate him. With my grandfather, we didn’t know how much of his issues were dementia for a long time (he had a lot of different problems going on at once, so sorting them out was pretty impossible), so my mom and I decided early on as his caregivers to err on the side of “not dementia” as far as how we treated him. We talked to him normally, even if he didn’t respond. My grandmother on the other hand never failed to point out his flaws or memory lapses, etc. but that’s a different story. 

One day he had her call me after he apparently had been dreaming. I could hardly understand him but I made out that he was asking about the insurance payment on the Pontiac (that he’d had in the 70s). I just assured him that I was taking care of all the bills, and he wasn’t late on anything. He accepted that and was relieved. If I had insisted he didn’t have a Pontiac, it would only have been confusing and upsetting for him. You have to go with what his reality is at the moment. 

Don’t make it seem like his confusion or lapses are something to be ashamed of. He isn’t in control of it, it’s not his fault. I know it’s hard for you and your mom to see it happening, but it’s hard on him too.
I struggled with finding a balance (between correcting and going with it) when my dad wanted to talk about his parents picking him up or a trip that he was going on when he was in a wheelchair. My best moments were when I used the time to find out more about what he was thinking about. Why did his mind want to escape and dwell there? Where did he want to go? Why did he like that place? What was his dad like? Sometimes ""going there"" with him allowed me to learn more about him but it's hard.
Hmm. What you're saying resonates. Back when I was a caregiver I spent much of every day responding to my mom, who had early onset AD, when she would have nonsensical thoughts using affirmation to do what it sounds like you are--not letting her think she was saying things that were nonsensical. Let me say that I've been out of the caregiving game since 2016 when she passed away, but it was really transformative for me, and now I have some hindsight, and here are my thoughts for what they are worth: 

\- I really came to enjoy our relationship after I more or less let go of + saw there wasn't a point in doing correction--and that is def easier for some personality types than others. At times I made a game of it (let me see how creative I can get with her) and at times I felt like I was being her protector so it was a sort of challenge to try and win at. I miss the simplicity of being with her, as she often wanted to do the same things over and over. Other humans are in lots of ways much more complicated, you know?

\- To that point, though, it drained my mental health reserves because I didn't simultaneously talk to someone who did NOT have dementia about all the creative mental work I was doing to keep her from feeling lost, and I could have taken better care of my mind. I learned to laugh about it but not until way late. I also didn't start therapy until way late. I would recommend a good therapist because venting can keep you healthy. I was also helping my dad who was sort of lead caregiving, and talking to him was important, but I think I should have tried to widen my support circle a bit. I think this community it probably a great place to vent too!!

\- I think my last thought is just about what's ""possible""--get creative. My mom repeatedly would get mad at being stuck or kept in the house, esp after she didn't drive any more, and threatened to leave and go get a job at the craft store in town...which is an amazing thing to THREATEN, love her :D...anyways, at first I would say no, that isn't going to work, and then I started helping her with her outfit or her resume, which would make her feel she was progressing towards her goal, and that would often morph into a craft project, which would take her mind off of the thing (until the next time it came up hours or days later).

\- Laugh! Dark humor is FINE! Fleabag has nothing to do with dementia or caregiving, but I find its darkness a PERFECT fit for the way my brain feels after spending 10 years of my early adulthood toe to toe with dementia. 

I really wish you the best, probs will see you around on here. Be well, L",2020-03-31 14:17:41,Pmiddy13,fsi3bp
,Mom's paranoia is getting way worse. Help.,"Sorry about the wall of text.  My mom is making some pretty serious accusations and I don't know what to do. 

We're in quarantine here in our state/city and my mom is staying with my sister and my brother in law. 

She usually stays at an independent senior residence, where she has a small apartment but her meals are made for her and she eats in a dining room.  She has friends there and there's a lot of high school drama (!) but she is happy and my sister and I are a daily part of her life.  I moved here from out of state two years ago to help care for her. 

We brought her to my sister's house when they locked down the senior facility.  My mom can walk and talk but she needs help with things like making sure she eats and using the microwave and she gets lonely even with her friends.  She wants family around too.  (Italian family).

For the last few years she has talked about people stealing from her. The items that have been missing are usually right there still, or she's put them somewhere safe but then forgets and my sister or I find them in a day or so tucked away.  So far, nothing has been actually stolen to our knowledge. 

So. My mom is difficult to deal with sometimes.  Very fussy and demanding and high maintenance. But we figure it out because she's our mom.  The stress of the quarantine plus having my mom there has made my sister pretty fragile and she's been spending most of her time outside gardening.

This morning my mom told my sister that my brother in law has been peeping in her windows, watching her get dressed.  My mom said things like ""He's a pervert"" and ""The wife is always the last to know"".  My sister has a pretty big house and it is in the shape of a U around the pool.  My brother in law could have easily been out at the pool and my mom could have seen him there and thought he was spying on her.  It's not the first time she's accused different people of spying in her bedroom window.  I don't think my brother in law was peeping.  I think  it's my mom's paranoia/dementia.

What do we do?  What do we tell her?  Any advice on how to handle this?  My sister is in tears, my mom is running around drawing the blinds and clutching her pearls as we call it in our family and I'm here quarantined 15 minutes away, 

Help.","Have you spoken with her primary doctor about starting ativan? It’s such an anxiety riddled time — losing your memory and the attendant stress for the lockdown. A lot of what is manifesting for her may seem very real. When my dad got like this a couple of years before his dementia was in full swing, I told him  “you know -you’ve been accusing people of xyz - it’s not like you. What’s wrong?”  

You have to do something for her anxiety. Talking, touching or taking something. These will soothe her. But please know, sometimes unpleasant aspects of peoples’ personality comes through when they are feeling vulnerable. She may not know she is even being nasty. Please don’t expect that she really understands what’s what right now. So much sudden change! This has got to be feeling slightly menacing to her, and she may be reacting with blame. Poor thing. I know it doesn’t help, but try harder to engage and then direct the conversation to safe, happy memories.
I'm not a Doctor; but as far as I've seen this is very common behavior for somone developing dementia. The idea of people stealing, trapping the individual in place and having nontrustworthy, unannounced friends over is super normal. The mental changes happen slowly sometimes. Try to keep her away from all men if possible, (for now) give her extra curtains if you can and distract her, talk her down from panic, and don't be pulled into the stress. Maybe give her a job around the house to keep her busy? Just don't be very reactive because this most likely isn't going away and you probably can't talk her out of her ideas. The drama will take some new form soon. Can her Doctor call in some medication to calm her? Usually doing that would be unethical without an assessment, but if you're all stuck together during this time it's crisis intervention. I suggest documenting this well so it can be shown to her Doctor over video. Just take a deep breath. Accept her beliefs are going to be a challenge to deal with but she truly believes what she's saying. Good luck!

Edit: medication does work, they're more effective than they used to be. She might be much happier taking something.",2020-03-29 14:00:39,alemap000,fra43u
,How much should I get paid as a live-in caregiver?,"I am starting next week as a live in caregiver/DSP of 6 individuals with disabilities.

This will be my first job in this field I was working in education but have been furloughed due to the coronavirus. I have been looking online and have seen that live in DSP get paid hourly, but I'm not sure how it works? I have a meeting with my employer to discuss pay Monday, should I request salary? How much? Should I request the minimum since I don't have prior experience?","SOO in FL...  caregivers in this state get anywhere from $12-$16 ($16 is high BUT because you are handling more than 2 people you could get something in a higher range depending on facility). Never met anyone receive salary as a caregiver. You should request an amount that you researched based on your state AND the duties performed/hours you'll be on floor. Make sure you are taking care of yourself in these times. Hold the business accountable if they lack supplies such as masks, gloves, etc because some homes are not as well off as others...

,Rising Anxiety,"I'm sure I'm not the only one, but I'm honestly overwhelmed by these thoughts right now and I want to get them off my chest.

My momma (49F) has MS. 
My dad (54M) is wheelchair bound.
My younger brother (26M) is blind. 
I'm in my last semester of University. 

What the fuck am I going to do if I get sick? If something happens to me, what will my parents do? I'm the only one who drives. I make all the meals. I make all doctor appointments and get them to and from. We are struggling financially and if I get sick, it's going to be worse. What if I put my family at risk? 

I'm so scared and I'm afraid to talk to my family in fear of worrying them. I'm 29. I'm trying so fucking hard to keep myself together but I am honestly so overwhelmed right now. 

I really just need some positive vibes, if you can spare them.","Positive vibes sent! Stay strong - I know, it's so easy to say, but much harder to do. Just focus on the job in front of you: Do this assignment. Read that chapter. Make this meal. The big picture stuff can be so terrifying right now; focus on the little things, individually, and tackle them one at a time.

You got this.
You will definitely get through this. You’re a hero for all you’re doing for them, and you’re a hero for going to university on top of all of it. 

Take some stolen moments. When you can, tell yourself, “I’m going on strike for five minutes.” Then do it. It’s your mind tricking you into thinking you’re giving everything up, even if it’s just for a few minutes. Of course, if there’s something that comes up in that five minutes, you may have to break your strike, but most of the time you may be able to take it. 

Little “release valve” times like that helped me during my years of caregiving. As I say, you’ll get through this.
Now is a dark time, certainly, but as long as everyone is as healthy as can be in your family then this is the time to feel alive
Telling your family your fears will make you feel better. You sound like an amazingly thoughtful, generous and caring person. Let then be there for you like you are for them. They may be wanting to help you in some way, but you seem like you have your shit together, so they may feel lost not knowing what you need from them. They’re your family, and I can tell there is a lot of love there. Talking out loud to people who love you makes all that you do a team effort - they need to know you are fraying at the edges before you make yourself sick. 

I can DM you a pattern for making masks if you like. A little bit of security for you. Maybe your folks can help out with the sewing? The point is, you are not alone. Don’t isolate yourself emotionally from them. They want to be there for you - let them. Before you burn out. You’ll see - things will be OK. Only worry about the things you have some control over - everything else will take care of itself. ❤️
Talking about your fears really does help make them more manageable.   Start brainstorming people/friends of you and your family who can step in if you get sick.    Check with your church, any social clubs.  Check Facebook for a local group that's coordinating people who want to help out.

Is your brother trained on how to do transfers?  That's something he can learn to do.

,To keep being a caregiver or isolate?,"Looking for some advice here. I’m a private caregiver for an elderly woman (85 yo). I work with her 9 hours a day then drive home to my apartment complex that’s located downtown. She’s refused to stop going to public places, though with places shutting down she’s limited. I’m at the point of wondering whether I should keep going in and potentially infect her, or just lose the money but hopefully preserve her health. I work with a separate client on weekends, and it feels conflicting knowing I could pass on something quite harmful and deadly by visiting the elderly every day after being in public spaces. The woman I spend my weeks with is rather self sufficient, mainly needs help cooking but other than that she can toilet and dress and perform most ADLs. Even if I didn’t go in, her daughter has said she would come stay with her. But in the meantime, they told me to keep going and if I needed to, I could just quarantine there with her (which I would not do). Any advice or input?

Update: as the state I live in has gone into a lockdown, I have still been going in to care for one client (the one who still insists on going out). I lost my job with my second weekend client because of “too much unnecessary exposure” that I had by obliging to take the other client out. The client I am still working with still makes trips out, has family and friends come in from out of town, has services come to her house that aren’t necessary. Her kids have offered multiple times to take her during this time. Thinking about taking them up on it, as I’m uninsured and nervous to continue going out so often. I tried setting boundaries about going out so often, but the family doesn’t seem to be on the same page. Thoughts?","I'm a caregiver myself who goes to my ""clients"" houses. And I continue to work despite everything. The elderly are the ones who need us now more than ever because they are in a very vulnerable and possibly life threatening situation. I wear gloves, face mask, have anti-bacterial wipes & make sure to ""clean"" myself before I enter their homes. They need me now more than ever & I can't abandon them at this time!
You could always take her outside to a park or an open-air place. Just make sure that you are avoiding all people that are not your clients.

 I think you'll be okay.

,Quadriplegic caregiver. How much should I be getting paid,"Hi everyone, I am a caregiver for a Quadriplegic man who is in his 50s. I have been working for him for a few months now. I work two weekends a month from Friday to Sunday and I am paid a get rate of 500 dollars. 

A little background on the man I care for: he loves to frequent bars, concerts and socialize with his friends. Regardless of his condition he has a very active social life. 

I help him provide him nursing care (bathing, transferring him, feeding him, catheterizing him, etc.) I also am responsible for driving him around to wherever he wants to go. Since he is very social I usually drive him to bars, friends houses and concert venues to name a few. Since he cannot use his hands I have to help him drink and eat. Most of the times I am driving him to places anywhere from 30 minutes- 2 hours away (one way).

He is a night owl and tends to stay up 2 or 3 am. He usually wakes up around 9 or 10 a.m. and occasionally 11 but rarely. This means I only get 6 hours of sleep per night I watch him. Since I have to transfer him manually in and out of the car, it is very tiring, especially when he wants to go out and socialize. 

Like I said I currently work 2 weeks a month at 500. I usually drive my own car. This weekend he asked me to stay another night. So instead of my usually Friday to Sunday, I will be staying till Monday afternoon.

I was wondering, how much extra pay should I ask to stay into Monday? Also, if I use my own car, should I be paid by mileage?","You keep doing the rate per week when it sounds like you should really think about hourly rate, hope the weekend went well!",2020-03-16 03:05:42,graciewise,fjgu31

Your temp is taken daily. If you have a fever, you are sent home for two weeks.

If you have any sort of a cold (like me) you are sent home for two weeks. I have an upper respiratory infection and I'm not allowed to go to work at all. It should be getting monitored.
I’m actually curious if I should have my moms caregiver come or not....so this may answer that question for me as well....

Edit : we’re in CA so my mom is supposed to self isolate....but like she can’t because she needs help. 😂
I’m literally melting down over this problem as I type this. Corporate told us they were planning to have telehealth options for us (in home therapists) by this week and I just found out that they just said that to say it. They privately emailed my supervisor to say it’s “business as usual”. I have a lung condition. I’m at higher risk for corona. I get pneumonia regularly and am hospitalized for it. We don’t get sick time. We don’t have benefits. And my fiancé is schizophrenic and can’t work - so I’m a caregiver for work and at home too. I can’t afford to lose the paychecks, but I also can’t afford to get corona. I don’t know what we do from here.
Well most of the caregivers are screened before they visit for delivering care. If they aren't showing any symptoms, they are good to go, else, they are sent back home for isolation. You can't do anything. 

However, you can read this. I found it useful and it might help you with your concerns related to exemptions and paid leaves: [https://bit.ly/39XVQAN](https://bit.ly/39XVQAN)
I think it is a work at your own risk question. Each caregiver has to assess what they can and should do. I am feeling well, but age 50 with some health risks, but not overmuch. I decided I will be going to visit my clients and even willing to do some overtime if other caregivers decide they can’t. I realize it is a risk, but my clients can’t even get to the bathroom without my help. My bigger concern is that each one of my clients live in apartment buildings, where I have to deal with common doorknobs and long hallways. I am doing extra measures to keep things clean. And I am self quarantining when not working. Honestly I will pray my way through the next weeks and continue to work as I can.

,Coordinating Arrangements from Afar,"I hope this is appropriate to post here. I'm trying to help a friend. She and her (widowed) father have a difficult relationship. There was no abuse exactly, but her dad was distant, difficult, and could be very cruel. His health has been in rapid decline since his wife died, in part because he refuses to look after himself. 

My friend lives in another state. She visits him when she can, but those visits are emotionally taxing. There are many unpleasant memories associated with that town. She has already moved him out of his house and into a group home (for the time being). It now falls to her to figure out finances, fixing up and selling his house, etc. 

He has no money (other than the house, which he owns outright). My friend makes a decent salary but certainly didn't expect that her parents had made ZERO financial arrangements for their old age. (For the record: he's not old--he's only in his late-60s--and though he's completely of sound mind, he refuses to participate in making plans/arrangements for the latter part of his life.) 

The whole situation is causing her tremendous anxiety. She keeps putting off dealing with the house, but I know it looms over her constantly. 

**I assume there are agencies/organizations/people one can hire to deal with coordinating the many moving parts (real estate, nursing care, finances, etc.) associated with caring for an aging parent, but I've been having trouble figuring out where to start.** 

Could anyone point me in the right direction? (One complicating caveat: he lives in a fairly rural area.) 

Thank you so much.","Have the friend contact the nearest Agency on Aging office and/or Aging Disability Resource Center. They will be able to provide many resources that are available for his area. More than likely, the house will have to be sold to pay for his care. 
As for your friend, my heart goes out to her. I work with many families that have the same dynamics and it is beyond stressful for the children. I often have to remind people that you can’t help someone that won’t help themselves. If dad chooses to not take part in his own health, it is on him. You can setup the best care and if the person isn’t 100% onboard, it is a waste of money and time for everyone. Your friend does not have to spend a dime towards his care. She has to look out for her future. Obviously her dad chose to not look at the future or perhaps circumstances hindered it. But there are services and resources available, he just has to be willing to accept help and do what is needed.
Best place to start would be his states department of aging (or elderly)  they should be able to answer any questions and point them in the right direction. One thing to note without power of attorney she won't be able set anything up for him, she will likely be able to have a social worker go out to speak with him about various services but it will ultimately be up to him to then take the ball and run with it. 

She could also try to speak with his physician, they won't break HIPAA but she can express her concerns of him possibly needing help/assistance and can request the doctor maybe have a conversation with him at his next appointment about possible in home help. Depending on the state there are usually in home services (that may be paid for in part or completely by his insurance or the state depending on his need). But again, unless he wants it, makes the effort and agrees to it there likely isn't anything she can do. 

If he is active with a church she could ask there about any services for the elderly sometimes they have volunteers who will help older congregation members. 

If he was ever in the military he probably can avail himself of services via the VA. The VA can be a pain to deal with but once they are on board they do do a lot for vets. 

Again though, since she doesn't have power of attorney and he is presumably of sound mind he will likely have to initiate anything happening. She can call and ask questions in general about any services and what qualifications he needs to meet but actually getting things set up will likely fall to him.",2020-03-15 15:26:16,poppykennedy,fj6w53
,When do I invest in a Hoyer Lift?,"My wife is in a wheelchair, has limb-girdle muscular distrophy, and has some control over her upper body but it's not great. She was in the hospital recently, and they moved her on and off the toilet with a hoyer lift.

Right now she and I manage with a transfer board, but these transfers are becoming more and more difficult, particularly when we transfer to and from the show bench.

At what point do we say ""screw it, we're getting a home Hoyer lift""? When it takes 15 minutes to get her into the shower? Half an hour?  Thanks in advance.","When you think it's a safety issue for you or her.  Or a quality of life issue.  Does it completely exhaust you or her?  If it would take you 5 min. instead of 15 would it make life that much better?  Only you guys can really call it.  I've been told it's generally better to stay as mobile as you can, but it all comes down to your quality of life.  (My husband used a hoyer lift for awhile due to partial paralysis but he has improved.)
I don’t know if you’re wealthy but when I think I need medical equipment I start looking for used ones ASAP.   You’ll find them very cheap used vs new
If you can get one now it would be an excellent move, because there's a learning curve. It seems like an easy and helpful device, and it is. However it takes a while to become familiar with it and for your wife to feel safe while using it. Will it work easily with your furniture layout? Is there a warranty on the thing? These are the little questions that come with change.
I would work on finding one now even if you're not ready to use it.  If your wife has a fall and ends up in the hospital and has reduced mobiity as a result, she can't be released back to your home until the staff knows she has a safe place to return to. 

You've also got to take care of yourself so you don't burn out or get hurt.

 I work with people with Parkinson's, one guy is in a nursing home (here in WA state with all the coronovirus breakout) until his home gets fixed up.

Call your family doctor and ask for a referral to an occupational therapist.  They help you figure out the safest/best way to do daily tasks (occupations).  He/she can come to your house and watch you and your wife do your activities of daily life and figure out how you can stay safe (don't hurt your back) and then figure out what stuff you can use now and then what stuff you'll have to get in the future.  

Another option is to hire a caregiver to help with stuff like toileting and showers.  If you're in the US, call your local Area Agency on Aging to find out if you qualify for gov. help to pay for the caregiver.
When I helped care for my grandmother it was a real life saver for my grandfather and I. We didn’t even use it all the time, necessary, but it made those difficult lifts much more manageable, and when she (or we!) we’re feeling particularly weak or we’re having a rough day it really saved us in the end. I don’t think the question is “when is she disabled enough” but “could this help her and/or I in our quality of life?” 

Honestly I think that we get it in our heads somehow that we should only get help or more mobility aid when it’s absolutely necessary, but if it will make life easier and save your back I think you should go for it, even if you only use it part time. 😊",2020-03-13 19:00:03,SingularBlue,fi8m7g

,Unemployed Wife (getting this off my chest),"My wife has several medical issues that prevent her from working a typical job. These range from fatigue to back pain to CPTSD.

We’ve talked about her finding a job at times but nothing seems like she can handle. I’ve tried and make peace with it and am a lot more understanding than I have been in the past especially since it seems to have gotten worse as time went on. 

Often when talking with people about money issues they always point to my wife and “why doesn’t she work” and admittedly I’m kind of embarrassed to bring up her problems especially since she’s not on disability. 

I know this stuff hurts her self-esteem when she hears it from other people but I don’t want people to judge and think she’s lazy or that I’m “just making excuses” 

What can/should I do?

Edit: She has already applied and got denied Disability. And CPTSD was diagnosed by a therapist","My wife also has several chronic issues, but doesn't qualify for disability and yet can't hold down a job. She struggles a lot with her self esteem. The borderline personality disorder doesn't help: it just makes the lows lower.

She worked for fifteen years in the medical profession before she slowed down too much to work.

She has focused on the kind of help that she can safely provide inconsistently. Things like stockpiling crafts that can be made slowly over months, then sold at a profit. Or simply planting a veggie garden so that we spend a little less on food.

There are other creative works that don't have strict deadlines, and can be done on-demand too. There's a whole world of ""gig economy"" jobs out there. She may never get to the point where she's bringing in the equivalent of even a part time minimum wage, but maybe she will. Gives her hope.

Best of luck my friend. We're here for you.
If she truly can’t work and the doctors confirm this she can always apply for disability or ssi. After 2 years of doing all the financial support for myself and my fiancé - who suffers from a psychotic disorder - his doctors have said his condition is too chronic and temperamental for him to be working and helped him apply. It at least will help with any financial burdens.
You’re doing the right thing, getting it off of your chest and out of your head. It’s a terrible thing - the guilt we feel over passing feelings we are burdened by our situation. Caregiving is hard, and an act of pure love. I don’t know enough to make any suggestion for improving your lot, but you should take a moment and remember that you were blessed enough to find a love together, this IS what you signed up for, and you WILL manage. Don’t feel bad for having human feelings - literally all of us have them. And if you stop looking for solutions, that’s the same as giving up. You are doing everything right. But knowing those feelings aren’t the true state of things, know that you will survive.
I would start by taking her for a psych eval. You want to see what's going on with her to see if you can even get disability. If she is not able to function. Or you can find out if she needs medication. C PTSD is very severe. And needs to be diagnosed by a doctor. Also taking her in for a physical if she has back pain you should know the reason. I mean the truth is as much as diagnosed she could be making it up. So you want to find out what's going on behind it to be able to help your wife as best you can",2020-03-04 23:54:28,,fdq5fz
,Unopened/sealed Medication donations?,"Hi all,

We recently lost my grandfather and we have a lot of unopened/sealed medications. Does anyone know of any place that accepts medication donations? Some of these are very expensive and I hate to just have them end up trashed when someone could probably use them. Thanks :)","Sirum.org
When my mum died, we asked her home care nurse to go through it and take whatever she thought could be passed on.
If you have ancillary supplies (bandages, antiseptic swabs, etc) a vet or animal rescue organization would probably take them.

,Update to last post [happy],"So at the beginning of the year, January 4th I think, we had had a huge blow out fight with GMIL who I'm a caregiver for. Now while things between her and I have not gotten better (like that was really possible) but things between my husband and I about how to handle situations about her has. For a while there even after that blow out we had issues with him understanding this was at least a weekly event for me; that is till he walked in on her screaming at me after I asked her if she wanted me to refill her glass, he was standing outside watching and saw her begin to berate me over that walked in and she smiled at him and pretended like she neve has said a rude word to me, and even tried to explain to him she wasn't screaming. So that helped, plans to move into a spare house of my in-laws has been axed on account my husband doesn't trust them, don't blame him about that. So we're saving to currently remove ourselves from this blasphemous reality, slow and steady though and with love we'll get through this.","Good luck, hoping things improve for all of you.",2020-02-29 09:54:44,nelbells8,fbdl14
,A rant on how doctors treat caregivers,"After 3 weeks of neither of us sleeping I called my fiancé’s psychiatrist because we’re concerned about his developed twitching (which is preventing him from sleeping). It took two voicemails just to get a nurse to call me back. Then once I spoke with the nurse, who was lovely, his psychiatrist called me and immediately set it on me. She told me how I’m inept at being his caregiver, that she doesn’t have a “magic pill” to fix him, and that I “need to decide whether I can handle being with him”...none of that that was the issue. I’m a therapist - I know there’s no magic pill to “fix” him and absolutely do not expect there to be. I’ve never been worried about whether I can handle it. For two years before his psychotic break it was just me taking care of him, managing his symptoms hand as a full time caregiver and working full time and going to grad school full time. I have been his only support system for years. All I wanted to do is make sure this wasn’t something I needed to be worried about in terms of his safety, and to warn her he wanted to stop his antipsychotic if the twitching doesn’t stop. Instead I got berated for 15 minutes about how poor of a caregiver I am and grilled about my work schedule and told I can’t work and be a caregiver at the same time. This same woman has sent police officers to our home repeatedly telling them he’s “possibly physically harmed me” when it’s taken me more than 15 minutes to call her back - because I’m in session with my own patients - and it took filing a complaint to get it to stop. I have never - and would never - treat any of my patient’s caregivers this way. I genuinely don’t understand why this woman feels the need to do this to me so constantly. I’m exhausted and I just want to know my fiancé’s safety isn’t at risk. Not get bitched out and basically hung up on with no answer. Nobody else will take his insurance. I can’t even switch him to someone else. I’m at such a loss.","Holy crap, you're fiance's psychiatrist is terrible...

I definitely have had issues in dealing with doctor's and their offices, but thankfully not this bad. Wow...I'm sorry...

Is it possible to switch psychiatrists?
The Psychiatrist’s behavior and treatment of you should be reported to the State Medical Board. Her statements are so unethical and unprofessional that she should be investigated and her credentials removed. Please call the state to see what your options are.
Oh I'm so sorry, I'm no help, but here are lots of cyber hugs for you. You'll find a way. I hope you get to see this before it gets removed.
twitching may or may not be a big thing, but why take the chance?  Anytimg I hear this, I always worry about Tardive dyskinesia. It probably isn't, but i've seen a case where it was, and the patient ended up basically in a catatonic state.

It's very scary, and in our business, there are two cardinal sins -- Abuse, and neglect -- And this doctor sounds like one of them OG doctors who talks down to patients.

You need to immediately (since this is affecting him in a very dangerous way) call your county long-term ombudsman, and I would contact the DHHS (dept. of health and human services), and get a social worker to represent him in official capacities.

I would also call APS. This could go south very quickly.
When it rains it pours, right?  This Doctor needs to be sanctioned, she’s so out of line.  I hope a friend can call the State Insurance and park their butt on the line to find someone else.  

About the copays - there are organizations that assist with copays.  Google Copay Assistance (might be another job for a friend).  There are different foundations that award a yearly amount.  I just got awarded for Copays for anything associated with Chronic Pain.  Worth a look.   Don’t let the bitch get you down.  You’re doing a hell of a job!

,Remember to take care of yourself too!,"I have been a caregiver for my husband for the last 3 years. Most our resources go to him to find a cure or relief from his pain. I always put him first and usually forget about myself. I haven’t bought bras in 5 years and they were falling apart. Yesterday I bought a couple and I feel so good about it! I’m excited to get them and my mood improved. It may not sound as much but I decided that this was the first step to also take care of my needs in order to also be a better caregiver.
Hope you are well! I know it’s hard and I think everyone is awesome and doing a great job. Take care of your needs too and give yourself a gift too :)","Even the smallest thing can make a difference!
Remembering your needs matter too it easier said than done, but so very beneficial.

Thank You! :),"Patience! I (21F) am a caregiver at an assisted living facility for senior adults and it's so important to exercise patience.

Also get good shoes! Caregiving means a lot of being on your feet and you want to be comfortable :)

Good luck!
Take time for yourself. Even if it’s just 2 minutes a day. Caregiver burn out is so real. I’m 24F and an ABA therapist, and a full time caregiver to my fiancé who has a serious illness. When you spend so much time caring for others it’s easy to lose yourself in the mix. Find little ways to do something that makes you happy every day.

,Mental health caregivers - what kind of supports do you think we need?,"Hi everyone,

I’m a caregiver for my fiancé who has a psychotic disorder, and over the last two years (and majorly over the last 8 months since his official diagnosis) I’ve found that resources for caregivers are really limited. As someone who works in psychology myself, I reached out to everyone I could think of in my home state to get him the right support, as well as help for myself and came up relatively empty. 

I contacted NAMI, went to the only friends and family support group they have in my area, just for them to disband two meetings in. 

I read every book on his illness I could get my hands on, and even the “family guides” don’t really address what the caregiver’s experience is. Only how to help your loved one.

Helping your loved one is extremely important - but we need supports too. I’ve discussed this in my graduate program, and how reddit has been a great support system when those are so limited for caregivers, and my professor recommended I write a book or blog on it while I finish school to become a clinical psychologist. I think that a blog may be a good idea, a place for caregivers to look for supports and information. 

So please - hit me up with your ideas. I’ve made wonderful friends on reddit with other mental health caregivers trying to be do their best for their loved ones while trying to stay afloat themselves and it’s made a big difference. I think if I can give back somehow to mental health caregivers around the world it could be a great thing.","The little luxuries tend to go by the wayside pretty quickly so a gift certificate to a spa or some similar gift that is specifically for the caregiver would be appreciated. 

Frozen food that can be cooked later is great during times of crisis (any crisis really). Casseroles, etc. 

Any household task that can be taken on so the caregiver has one less thing on their to do list is great. A simple “hey, I’ll be in your neighborhood tomorrow can I bring you anything from the store?” would be great. 

Acknowledgement of how f-ing hard this is would be great too.  Most of my friends are really good about saying how amazing it is that I’m taking this on. Never gets old, never. 

I feel ya.
First, I want to say you’re amazing for what you are doing. This is what love is and I am so proud of you for this, really I am. I would suggest maybe seeing a therapist yourself to be able to talk through some of the things that are difficult for you. And making sure your head space stays strong. You can’t pour from an empty cup. Many al anon meetings can be helpful? I am not 100% sure if they will help your situation but it is still a support group that could be helpful. I bought my bf and I the DBT self help guide and we are working through it. It’s super easy and helpful. You can get it on amazon for $22. Amazon has tons of resources. Maybe look into Facebook groups? Or even start your own! I wish you so much luck and happiness and success!!
After 37 years of caregiving to my husband, here is what I have come up with:

I take one day a week and go get my hair done, go to lunch, or out with my kids.  I NEED that time for me in order to be there for him.

Because he not only has a mental health issue (PTSD, BI-Polar), but also Physical disabilities (too many to mention, but right now Cancer) it is a strain. I have one friend that I call and vent too, and she and I trade stories. She makes me laugh, cry, whatever, but it gets my feelings (and my anger. Yes, there IS anger and you have to admit it!) out.

I have a therapist that I see every two weeks (other then when he is hospitalized) so that I have a safe place. Sometimes it is like pulling teeth, sometimes ALLLLL I do is talk.  It also helps

Take care of yourself. Discover what is important to you, what one thing you have that you want to keep for YOU, and make sure you MAKE TIME TO DO IT!! I cannot stress this enough.  Make the time, you will feel much better!
Please write that book or blog! What I need is to be comforted. I don’t need to know how to help my partner, there is plenty of advice about that. I need someone to tell me it’s going to be ok, to hang on and that it will get better. I need hope when everything feels hopeless.",2020-02-11 18:41:55,Pandaswife95,f2hgpb
,Rude va representative,"So my husband received a call from the VA caregiver program today which they were told to call me.  They told him that even though he was 100% p/t, he would have to go back to another therapy session to qualify so they would know that his disability would not get better.  He ended up smashing and breaking a chair because he went into a fit of rage after he tried explaining that he already had a medical board determine his condition was p&t.  Has everyone had this type of interaction with this program.","Not an exact same situation but I've noticed that they do like to evaluate over and over again. As for them not calling you as requested that also isn't surprising, they seem to only want to deal directly with the vet. My best suggestion would be to change the primary call number of record to your cell phone so only you will answer. Just say he isn't available and you're his wife/caregiver. Make sure you are listed as someone who can speak for him, a healthcare power of attorney might be a good idea if you don't already have it set up.
Aid in Attendance? It’s a giant pain in the ass. I used to work for a caregiving company where it was my job to facilitate communication with the VA to make the process easier for vets and it would still be 6-8 weeks minimum with me hounding them. Unfortunately the best way to handle it is to jump through their hoops, or have your husband’s VA case worker give them a call if he has one, sometimes that can help move it along. If it’s just one more session that they need, play their game and it will (usually) be smooth sailing from then on out. Good luck!
We are having the same problem. They said there was no proof my 100 P/T would not get better in 6 months and I didn’t have support from my primary care team even though there are notes from my PCP saying he 100% supports us being in the program because I need a caregiver. Second time up on appeal was denied this time because they didn’t see I need daily care even though it is stated I need help dressing, managing suicidal ideations and medication, as well as I can not drive anymore.

,I guess I just want to know that I am not alone...,"As I was getting ready on the morning of January 6th to head to my third year university class, my mom presented signs of stroke so I called 911. She has been in the hospital since, I have had to put school on hold while I care for my mom and 86 year old grandmother who lives with us. I have come to terms with the fact that my life is on hold for about a year as my mom recovers from this. I’m angry at life, I’m sad and deeply upset. I know there is a light at the end of this tunnel and I feel incredibly grateful that she’s alive and things are not worse. She should make a full recovery. I am 32, in my 20s I was not able to attend post secondary because my mom was helping my brother go through school, so I helped her with her business (she’s a single mom).  I can’t help but feel angry but mostly I feel sad that I again have to put my life on hold. Don’t get me wrong I wish the roles were reversed so she didn’t have to go through this, my mom deserves the world and I’m happy to help I just can’t shake this feeling...

Can anyone else relate?","You are most definitely not alone. I spent my childhood, my teens and my 20s taking care of my dad, and now I'm spending my 30s taking care of my grandmother. I often wonder when I'm going to be allowed to take care of myself. Sometimes I wish I could just run away from all of these responsibilities, but alas, I can not. Someone has to do it and unfortunately the task has fallen to us. Sending you hugs if you need them. Caregiving is exhausting in every way.
You're not alone. I was the 'Bonus Baby' in my family. Born to older parents and I became the caregiver at a young age. I also felt like I raced through life because of that too. I got married really young, had a family really young, jumped through hoop after hoop to try to get through  everything while my parents were still alive. A year ago my father died and my mother moved in with my husband and I and our two teenage kids. My mother's health has been poor lately and I've more than once found myself being resentful and frustrated, even when I'm trying not to be. I can no longer just go away for a weekend with my family, or take a vacation, or even come home late without worrying about who is taking care of Mom and who will feed her and make sure she takes her medicine and makes sure she's okay. The one thing that gets me through a lot of days is a greeting card that an old friend sent me probably a decade ago. She was catching me up on her life and at the time she was caring for her elderly mother. I remember her writing about how frustrating it could be, but also what a privilege it is to be responsible for your parent at their most vulnerable. She considered the time spent as caretaker to be a gift that not everyone had the chance to receive. When I have tough days I try to remember that sentiment.
There is another alternative, walking away. You're in college and you had to put your life on hold because your mom had a stroke.

Wheres your relatives that can help you.

If you're forced to drop out of college, theres a good chance that you will never graduate. Society has gone highly competitive and theres no patience for those who choose or are forced to be left behind. Nor there are any supports for excaregivers except for a homeless shelter.

Please reconsider, I was in a similar situation for 5 years and my life and future is gone and by the way the country is going, I will eventually end my own life on my own terms, loved ones (and relatives who didnt give care be damned)

,Sometimes it’s just too much...,"Some days my job is amazing and I love it and I can’t wait to go to work. Other days, I am overwhelmed and frustrated because of lack of communication and support from my coworkers and the clients family’s. Specifically, when a client is vomiting, has blood pressure that’s 90/60 and they won’t allow me to take them to the hospital. Or when my coworkers lie about cleaning the c pap machines, lie about cleaning in general, write in their notes that they see that something is off but do nothing about it except sit on their ass and play on their phones. When their work doesn’t get done, it’s my job to do it. Otherwise it simply won’t get done. It’s not fair that this all falls on my shoulders. And I leave crying and wondering if I’m going to find my client dead the next day. I don’t really have anyone I can talk to about this so Reddit is the place I can go. Thanks for reading.","Hang in there baby! You have seen this cat poster, right? Your the cat. Remember that YOU can only do so much. Report your suspicions to your supervisor and move along. I have felt your pain for my own peeps now for many years. I get it, skin is only so thick and when you need to sometimes ya gotta release the anger.(AKA POP!) Go home and try to chill with some nice music, meditate,get a big bag of weed, whatever works for you. Ours is a tough job that most people couldn't do. You just need to keep on keepin' on! GL fellow human person.
This may be a cop out, but maybe you can find a better place to work, where everybody is on the same page in putting the clients’ care/needs first. Then on your exit interview, you can talk about the things you saw or that can be improved on. None of this is easy, cuz you've probably connected with your clients and who knows how your information or suggestions will be dealt with.

If your coworkers are noting potential problems but not addressing them, and the supes/mgrs aren't doing anything about that, then there seems to be something wrong with the system and/or the culture. 

Dunno why families would not want to do what's best for the client, but there should be some documentation that they sign off on, that acknowledges that they're going against your advice. (I'm assuming you're going into clients’ homes to care for them, and if you don't already have such a procedure in place, you can suggest it to your place of work, to have a check off list of what was done (like the cleaning of c-pap machines) and suggestions you made, to be signed off either by the client or someone already designated as being able to represent the client). This might make them think twice before declining the hospital route out of hand, and force accountability in your coworkers' actions.

Of course, it's up to you to either bite the bullet and soldier on, or try to improve the system, or look for a more reputable place to work, but no matter what, take care of yourself first, per u/Darth-Serious, with the additional suggestions of seeing a masseuse (date one or get a massage!), do some tai chi (didn't want to suggest too strenuous an activity in case of potential injuries unless you're not known to be injury-prone and you thought an intensive workout like boxing or Krav Maga is just the thing; tai chi is supposedly based on mindfulness, breathing and the kind of physicality that helps the mind as well as body), taking a vacation, even if it's just a one or two-day getaway like into the wilderness (with a friend), or to the seaside (watching the waves can be therapeutic), or go skydiving or learn how to hang glide, whatever the f to chill.

All the best.
You guys are the best!!! Seriously!!! Today I came in and so much shit wasn’t done. I took pictures and called my boss and sent them and told them what’s up and they were FURIOUS! They immediately were thanking me for bringing this to their attention and for making sure the client is well cared for. So maybe something will change!! *fingers crossed*
Omg this sounds absolutely horrible!  You have so much empathy and care so much, I can tell!  You also are caught in that place where you don't want the patient to get worse, but you also don't want to be the one who has to rat out your coworkers! I've been there before, as before I was very sick I was a caregiver myself (ironic).",2020-02-05 12:54:57,ashyfoxypants,ezdf3r
,What are my options as a new caretaker?,"Hello, I'm so sorry if there's an answer to my question somewhere here but my hands are kind of full. A basic rundown of my situation: I'm 22 and have 0 experience with nursing/care. My father is suffering from monthly seizures that are getting worse and are eating away at him. His vision has been majorly impacted a month ago and he needs regular care. His sister was bearing the load and doing a great job but now she is stepping back which leaves me in charge of pill planning and regular assistance in general (multiple visits a day).

Now I heard there was something called an Individual Provider that can allow anyone, experience or not, to make some income from the care they provide to someone else. Is this a thing? And if so would it apply to me? I need a job but after this I don't think I can get one... any help would be appreciated. Thanks.","Dunno where you live, but in the USA, if a patient is on Medicaid (or whatever it might be called in their state) and qualifies for in-home health services, then whoever's taking care of the patient can be eligible to receive pay for giving care to the patient. However, it needs to be assessed that the patient truly needs help and the assessor will determine how many hours the patient needs help for. All the best.
hello,

how old is your father?  is he on retirement pay?

do you have any other family members there that can help you?

I know that you are trying.  I have been a caregiver for my parents for 3 years.  this is going to be too much for you to handle on your own.  you are going to need the help of your aunt and other family members because you can't be there 24/7.

I didn't get assistance from any programs where I live so I had to do most of it by myself.  I got my pay from my parents retirement pay.   we had life insurance on my father and it paid off after he died.  

you should check to find out if your father has any life insurance.  find out if he has planned anything for funeral expenses or where he wants to be buried or what church to do the funeral.  you should check to see how his bills look and what income he has and how his credit looks.

I cooked and cleaned for my parents.  I took care of their home.   I did their shopping for them and i paid their bills.  it was a 24/7 job and I had to give up most of my social life to watch them day and night.
Depending on where you live you may be qualified for a stipend, respite care and in home visits keep calling , follow up and apply for everything possible , this is a job in itself but once your set up it's everything. Don't put it off for even another hour, don't wait until your overwhelmed. Don't think of you put in the time you can then rest it will now happen/ pace yourself",2020-02-05 05:36:05,Sm1ThrowMeInTheTrash,ez7otd
,Advice Please,"So I have been caring for my husband for a little over 3 years. He has a seizure disorder, BPD, and other mental health issues. Honestly there are days that I just want to walk away. I never thought it would be this hard. This is not what I signed up for. I love him more than anything in the world. However, I feel like I've lost myself in caring for him. How can I care for him as well as make time for myself? I struggle with feeling guilty any time I leave him to his own devices to do anything I need to do. He's extremely dependent on me to the point that he insists on riding with me even to the gorcery store. It gets annoying and difficult to do things on my own. Any advice on how to do that without making him feel slighted or abandoned?","Does he have family nearby? I'd ask someone or a few someones to commit to regular visits so you can get some away time. Some ins will pay for adult day care or home visits. Don't feel guilty, that's not what anyone expects in life. You deserve to live too!!
Seizures and anxiety... are you in a Medical Marijuana or Legal state/country?
Schedule some therapy sessions for yourself.  When it comes time to go, if he gets anxious, rather than cancelling, tell him he’ll just have to go too!  Win-Win!

What type of seizures does he have?  Grand mail?  Have you seen the seizures yourself?  I’m wondering about his several seizures, at home alone, while you’re gone.
Hi! Sorry to hear how you're feeling... I've been there myself to some extent. I've posted about this before, but my advice is to be open to talking. The fact that you can recognise there is a problem is a good start. Going on to such forums is a great starting point. I myself have used [https://healthunlocked.com/](https://healthunlocked.com/). They are such a supportive group of people - extremely kind. Now all else I know is from what I've read online: [https://www.guardiancarers.co.uk/care-information/feelings-being-carer](https://www.guardiancarers.co.uk/care-information/feelings-being-carer). 

Carer guilt is so common and it's nothing you should be ashamed of. As much as you love your husband, you need to look after yourself too. I suggest you take some time for yourself. For me, meditation in the morning worked. (To be honest, I did not live in the same house as my grandmother, but it was still very demanding caring for her almost every day). Try to meet some friends for even one hour or speak on the phone to whoever you're close to and might understand. Also, if you feel like your husband is too dependent on you, have you given any thought to getting a carer to come in for a few hours per day? Or even per week? This would also offer you some time to focus on yourself and your health.",2020-01-29 14:28:45,mlweeks,evrqln
,just one big mistake.,i hate my life. i hate the choices i've made.,"What happened?
It makes my heart want to reach through the screen reading this. I don't know if any words I can muster here will make any difference at all but I know everything passes and this too shall and you will be free again of whatever current situation you feel trapped in right now. I know it helps little to hear but hang in there and do what you can to take care of yourself to feel some relief. I hope things get better sooner than later.
You may hate your life & the choices that led you here, but don't ever forget that what you are doing is a remarkable thing -- caregiving, especially for someone you love/hate, does  great job of taking all the joy out of life.  Your obvious ability to manage this for 2 years says you a) have tremendous character, b) great strength & fortitude, and c) endurance.  This is the kind of character discovery people plan great adventures to search for.  As you well know at this point, no travel is needed, your character can be found at the bottom of a pool of diarrhea on the floor.  

Try writing.  At least once a day and any time you feel overwhelmed, write.  Make yourself do it if necessary, which it will be if you're not comfortable with writing, force yourself to do 3 pages before you stop, make yourself do it every day, or maybe twice a day.  Write out what you are thinking, feeling,  whatever pops into your mind.  No matter how ugly or hateful or negative or resentful or bitter, pour it onto the page.  Forget grammar, and spelling, just write.    If the only thing you can think is 'f\*\*k this, i hate this, this is bullsh\*t', then write that for 3 pages.   Then throw those pages away, shred them, burn them.  Do not re-read them, do not leave them where anyone else can read them.  Just write them and trash them. 

I cannot explain why or how, but this will help.  No you won't suddenly see the world differently, you won't develop great insights or find yourself writing a bestseller, it's more like drainage, it gets all the stuff swirling around in your brain out so you can think better, gets those feelings into words so you can feel better.  Etc Etc.  It's cheap, it's something almost everyone can do, even caregivers with their overwhelming responsibilies, and it helps.",2020-01-26 08:49:32,,eu6wiq
,If you have a loved one being cared for at a facility teach them to make specific requests rather than say...help me.,"I have watched more than a few older people being ignored with a request of ..please help me..help me..or I need help.. As an excuse for ignoring them, the staff will sometimes claim the patient is senile.

Better to teach your loved one to say..I need a blanket..I need a cup of water..etc. and they are somewhat less likely to be ignored.","I work one-on-one with an elderly lady who has dementia and brain damage from a couple strokes.

All she says all day is ""come here, help me, come here"" and when you go in, she doesn't need help. She tends to get ignored a lot because... Well, if they don't need help and you have other people who actually need help you don't make the time for them.

It shouldn't be that hard to just ask if she needs anything. But I wonder if those people are similar to her and that's why the staff is ignoring them.",2020-01-25 16:47:59,jenniferami,etx6z1
,Any advice for someone who wants to take care of a parent in the future?,"I [23F] have been telling my mom [53F] that I would take care of her when the time comes. She's the most important person in my life to me, and I can't think about her being on the hands of an unknown person.

Luckily, my family has good genetics, and I guess I have over 20 years until the day of taking her under my wing comes, but it can also mean taking care of her husband [48M] if they stay together, which I kind doubt, but who knows?

It can also hurt my father's [54M] feelings because I want NOT have him in my home when he gets older. 

So, what kind of preparation do I need to do in order to make this work? Any tips on caring for two elders? Any tips on how to avoid people shoving my dad into my house? 

TIA!","First thing I would do is make an appointment with a lawyer and have them make a living will (and regular will) and give you power of attorney, which of course you wouldn’t have to use unless something happened. My husband and I did this about 2-3 years ago on advice of a friend, and last year he had a stroke. I could not believe that without the POA, I couldn’t access accounts, and medical and disability insurance people literally would not talk to me until I had faxed the POA. 
Theres lots of other stuff too, I’ll try to compile a short list of tips. 
Ask them to write down their passwords for everything also.
If you can swing it, a separate and independent space within your property. Something that would give her and you some privacy and independence.
In housing, we found it helpful to have less stairs (or at least not very steep and winding), wider doorways and hallways (in case mobility becomes an issue and they need a cane, companion, wheelchair, etc) and a shower stall that's big enough for a plastic chair (a tub can be difficult to step over). 

Second on getting a list of all the (medical, insurance, bills, address book, etc) information and paperwork in order as well as seeing if she is willing to talk to you about her wishes on life sustaining treatments.
Some solid estate planning is in order. it's time to visit in the state attorney, and to go over the wishes of all the adults involved.

I think it's very noble that you want to help your family. But I suggest you strongly think about this before you bring up doing this for your family. Will you be working? do you know what aid they might qualify for? What happens if they become ill or otherwise unable to care for themselves when you have very young children? What happens if you become ill and unable to take care of them, and they have spent years planning on that? I would recommend looking into contingency plans.

At what point would you be comfortable putting them in a nursing home? some people might progress through the end stages quickly, and so they won't need a nursing home. Some may be bedridden for years on end.

I would strongly recommend getting in contact with hospice organizations in your area and volunteering. I think this is something people should really see firsthand before they voluntarily take it on for their parents. 

Other than that, I'm not sure there is any way to avoid criticism if you choose not to take on your dad. people outside of the situation will not understand. You'll have to decide what your level of comfort is there.
Maybe have them look into long term care insurance so a nursing home would be a more affordable option at some time.

Tell them to think long and hard about living wills. If they are ever declared senile they cant change them. Many are designed in a way that water, food other than by mouth is not allowed in certain situations as well as other things they might want. As an alternative have them look at a more prolife ""will to live"" so they know what they are signing and can make a more informed decision.

As the population ages I see more of a push by hospitals, doctors, social workers and governments to get rid of older people. Sad but true. 

http://www.nrlc.org/medethics/willtolive/states/
Honestly, don't. I said the same thing to my mom, and it ended in her going to a nursing home because the amount of care she needed was way beyond what I could provide. You have incredibly genuine intentions, but it's not fair to you. Your life will be put on hold, you will be isolated from friends, family, and lose out on work opportunities.  Also the mental toll that comes with things will literally drain you of everything. This is something that if you can talk about beforehand, you need to prevent and have as many people as possible that will help when the time comes. Sorry if it sounds depressing, but it is. I've been taking care of my mum since I was a kid. Full time since I was about ~20 y.o. and I'm almost 28 now. She's in a nursing home after some incredibly traumatic events and it will only get worse tbh.
Financial planning.  As in, accumulate as much money as possible because money is the key to caregiving without misery.  Money means you can hire assistants, purchase equipment, etc.  

Though I understand your promise, 20 years is a very long time and anything can happen, so it's important to remember the intent -- which is to ensure your mother is cared for.  It sounds like you're already doing the realistic planning that can be done -- formalizing everyone's wishes, establishing practical plans for money and medical care (how do they feel about hospice care, etc) and legal issues.  Beyond that, it will depend -- Alzheimers care is vastly different from caring for someone who had a stroke, for example -- and you can't do any practical planning until it happens.  Kudos to you for caring and thinking ahead.",2020-01-19 07:59:35,FearlessnessPit,eqvxqk
,"If caregivers are so noble, admirable, heroic","1. Why they cant get financial support?
2. Why they cant get paid lot of money when they're done caregiving?
3. Why they cant get help via aides to do the work for them?
4. Why they dont have a job waiting for them when their duties end?
5. Why they cant get a support network when they're done caregiving.
6. Why they cant get a apartment waiting for them when theyre done caregiving.
7. Why they cant get a package of movies, anime, video games that they had to miss out because their finances had to support them?
8. Why they dont get assistance traveling overseas to relax after years of forced caregiving?
9. Why they cant get medical help for all the treatments and checkups they have to forgo while caregiving their loved ones?
10. Why they cant get any help after their duties end?

If caregivers are considered so noble to assfarting people, why they cant get anyjelp when we do reach out? And why we are treated as garbage by society and rejected when we try to reintergate.

I heard the words admirable, noble, heroic too many times and everytime I hear it feel shit.

This country does not care about the wellbeing of informal caregivers at all. People give us platitudes and refuse to help, and when we are done they actively reject barriers that prevent reintegration: Such as bad credit, social alienation, and picky employers that reject caregivers with valuable skills because of a long gap and temp agencies that wont touch them because of a long gap.

Almost no one cares about informal caregivers especially young caregivers, even when they're done caregiving. They just expect them to exist so when they reach out for help they spout their worthless platirudes to them.","I just broke down on the phone with the social worker for hospice. My grandma is at a point where she’s not hardly opening her eyes, she’s been refusing food and meds, she can barely formulate sentences. 

I feel like a failure, like maybe there was more I could have done before we got to this point. But in the end, I realized that it was too much and I did need to seek help from a nursing home and then hospice. 

I wish people weren’t all talk when it comes to caregivers. The Medicaid application shouldn’t have taken so long to process, long term care in this country shouldn’t be in such a sorry state, family should be more willing to help.

I’m endlessly angry at my grandmother’s niece and nephew for not coming around.
I felt this way when I left being a professional caregiver. Last person I worked for who owned the building said I’d be wasting my time leaving this profession for something like the non-admirable, non-heroic pencil-pushing office job that I do now.

Hilariously, I get paid more doing entry level office work than some of the caregiving gigs I’ve had. I don’t get my ass beat by dementia patients on a daily basis, I don’t clock in 12 or 16 hour days anymore where I don’t even get a pee-break.

And I did this -paid-.

I can’t imagine what the hell it’s like doing this out of nothing more than love for a relative or compassion for someone in your life who has no one else, and without support. If it was hard enough for me to transition to “normal” life after what was just a career change, I can’t even begin to suppress my anger at how terrible it must be to have to give up EVERYTHING to care for your loved one, and then have nothing but some empty sympathies and a ridiculous uphill battle to transition back to life after being an unpaid caregiver.

I’ve said it somewhere else and I’ve said it here —- our system is a joke.
Why doesn't the society care about caregivers?  Because caregiving, like every other type of Housework, is considered a ""duty"".  It's morally/ethically required, not lauded, not assisted.  

That's how it been for generations when very few people got sick enough, or  old enough slow enough, to need care.  Most old folks stroked out, coughed themself to death in a few weeks, died in childbirth, or the like.  The very sick weren't saved: diabetics always died; the gluten intolerant always died; neurological issues, bad eyes, bad organs, sudden allergies, digestive problems, all of those things that Modern Medicine has fixed: those sufferers died.  Only a handful stayed alive long enough to become feeble.  

Look at Dementia patients.  Now we have the unholy concatenation of modern medicine... and a social prohibition against suicide.  So far too many people are alive in hideous states and we won't let them end their own suffering... but we do force caregivers to care for these poor people.  These people who, in their right minds, would never want to be in such horrid conditions, aren't given that choice.  To live as endless, degrading children with nothing to look forward to, ever, except for increasing burdens until suffering is stopped only by death.  And we force those caregivers to these hideous tasks with guilt, shame, sadness, poverty, pity... all the horrid bad emotions.  Nothing good.  

Contrast this to motherhood.  It's a draining, thankless, unpaid, frequently debilitating task that takes years or decades to bring to conclusion.  People who do it are almost always worse off financially than those who don't: beyond the Motherhood Penalty, those hours creating new citizens are not repaid.  Very few if any parents earn social credits toward Social Security or healthcare or any other assistance just by having children. However NOT doing this isn't really punished much anymore: childfree people are becoming much more common.  So women are choosing not to have children, especially in countries where the financial/social rewards for motherhood are much less than optimum, and there aren't any financial penalties to that choice, unlike the financial burdens of caregiving.  Women are opting out of this caregiving task because there are very few things forcing them to it.  This is not true for caring for the disabled, or the chronically ill. 

So society isn't set up to help caregivers any more than it's set up to ensure stay-at-home-moms have comfortable retirements.  Those (unpaid) jobs aren't considered paying jobs because they never were... even though they damn sure should be now.   

The Boomers are getting older.  They're living MUCH longer than the Silents did.  Maybe when Gen X/Millennials finish burying their Elders, they'll find the time to make laws for caregivers.  After all, if it costs $4,000/month for Grandma's paid caregivers, why should Grandpa's family be forcee to do it for free?
I'm 28 and just inherited my mother's house after she had to go into a nursing home. I lost my youth from caregiving. Now that I own a home from caregiving, I'm expected to pay ALL THE BILLS, including tax, mortgage, utilities, etc. I don't have enough leftover for food and ""government assistance"" wants me to volunteer in order to receive $50... A month. Currently searching for a new job since mine refuses to give me more hours or a raise.
Your words are so relatable! I somehow believe that you are right but think that caring for someone is the best service you can do. May be a caregiver is the one who is born to care and help and not to receive. May be a caregiver is strong enough to manage his/her tough time at its own.

,Abuse? Possible TW,"So, my GMIL, Meemaw is abusive. I take care of her full time. I am told on a daily basis how I am ripping away her life, screamed at for making her drink water, told that I'm being mean for making her take her medication for CHF, berated for the fact our toddler is messy (sorry I can't control that), while having her turn my son into a tool for her manipulation. Last Saturday screaming at my husband and I till she ended up throwing her phone at my husband, grabbed him, left marks on him, then grabbed me while holding our toddler and screamed in our faces that we are horrible people. We ended up having to pack our 5 month old and toddler in the car and driving away while she screamed at us. My in-laws just laughed and said ""THAT'S MEEMAW!"" Um excuse me? How come no one told me this? Why are my in-laws so laissez faire about this? On Sunday though my MIL and FIL offered to let us move into a house they are planning on buying (they want the land for hunting and if someone lives there the meth head won't come and set up a lab on their land... again🤦‍♀️) if we take that offer though, the state will take her into their custody. After nearly 5 months of her screaming at me daily I want to throw my hands up and tell them to take her away. Am I being cruel if I cannot deal with this and have her sent away? GFIL said ""Nelbells8 you are delusional if you imagined you could care for her till she died, she will eventually be institutionalized don't feel bad."" But I do... I just also don't know if I can put up with this treatment much longer.","Run... my kids have deal with my mother in my home. Before she was medicated she was a shit talker. You can tell a difference between my 3 kids that were NOT raised with her and the two that were.  So my advise get the hell out now with those kids. If i knew I would not have done it. Thank God she is medicated now.
Caregiving is a hard job. You not only have to take care of your child but this woman too. It’s not bad to have someone else care for her or put her in a facility. Don’t let any one tell you otherwise they didn’t step up to care for her but you did. The only thing to worry about is whether or not her care somewhere else is adequate and keeps her engaged and still lets her be her. Sometimes dementia causes personality changes like that or just the fact that her independence is slowly going from her it can be scary thing and is blaming you. Probably none of this helped but you’re not in the wrong for wanting to get away.
I don’t think it’s wrong for you to make that choice. I’m a caregiver and an RBT therapist, and caregiving is a hard job regardless of the situation and it’s so important you find time to care for yourself while caring for others and this situation is so toxic for both you, your spouse and your children. It’s not like you’re abandoning her, but you’re putting yourselves in a better situation and possibly even her.
It sounds like GMIL has been abandoned already before you came along, which probably adds to the guilt. That isn't the case, you can just shift your care from the front lines to a managerial position. You will be less stressed and have more resources/braincells to take care of her! It'll just be a different aspect of caregiving and love. 

For example, keep an eye on the facilities, praise/report the facility if there are inconsistencies, etc. You would not only be trying to protect her but others living there who do not have anyone else to look out for them.

. .. .and of course, you can visit in person too, but it doesn't sound like she'd appreciate it. Bring goodies for the facility's employees and her caregivers instead :D!",2020-01-08 18:20:08,nelbells8,em0rdr
,I need advice,I recently became a caregiver for my father in law. He has late onset Alzheimer's. He has issues sleeping which is driving his wife absolutely crazy because then she doesn't get any sleep either. What can I do to help him with this? Something to help him sleep?,"Is he taking meds? Definitely something to talk to his doctor about, add something like Seroquel or a sleep aid/adjust current meds. Unfortunately there’s not much you can do from a holistic/home remedy aspect as Alzheimer’s literally is a restructuring of the brain’s neural pathways so there is no longer an understanding of night time vs daytime. Encouraging him to not sleep a lot during the day is something but not always a possibility. 

Also, my heart goes out to you and his family. It’s an incredibly tough disease and the bigger your support network (caregivers, doctors, Hospice, support groups) the less difficult it will be. Sending love.
My fiancé also has sleep issues but he has sz. The medications help, but he often refuses to take them. I’ve found that spraying lavender all through the bedroom tires him out quickly and helps him fall asleep. Even if he doesn’t stay asleep long, it gives me a little more time to sleep
My mom is going through the stages of dementia and slowly working towards Alzheimer's.  Although she gets tired easily, we still encourage her to take supervised walks outside, around the neighborhood and in different stores/venues.  She'll get some exercise and will exert herself.  Later on, feeling tired overtakes her restlessness and she'll be able to sleep longer.  We've recently tried sleep-aids and they seem to work, but I try to use them as sparingly as possible.  It's a tough road, especially for the caregiver, but know that when their time here on Earth is done, that you did what you could to help them in their time of need.  

Stay strong.
It's really challenging to offer care to the ones with Alzheimer's. The best way is to ensure, by any means, that your father-in-law doesn't take a nap in the morning. Also, you cannot deny the fact that medication is must in this case. Consult your doctor and give him appropriate medication that surely isn't the ultimate solution, but it will help. Ensure he isn't in any pain as this could be an unknown fact that is causing night trouble.",2020-01-08 02:19:11,redheadjax6233,elpfui
,Disability assistance for my wife and FMLA support for me,"Kind of a 2 parter here. I'll give you back story:

My wife (26) has many chronic illnesses that make her unable to work, but it's difficult for many to understand this. Her disabilities often fluctuate and there are days where she can go out and be on her feet all day having no problem, but others where she'll struggle just to get around the house. On top of her physical disabilities she also has sever depression and anxiety, as well as bipolar. The stars rarely align where she is physically and mentally well, making it impossible for her to keep a job. Last year she got pregnant and had to be induced this past month. Our baby is having to stay in the NICU at the hospital. My wife had multiple complications, was hospitalized for almost 2 weeks, and almost died but is now recovering at home. 

I am a teacher (24) with a part time job that keeps us afloat, but I often have to sacrifice my schedule and work to help her. She takes care of herself as much as she can but I often have to carry a lot of the load for her. I organize and administer medications, contact doctors, cook, run errands, do the majority of the chores around the house, sometimes even help her dress and shower. I don't have any problem helping her, but recently we've run into some financial/support issues, which is what I am here to ask about.


1) My wife is having issues obtaining disability assistance. Even is she doesn't qualify because of my income, her medical bills put extreme stress on our finances. Last year half of our income went to her insurance, medical bills, and prescriptions. She applied for assistance in May 2019 and received a few letters (to which she responded appropriately) asking for more information and informing her of court dates (that she can't attend due to her anxiety). Since August or September she hasn't received anything else and doesn't know who to contact or if she even can contact anyone.

The social security office here is shit, basically they just have you wait for 45 minutes and then redirect you to the website. Where can she get help with this?


2) Is there anyway I can get financial assistance for caring for her since she isn't on disability assistance? I received FMLA through my school district but they don't offer ANY paid leave (FMLA eats through your sick days then it's unpaid) and we cannot afford for me to have any unpaid days. School starts back up Monday and I don't want to leave her since her recovery has been a roller coaster but we wanted to save my remaining sick days for when the baby comes home, since I know my wife will need help then. 

Any and all advice is welcome. I'm at a loss and I'm 10 miles past burned out. Winter break was supposed to be my time to recouperate but instead I've been caring for my wife and child nonstop and felt more stress than I thought possible. 

Thank you in advance","For disability most people will get denied the first time. From my understanding the best/fastest was is to hire an attorney that specializes in disability. They usually get paid once disability is won (typically they go after and get back benefits, so what she should have gotten if she wasn't denied the first time. This is where they take their fee).

There may be compensation for you as her care taker, it will depend on your state/city. You can try the dept of aging or adult services. You can also try speaking with her insurance company about getting some inhome help, they may or may not cover part of it. 

Also, speak with her physicians and see what if anything they suggest. 

If she has any hospital stays reach out to the social worker that works at the hospital, they usually know a ton about what is available in your area. 

There are also caretaking groups on facebook where you might be able to find more information.

You need to get a good disability lawyer who can handle the process of applying for disability for you, they can even show up in your place to represent you in court proceedings. There are two basic disability programs: SSDI (Social Security Disability which is not income-based and the payout for monthly benefits is higher) or SSI (income based disability for people with low income and looser work restrictions). My lawyer told me to apply for both so if I get denied for one then I would still have a shot at the other one as a fall back. You probably won't get approved for SSI as it is based on income but she should have a shot at SSDI, it really depends on how well her conditions are documented in her medical records and how much her Doctors are going to be willing to work with Social Security or your lawyer. A good disability lawyer will walk you through the process and go through the process of getting your claim approved. One really important thing is even though your wife has disabling physical conditions she may have an easier time getting approved for the mental illness. If you put in a claim for the mental illnesses as her primary issues then just add on the physical conditions to strengthen your claim it may be approved quicker and with less effort. My main diagnosis is bipolar and I was approved realativley quick compared to other people. You are going up against one of the World's largest bureaucracies so it is good to have the help of an experienced disability lawyer; plus how much they can charge you is capped by law. If you have any questions about applying then just let me know. It took me about 10 months from initally applying to approval and I did get rejected the first time, I was supposed to go to a hearing but they looked at my file and approved my claim without the need of a hearing. The best thing about using a lawyer is they do most of the dealing with Social Security because dealing with them is EXTREMELY frustrating! The lawyer will also go through the trouble of obtaining all of your wife's medical records. I don't think you qualify for any programs that will pay for you to take care of your wife. usually only Medicaid would cover that and you probably don't qualify for Medicaid due to your income. When your wife is hospitalized next you may want to talk to a social worker, they can help steer you in the direction of some services. There may be programs that are specific to your State that might help cover the cost of health insurance and the costs of prescriptions.
Do you have some nearby family or friends from church who can occasionally help out? You should not have to do it all by yourself. Also, even if she can’t get disability yet, maybe she can still get some state assistance if you qualify. Maybe she can get part-time in home care from an agency, if insurance covers it.",2020-01-03 21:00:13,themagiclander,ejpscb

,Need advice for parent,"About 10 years ago we had a grandparent die, the other committed suicide, and the rest of the family disintegrated. My mothers weight exploded and got diabetes and she had a stroke after smoking all her life. 

She survived and quit smoking. The past 10 years has been an f'ing struggle with her. My father and I were super supportive. Very patient with her. Getting her to be active and control her eating is like pulling teeth.  At this point she's barely hovering over the final step of being one of those bed-ridden overweight people. 

We try but it's become obvious there's some underlying psychological thing going on with her and we feel that it's part of what's holding her back from getting better. She keeps talking about slights that happened to her decades ago and about how terrible her family is. Things from when she was a child.  She has this victims mentality and uses it to avoid having to do anything at all around the house. Not only chores but just simply getting up to grab something 5 feet away. She howls in pain whenever she moves but we've been around her enough to know she's not in pain, it's discomfort or minor pain from not being active. And she makes excuses not to do anything. We get her to go to the store and the walk from the car to the store was ""too much for her"".  I tell her it was good that she was winded from it because it means she's exercising but she treats it as a serious thing that must have been avoided. My dad got angry with her one day and she had to shower on her own which she was able to do just fine. But she told me she only did it because he pissed her off and she did it just to spite him and I'm thinking.....why the hell aren't you doing it yourself all the time then? 

It's a lot worse than I'm putting down to save you guys some reading. Basically it's come to the point where both me and my father has snapped on occasion. We wait on her hand and foot 24/7 when even the doctors has said she's totally fine now she just needs to lose the weight. After a few days of us getting angry she goes back to her ways. We've both told her she needs to be more independent, just a tiny bit would be a huge burden off our backs. I work full time and go to school full time and when I'm not doing that I'm in front of my computer waiting for her to yell for something. I don't have a life. No friends or anything. I'm in my 30s and feel like my life is over at this point and I'm just waiting out the clock it to end hopefully quick and painlessly.

My father and I decided on looking into a therapist for her. I feel like she has a lot to unpack and needs to start dealing with this from the bottom up. We're tried speaking to her but honestly we're over our heads and we need outside help. 

My question is who should we been looking for? A specific type of therapist? Some other type of person?","I can't offer any advice regarding a therapist, though getting one involved sounds like a good idea. This sounds like a very complicated situation, but if I'm reading this right, you're saying your mother is ABLE to do things for herself, and just isn't willing. Is that correct?

If so, then by waiting on her hand and foot, you and your dad are actually enabling her behaviors. Why should she want to get up and get something when it's so much easier to have someone else do it for her? This can get tricky when there are legitimate medical issues involved and you aren't sure what's real vs. what's invented. But again, from what I'm reading it sounds like your mom has gotten used to having personal servants. She isn't going to be interested in changing as long as someone is willing to serve her.

Assuming there is no medical reason she can't take care of herself, let her do it - or not, but that's on her. If you don't bring her something to eat, she'll eventually get hungry enough to get up and get it herself. If your dad refuses to ""help"" her shower, she may sit there and stink for a while but eventually she will realize that if she wants to be clean, she's going to have to take the initiative.

 If she's anything like my grandmother, she may rant/rave/try to guilt trip you into doing things for her, but you have to resist. And your dad will have to agree to stop catering to her also. You both need to set clear boundaries of what you want to do/are willing to do, and make it clear what you won't do.

It's not right for you and your dad to have to take on these responsibilities if she is able to do for herself and just won't.
A family therapist (LMFT) is gonna be your best bet, if it’s not a diagnosed condition you want to look for someone who can help her unpack her trauma and take responsibility for her actions, figure out the root causes of her issues, etc. From that might come a diagnosis and then they can either work with a psychiatrist or another specialist (nutritionist, etc) to come up with a care plan. 

It’s probably going to be very hard to get her to go initially and to be honest my recommendation would be for you and your dad to actually go to a few sessions together or apart first to give the therapist an understanding of the situation and get a professional opinion, and then do family sessions. It will be intense but hopefully it’ll be enough to get her to go on her own. The thing I have learned over the years with my own crazy family is that it is very difficult to get someone to make any progress if they aren’t voluntarily seeking help.
I was in a similar situation to yours. One other piece of advice I have is, be consistent in your boundaries. 

If you and your Dad say you’re not going to help her take a shower, then you should never help her take a shower. Be prepared for drama like, “Help! I fell in the shower,” etc. But, just pick a few boundaries and stick with them. 

Another approach with your boundaries is to explain to her, “You did a great job taking your own shower, and that’s a piece of human dignity you’re entitled to. I am so glad you’ve regained that ability, and I really respect you for taking that back for yourself.” Then don’t back down if there is whining about it. 

In my family member’s case, the dignity thing started to work somewhat, but it took several years (sorry).
Separate from any mental issues (likely), she may be in real pain. A family member is gaining weight, and he's a dangerous 275lbs, and I too don't know what to do to help him. Is she on psych meds?
Hi. First of all, salute to your patience! You are doing a tremendous job. Regarding therapist, i can suggest you should consider a family therapist but let's keep that the last option available.

As you mentioned that your mother is totally fine but need to reduce weight and improve her mental health, the thing that would play a crucial role is positive motivation from your end. No one else could help her in a way that you could. Cheer her up and motivate her to lose weight. Tell her she's beautiful and give her complement for every small effort she makes in losing weight. I bet you will see an improvement in her overall mental and physical health.

Try to make her smile and most importantly, don't negatively motivate her. Give her the food she adores in little quantities and you could bribe her to get started with simple walking. Don't just feed her in the bed. Ensure she does efforts in getting up for a reason she can't neglect.

Complement her: ""You are looking beautiful today and i think you have reduced some weight"". You can ask the same from your acquaintances. This gonna help a lot! 

Place her favorite food in the kitchen in the beginning and create an instance when she's hungry and gets up to take the food herself.

DON'T FORGET POSITIVE MOTIVATION. Cheer her up and always greet her with smile:) As this was something similar I have seen with one of my colleagues. It works! God bless you all!",2019-12-26 13:05:23,Zebee47,efynk3
,Spending Christmas Alone,"I spent it alone, I’ve only called my parents to say merry Christmas and see how they were all doing including my autistic brother. And the only thing I ate is a large baked chicken I’ve bought two weeks ago that I didn’t had the motivation to eat until today. And someone had to audacity on Reddit to insist I have a merry Christmas, even though I expressed misery.

As for my relatives that refused to help or didn’t want to help, I can tell you straight up, that none of them offered me or my parents any help since I moved away. None of them. More proof that caregivers are just disposable and just told to shove themselves back into the job market. It worth nothing that none of them called me to say Merry Christmas, not even my friends or people I know who I contact on a regular basis. I basically don’t exist.

So yeah a person with autism who has his life destroyed by caregiving, and no relative or friend or loved one to spend time with on Christmas. More proof that ex-caregivers are worthless to society despite how “noble” and “admirable” they are. But not noble enough for society to help them when they’re done caregiving and when isolated and alienated.

And no, I'm not in merry mood and people giving me unsolicited videos trying to make me happy are doing it to make themselves happy.","Bullseye. I'm starting to feel it. I don't need the faux respect. 

Looking at your relatives in the best light, maybe they wanted to help but ""were never asked."" That's common in ""old world"" cultures. Or, that it just wasn't going to happen in this lifetime.

I'd guess that to most Christians, it just means they're wishing you well in some sense. But yeah, I don't need that either.
Jkid is complaining that no one helps him when his parents are literally paying for a home in DC that’s in jkids name. I wish my relatives were so unhelpful that they shelled out like $1700 a month to buy me a house
Not gonna lie, that shit sucks. Hands down, without a doubt, unequivocally. You don't need or want words of comfort so I won't offer any but you are heard and validated even if it's not from the people you need to be heard by and validated from.

,Way to Memorialize Loved One Before Death,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

My SO's father doesn't have much time left. Maybe a few years, if we're lucky. I know it's going to be devastating to my SO when he eventually passes, so I want to take advantage of the time we have left with him and memorialize him in some way. I was thinking a video clip or something that he can take every day that I can give to my SO and his sister when their father dies.

Does anyone have any suggestions here, any ways I can start to help them remember him?","I saw a couple of books at Barnes and Noble the other night that might help. These are journals where each page has a question about the father’s life, experience, favorite memories, etc. You’d give the book to him and he’d fill it out. If he’s able to write and is interested, these might be good. Or you could ask him these questions and record his answers.

And there is *A Father‘s Legacy: your life story in your own words*, which says it has pages to fill out but it’s only shown as an e-book.
Ask about his favorite songs and favorite songs of his family members. You can add them to photograph collages or slideshows. Also get scrapbook photos or pages which the family would like to include.
You'd obviously want to get his permission first. But before I die I'm trying to get some video of me and various people just hanging out and shooting the shit. I've found that with the people I've lost that's one of the things I find myself pining for the most. We tend to make records of the singular and unusual parts of our lives. But it's those moments when we're just totally relaxed that I think often defines relationships with each other.

And also a pain to try to get solid video of. The more people aware that you're trying to make a video related to your death the less natural it gets. And I'll say that it's often hard enough to get people to stop treating you like glass even without anything added on. But I think if one 'can' manage to record a couple hours of just casually chilling with someone important it'd be one of the absolute best possible gifts for them when we're gone. 

Gmail also lets you schedule email for future dates. I'm planning on putting together some emails to people for the upcoming years/decades. The further in time it is the less reliable that kind of thing becomes. Google seems like it'll outlast all of us. But you never really know. But even if it's a roll of the dice I think that getting the occasional email from me after I'm gone will mean a lot to some people. And for me it means that I kinda get to be a part of some of their special moments that can be planned for. Important birthdays, graduations, etc. Even a chance to nag about eating right and what classes they might be taking :) Though in your case it might be more his style to hand write some letters or cards and entrust you to make sure they get to the right people when the time comes. I know it seems like it might also upset some people. I'd considered that kind of thing in the past and had previously decided against it. Right up until my wife left a card for me to find after she died. Finding that was the happiest moment I've had since losing her and it's one of my most treasured reminders of our connection.",2019-12-11 20:11:37,InternationalCreme4,e9ggfy

,"Is it normal to for a Neuropsychologist to quickly and aggressively separate you from relative you are a caretaker for, with a severe cognitive decline? I fear he may have sexually abused my relative.","
I am a caregiver to a relative with a severe cognitive decline; he has the mental capabilities of a 1 or 2 year old.

I visited a new Neuropsychologist with the patient and his mother. We were discussing the patient's history. Then he asked to see the patient by himself to access him. I was hesitant to do this, we have never done this before. I asked him if we can stay for the assessment. He then says that he always see's the patients alone. Then, he turns to be as says 'let me ask you this: Is there any reason you wouldn't want me to see him alone?'. The only thing I could think of is not the mentally handicapped are prone to sexual abuse, but I didn't want to accuse him, so I didn't say anything, left book stood outside the office. He mentioned earlier that he has contacts at top hospitals, and that he could get them to see him, so I didn't want to muddy our first impression. I was listening outside the door, the questions didn't seem too weird to me.

He then let us back in and we talked some more. But I was very uneasy. I think in rare occasions we had medical professional separate us before, and when they did, they were being slow and empathetic about it, they didn't make us make rush to any decision, and said it in a way of a suggestions.

This may just be a coincidental detail, but as I was leaving the building, I noticed that all the offices had a clear window, only the window of this particular Neuropsychologist had a frosted window that you couldn't see what was going on. It just may have been a coincidence, but I couldn't stop thinking about this detail.

We drove home, and as soon as I was alone with the relative, I asked him if he touched you. He said 'yes'. I asked him where did you touch you, he pointed to near under his stomach, but not near his genitals. The relative has a severe cognitive impairment, and often doesn't understand what you're asking of him, but his default answer is almost always 'no'. So I keep asking him several times, using variations of these questions, and where he touched you, but he was consistent each time. It's very unlikely that he was be this consistent if this didn't happen. I have been panicked every since. I don't know how to process this.","Depending on your state, like WA, you are suppose to report anything that makes you think sexual assault happens. Did he not have a nurse come in to? It's a little weird that he wouldn't let the caregiver in, all my clients doctor's want me there to fill in the blanks and make sense what they are saying.
I also find this a little weird. I’m a therapist for autistic patients and it’s required by our practice to have a parent/caregiver with them during therapy to avoid any muddy situations and protect patient dignity. This isn’t required by all practices but I feel like it’s good form. Even when I worked in a psych hospital we couldn’t be in a patient’s room with the door closed we had to leave it open so the cameras could see us. Neuropsychologists are a little different though and in my experience they do typically see patients on their own - but I’m not sure if there are caveats depending on the mental state of the patient. I’m a caregiver for my fiancé with schizophrenia and I’m only allowed into some of his appointments unless he requests they bring me in (he usually does). So maybe if the person you’re caring for requests either you or the son come in it may be an easy fix? Not sure though. 

Depending on the state there may be laws saying they must have a nurse present. 

I would look into your local laws.",2019-11-09 15:53:57,ThrowAwayCogg,du1kqw
,Losing friends because you’re a caregiver?,"Has this happened to anyone else? So many “friends” have stopped talking to me because instead of running away I chose to be my fiancé’s caregiver when he got extremely sick with a mental illness. A lot of people don’t really understand how mental illness works, and there’s a lot of stigma so I’ve kind of just accepted that those people were uneducated and maybe were never my friends to begin with. Now my best friend and I had a falling out because she’s constantly making really awful and mean jokes about my fiancé’s mental health, and talking about it behind my back (I found out when an acquaintance asked me about it and I had never told him anything). I told her that while I understand she thinks she’s funny the things she says hurt me - and see proceeded to scream at me and say really horrific things about him, the fact that I care for him (he’s since stabilized and is almost completely back to baseline so it’s become significantly less labor intensive) and that saying the mean things she does helps her own mental health and makes her feel “sane” about her own life’s choices. It devastated me because she’s the only consistent person in my life for the most part. Even my parents, who are so lovely, are upset that I stayed when my fiancé got sick. They used to love him, now were fighting because they don’t want him to spend the holidays with the family - and that’s been tradition for years (we’ve been together since high school). We were that weird family who all wore matching Christmas pajamas and did EVERYTHING together. My fiancé has been very accepting because he knows when he got sick he had some personality changes and while they’re no longer an issue he can understand their reluctance. My mom later said she’d revisit the issue. I just feel like I’m losing everyone else in my life because for a year my fiancé was extremely sick and I stayed. He never hurt me, he never did anything outright wrong. Has anyone else gone through this weird isolation of people who don’t understand","Different circumstances, but yeah. I lost all my friends when I was taking care of my mom. I spiraled into depression when I was taking care of her; it was like a weird feedback loop. I wasn't getting any support, which made me depressed, which my ""friends"" felt was intolerable. I also had to decline a LOT of invitations.

My relationships never recovered. I did try, after she died, to re-engage. But it just never worked out. Id ask if someone wanted to get together, and was basically rejected. And at my age, it's very difficult to make new friends.
Hi I think this is very common. Sometimes carer groups can help but tbh I feel not much connection there as my local group is much much older than I am. Sorry to hear about your family and friend. This kind of situation really tests those relationships.
I need to be honest: your best friend doesn't sound like the kind of person you would want to have as your rock long-term.

I realize that mental illness, especially those that can cause sudden and dramatic shifts in mood or personality can seem ""crazy"" from an outside lens but making fun of and talking behind your back is not okay.  Her then screaming at you when you brought up that it was hurtful is unacceptable.
I can sadly say that it's not the first time I read this story. I've been through a similar thing too with two of my friends. When I was caring for my grandmother who has dementia I had to spend a lot of time with her, checking in on her all the time, taking time off work as well. It got too be too much. I almost reached breaking point after4  years of caring for her. I've put my life on hold and lost those 2 friends of mine. Some have stuck by me and are my friends for life.

I completely understand what you're going through. It's hard to make people understand, when they don't want to understand. I've through so many rough times.... I tried to put off visiting my grandmother to hang out with my ""friends"". I was down and feeling guilty all the time. It was a vicious circle. I think you're lucky that you made your way to forums. These were my escape back then and still are in some way. Before going to bed or on my lunch break I would always go on forums for advice and read in order to make myself believe. There are some great resources online. [https://www.guardiancarers.co.uk/care-information/feelings-being-carer](https://www.guardiancarers.co.uk/care-information/feelings-being-carer)

Also, carersuk have a great forum, where you can find lovely people with the same experiences. That has been a great place for me. And what else can I say, friends come and go.

,Showering,"Uno reverse card here: my sister cares for me and helps me shower, but we have figured out no way to do so without her getting completely soaked. For reference, we’re both very petite and she doesn’t lift me.","A detachable showerhead did wonders for keeping me dry while helping my grandmother. And the other thing that got me wet was runoff from her bench, so I just started putting a folded towel in the way of the flow of water to absorb/divert the water another direction.
This is assuming you can move to a shower bench. So you're going to need two shower curtain liners, one on each side of the tub. You close the liners and then stick your arm in and use the attachable shower head. You move one of the shower curtain liners, usually the one you put in the back of the tub, put it in front of you kind of like a shield. Put towels on the floor in front of the tub so the floor doesn't get soaked.

There is a lot of trial and error here so you're going to have to figure out good positioning for the both of you. Hope this helps.",2019-11-03 07:37:43,yelloitsselma,dqztvj

,I’m reaching my breaking point,"I feel like I’m living my worst nightmare. There is no way that I’m going to leave, but I am now the sole caregiver for my mother who is on hospice for copd and has borderline personality disorder. She was physically and emotionally abusive my entire life. She is very cruel now. 

It is physically exhausting; she treats me like her personal assistant, on the better days; and I feel angry and resentful that I gave up life in another country where I had finally begun to work at my dream career to sleep in the living room and not talk to another living being. I want a job! I want friends! I want to leave the house! 

Again— I will not leave her. There is no one else. What do I do?","Talk to your hospice nurses. See if you can speak to a social worker. Tell them that you are at wit's end and that you need respite assistance.

Ask your nurses to help you train your mother with some coping skills so that she can be independent for a few hours a day.
You should google a support group in your area ASAP.  You are mining a marathon and sounds like you know you won’t stop but need a little push. Life is long, this is just the uphill bit.
I have no advice, but I deeply sympathize with you. I was in a situation with an uncle. Being the only family nearby, it was expected that I should care for him. He was charming to everyone but me. To me he was abusive and demanding and sexually inappropriate. He made every task ten times harder than it needed to be. He pretty much ruined my life for 6 years. It all ended after I made arrangements with a care giving agency to assist him with his shopping, cleaning and doctor visits every week. And two members of my family are splitting the cost with me. Then I upped and moved across country. I still have what I can only describe as extreme anxiety every time I have to deal with anything on his regard. I myself am retired, and my income puts me below the poverty level. So providing for his care, even partially, is a huge financial burden in me.

And here is what helped me make my decision to remove myself physically from his life: when I asked our state’s Elder Care department for some help with him, they could not provide any services because he could toilet himself, feed himself, dress himself, bathe himself, manage his own check book and bills, and could make his own transportation arrangements to get to the grocery store and the doctor. So, after that call, I thought “Well why the heck am I doing all this for him, putting up with his abuse and getting suicidal in the process? The state says he’s independent!” I called the helper agency, and packed my bags.

This man is not even a blood relative to me (my deceased Aunt’s husband), so I can only image all the mixed feelings you must be experiencing right now. My heart goes out you! Maybe a support group could help you set limits and boundaries, and give you space to grieve for all you’ve lost. 

Perhaps hospice can help you determine what care your mom actually needs, as opposed to what she wants. If in fact your mom needs around the clock care, then maybe hospice could provide more, or perhaps they could help you get her placed in the proper facility for that level of care. But if it turns out that your mom is demanding more care than she truly needs, you could go ahead and get away from her more.

I wish you could luck, and don’t beat yourself up over guilt or worrying that you lack compassion for wanting to be elsewhere. Please remember that in this situation YOU are the one who needs and deserves some compassion. Please give that to yourself.
Sounds like you are experiencing caregiver burnout. Go see your doctor and see if they an point you in the right direction to get help. Your health is important too!
When my wife was on disability, helpers came in 20 hours/week. I'm convinced if they didn't I would have lost my mind. I'd give her the meds every 3 hours around the clock. Between that and needing to carry her weight on and off the commode every hour on average, I didn't get sleep for 3 years and was getting  psychotic. 

The hours went up drastically after a ""reevaluation,"" which I had suggested. Good luck. I'm with you, clockwatcher.

,CA resources for in-home care,"Hi r/caregivers

I was wondering if any of y'all know of any programs for in-home care nurses. My 81 year old grandma has lewy body dementia, which has began to progress rapidly over the last 2 months and she is becoming increasingly violent/agitated. Its really been a team effort for my family to make sure she's watched most of the day, but there there's about a 6 hour window where she needs a caregiver. 

She's currently enrolled in IHSS for (I think) 2 hours per day and are petitioning to increase the number of hours. 

Are there any assistance programs I should be looking into?

,Any helpful tips or links for a live in caregiver?,"Hello I’m very new to this as I wasn’t really looking to be a caregiver for my grandma (94) but I did see it as a good opportunity to save money while I go to college. She’s pretty independent except for the fact she needs help grabbing items off a high place and needs someone to clean her stoma (she had a colostomy). We tend to find ourselves running thin on items for cleaning (gloves, gauze, long cotton q-tips, etc) and when I asked if they could send more they brushed me off saying I should be grateful I get some at all (not directly but not subtle either). Also it’s been a bit difficulty mask the smell since we clean her 2x a day.

Does anyone know if there’s a place we can buy what we need preferably in bulk that isn’t overly expensive and/or ways of keeping the house smelling clean? Incense and spraying air fresheners isn’t really cutting it. Thank you very much!","Who is ""they?""",2019-10-28 15:17:53,,dodota
,I’m drained...,"Hey reddit, TLDR at the bottom. 

I’ve been my grandmothers caregiver for about six years. She has a condition that doesn’t allow her to really do anything. I’m positive that it is extremely difficult for a once very independent woman to now have to require a great deal of dependence on another person, she is still mentally alert. I love my grandma, I just want to say that right away so that the things I say in this post do not sound bitter. I have been caring for her since I was in high school, at the age of 16. My grandmother had custody of my smaller cousins (13 & 8 now) and I have also taken on the responsibility of them while she refuses to accept that I take care of them. I do not get paid for being her caregiver, my grandmothers kids (my parent passed away so excluded from this) do not help or give me any respite, I’m struggling to pay bills and remain on me feet, my grandmother is not easy at all to be around, and I really need to vent to someone who may be able to make me feel a little better or give me some advice. I’m feeling so extremely stressed and overwhelmed, I feel like this is never ending and these thoughts and feelings never leave my mind. 

My grandmother is not easy to be cared for. She is extremely needy when she shouldn’t be. She expects me to be right by her side 24/7, if I’m not she will guilt trip the hell out of me and make it seem like she is always alone. Nothing I can do for her is enough, no matter how good it could be done or how hard I try it’s simply never enough for her. She puts everything on me. 

The children are hard for me to keep up with, as in we are only 8 & 12 years apart, I am just learning how to adult myself and it becomes extremely overwhelming for me to be pretty much raising kids. My grandmother believes that she takes care of and does everything for them. This isn’t true. I help with homework, make dinner, make sure they have clean clothes, make sure they get to school on time, I mean everything. It upsets me greatly because I did not ever imagine I would be 21 years old raising two children and caring for my elderly grandmother, without ever getting a chance at actually living and starting my own life. 

I am only able to work about 15 hours a week because I need to be here with her all of the time. I have no social life or relationships with anyone. I am home, with my grandmother, ALL OF THE TIME expect for when I am at work. I can’t afford anything, I am barely scraping by and she has so many bills that all of her money goes to paying them and leaving her without anything. 

I am so mentally and physically exhausted, I don’t even know if I think about anything else but the fact that I’m so exhausted. I’m burnt out, beyond what I can explain. I just want it to be over already. I want it to go away. I want a different life, where I can actually take care of myself and feel young. I feel so old, like I’m just here to take care of everyone else. I don’t want to raise children, I don’t want to be home with an old lady every day of my life. I don’t want this anymore. I feel so horrible for saying these things and feeling this way, but it is really all I think about. I feel guilty when I think these things because I love my grandmother and care about her well being. I would never mistreat her or the children, im very patient and kind to each of them, always. I do not treat them cold and I am very attentive to their needs. I’m just expressing my thoughts and venting. I don’t really have anyone to vent to, I do not have family or friends to help me through things. This is kind of my only hope right now. When I sit back and think about my life, i become so depressed because I can’t seem to get ahead no matter how hard I try. I feel as though becoming my grandmothers caregiver was the worst thing I’ve done because it has set me back so much in life. I’m so tired of not being good enough for her, no matter what I do. I’m mostly just tired of feeling tired and depressed. And to be completely honest, I want out of this. I don’t want to be a caregiver anymore. 

TLDR: I’m feeling extremely burnt out from being a caregiver to my grandmother and two cousins. I have no social life and depression is getting to me so much because I have to be stuck in this home 24/7. Sometimes I just want out.","Hang on Sloopy!

Kudos to you for lasting as long as you've had in your herculean efforts of taking care of grandma and your young cousins. Talk to her doctor about what's going on and request to be connected to a social worker who should have the types of resources and tips for your mom--possibly based on her condition--and you, as her caregiver, to have some sort of respite and other support. All the best.
Call your local Area Agency on Aging.  They provide caregiver support and will help you find local services that will make your life (and grandma and kids's lives) a lot better.    

As far as your grandma--tell her ""If you don't use it, you lose it.""  If you stop doing a skill, then your brain decides it doesn't need to expend the energy to maintain that skill.  You can relearn the skill later, but it's a lot harder than if you kept a skill going by using it.  Sympathize with your grandma that it's hard for her to do stuff, but you are \*helping her\* by making her do stuff herself.
I mean you could talk to a caregiving company about applying your grandmother for one and asking to work as a primary DSW for her. I don't know if others are like that but there a few at my company that do this.
Keep in mind that all your feelings are normal and that caretaking is a tough job.",2019-10-28 09:49:11,throwaway12244860,do9305
,One idea for an aging America: a volunteer corps of caregivers,,"Approved as of interest to our community.
Definitely of interest...

On the one hand, this is such a necessary service, it's a wonder plans haven't progressed more rapidly than it has but on the other hand, there are liability issues, mainly because the population being served is vulnerable on so many levels, there might be rampant opportunities for abuse and litigation.

But I suppose if they have a stringent vetting process it may be a lifesaver for so many ppl.
I agree with the comments below, and on the risk aspect too.  Even those that appear to be professional and well-intentioned via marketing by large firms and franchises have weaknesses in the security aspect.  Caregiver burnout is real, and even those who do this type of work professionally can serve as a weak point in the care cycle.   The best for all is to have a committed family team that works, with great diligence, in coordination with all support - inside and external to the elderly person's family.",2019-10-24 13:31:37,sfzhp,dmjpyv
,"It finally happened. I'm no longer a caregiver. I am relieved, but I have nowhere to go, lost, and alienated from society.","On October 15th 2019, something horrible happened to our household. I never told anyone on this blog this, and I don’t do regular updates but I’m horrible on the social media thing because of I’m a private person for the most part. On the evening of October 15th 2019, my brother, who has autism (like me, but of a lower level than me) just before dinner, had a seizure. I just completed my first aid training on a website on the Sunday before it happened.

It happened when I was settling in on Tuesday, after some days moving upstairs to in hopes of renting out the basement room. I left the door open just in case. Then I heard a faint sound of my mom saying “Ndee…Ndee”, due to my hypervilgilence where I get sensitive to certain sounds I got up and brought my phone. Almost immediately I saw my brother on the ground on the carpet shaking with him bleeding from the mouth. I knew what to do by instinct because my brother never suffered a seizure before by calling 911.

I told my mom I’m calling 911. As soon as the operator pickup ed the line, I told her “We need a ambulance now! My brother is having a seizure! He’s bleeding through the mouth!” I couldn’t hear what the operator saying because my mom tried to get him to breathe after the seizure,and she ended up having one of her fingers punctured because my brothers teeth/jaw was sealed shut during the seizure. She was screaming “WE NEED A AMBULANCE NOW!” “WE NEED ONE NOW!” “ MY SON IS HAVING A SEIZURE”, while trying to comfort him while he was face down on the ground. I could not hear what the operator was saying because my mom was screaming out of pain of of worry that my brother is not breathing. The entire call lasted ten minutes.

Luckily, the fire department, which was a volunteer fire department that is literary a stones throw from the house responded within 10 minutes. I told them what happened and directed them to the living room. My mom who told the paramedics everything and my brother, who was disorientated after seizure, after assessing the situation, went to the hospital. I didn’t ate anything from the prepared dinner until the morning after.

I went there the next day in the afternoon, I saw my autistic brother laying down sleeping in drained after suffering a seizure. After I saw my brother, met the hospital staff supporting my brother and my mom. I went down to grab dinner: A simple hamburger with chips, and a soda. When my mom came down: I told her the honest truth: “The entire situation was traumatizing. I can’t do this anymore. I need a long vacation.” She knew what was going on with me, and she knew the situation and she accepted the fact that it was time for me to go and have my own life.

At this point, I’m free. I’m free of caregiving for my parents and my brother. But I don’t seem to belong in this society anymore. I’m unemployable in the IT field, barely have any social network, my only income is SSDI, and if I can’t find a place to live I’ll be homeless.

My brother will be fine, he has a group home to go to. He needs round the clock care at this point that my parents nor me can provide. My parents will be fine, they can finally get jobs, even temp jobs because they realize that they can’t rely on me anymore. For me I’ve sacrificed my career, my health, my social life, my future so they won’t be in a homeless shelter, because their relatives won’t help them. These same relatives didn’t even visit my brother for the past 7 days while he’s in the hospital.

If people think caregiving is so noble and admirable and heroic, where’s the prizes and riches like the heroes in isekai light novels and anime? Where’s my home and a place to live, after years of putting myself into poverty supporting my parents and my brother.

At this point, I’m packing up my stuff and finding a room for rent somewhere, because all the public housing and rent assistance programs are non-existent. If I can’t find a room, I’ll just have to be homeless., move remaining of my stuff in storage. I’ll travel for a while, see the country, do whatever I wanted to do, before it completely falls apart in political strife.

But what I really want, as a person who is a caregiver for the past 5 years, to have somewhere to live, some place to turtle from a society that loves caregivers, but won’t help them when they’re done. That’s what I want. While I might be relived, I’m lost. I merely exist, but I don’t belong on this earth, because my future is has been robbed is gone forever.

There are no resources or support for ex-caregivers like me, especially those who have autism/aspergers, to have a fresh start in life.

All I want to do is to rest for every year I’ve been caregiving for my parents and brother. I want to do everything I wanted to do before I was forced to caregive for the past 5 years, for the times I have to push through despite running on empty for the past 2 years. And for the times that I’ve been mentally and emotionally fatigued.

That is my wish: The rest and slowly recover so I can have a new life.","So this thread has devolved. Badly. /u/Jkid , I appreciate your reaching out for... Well, I guess help.

I took care of my elderly, invalid mother for four years. She required 24 hour care, she had a stoma I had to suction, she used oxygen, couldn't walk far, had no appetite, withered down to 78lbs, couldn't talk etc. 

She had a seizure one day. Usually I'm the one that stays calm but seeing that, I thought she was dying. I call 911 and they have to calm me down while my sister, usually the one to freak out, remained calm and say with moms head on her lap turned sideways. I kept screaming ""MY MOM IS FUCKING DYING!!! SOMEBODY PLEASE GET HERE!!! SHE'S DYING!"" etc. It wasn't until they asked me to check her chest to see if it was rising and I saw it was that I snapped out of it and went into action mode. It was horrible traumatizing for my sister and I. Mom came to before the ambulance even arrived. She didn't realize what happened, she just told us she was tired as hell and dazed. She'd had to have all her teeth pulled for radiation ( throat cancer) but she still bit her tongue so bad the end was dark purple. We watched her through the night, got her medicine refilled that she'd been out of (caused it) and she never had another. My brother in law watched her the next evening and my sister and I ended up getting drunk and just letting loose to wind down from it all.

One day, when it was all new and I wasn't the tired, shriveled, panicky version of myself that I am now, I had a date. My sister said she'd watch mom. I was super dressed up and all ready to go. I go in to say goodnight to mom and show her my outfit. She told me I looked beautiful but asked me not to go (she hated when I'd leave, she felt abandoned even for a few hours). I told her she'd be just fine, she could call me and I'd talk to her even though she couldn't talk to me. I'd never leave her etc etc. Well I noticed her potty chair was not in it's night spot where she could safely shimmy to it without risking a fall so I go to move it closer. I trip over her oxygen tube (I was in heels on carpet) and........ It was full. I'll let you imagine what happened.... I fell to my knees crying so hard, ruining my makeup etc. Mom just laid there and watched me. I finally sucked it up, cleaned all get medical devices first and sterilized them, called the guy and told him I'd be out asap, I had an issue with Mom I had to take care of, scrubbed the carpet, changed my dress and fixed my makeup. Went out, had a great time...

One morning I headed in to Mom's room, opened up her curtains to let the sunshine in, gave her her morning meds and a glass of oj. I tell her it's time to switch to her chair so I could change her bedding (she was incontinent). Well she kept trying to tell me something but in the mornings I was in beast mode. Morning were hardest as I had SO much to do and my sister still worked at the time. I go to take the covers off and there's shit spilling out of her diaper. That never happened before so I was shocked and worried, also dreading cleaning it. Bathing mom was a nightmare. I suck it up, get to changing her the best I could but the poop streaked down her legs and even got in her toes. 

I take some deep breaths and let her know I'm going to go get a bath ready. She starts whining and crying (mind you I have to sit there and read her lips which is extremely stressful for us both). I tell her ""MOM, you're an adult, not a child. You're covered in FECES. I will NOT wipe you off with baby wipes. You ARE taking a bath! End of discussion!"" 

She gets pissed and starts being bitchy to me, not helping at all. I strip her down and by now the poop is everywhere. I'm a germaphobe btw... I decide she can't sit in her wheelchair and she can't walk, poop will get everywhere. So I decide to wrap her in a sheet and carry her to the tub. 

I was 5'7 about 120lbs.....I held her with a mother's strength because I knew if I dropped her she was toast. She was as skinny as a Holocaust victim but still hard for me to carry. She'd have shattered like glass 💔 I manage to get her into the bathroom just down the hall. I had the room hot because she got chilled so easily and would cry because she was so cold. I on the other hand would sweat and get so weak and dizzy. I had to give her one bath (fighting her all the while) to get the shit off her and another just to make sure she was fresh and truly clean. 

I then help her to the toilet with a couple towels on it so it didn't hurt her bony little butt. I dried her well and dressed her really warmly. I told her I'd be back, I had to clean her bed and put clean sheets on etc. Thankfully she had a medical bed so it was easy to streamline l sterilize. I get her back in her fresh clean bed, all warm and toasty. She immediately tells me she's starving.........

Mom's nutrition was SUPER important so she had special high calorie foods we'd make her as well as making sure she got plenty of vitamins and minerals. I don't cook, but I did for her. I'd make her a big breakfast, still having not eaten anything myself. Sit there and make sure she ate it all and didn't need help etc. We'd put her huge flatscreen (so she could see it, wouldn't wear her glasses) on the food Network all day to boost her appetite (thyroid was destroyed from radiation).

Then I'd go clean her laundry, clean my sister's house, finally eat and I'd hear her tapping on the baby monitor. It was lunch time and time to start all over again.

Luckily the poop incident was a one time thing. I asked her if she felt it happening and she said yes, she just couldn't get to the toilet in time. So at least I didn't have to worry about why. 

Anyway, things like these happened daily. She was in and out of the hospital, ICU and rehab.
I'd wake up at night sometimes to find her oxygen had fallen off or she had a mucous plug (hardened ball of basically snot that closed her stoma up) and she'd bang her wooden spoon into the baby monitor to wake me up for help. Her lips would be blue and her poor chest would be heaving for air. 

I'd immediately call 911 and speak to them over speakerphone while suctioning her in case she had a mucous plug, I'd grab an oxygen tank (higher oxygen pressure than her compressor), jack it up to ten and put the tube right up to her stoma. I would check her o2sats with a pulse ox and it'd be 53%.... I had to stay calm, keep her calm, give her high oxygen along with breathing treatments while watching her oxygen level slowly climb up to 60%.....75%......80%.....90% etc. Each time wondering how many brain cells she lost... she was so loopy sometimes. She would say the president came to see her etc. She couldn't filter out carbon dioxide very well anymore...

When she first got sick I lived in the hospital with her for 45 days. That's when she'd found out she had throat cancer because (while at an appointment at her drs thank God), the tumor in her throat swelled just enough to cut off her air supply and she had a heart attack.

They did emergency surgery because they couldn't even fit a child's intubator down her. They removed most of the mass and put her in a coma and cooled her body to 93° to prevent brain damage.

I remember sitting by her side day and night. Crying, snotting, praying and begging God to save my mommy. Staring at her brain monitors. Praying my mother wasn't brain dead. I'd sit and talk to her, holding her hand, praying to God to save her life.

A couple days after, they said she seemed to have suffered little to no brain damage and they'd start to warm and wake her slowly. They told us to be prepared though in case because machines don't tell us everything.

We were encouraged to try to gently interact with her. I'd whisper to her ""Mommy, it's your Kissyfur. Please wake up, I need you. If you can hear me, squeeze my hand"". I did this all day every so often. Finally, I felt a squeeze!!! I asked her to do it again to be sure it wasn't just a bodily reaction, she did. My Mommy was still in there!!!

She passed away four years ago. She was in the hospital for pneumonia when she stopped using the restroom. Her stomach was swelling. No medicines helped. I got the Dr to do tests and we found out she had a perforated colon. Her body had formed an abscess around it and she was very very sick. They couldn't let her eat so she was starving. 

I had to explain to her once I'd talked to her drs and surgeons that there was nothing that could be done. She likely wouldn't survive the surgery to put in a colostomy bag and we could only hope and pray that her body healed the wound itself. They were draining the bile and ""contents"" the best they could. I won't describe that part.

I had to tell my mom, alone, that she was probably going to die. I asked her after a while of silence for her to process it all, if she wanted me to fight for them to do the surgery anyway. If she was going to die anyway, why not at least try. I had already asked the surgeons and they said no, it was unethical. They could guarantee her death and they didn't want to experience that and put us all through it. They explained hospice etc.
Ok
Good for you! You will adapt and survive. You can fi d a job doing anything, you are certainly not unemployable! Try starting at an office or factory doing something mundane and take baby steps to get higher on the pay scale. Don't give up.
We just talked. He's going to email the pastor of his church to see if anyone in the congregation can help. In the meantime, go on Craigslist for PG County (or wherever else you choose) and look for ""rooms for rent."" I found several that look really nice in your price range and they include utilities and internet as well. 

I'll let you know if the church people come up with anything.

Thanks.

,Smart phone controls for person with mental disabilities,"Any tips on ""dumbing down"" a smart phone? 

I'm a caregiver for a family member who needs a phone to call and maybe text. He has mild mental disabilities and is technophobic, so he gets easily confused and frustrated around technology. I want him on my phone plan (is plan is super expensive), but do not want him using any data, he doesn't need it, and having apps would likely be more things to confuse him. He currently has a simple flip phone, but the interface of flat/smartphones is actually more intuitive to use. 

One extra parameter: he is friendly, and often asks random coworkers or people in his activity group for help with his phone. When that happens, the phone needs to be able to STAY ""dumbed down,"" other people shouldn't be able to undo the settings or apps that I set up.","Get an unlocked cellphone made for elderly or little kids and bring it to your service provider and/or there's services like Jitterbug. There's a ""phone"" made for kids that's just a button you speak into, though I don't know how portable it is.
I can't give you any advice unfortunately but maybe you could ask your carrier about this. Maybe there is a way way they could help you do it. Good luck. I know what it's like to be a caregiver to somebody who absolutely knew nothing about technology and he would get really frustrated easily. Sometimes I would have to sit with him for two hours or more before he finally got it and sometimes I would just have to say let's take a break and come back to it.
Do you think he would be able to use Siri or the Google Assistant for voice commands? Rather than setting up the screen for him to navigate, you could help him learn to say, ""Hey Siri, call jessica"" and the phone would be able to execute that for him.
There's BaldPhone, available on fDroid. Has its own small subreddit at r/BaldPhone.

,Medical Alert Devices,"Hi all,

I am a caregiver to my parents who are both fall risks among other issues. I am looking into medical alert devices for them and I was curious what others have used. My hope is that this will give me piece of mind when I step out of the house for an hour or two. I  was looking into Mobile Help. Seemed good but who knows. All of those companies seem a bit shady in my opinion. TIA!","Are you dealing with just fall risks? Or do they have dementia as well?
Just fall risks. They don’t have dementia thankfully.
I also feel like those devices aren't what they're cracked up to be. My friend's mom was wearing one when she fell and it didn't kick in and she forgot to use the alert button, so she was just on the ground for 9 hours. Terrible. 

Where are you located? Maybe there's a [service like this](https://www.monami.io/) nearby where you could get someone to come by and spend time with your parents when you need to go out.
Kind of new to this, but would a smart watch that can make calls be an option?  Apple watches detect hard falls but I have no idea if it would pick up on a home fall.
Life Alert, but I never had to use it. We tested it, and surprisingly they were right there. In my experience, at least, I'd keep track of the line where they can't be left alone. My wife was in bed for 4 years. Once I set up the laptop on the bed, dialed my cell, and went to town. We were talking, but then she didn't answer me. I raced home to find her sleeping. :)",2019-10-15 19:37:11,lajefa2012,digkh7
,How do I motivate my mother to live when I can't stand her?,"This may belong in /r/justnofamily but I'm posting it here because I'm technically her caregiver and I need advice.  

My mother (72) has come to live with me after a second stroke and some serious health complications (diabetes, renal disease, congestive heart failure) made it impossible for her to return to her house immediately following hospital/rehab.  I cleaned out her apartment (100 miles away) and moved her into my basement.  I have Power of attorney and am med proxy.  I reorganized her healthcare, manage her meds and all her finances, organize her doctor appointments, take her to those appointments and explain everything to her when she doesn't understand (although she used to be a nurse, there is a lot she doesn't understand anymore).  There is also undiagnosed mental illness.  I have one brother who no longer talks to her, so he doesn't help with anything (although he did help ME clean out her place). I also have one brother who overdosed 4 years ago and she stopped trying at that point.

In addition to working full time and trying to keep my family moving, I have been busting ass to get her into HUD assisted housing for seniors.  I don't really believe she should live alone, but this place is 10 minutes from my house and she's been on the waiting list for 4 years.  She wants her independence.  I want my sanity.

So today she tells me she no longer is going to go to the doctor.  Because she's sick of it.  But really, it's because we had a week of bad news (high blockage of carotid artery, she doesn't want surgery; need to self-cath frequently to avoid UTIs; and the final blow...the HUD housing rejected her because of the mangled mess she made of her finances in the years before this stroke allowed me to take over).  

She's not close to death, but if she bails on taking care of herself she will be.   She is barely helping as it is: sleeping all day until I get home from work at 4, ""forgetting"" to check her sugar, refusing to follow the simple checklist we made to help her with daily health and wellness, refusing a nurse/aide to come in & help. And because she lives with me, it will be my problem when the shit hits the fan. I am sick of cleaning up the shitty mess she makes of her life. But really, how do I drag a grown woman to the doctor?  I am trying to let her make her own decisions and have some autonomy, but she's acting like a fucking child and I want to smack her.

I know she needs a therapist, but I am stretched so thin, I dont know when to fit it in.  I can't rely on senior transport for her (while I'm at work) because so far, she has never been ready for an appointment for me (and I come in the house to get her, they won't).  I can't take time off work each week to get her to the therapist and the ones near me that take medicare close at 4.

She tries to help out by occasionally doing dishes (which we end up having to rewash bc she can't see well).  But she won't clean up her own space or care about it at all.  Most of my life she has made me angry and uncomfortable.  She is negative, racist, sexist, rude, constantly criticizing my choices, kids, husband and parenting.  She refuses to think ahead, constantly plays the victim and won't take responsibility for the fact that most of the stuff that's wrong with her is stuff she caused by not taking care of her diabetes for years and years.  She never pays bills she doesn't ""agree with"" and is angry with me that I dont let her do her own finances or meds.  But as soon as theres a problem, she hands it over to me and expects me to fix it.

Honestly, I could go on for days.  But really, I am just tired of trying to keep her alive when she doesn't want to try and just makes everyone miserable.","Sounds like a case of ""damned if you do, damned if you don't."" I will go on record here and tell you 1) Talk to your mother's doctor \*without\* your mother and ask what your options are, and 2) talk to an elder attorney and ask what your options are. 

The rest of what I am about to say is bullshit, and you probably should stop reading now. My wife had a similar problem about ten years ago. She was living with her mother, who had Alzheimer's.  We got to the point where she didn't even recognize my wife.  She had her in assisted living for a while, but that drained her finances something fierce (we were not married at the time). She had to live with her mother in order to save money. It finally got to the point were she had to us a hospitalization (her mother fell and couldn't get up) to get her into a nursing home.

It was a nightmare, compounded by the fact that my wife was (and still is) in a wheelchair.

What I'm trying to say, here, is it's up to you how heroic you want to be. I'm an atheist, I don't believe in a soul, so my question to you is how much does this disease have to take away before your mother stops being your mother? Yes, this is pretty cold, but as my father used to say: ""Nobody gets out of this life alive."" Yes, you owe her love, but I suspect you have other obligations. What is the ultimate prognosis for your mom? You either don't know, or have not come to terms with it.

Good luck. Try not to take the last two paragraphs too seriously (or too personally).
Boy, you’ve got your hands full, don’t you. Have you talked to her doctor? Would he suggest a stay at a facility so they can help her (until she can)get her shit together health wise?  She obviously can’t (or won’t) follow doctor’s orders. So she is essentially self-harming herself. It all depends on how the doctor wants to look at it, and if he wants to push her. 

It’s hard to take care of someone who has self-destructed, especially if you’ve watched her do it since you were young. If the doctor can’t do anything this time, you may have to wait for her next big health crisis.  After she has been admitted to the hospital, tell them that you won’t take her home and she isn’t safe to live alone.  The hospital will push you to take her, but keep telling them no. They then will have to find a bed in a facility for her.  Stay strong through all this, try to take little mini breaks when you can - read a good book, take a hot bath, go to a movie. Hugs
Hi - hospice nurse here.  I have not had to actually live with / take care of an elder, so keep that in mind as you read my more editorial comments vs. concrete suggestions.  

I know you said she's not near death, but she will be if she doesn't take care of herself.  At the same time, there really is only so much you can do.  You have already done, and continue to do, a huge amount for her.  Part of the immense difficulty of taking care of an elder is knowing what your limits are, as well as accepting some of the decisions someone who is still mentally competent is making.

So - the suggestions so far about consulting with her PCP about options are good.  I would ask specifically about how to evaluate her mental competence, as if she is no longer deemed competent you might be able to get her into a facility.  Also ask about any anti-depressant medication options.  If her depression is being treated, and she is still doing this self-destructive stuff, there's not much more you can do about it, painful and frustrating as it may be to watch.  And then just ask if there is anything else you can do.  You don't have to figure this all out by yourself.

It's also worth exploring any in-home programs for seniors that may exist in your area; one or more of them may have medical social workers, who are also great at brainstorming options.  I seriously believe medical social workers are a totally underrated resource!!  Grab them when you can...

Even though it's early yet, at some point you'll want to figure out as best you can what her end-of-life plans are or should be, and to what degree they involve aggressive measures.  Knowing what the plan is at the very end of life will actually help clarify what medical care decisions you and she might make sooner than that.  

Bottom line:  remember there is only so much you can do.
Honestly, if she wants to die, let her. It's not your job. Do the bare minimum to avoid being legally negligent, and the rest is up to her.
You have taken on too much, trying to be her emotional manager as well as her ""mommy"". She has made it so that you have reversed roles, and at the age of 72, she is probably closer to death than you realize, because she has lost the will to live. You must realize that this weight of responsibility she has placed on you is not healthy, in fact it is toxic. You cannot force someone to accept medical help. And since you have a family of young ones to take care of, they MUST be your first priority, because they are the future. You need to tell your mother that you do love her, but that you are taking your hands off of her personal decision making. It is HER responsibility to get herself housing, health, and help. If you have any siblings or she has any close friends, let them know that this is more than you can handle alone. Don't worry about how your children see this. They will simply be happy for you to give them the attention they need. Do some kind things, but don't force her to accept care, if she is unwilling. You may be able to get her to accept in home care if you tell her the only other option is a nursing home. Other than that, you are doing your best.
I would suggest talking to her doctor without her there and trying to get her into a facility. I've been there, done that. Luckily my mom turned really sweet and gentle towards the end but she was a lot like your mom too. 

You will destroy your mental health by putting this all on yourself. There are medical professionals who do this for people like her for a living. It could really improve your relationship with her too

,How do you as a caregiver take care of yourself while taking care of others?,"Maybe this isn’t the right sub but I’m not entire sure where this belongs. I’ve always been the type of person that feels like they need to help everyone. First I was a nanny and now I work as a mental health caseworker in an inpatient facility. I’ve been working as a mental health worker for 2 years now and I always make sure one day a week that I’m solely focusing on myself and having some me time. But lately I’ve noticed the dark circles under my eyes are becoming worse, my under eyes are so puffy (I’m only 24), I’m feeling more tired than usual and no amount of coffee can help. I feel like I’m not taking care of myself as well as I should be because my body is starting to show it.","I've been taking care of my elderly grandmother for 10 years, since I was in high school, through college, and while holding down a full time job. You need to force yourself to get time away. That doesn't mean you have to go somewhere extravagant, just go to some place where you don't find yourself thinking if your work. A local comedy night, art show, karaoke, etc. Whatever it is, enjoy it. 

You also need to make sure you're getting exercise. It's proven that getting regular exercise helps you feel better mentally. Even if it's just a walk down the road after dinner, it will help.

Sounds like you're experiencing burn out. Can you take a few days off for some R&R? Caregiving in any capacity is hard!!! How's your sleep and your diet, water intake?
I used to work as a mental health counselor in a psych ward, now I’m a therapist for autistic children. Im also living with/engaged to someone with schizophrenia. What you’re talking about sounds a lot like caregiver burn out, I go through it a lot too. I’m 24 too - and sometimes I’m just tired. I’ve found that taking a little time for myself everyday helps. Even if it’s just 5 minutes to put on a face mask or do some yoga stretches because I’m way too busy for anything else. Just five minutes to make it about me and nobody else and ground myself. I also use apps that force me to check in with myself at least 3 times a day and document my emotions, moods and daily activities - they analyze it and then tell me what may be contributing to burn out or my emotions and ways to alter it so I feel better and that’s been very helpful too
I’ve been a caregiver for the past 17 years. I understand your current situation and it seems as if you’re experiencing “burn out”. I work as a live-in caregiver, and my client is usually up about 16 hours per day. At one point I worked 98 days before taking a break, but I’m used to it. I started my own company a few years back and I’ve seen burn out to where caregivers entire personality changes. You must take a break. It’s healthy for you! You need it!
Wow. You have all my admiration. If you feel like you are not taking enough care of yourself, all I can say is start. I've looked after people in my family who needed caring, and I can agree that it does burn you out. I don't work professionally as a carer, but I've felt burnt out myself.

,Should I seek an In-Care Facility for my wife? How do I find one that will give her what she needs?,"This post is going to involve a lot of different elements but the focus is on: Is there a care-facility that will give my wife what she needs?

\---

Hello all,

I \[27M\] am the caretaker for my wife \[24F\]. My wife has several different illness/issues all stemming from *Limbic System Impairment*. Much of what she has is characterized popularly as an ""invisible illness,"" for example one of the stemming illnesses she has is *Dysautonomia* and *Multiple Chemical Sensitivity.* In the past 2 years, her health status has plummeted owing to a) an attempted treatment that exacerbated her issues and b) a severe, pervasive, and persistent flea infestation in our old apartment complex that worsened her Limbic System Trauma (we are no longer in that apartment). 

She is now bed-bound. Her room must stay almost completely dark (she does have a small glow lamp that she turns on at night). She cannot look at screens. She can only eat 4 foods and has extreme sensitivities to smells. Because of these sensitivities, I cook 2 of these foods in our garage. One of the other ones I cook in the house only because I need the oven for it, so we have to open all the windows (and God help us if someone decides to have a fire or start mowing at the same time). She is also heavily drug-resistant.

One of her medications (which I won't name here) that does help is a controlled substance that helps with a lot of her issues. Because it is a controlled substance there is a lot of red tape around it and there have been several times where she has had to use more than prescribed and I've had to spend entire weeks stressing and battling pharmacists and attempting to get a hold of her doctor. We actually changed pharmacies as a result of this. 

We recently had to get a ""lay-over"" prescription written because we cannot refill her actual script until the 10th and she would've run out of what she had at 4:00 AM tomorrow morning.  Her doctor agreed to do this on the condition that we look into a psychopharmacologist.

Unfortunately, my wife's doctor's office sent it to the old pharmacy instead of our new one...they also sent in the wrong prescription. So, all weekend I've been working to get a hold of my doctor to get a hold of my wife's pharmacy in order to get the correct prescription and get them to be actually willing to fill the thing. Its been a nerve-wracking and stressful time. FINALLY I was able to get it filled, but then the pharmacist told me three things that were concerning:

1. They were only going to be filling 10 pills.
2. They would not be filling this prescription for my wife after this.
3. They believe my wife should be in an In-Care Facility. 

The second of these isn't super concerning to me because they are no longer her pharmacy, this was just a mistake. The first is a problem because she is still going to run out early (for her dosage 6 pills = 1 day, the actual script does not refill until Thursday). However, this isn't why I'm writing. The third thing they said is why I'm writing this, the *In-Care Facility.* 

Now, this is something that I've considered in the past. However, I just don't imagine *any* facility having the accommodations that she needs. We're talking: leaving the room dark, no loud sounds, no bad smells, no drugs apart from what she is currently on, only chicken, quinoa, rice, and sweet potatoes to eat (that don't taste terrible and are unflavored). 

Another hesitancy is that she is doing a treatment to get better (it focuses on addressing the responses her Limbic System makes to try to correct things at the source). We are seeing some good things from this, but it is taking longer than expected and I'm nervous that such an upheaval will set her back.

I'm also nervous that they won't be able to actually *do* anything. Or even worse, that the people there will treat her as though she isn't really having issues. When she first started exhibiting symptoms, she was told again and again that she was making it all up or that there wasn't really anything wrong with her. Until finally some doctors recognized that there *was* something going on. (this medical gas-lighting didn't do my wife any favors either, but I won't go on a tangent about that here). Given that my wife has an ""invisible illness"" and that a lot of doctors are either completely unaware of people with conditions like hers or are outright dismissive also makes me less inclined to seek out such a thing. 

Is there a facility that will tailor to my wife's needs? If so, how do I find it?

I've sent a message to her doctor, but I thought that I would poke your brains as I'm sure some of you have experience with In-Care Facilities. 

Thank you.","Hi, I’m not an expert, but I would imagine your wife wouldn’t want to go to a regular nursing home. They are just not equipped for anything out of the ordinary (3 meals a day - everyone eats almost the same meal - rooms are shared).  I would think she would be better suited at some kind of counseling facility, just because the treatment there is one on one. Meals are catered to a person’s needs. Meds are strictly controlled - so maybe they could finally get her on a medicine that she doesn’t need to take more of than prescribed. They have private rooms. A lot of them are very nice, set in the country or with gardens - very peaceful.  Does your wife have a therapist? Or do you know of one? If not, I’m sure your doctor can research to find a facility that fits the criteria you need.  

It sounds like it would be worth a shot. She certainly doesn’t have much of a normal life right now. Neither do you, for that matter. They may be able to make a big improvement in her health. Good luck in your quest. You’re a good husband for researching this, to try to help her out.",2019-10-06 21:01:53,pjsans,decbzv
,Caregiving can be a way to hide.,"Do you find yourself constantly in a caregiver role? I know I do. I am always so quick to help others, care for other and always want to ""fix"" others. I now see that at times this is a way for me to hide from wounds I'm unwilling to take care of within myself. Caring for someone else temporary distracts myself from how I'm feeling inside. It gives me temporary pleasure just like any other addiction. 

Do you find yourself constantly in relationships where you're trying to fix someone else? I know I have and I now know this is a way to distract myself from the fact that I need to fix my own self. If this resonates with you then start to do the work to look within. We all have wounds. We will never heal these wounds with anything outside of ourselves. After I help someone else I am eventually left feeling empty inside because I'm not doing the work to help myself. We cannot help or care for anyone else if we are not helping and caring for ourselves first.

,Reinforced toilet?,"Hi. I take care of my Mom, who has late stage Parkinson's Disease. Most issues that arise, my Dad and I have been able to compensate for fairly quickly. A newer development, and one that's becoming increasingly concerning, is the toilet. Her dyskinesias while on the toilet are severe enough that she's broken the bolts that hold it to the floor. 

Do they make a toilet that's not made of metal, that's designed to handle a lot of abuse? 

We're worried she'll break it off the floor, and hurt herself, as well as cause a minor disaster in both her bathroom, and the downstairs, as it would inevitably end up leaking through the upstairs floor.

I've tried googling for a solution, but all I see are jailhouse steel toilets, and that's something we'd like to avoid, if possible.

Any suggestions would be very helpful.","Would grab bars help? You may have thought of that already; if so, apologies. Or perhaps a DIY cage built around toilet with PVC tubing? Just brainstorming.
If the toilet is secured to the floor properly, it shouldn't wobble, regardless of whether its made from porcelain or metal. I would try to find a contractor who is CAPS certified from the National Home Builders Association and see what they can suggest.

The toilet should be fine.

Have a professional plumber redo the gasket and caulking. It's the Porcelain Toilets caulked to the floor that keeps it from shifting.

,Is it unprofessional to feed your dog a raw food diet as a caretaker?,"My co-worker/boss, ""Lenny"" lives with the quadriplegic patient that we care for.  Recently, Lenny bought a dog and has decided to feed the dog a raw food diet.  This seems, to me, like a great way to spread germs, and not really a good idea in a health care setting.","I don't know but it seems risky to me. I mean he wouldn't eat raw meat so why would he expect his dog to? I know dog food is mostly meat by-products. That doesn't sound safe.
I am caring for my mother and was going to buy the freeze dried raw treats for my dog about a month ago and my vet said I should not do that because dangerous bacteria has been found on the raw dog foods sold in stores.
Take the pet owner with to the vet and have him ask the vet these questions. You ask yours, and hopefully the owner will listen to the vet.

,Disappointed wife,"My wife suffers from chronic pain that has gotten worse since we started dating. She like most has been told her weight might be a factor.

Her weight is something she’s struggled with since before she had pain and was looking into and was getting referred to a specialist about some gastric surgery to help.

She made a mistake reading the papers about her Medicaid coverage and has only enough to cover birth control and the like but that’s really it. 

She’s been looking into this for a while now and it has caused her depression to spike to the point she is suffering from disordered eating (another struggle she’s had) any advice on what I can to help her cope?

,Caregiver Looking for advice,"This is my first time posting here, but I'm not sure one what to do with my current situation. I've been gradually caring for my mother since 2006 more and more up until last year when my mother nearly bleed out internally. We and the doctors thought she wasn't going to pull through, but she did and is doing better. She was going in and out of the ER since then once a month up until April of this year when Kaiser told us, ""She would qualify for Hospice and it would help with having her to be brought back to the hospital for every little problem.""

Initially things have worked out well, Hospice was helping us more so then Kaiser with her constipation and Pain, but here's where the issues begin. Each RN and Aide is only contracted to my mother for 13 weeks and then she get someone new. The first two RN weren't bad and the first Aide was great. My issue if with the current RN and Aide. The Aide I'm constantly telling here the same thing every time and she does a bad job at bathing. There's just a point where I'm face palming and getting angry of how much of a mess she is making. 

Seriously I could just do it myself with less hassle and mess, the point of the extra help is to give me a break from having to do this all the time. The nurse, she's been more so admit about want to see the bed sore every week. I take a picture sometimes this way I don't have to move my mother more then I already do. They really don't help in getting her comfortable again once they do finish looking at it. If the nurse try's to help she's just makes more work for me and if she doesn't I'm still stuck moving her regardless. 

The other two nurse never felt like they needed to see the Bed sore every week and it's seriously not going to change that much without me noticing first. I try to tell her, ""It hasn't gotten worse since you last saw it, but if you want to see it here's a picture."" This way I don't have to cause more stress on my mother then I have to. It's tough for her to be shifted to her side and takes a lot out of her. I just don't like how they're causing both of us more issues then helping. I've told the nurse also, ""The other two nurses didn't require to see it as much as you. On top of that you are wasting supplies we have to pay out of pocket.""

I've been thinking of talking to the social worker assigned to her and see if we can get someone new assigned earlier rather then have to put up with another 3 months of this, but it just seems like a lot of these at home service Kaiser has put my mother on start off fine, but then spiral down hill quickly. I'm almost tempted just to hire from a company of my choosing to see how much it would cost to have someone come out once a week for an hour to hour and a half to do the same tasks they're providing. 

Really I'm doing most of the work all I want the nurse to do is every other week look at the wound and every other week just do a general check of vitals, ask how things are going, and if we need anything. That's why I liked the first two nurses since that's pretty much what they did. If it wasn't for the fact that Kaisers own in house home care was full up at the time she would've been seeing someone from Kaiser every week and at least I could complain a little easier. Yet they use a 3rd party when they're unable to do so. 

Anyway, I know it doesn't sound to serious and the nurse is just trying to do her job, but it's at the expense of my own pain of having to move my mother. Now someone might suggest a Hoyer lift and that would be great, but two issue with that. Last home care place(not Hospice) used it wrong and caused a lot of pain to my mother. I told them, ""You're using it wrong, put her back down."" They kept tell me, ""I'm using it correct. You don't know what you're talking about."" To which, yeah I do since I was shown in Kaiser how to use one and my mother was fine. 

This caused her to not trust people from 3rd party companies to use on and they give us the compact version which doesn't work for her. Also the time and effort to manually crank her up and gently put her back down still causes me since I have to be very careful on the release mechanism. The equipment I get via on loan from them are kind of bad to boot. I trust in my physical strength more then the equipment. The bed is awful too and I had to add a topper just to make it comfortable. 

It doesn't sound complicated, but it's really hard to write all the reason why certain things won't work. Also one last thing, my mother is completely bed bound. She can't walk or stand. This is why I've on standby 24/7 with minor exceptions when I need to run out for groceries and even then I use online delivery 50% of the time. I haven't had a social life or been out of the house with the exception of the above since 2016. That's when her ability to walk completely failed her. Though before that I had my own health issue from 2014 to early 2016. So you might as well say 5 years total. 

Once my parent hit 65 they'll be able to get medicare and possibly we can have more options for care for her. Though I worry about any homes that offer to my mother and they'll be really bad. Bad thing about medical in the US is that they prefer to be as cheap as possible. I just have little faith that medicare is going to be any extra help, but we'll still need to wait til 2020  before we can count this as an option.

Sorry if this was long, but I mostly keep a lot of my frustration bottle up and when I do post online I end up ranting for a good while. So if you did read all this and can offer any advice on what to do about my Hospice issue I thank you.",I wonder if you really want to post this to /r/hospice where you are talking with professionals that might give you clearer guidance on your multiple issues ???,2019-09-16 03:34:03,Wristan,d4xdlp
,What are my rights as a friend?,"I'm concerned that my friend, who went into nursing care last year, is being ripped off and deprived of his rights and autonomy. 

In 2011, he had a stroke that left him with aphasia. He spent 7 months in a state veteran's home, and wanted badly to come home. I was staying at his house at the time, and his VA support team contacted me, and after talking with them and promising to keep an eye on him, he was allowed to return home. For about a year, he had a wonderful lady come in once a week and do some house cleaning, play chess with him, etc. She was *great*, and after she left her job, she still came to visit once in a while. After she left, nobody replaced her. For several years, I lived in his garage, checking, fearing that he'd have another stoke. In May 2018, he developed a problem which I thought was one of his regular flareups with gout. He also had an eye infection, and I was worried, so I called the VA to make an appointment for him, but was told that because I'm basically ""nobody"", all I could do was take him to the E.R. In the end, he called someone on his own to take him to the hospital, where they chopped off his leg at the hip. 

I should have mentioned that after his stoke, but before he went into the state veterans home, there was a court hearing where he was declared incompetent, and a fiduciary was appointed. I don't know if there's a guardian, and don't even know how to find out anything about his condition or medical information like prescriptions, etc. I am ""nobody"", in spite of spending more time with him than anyone else, going back to before he had his stroke. I'm the one who found him after the stroke, called 911, and got him to a doctor. 

This last May, his fiduciary started trying to kick me out of his house, in spite of his wanting me there, holding the fort, guarding his possessions. Things got ugly last month, and they sued me for eviction. Like a coward, I settled out of court and abandoned his house. I should have fought with a jury trial. I wanted there to be no question that I was merely looking for a place to live. I'm homeless now, living in my car. But at least nobody can say I'm acting in my self-interest now... 

He's now in a private nursing home, hating it, and evidently signed a power of attorney letting the fiduciary sell his house. The fiduciary says I have ""no rights"". 

It's clear to me that his health, both physical and mental, have gone downhill since being locked up. His only distant relative simply snubs me. I don't even know how to contact her. She's come by the house a couple of times, and won't tell me shit. 

He NEEDS to return to his HOME. He doesn't need to be in a nursing facility. Before he got locked up, he was taking care of his grooming, going out making the rounds of the neighborhood every day, engaging with people as well as he could given his aphasia. He's always been an eccentric character, and does have some OCD problems with housekeeping. But his intelligence is there. He simply has trouble communicating and understanding. Not that he can't, just that it's really hard work for him and he tires easily. Over the years since his stoke, we've developed communication techniques, and I more or less been his ""mouthpiece"" at his request when he has something to do that needs someone more fluent than he  is. 

Anyway, I left the house in spite of us both wanting me there. I guess the fiduciary is going to take all his sentimental possessions to the dump, and leave him to die. He would be much better off living at home, with someone coming in to clean once a week. We both agree that this is not a job for me. We're two old school dudes, and neither of us want me washing his shorts -- which he was doing on his own, anyway. 

Is there any way to get a review of his fiducary/guardianship, or information on his prognosis, etc. IOW, be something more than a ""nobody with no rights""?

,Spouse is resentful of caregiving needs of my parents with cancer," I originally posted this on r/caregiversupport but got no feedback, so hopefully someone here can understand this...

I  have two parents with cancer, and they have been sick for almost 3  years now. My siblings and I have worked together to provide support and  intermittent caregiving, and my spouse is exhausted and resentful of my  parents. To his credit, there has been so much drama around sibling  fights (stress over parent crises, caregiver burnout, etc) and parents’  illnesses (bad scan requiring chemo change and all the resulting emotions, a fall, sudden confusion,  hospitalizations, and constant ED trips) that he just feels like we  can’t even do anything as a family without my parents' needs intruding, and it has been three years and he is just tired of it..  There is very little we can do other than distance ourselves and help  less, but that then causes sibling fights because they become resentful  that they are picking up the slack.   I have been encouraging my mother to pay for some home care (she has the money) but refuses to and doesn't say it but I think she just expects that children should do this for their parents (she herself was a devoted daughter but due to her parents dying suddenly has no experience with the strain of prolonged caregiving). 

 Anyone else feel like they are torn between sick parents and their marriage/family life?","My parents are gone now, but this is pretty familiar. My mother wouldn't let my husband help, which would have given us another person to work with. 

And yes, there was resentment from my husband. It was hard on us.

My brother didn't help out at all. We haven't spoken since my mother died six years ago.

Do what you can to get your mother to hire some outside help. The damage to our family because of my mother's insistence on limiting help was devastating. She was always a needy person, but went completely off the rails those last two years.
Hi there! I actually do in home/ private eldercare as a job, and I can tell you that a lot of the time we get clients who don't want or think they don't need the extra hand. I'd say just convince her to start out with a couple hours a week (my company personally has a minimum of 2 hours whenever a caregiver goes to a client). You could then pick either a time where you aren't there to help (or your siblings) or you could be there while the caregiver is there to get some time in with your mom and possibly adjust her to having a caregiver. Hope this might help, I'd say just keep on hammering down the idea that she needs an extra person to help, especially since it seems everyone involved has burn out.

,I want to give up,"How do people do this? How do you not lose faith and keep going? 

My fiancé was recently diagnosed with a psychotic disorder and I’m drowning. He’s been symptomatic for two years and refused to get help - but I’m a mental health counselor and therapist so I did what I could to kind of support him and help him until he had a psychotic break in June and I had to call for him to be hospitalized.

For those two years I’ve paid all the bills myself, working a full time job and weekend job to cover his expenses - and juggling school because I’m trying to become clinical psychologist. I’ve done it happily and willingly. 

When he was released from the hospital his mom flew out to “help”. Instead she tried to get him drunk and then left the next day - but not before she yelled at me for two hours as I drove her to the airport about how it’s my fault he’s sick and I need to quit my job to care for him full time. (...who would pay the bills Sherri???). When he got out I begged his doctors for services. A visiting nurse. A day program. Anything. As someone whose worked in psych hospitals I know what there is available - I was turned down every time because he hasn’t been hospitalized enough times. Why would you wait until “4 hospitalizations”? Statistics show schizophrenics with treatment in the first two months have great odds at a “typical” life. It’s like waiting to treat cancer after it spreads.

He was really difficult and against his meds and doctors orders when he was released home in June but over the last month he’s dramatically improved. Delusions are gone. Proper emotional reactions. I’ve been so relieved because for the last two years I didn’t recognize the man I’ve been with for six years and I’ve finally started to see him again.

Until today. He went to see his psychiatrist today by himself and I was really proud because he doesn’t like her. I got a call from someone there immediately after he left who told me he seemed to be doing better. Then I got another call. From the psychiatrist who had lied to me, lied to him and tried to get me to medically treat him which legally I can’t (you can’t treat your family) - and I’ve complained about to the practice. She tore into me. Told me again how inadequate I am. That I’m not providing care enough for him. That he needs more than me. That he’s losing weight again back down to 92 pounds and it’s because “I don’t have food in the house not even peanut butter”. I told her that’s blatantly not true and that I buy him everything he asks for and he eats because I monitor it. But explained how he’s been abusing nicotine and caffeine - which is STANDARD in schizophrenia, and that I’ve voiced my concerns about it repeatedly - and it’s why he’s losing weight. She told me he told her he wasn’t smoking really anymore and that he’s clearly unreliable. No shit. But then she continued to tell me how I’m inadequate and it’s my fault and he needs to be/have a constant caregiver. I don’t know what she wants from me. I’ve begged them to help get him services. A visiting nurse. An aid. Anything. They won’t. He’s not “severe enough”. They expect me to stop working. How can I stop working? We’d have nowhere to live? We’re going broke providing for his care because I’m the only one whose worked in years. 

I also found out he’s been lying about his meds. They cause weight gain and he’s losing weight so they took his blood. He won’t let me administer them. Even though he lied to the facility saying he asked me to and I told them the truth. He hid them and it took me until last month to find them. But since I did he’s improved and told me he’s taking them and now I feel like it’s all manipulation and lies. She wants to get him removed from our home but doesn’t know where she’d have him put because he doesn’t currently meet the criteria to be hospitalized again and her main reason is because I can’t quit my job and he needs “somebody who can be there for him more”.


I want to give up. The last two years of my life have been hell and I stuck it out because I love him and I’ve been desperately trying to get him help. I finally thought things were getting better but I guess not. And I’m really sick of people telling me I’m inadequate. I’m crying my eyes out at work right now. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. How do people do this? I usually have it so together and can figure things out especially because I’ve worked in psychology my entire adult life and even as a teenager. But I am so lost with this. I just want to give up.","I can't even begin to imagine the challenges and pitfalls of being a mental health caregiver to a significant other. I am so sorry you are going through this tough period of life. I was my mother's caregiver after she was diagnosed with cancer and we certainly had our share of issues getting her to take meds, make it to appointments, being admitted to the hospital - those were all things she fought too. But she wasn't capable of any scale of manipulation or hiding things from me - it was always more of a direct confrontation which are a lot easier to handle I'm sure.

I'm afraid I don't have any specific advice on how you can better help him, but I wonder if you could find a good social worker at the hospital to be an ally and advocate for you both? Sometimes they know about things we don't, or have ways of opening doors we can't. I  know they were a lifeline for me when trying to get services. You may have already been down this road, but if not it might be worth a try.

Mostly, I am responding to tell you that you are NOT inadequate. You are an amazing and selfless person to put your life on hold to help another person through such a hard time in their lives. You aren't obligated to stay, but you do, and I think that is so admirable. It sounds like you care about him a great deal and are doing everything in your power to help him heal. Honestly, anyone that isn't sitting there in the weeds with you as you handle this complex situation day in and day out, for years, has any room or right to pass judgment on you. There is not a lot of understanding in society for the pressures and responsibilities placed on caregivers. You have to work extra to make ends meet while also needing to be at home as much as possible. Your needs go out the window and it never feels like it's enough. It's such a hard balancing act.

His mother is probably just looking to place blame on anyone but herself and her son, and it's very sad she can't be more supportive of you, which would of course just be supporting her son by proxy. Just know that you are more than enough, you are doing your absolute best and deserve kindness, grace, and understanding. If you can't get that from these people in your life, you certainly have it from a random internet stranger who has been in similar shoes.
Maybe she doesn’t mean that YOU are inadequate. Maybe she means that the coverage of him is inadequate. That he needs eyes on him more hours of the day, which you can’t do because you are trying to keep a frickin roof over his head and food in his stomach. Just that he needs to be under supervised care.  Nothing against you.  She knows it’s all him. She’s just taking it out on you, trying to bully you to do something that you are absolutely unable to do - stay home 24 hours a day and watch his every move, so he will be 100% compliant.
You wonderful, precious, generous, kind, incredible, amazing human being. You have my full and utter respect because you are over there loving and showing up and that takes courage beyond comprehension. Only you know how it has cost and you have counted that cost and you are incredible. I don’t have words of wisdom, but you have my prayers and my thoughts and whatever strength I can somehow send across the miles. I wish I could help support you. You are amazing and tough as diamonds (and wayyyyyyy more rare).

The only thing I have to say other than being in your corner is that I’m honestly wondering if we can dump this psychiatrist. Is there anyone else he could see? If he doesn’t like her and she is being this awful to you, are there options? Or is she it? Cause it sounds like she is pretty inadequate herself.
Okay, so I'm going to say something you probably don't want to hear - but I bet deep down you know it to be true: why put yourself through this? From what you have described, I can see how much you love and care for your fiance... But that can only go so far when even before he had a mental breakdown he refused help. This is not your burden if it is causing you your own life. I'm not trying to be mean or imply anything, but there also comes a time when you just have to put your foot down and say enough is enough and look out for and take care of yourself - because no one else will like you do. I really truly wish you the best.
I have no advice to give, but I hope you can take care of yourself and get the support you need. You aren’t a bad person if you cannot support him forever. You sound like an incredible person.
I hope y’all can get away from her sooner rather than later!
Sometimes those with mental disorders will ruin the close relationships they have, and as his fiancé you really need to ask yourself if living this way for the rest of your life with him is healthy for you, emotionally. Since you are a professional, you need to make a decision to separate your personal life decisions from your professional life decisions. Sometimes if you are too close to the patient, you are definitely not the best person to treat them. In other words, as much as it pains you, you may need to decide to break things off because otherwise this will continually be your entire life. What he is doing and what his mother is doing are toxic for you, and beyond your scope of ability, because they are abusive to you. Please be safe and save yourself. Then you will be able to help others professionally, if you are not in a close relationship with them.

,Advice and help for caregiver-husband,"My 66 year-old wife lost her foot Feb '18 from an infection due to undiagnosed diabetes.  She had acute sepsis and nearly died, spending a month in the hospital and three months in a nursing home.  She recovered quite well, considering, and has a prosthetic leg.  She was left with some neurological damage, presumably from the sepsis, and is still relearning skills like writing and using utensils.  She doesn't really walk, mostly due to her age and some balance issues, and she uses a wheelchair.   She requires assistance transferring to the toilet, couch, etc., and needs my help cleaning her up after using the bathroom.

Conveniently, I had a good work-at-home job with flexible hours and an understanding boss.  So bathrooming, doctor and PT appointments were not an issue.  Unfortunately, I was let go from that job in July due to company cutbacks.  At 58, finding another situation like I had will be very, very difficult.

Even a modest income would allow me to pursue other part-time or contract work and keep us afloat.

,Advice on finding a caregiver,,"Our Mom has dementia, cold, so we've used both agencies and hired privately. 

I prefer hiring privately. Agencies make it easy by handling payroll and all the legal stuff, but I wasn't able to interview potential caregivers before they sent them over, and a couple of times neither me nor Mom could stand the person, even if they were kind and patient. We're not picky but one lady in particular would not shut up, and she was LOUD, and after 4 hours of that I thanked her and sent her on her way. 

To hire privately I used [Care.com](https://Care.com), paid for the membership one step above the free option, and was pleased with the candidates we got. Although I have noticed that there's not a lot of professionalism in private caregivers, not too many had a resume, or understood an interview process, and I kept getting hand written references that they scribbled out at the last minute. Coming from a business background that was odd to me that they would be so unprepared. 

However, the person we did hire as a p/t live-in, my sister met in a nail salon! She and Mom were getting manicures, and they struck up a conversation. She had been out of work for a couple of months since her last dementia person had died. My sister passed on her info, she had a resume (!) , we had her come for one night a week for about a month to make sure Mom was comfortable with her, and that was that! 

I also recommend word of mouth in your community. Once someone's been a compassionate, reliable, trustworthy caregiver, their former employers are eager to help them continue working. 

As far as interview questions, I just googled for recommendations. I can't remember what sites specifically I took questions from - there were quite a few helpful articles to reference.

I told the resident to press their call-light when they were done using the bathroom and when I got to the other resident’s room I got radioed that she had fell. Well I was already in the middle of toileting the other resident that I was late for so I finished them up, hurried to the fallen resident’s room and the nurse asks me what happened. The resident was sent to the hospital. This resident was a fall risk, I was never supposed to have left her there. Note to all caregivers, please please read their care plans, memorize the fall risk residents as best as you can even if you have 30+ residents that you have to try to keep track of. If you have a million call lights going off at once, utilize your coworkers no matter what to help you. 

I’m still finding it hard to face people because I still cannot forgive myself, but I have to so I can improve and try my best to serve these residents who need to be cared for. I learned a huge lesson today, and I’m still trying to accept that we can all fuck up this badly.","Most care facilities use some sort of marking on the door (oftentimes it's a large red piece of paper with a leaf on it) to indicate residents/patients that are fall risks. You shouldn't have to memorize the fall risks, there should be some indicator in/outside their room.

This was definitely a mistake and feeling bad about it is completely understandable - but don't let it be just a mistake. It sounds like you've definitely learned from the experience! Accept that you made a mistake, but let yourself move on - I know, so much easier said than done, right? But the fact that it bothers you is a sign of your compassion. Don't let it be the end of your learning experience in this job! Keep your head down, focus on the job in front of you, and let yourself grow. You'll be great. ;)
Recognizing the mistake is 99% of fixing any problem. Part of the remaining percentage, is not doing that again. I have been on the job for almost 20 years. I have seen a lot of bad shit and had a lot of really shitty days. Life goes on and you try to move ahead always. Try to smile and mean it,always. Take good care of yourself,always. At the end of the day,its all just another layer of skin that is getting thicker every day. Keep calm,chive on or some such common drivel. Heavy sigh.
You have to remember that you are working with a handicap your first minute on the job.  What is the patient to aide ratio there? If it is like everywhere else, you are expected to be too many places at once. When you are stretched that thin, all you can do is your best. You may never be perfect because you are not given favorable conditions to do the job the way it should be done.

That said, I know how terrible you feel, now that your patient has fallen. It has happened to me. All you can do is learn from it. Try to figure out a way to keep it from happening again. Keep your own list of fall risks, maybe.  But move on, apologize to your patient, and I know you’ll keep a sharper eye out now.
Honestly, thank you for sharing this story because I’ll be starting RN school and now I’ll definitely be more mindful of this on clinicals. It sucks that for us the mistakes we make on the job can actually hurt people, that’s the scary trade-off for wanting to help people professionally. You’re still a caring person and I hope you feel better soon.

,Can I (30F) reasonably care for my mother (63) when she has no ability to care for herself?,"My earliest memory is my 3rd birthday party, where as I watched my mom scramble to start baking the birthday cake in the middle of my birthday party, I thought to myself, ""She didn't think this through."" So I can say with certainty that I've always had a problem with trusting my mother's judgement. 

When her sister set her up with a decent government clerk job, my mother moved away from all of her family, but then got lonely, so she hooked up with an old friend -- who was engaged to another woman -- so that she could finally have baby. Problem is, she's petulant at her best and having a panic attack at her worst. Ordinary life problems can send her into a fit and when I was a kid, that meant taking out her anger on me. When I was a teenager, I learned about ""depression"" and ""manic-bipolar"" and ""conflict mediation"" and trained her on how to talk out her frustrations. But the moment I graduated, I left her behind -- which wasn't hard since she kicked me out for taking English and math college classes during my summer break instead of getting a job like a normal person. She'd become as jealous of me as she was of her sisters. My father's wife took me out to dinner when she realized my mother wasn't going to do anything to celebrate my graduation.

It took a long time for me to realize that my mother took care of me so poorly because of her own problems and not because I was unworthy. That I never got along with my mother because she's a difficult person, not because I was a bad girl. My dad tried to patch up problems he saw; take me to the beauty salon when my hair was matted, buy me bras and feminine supplies when my mother was in denial about puberty... When Grandma turned 90, Mom drove us to her hometown, saw that Grandma wasn't at her senior apartment, and was ready to drive back home, saying it wasn't her fault she couldn't find her. I had to take her cell phone, call up my aunts and find out where the obvious birthday party was being held. It was then that I realized that my mother's ability to think, plan and problem-solve was fundamentally broken and it effected every relationship she had. Uh, the way one auntie says it, ""I wouldn't trust her to babysit my dog.""

That was then, and now... Now she's diabetic, injured, frail, handicapped and in desperate need of help. And I don't care. She's financially in the hole, owing at least $30,000 on her credit cards. She was supposed to retire 5 years ago but didn't because she can't live without her pension and SS. She was supposed to be in a house by now, perhaps with a duplex she could rent for extra income, but if she couldn't have a house nicer than her more successful sisters, she wasn't interested in it. She finally finished her Associate's Degree in Accounting, but never did anything with it since she's still just as insecure of her intelligence as always. And her hoarding has reached its natural conclusion. 13 years after leaving her, shelves in the bathroom and kitchen are filled with the same things from when I left, and yet I could pick up a bottle or can of anything and calmly tell her it needs to be trashed and she will whimper and whine that she wants to keep it. And I just don't care.

Every aspect of her life is messed up and I'm left wondering how to approach this 60-year trainwreck, if for no other reason than the vague sense that elderly people shouldn't live in infested homes. I don't think that I'd be a good caregiver for her at all, but I also know she will start a fight with anyone over anything to avoid being taken out of her comfort zone. Experts? She'll smile sweetly and ""listen"" to everything they say, then trash them the moment she leaves. What expectations should I have? How should I communicate with her going forward? Right now, her wish is that I'd become a Home Health Aid so that I can take care of her. Seriously. When she wanted to find a house, she wanted me to become a real estate agent. When she wanted to start a child care business, she told me I'd make a great teacher. So, in a way, birthing me was the only long-term planning my mother ever committed to. XD","Hi - speaking as a home visiting nurse (no longer practicing), as well as someone with a complex history with my own mother -- here are a couple of thoughts:

1.  As long as she is able to make her own decisions, that's what she's going to do.  You can't make her decisions for her.  Unless she is deemed incompetent by a psychologist and is taken into care in an institution, but that  doesn't sound like the case just yet.
2. If she is handicapped and unable to care for herself easily, you might be able to find out if she qualifies for any community social services.  If she does, you or she might be able to connect with a medical social worker to figure out options.
3. And, no, it is not reasonable to expect you to become a home health aide.  You may be willing to pay for one, or for a house cleaner, or whatever, but that's your decision.  
4. What may happen -- a situation I've seen a LOT -- is that the situation may have to worsen (due to her poor decision making) until she goes to the hospital for something.  If you live in the U.S., most hospitals (!!!) need to have a safe discharge plan for their patients, and that might be an opportunity to get a medical social worker involved to help figure out options.
You are not going to become a home health aid.  Hire them, manage them, whatever, but don't become one.  And tell her that flat out.   

Like u/donut_tell_tales said, most hospitals have safe discharge policies, but unless you are there to attest that she has no additional help, etc, the hospital may discharge her anyway because of her insurance.  Also, your mother may lie to them and tell them she has friends who will help her. Mine did.

How long term of care does she need, immediately? Does it require her living with you or someone? For now or for always? Is her injury something that she could recover from and go on living her life her way until it definitely gets worse?  Because it will.  

For the past 10 years I was unable to get my mother (now 73 going on 97) to give up her independence, despite her inability to care for herself at all.  It has taken her getting so ill that she is unaware of how little time she may have left. My brother, who lived 100 miles closer to her, wrote her off and doesn't really speak to her anymore because of her refusal to take care of herself or manage her finances (and because she's difficult).   After a recent stroke and debilitating illness, I had to give  her an ultimatum of the same outcome if she refused to come live with me.  I frankly told her that if she didn't come live with me she could forget my phone number and never see her grandkids again (she needed time to consider it and didnt answer me for 3 days).  She has no idea how sick she really is and I am learning firsthand how little mental capacity she actually has left.  It's terrifying.

Help your mother  in whatever functional ways you can, but don't expect her to change who she is just because she should.  Understand that the more you try to change her, the more infuriating her refusal to change will be.  It will drive you  apart.  

Good luck!",2019-08-07 11:50:58,ProserpinaFC,cn7ips
,Positivity,"My Mom used to say ""things aren't ever as bad, or as good, as they seem."" 

You probably know someone who said some version of that too. And it's true. 

Yet caring for a loved one living with any form of dementia is so grueling and so sad, it's easy to be swallowed up by it--and forget. 

But there can can still be happiness. We just have to work hard on, and for, ourselves so we're 'present' when the moments come--to enjoy and appreciate them. It's not how any of us drew it up, but those moments of happiness become memories to cherish. 

Here's to making new memories today.

,Safety (for caregivers) in the car?,"So, I tried Googling this, but all that I ended up with was results on child safety and seatbelts.

My husband and I part-time caregive for my younger brother who has some developmental and intellectual disabilities, and is paranoid schizophrenic.

He's been on a tear mid-rise this week, and today he attacked my husband.

Both of them are fine, though our options when filing the report were to either cite him, resulting in NC between him and husband until court proceedings, or nothing.

We had to opt for nothing and filed a report, as he is not eligible for third party caregivers just yet.

We will now be using a ""two person system,"" with him, meaning both of us will be present when we need to interact with him.

How do we stay safe in the car with him on the way to appointments, errands, et al?

We cannot wait for public transportation, nor afford a ride share service at this time.

I am thinking him in passenger seat, me behind, husband driving..

Any other tips?","> I am thinking him in passenger seat, me behind, husband driving..

This seems like the worst option to me. He could interfere with your husband driving without giving you much ability to react.

Personally, I'd put your brother in the backseat either sitting by himself or you sitting with him.

If him reaching into the front seat is a huge concern, you could buy a dog barrier that attaches to the back of the headrests. A towel or blanket tied around the headrests and seat mounts could help too.
That seems like the safest choice. Maybe you can think of a seatbelt & harness that he can’t get out of? One that locks behind him? Anything that will keep him sitting tight where he is. I know it’s probably not legal, but you do what you gotta do to stay safe.",2019-08-01 23:27:23,Y-Cha,ckypa4
,Enabling or following orders? Any advice is really appreciated.,"Mental health caregivers please give any advice you have - or anyone really. I feel like I’m losing my mind.

I’m a caregiver (and fiancé) to someone recently diagnosed with a psychotic disorder. Been together 6 years, been symptomatic 2, psychotic break two months ago involving police, secret service etc. 

I’ve had a really awful time dealing with his doctors, both when he was on the 5250 hold and now in his outpatient program. I also happen to be a Therapeutic Crisis Intervention mental health counselor, RBT and ABA therapist and am in school to become a psychologist so a lot of his doctors have taken advantage of that background I have and kind of pushed their responsibilities on me - (you can read more in previous posts if you wish).

At the end of his last psychiatrist apt she called me in to talk. She asked that I administer his medication from now on - specifically his antipsychotic because we all strongly suspect he’s not taking it properly. She knows I have experience doing that, that I’m medication administration certified and that I dealt with this at the mental hospital I used to work at. He looks me dead in the face and goes “oops...I was supposed to tell you to do that before...I forgot”. So apparently I’ve been supposed to be doing this for several weeks. She also asked me my concerns about his mental health IN FRONT OF HIM (a lot of his delusions and aggression is towards me, blames me for his hospitalization, and he’s told her he doesn’t trust me and it’s been a safety risk so why the heck would I be comfortable addressing any of it while he’s staring me down subtly shaking his head “no” at me???) so I didn’t feel comfortable saying anything.


It’s been a week and I haven’t given him his medication once. He got frustrated immediately after we left that he feels nobody trusts him to take it and that she apparently threatened him with a nurse coming to give them if he won’t let me do it. When he first came home from the hospital I immediately noticed he wasnt taking the antipsychotic and talked to him about it and he started hiding the pills. It’s happened again. I can’t find them anywhere. The day we got home I put both pill bottles on the nightstand - the antidepressant is there the antipsychotic is gone. He’s been stable/not having delusions but he’s confused very frequently which is a big part of this illness. I tried to talk to him more than once about the pills and made it very clear I will not lie to the doctors for him if they ask if I’m giving him his meds and he refuses to have the discussion. This morning at 530am I woke up and had a massive anxiety attack because the pill bottle was missing and I’ve looked everywhere. I tried to talk to him again and he said it must have fallen while he was cleaning but I looked where he said. He then told me he was going to take them when he went to bed (up all night sleeps all day) - he didn’t. He thought I went to sleep but I was wide awake and watched him get in bed next to me and go to bed sans any medication. I’ve been told by his doctors not to confront his confusion, delusions etc. basically not do anything to set him off or confront him with reality because it will only make it worse. Basically been told not to piss him off. 


I feel like I’m enabling him. If I knew where the pill bottle was maybe it would be different but at the same time every time I try and talk to him about his medication the hostility rises and I’m supposed to immediately drop whatever subjects aggravate him. I literally don’t know what to do anymore. At the hospital I worked at it was really simple - take your meds or x y and z will happen and you don’t want those consequences like respite. It was structured and there was always a “doctor/patient” relationship so it was fairly simple. This is such a different dynamic. I know nobody can force him to take his medication, he’s in his 20s it’s ultimately his choice. But meanwhile for the last two years I’ve juggled school, working full time and cleaning the house myself while all he does is sleep and play video games. And he’s backsliding. The confusion is worse, he’s not showering again, not brushing his teeth. I think he’d lose even more weight if they weren’t weighing him every other week because of the food refusal. But when the psych ward sent someone to evaluate him because his psychiatrist and everyone at the outpatient place think he’s “extremely sick” they basically were like “he’s not violent he said he’ll comply so we won’t hospitalize him again” - but it’s what he needs at this point or a more intense program at least. I’m so worried he’s going to backslide into a worse place than he was during his psychotic break. He genuinely believes this whole thing is a misunderstanding and that he has no diagnosis despite the paperwork he was discharged with being extremely clear. His psychiatrist keeps stressing the importance of his meds and how serious this is as the secret service got involved (literally interrogated me at my job in front of my bosses causing me to almost lose said job). 

How the hell do I tread around this? Don’t piss him off don’t make him mad don’t confront him with reality - but make him take his meds, find them if he hides them etc (they’re literally nowhere I’ve turned the house upside down I was ready to search through the trash cans until he caught me looking this morning). Any advice as to how I can handle this would be so appreciated.

I’m sorry this is so long and I’m word vomiting everywhere I just have no idea what to do and very little support. Everyone wants me to leave him and if dies he dies if he winds up in jail whatever etc. but I just can’t. You wouldn’t say that about a spouse with a different illness, it’s because of the stigma around mental health. I’m just desperate for ideas. No amount of schooling or experience in the field has taught me how to cope with this.","I am not a professional, just another caretaker that has read and listened to your story ... and I think you already have your answer.

>At the hospital I worked at it was really simple - take your meds or x y and z will happen and you don’t want those consequences like respite. It was structured and there was always a “doctor/patient” relationship so it was fairly simple. This is such a different dynamic.

In his delusions you are not a neutral person, he sees you as his problem and doesn't trust you.  Because of that it doesn't sound as if he will allow you to be his caretaker.

The past doesn't matter right  now because he is delusional so whether or not he  is your fiance or live-in partner or have a medical/professional training that can help him he probably can't get past his mental illness and his blaming you to remember that.

And, really, I don't think your problem is him ... and I think you know that.  Your problem is that his doctors are expecting you to be able to force him healthy despite the fact that he is focused on you as his problem.

>She also asked me my concerns about his mental health IN FRONT OF HIM (a lot of his delusions and aggression is towards me, blames me for his hospitalization, and he’s told her he doesn’t trust me and it’s been a safety risk so why the heck would I be comfortable addressing any of it while he’s staring me down subtly shaking his head “no” at me???) so I didn’t feel comfortable saying anything.

You aren't his doctor, you aren't responsible for making him do what he clearly said in front of you both he wouldn't ... and both you and his doctor need to find someone neutral that can help him.

If it were me I would make an appointment for myself with his doctors, hopefully the whole team of doctors, and tell them what is happening and that THEY need to find another solution ...

Isn't your situation the exact reason that doctors don't treat members of their own families ????

Good luck, and remember you aren't his doctor or therapist, your his lover !

,Any other caregivers bullied by doctors of the person they’re caring for or just me??,"Today I made a call on behalf of my fiancé who I have recently become a caregiver for after he was diagnosed with a severe mental health disorder (a diagnosis he’s extremely unwilling to accept) because he believed himself to be out of one of his medications.

After speaking with both the pharmacy and doctor and determining he should have another two weeks worth of pills as I had believed and initially said to him, his doctor became very adamant about wanting to send him back to a psychiatric hospital because she thinks he’s not properly taking his medication/the dose is too low. She asked me to be the one to inform him she would be sending a crisis team out to our home to evaluate him - which I told her I was not comfortable with doing (when he had his psychotic break he made threats towards me and a lot of his agitation was directed at myself and our family, and he has expressed every day since that he will be angry if I force him back into a psych ward - I’m also an RBT and TCI therapist...). She put a ton of pressure on me but eventually dropped it because he’s not showing signs of psychosis or agitation just some confusion.


She called me a little while ago to tell me she called crisis intervention anyways and is sending them to my home when I get off work to evaluate him (after she talked to him - and did not tell him this). She again told me I need to be the one to inform him of this and asked me to lie to him about it. She told me to “just tell him it’s because he complains he’s allergic to the meds. In reality it’s because he’s so unpredictable. Just tell him it’s because he says he’s allergic. Tell him that. This way I can sleep tonight”. Like okay lady. Glad YOU can sleep tonight. I’ve never lied to him once in six years of being together. And it’s not my job to tell him why he’s being evaluated. She’s his doctor I am not. I feel like she’s bullying me and putting all this pressure on me because she feels like she can.

This isn’t the first doctor in this situation who has done this. The entire two weeks he was on his psych hold his doctors, social workers and psychiatrists would call me all hours at work demanding I leave my job to come to the hospital to “evaluate him for baseline behaviors”. That’s literally their job description. But because of my background and education they wanted me to come look at him and give my opinions on his mental health and make the judgement calls I shouldn’t be making because you’re literally not supposed to treat family. And I’m still in school to become a psychologist so I don’t even have the right type of license for them to have put that on me. When I refused they would call my phone and berate me telling me how “difficult” and “uncooperative” I am. 


Is this the norm for caregivers? Is this the typical experience? I like genuinely want to know what I’m getting myself into here. For the last two years he’s shown signs of illness and for the last year I’ve paid all the bills for both of us myself working full time and another part time job plus school just to get by supporting him, and now that he’s this sick I have no idea how I’m going to do this alone. It’s only been a month and a half and I feel like I’m drowning. I’ve fought tooth and nail to try and get services for him and every time I come up blank. And I feel like the way these doctors keep dumping their responsibilities on me is putting me in such a dangerous situation. She told me word for word he told her he “doesn’t trust me” so for her to put me in position and repeatedly over the course of three separate calls ask that I lie to him puts me in a really bad situation. Is this the norm? Do doctors just dump it all on caregivers? Is it just the mental health system in CT? I worked in a mental hospital in New York and we NEVER did this to the caregivers. I’m just so confused.","I'm not familiar with the licensing boards for that profession but you might want to see if this is a violation. If so, get it reported. They are putting you in an unbearable situation.
WTF?!? Asking you to lie?  Having you give the bad news because they don’t want to?  Seriously?  That’s messed up.  That’s their job.  If they are going to send a team over they should tell their patient that.  If there was no fiancé, what would they do?  They’d have to tell him.  

I’ve never had doctors bully me like that.  I have had them flat out ignore me.  They just wouldn’t listen to me.  They they would just patronize me.  Their ignorance landed my mother in the hospital.  They started listening, well a few of them did anyway.
That’s horrible.  Are you stuck with that psychiatrist or can you get a new one through the insurance?  I’ve done that with my mother before.
I've been shuffled around from doctor to doctor, hospital to hospital with my mom. The ONLY WAY we have gotten anything done is with a lawyer - which has cost us so much money it's unbelievable. Is your fiance's family around to help?",2019-07-17 17:46:25,Pandaswife95,cejdif
,Looking for recommendations: Mobile medical alert with pendant or wrist band,"My father is getting ready to move into an assisted living facility. They have the pull-cord system with only 2 cord locations in his room: by his  bed and by his chair (or he could move that one to the bathroom.)

I'm looking for something he can wear around his neck or on his wrist in case he has an emergency and is away from the pull cord locations. (Outside the facility is not an issue as he will not be traveling outside unassisted.)

Can anyone recommend a decently priced solution that has either a neck pendant or wrist wearable? Ideally it would have an option to call a number that you choose (I would just have it call the nurse station at the facility he is living in.)

Would anyone care to chat sometime? i don't know about you but the life of a caregiver is very lonely sometimes. I'm an educated male in his early 40s. Trying to keep it all together. We don't have a large group of friends anymore. Most have ""abandonded"" us because of my wife's inability to get out much and that she has to rest so much. Additionally, I'm starting to suspect her cognitive skilsl are failing.

&#x200B;

The remaining people are there for us if needed but they have their own lives and kids, etc. My best friends will drop everything for us and they are great at just ""listening"" but sometimes I wish I could chat and share frustration, ideas, tips, and laughs with someone that knows what I'm dealing with.

I'm in MA if anyone ever wanted to meet. How about a lunch group some weekend? Just us caregivers to hang and chill. It's been a battle for me ... trying to keep it together. One good thing ... i'm learning to cook (turns out i'm pretty good at it- who knew?).

He won’t talk to me much, he just sits on his computer. It’s been an extremely rapid deterioration since I picked him up 48 hours ago when he was discharged. I warned the psychiatrist he wasn’t ready but they said it wasn’t really their problem. I don’t know how to help him. I’m reading all the paperwork he was discharged with, all the notes from all the doctor’s meetings and the books I ordered on his diagnosis - but even with a career in psychology at 23 I don’t feel equipped to handle this, especially when he doesn’t want help and is full blown psychosis and with no support of my own. Everyone is pressuring me to just cut him out of my life - but where would he go? He has no family here. His mother is an addict from the other side of the country. I know the survival statistics for schizophrenics. They’re not good. Especially without someone to care for them. I don’t think I could live with that kind of guilt. I’ve reached out to a ton of places in my area trying to find support for both him and myself but it’s not going well. What if I can’t do this? What will happen to me? What if I try and I fail? What if I’m at work and he self medicated and ODs again? I’m so afraid. The future is so scary to me now.","I'm so very, very, VERY sorry that you're here/he's in that shape. That is horrible. Honestly, I don't know how you've come this far without other support - does he have a social worker? I can't believe they discharged him in that state and there's no follow up or some sort of other support (well, I mean - I CAN believe it, I know how terrible our health care [especially mental health] is, I just don't WANT to believe it). 

I don't have any great words of wisdom or even decent advice. The only thing I can say is the advice I give most caregivers from my own experience: do the job in front of you. Don't worry any further than you need to. Figure out what you need to keep going at this moment, come up with a plan to get that taken care of, take care of it, and move on to the next task. Focus on the moment to moment; the future can overwhelm you.

That's my advice; but my concern is that you're dealing with a drowning swimmer. Of course you don't want to just abandon him to drown; but please, please take care of yourself. Don't let yourself get pulled under with him. I know it's horrible to say and to feel like you're giving up - but somewhere inside of him is the REAL him, and you know he wouldn't want that. Do what you can - but take care of yourself. 

I'm so so sorry. If there's any sort of virtual support I can offer, I'm here, please feel free to PM.
Is he in bad enough shape to be Baker Acted to a different facility?
He needs to go back to a psych ward. See if you have another in the county. He seems like he would qualify for disability, but that would take awhile to get even with doctor's notes. See if he qualifies for Medicaid, if he does I think the state will pay you to take care of him on top of disability. But that's going to take awhile, assuming you are in the States, though you might stll have something like that outside of the states.
He is evidently somewhat competent. If he ODs while you are at work, it certainly won’t be your fault. It will be a decision he made and carried out. You are in an impossible situation. Sorry, I forget what your post said now - have you contacted Adult Protective Services? If not, I would immediately. They will evaluate him, that will take some of the burden off of you. You shouldn’t have to carry this alone. Stay strong hun.
I get your situation. I'm helping a friend through similar.

I have no solutions. Just stay present for yourself and stay in the moment. One second at a time. Make the best decision you can in the moment.

But be aware, your life is at stake here too. Your mental wellbeing, your career, your education.

Good luck.

,(vent) What motivates me to keep going doesn't matter.,"My wife just gave me an ear full about how she thinks I'm not caring for her out of love but just out of obligation.

Like, the fuck?  Who fucking cares why I'm taking care of her? Does she not fucking see that my entire day revolves around making sure she's cared for?  I help her walk, I help her to the bathroom, I manage her medical appts and contact with the dr. offices, I manage her meds and set them out for her.  I make her food, clean up her things, help her get dressed sometimes.  I'm 100% disabled from my military service, I'm currently recovering from a severe sinus infection (during which I was still taking care of her), I'm working a part-time job, and going to school full time, and raising our 4 kids, and running our whole fucking house and finances.  God damn it.  But I don't kiss her often enough, even though she constantly tells me not to touch her because she hurts too much.  I don't spend enough time with her when she's unconscious most of the time and I have the rest of our existence to manage.  

And the newest bullshit. I need to Stop CONTROLLING her.  CONTROLLING HER?!  WHAT!?!?!?!  Because, apparently, I just do things for her like help her pick something up, or wake her when she falls asleep in her food, or help her in and out of the car into her wheelchair.  

I'm constantly, fucking constantly required to implicitly know when she wants me to do something without her saying anything and, at the same time supposed to wait until she says something to do anything, which she does in a terribly condescending way like I should have known to do it without being told.

So, am I still here doing all this shit out of love or out of obligation?

I love her.

I'm here and doing the job, be it love, compassion, duty, obligation, whatever.  It does not matter why, only that it's done.

P.S. This sub is the only place I have to talk about any of this, I appreciate you.","You’re rocking it, bud.  And she knows it.  But she’s having a hard time with the loss of her independence and it’s a little scary for her.  I had it a little easier than you, but I’ve been through a lot of it.  At some point it’s important to sit her down and have an honest talk, husband to wife, about the fact that you’re doing the best you can in a calm manner.  Let her know you’re both in this together but you need some help from her too.  You’re there for the long haul, you’re not going anywhere, but you need to know she’s on board.  Have a long talk, outside of the normal routine with no kids, just the two of you.  When you married you teamed up against the world.  See if you can get back to that place.  Best of luck.  And High Five for being a superhuman.
You are amazing!!! Thank you for all you do for your wife.  If she doesn’t say it then I will!!! Thank you for your hard work and your love you show.♥️♥️♥️
I appreciate all you are enduring and I think you are amazing. Thank you. ❤️🌞🎉
I take care of my dad and understand when you say they don't think we do enough.
My husband tells me that all the time, some of the things he says now are just downright mean.  I don't deserve it and it isn't true. In the moment I get so mad! I do love him and I do this BECAUSE I love him.
 Sometimes I do see all this work I have to do for him as a chore.  It's hard work and I would really like to be doing something else. I'd like to have him appreciate me more, be thankful he has me to care for him, otherwise he'd be in a nursing facility. 
Since his stroke he's disabled, can't work, can't walk, can't drive, can't even move his own wheelchair.  His life is small now, he's not got a whole lot going on.  He's in a lot of pain, and when all he does is focus on his pain he directs his anger and frustration to me. I suspect your wife is doing the same thing. And when he says those things to me there are no words I can say to convince him it's not true, and now i know it's him not me. I know in my heart what is true and that is what matters. 
So you did the right thing, you vented to the right people.  We understand! We know you do it out of love, otherwise you really wouldn't be doing it.
We literally had the same ""discusson"" last night. Honestly, I am sort of just doing it out of obligation at this point but we are married. I HAVE to do it. I know she would take care of me. Feel free to DM if you want to talk. I totally understand. You are doing great. She knows it.
I’m 64 and care for my 84 yr old Mom with beginning stages of dementia.  I swore to my father, on his deathbed (at home) I would never make my mom leave her lovely home to go to a facility, so here I am.  Last night my mom said something really mean to me (getting more frequent) and told me the reason I was here was for the free rent (my father paid cash for this house 25 yrs ago).  No mortgage payment, I pay electric bill, groceries, cook, take her to Dr., blah blah blah.  My life is on fucking HOLD.  No boyfriend, no social life, spend most days in my bedroom (I’m retired). I am so upset with her ugly words I just want to get the hell out, but I won’t do that.  I just found this reddit site at 3 am out of desperation.  I’m glad I did.  I feel guilty if I complain so at least I can vent here (I hope).  I have 3 brothers nearby that don’t like seeing Mom like this so they’re useless.

,IHSS Hours and Respite Sources,"Hello!

&#x200B;

Thank you for your attention and help!

&#x200B;

My brother (28 y/o male) fell victim to a traumatic brain injury last year and now needs around the clock care. He is wheelchair bound, suffers very short term memory, and lacks reasoning (ex: will attempt to roll himself down stairs). My mom has taken on the monumental task of taking care of him - something she will now have to do for the rest of her life. Yesterday, IHSS (California) came to determine her billable hours. The worker determined something around 30 hours, an amount that will barely allow them to live off of. My question, is there anything we can do that can give her more hours? This is a 24 hour job for her, so it was very disheartening to find out she only was approved for around 30 hours. Any tips or insight would be much appreciated.

&#x200B;

To follow up on that, can anyone provide me with some resources for free or cheap respite care. The sacrifice my mother is making is starting to take a mental toll on her as she is realizing that she will never have free time or time to herself. I am trying to find her breaks any way I can. We are very new to this. Again, any help would be awesome!

&#x200B;

Thanks again for your time!

\- Steeze","30 hrs for the whole month or each week?
Steeze, I would try and appeal the 30 hr determination with the state if possible. I have been in your moms shoes here in Utah for 13 years. My son was injured in a diving accident and requires similar levels of care. The TBI your brother suffered makes things harder than what I deal with ( c-3 quad). Long term care like this is crazy difficult and takes a toll on the whole family. I feel like I was still in shock  after a year and even now but things are easier now than they were then. The best thing you can do is stay positive and try to keep moving forward. Take care of yourself first. Try to help your family as much as you can. If you need something, don't be afraid to ask. There is always a way around any problem and there are people who want to help. The situation sucks and always will to some extent but there are bright spots to be found here and there.

,Caregiving for spouse and younger person,My dh had a stroke at 44 years old. It seems like most of the help out there is setup for caregivers taking care of the elderly. We were in our 40's and had children at home. Plus now I am a caregiver for my spouse. How to find support from others in a similar situation.,"It’s hard.  I care for my adult sister who is disabled.  There are always parallels between the recipients of care, but I’ve found that people rarely understand my situation.  Most want to get back to their life without understanding that I’ve never had my own life because I’ve been her caregiver since forever.  I was 19 when I became one of her guardians.
I've been a caregiver for my wife for 28 of our 32 year marriage after she was diagnosed with MS.  Some days are definitely better than others.

Number 1, take care of yourself.  It can be hard, but at the very least, journal.  It will help you to manage your thoughts and feelings and help you remember that your personality is still there.  You are more than ""just"" a caregiver just as your husband is more than ""just"" a stroke victim.

Caregiver Action Network has been helpful.  Not as far as resources are concerned, but a monthly e-mail confirming I am not alone helps me tremendously.

 [https://caregiveraction.org/](https://caregiveraction.org/) 

One last piece of advice from my experience.  DO NOT relieve your anxiety with alcohol.  It helps in the short term but long term it's unsustainable.
Hello, i’m in a similar situation. My wife had a stroke at 27, and we currently have 4 kids under 8.

From my experience, 90% of the caregiver info is set up for elderly. I have found some really interesting academic papers to help me though. This sounds boring, but they have been super helpful for me. I will try to provide some links later today.

Googling “young stroke” has helped too. That tends to be the phrasing that gets me the most relevant results.
I'm in the same boat.  He had a massive disabling stroke 2 years ago and we are also in our 40s. Navigating Medicare,  Medicaid,  other services has been a nightmare i don't have anyone to ask that's experienced in this. And now losing our friends because we can't do the things we used to do with them. It's lonely and isolating.  I'd imagine if I was older I'd fit right in with the elderly group.",2019-06-18 15:18:17,itsmytimenow201,c26ikh

Thanks in advance.","Care.com may be worth a try, though I am not familiar with the market down in LA and where I am it seems to be very hit or miss(Los Angeles or Louisiana?). It could certainly be worth a post in a local themed subreddit(google the nearest metropolitan area if in Louisiana) and someone may know someone who they have experience with. In my area some clinics/nursing homes/libraries have a bulletin board as well that you could post to, its possible that that might be common in your area as well.",2019-06-12 22:09:20,HolyshitlikeWOW,c0002c

,Is it legal to work with a client outside of the company,"Hi! I currently work for a caregiving company and I do in home caregiving. One of my clients offered to pay me more than what I’m making right now. Also, is willing to be a lot more flexible schedule. The client said they will stop being a client with my company then I can work from them full time. I don’t know if it’s legal to do this or if I will get in trouble? 

Thanks!","When I worked for an agency I had to sign a paper that banned me working for any of their clients personally for a year after working for that company. You couldn’t be seen in town with them. Only having one client doesn’t guarantee you a job,because they could pass at anytime. So maybe consider those things when making your choice. Good luck. Care giving can be such rewarding, heartbreaking work. I moved in and lived with an elderly man that had a fall after his wife that I took care of thru the agency died. It was kind of a loophole since I wasn’t his caregiver before. I lived there 3 years and we became good friends until he passed away at 96.
Not really a safe route to go unless you: 1) have your CNA at the very least, 2) planning on getting a business license, and 3) plan on getting home healthcare insurance. If something goes wrong and you’re not licensed you could be sued by the client or family, or potentially your former employer just for “poaching”.
It might be easier to use something like [familydirected.com](https://familydirected.com) 

From what I have read, they will help set up the employment relationship between you and your client. That being said, most agencies have some kind of non compete clause to prevent exactly this situation. Agencies charge insane fees though, so it would probably be more cost effective for your client to bounce from using an agency.",2019-06-04 19:26:58,delilahhazlewood,bwvo83
,Emergency Alerting System using Alexa,"Requesting advice about technology that could be used as a reliable intercom system. We are looking for a way to ensure that we can communicate between rooms in case of an emergency with our grandfather who lives at home but recently needs to be watched full time because he is unable to swallow properly. Our grandfather has recently been placed on 24 hour care because of asphyxiation risk, so he has an aide in his room all night to monitor him. His wife is currently sleeping in the guest room downstairs but needs to be alerted at a moments notice without the press of a button if the aide needs assistance in the case of an emergency.

They’ve tried baby monitors so the aide could yell for help in that scenario, but they are disruptive to his wife’s sleep because she can hear him coughing in it or the aide watching TV ect.

Recently they’ve been trying an Amazon Echo system with one in grandfathers room and a dot in her bedroom, but sometimes when we try the drop in feature it does not work. 

I would really appreciate any suggestions you have for a communication system because they are helping keep my grandfather safe and as comfortable in his home as possible.","My mother has a Google home, not sure if the same program is availabl on Alexa, but on Google they have an app called ""Call my buddy.""

,How do you manage guilt?,"I am an only child who has been caring for my divorced mum who is a stroke survivor since I was 26 years old. It has been close to 5 years now. 

Mum needs help for all activities of daily living and is mostly bed-bound. Due to my full-time job, I hire a live-in helper to care for my mum. 

The helper does her job but there are times when she is ambivalent to mum’s feelings and behaves coldly. 

It is my daily struggle to come to terms with this arrangement. I blame myself for not being able to take care of my mum personally. Rationally, I know that this is the best arrangement for mum as I don’t bear to see her under institution care, away from home and away from our dog (her best companion). However, I also question myself what else and what more can I do for her.

How do you manage any guilt that you feel?","It sounds like you're doing the best you can, and I think you should be proud of that. Remember to take time outside of your job too for yourself. You're only human and you deserve a full life for yourself. I started reading about stoicism and I am trying to practice the meditation, maybe it will help you find a peace of mind.
You feel guilt and that means A. You deeply care for your mom and B. You are super conscientious. 
You are going above and beyond. Give yourself credit.  Burnout is common, though. Take care of yourself, too.
All caregivers are not cold and ambivalent. Consider looking around for someone else.
I've been where you are, and like others have said here, you are doing the best with what you have.  The only way to overcome the guilt, for myself anyways, is by recognizing you are most likely doing more for them than they wanted you to... and that while there are times where it is not an ideal situation (i.e. the helper acting coldly) it is better than the alternative where they have no one else there when you are not around... because in the end you are only human and can only do so much.
I strongly suggest that you get a caregiving agency. You don't need to feel guilty. There are plenty of other, better suited caregivers than someone who is cold.",2019-05-21 04:26:17,jscyy,br7suw

How do you guys deal and help with back pain? I'm relatively new to caregiving and would love some advice. Thank you!","I second the TENS unit, but I also use Thermacare wraps, they are good for 8 hours and the gentle warmth keeps my back from tightening up
Interesting question.  I say this because when I ask people about this they tell me to exercise.  Sure.  Okay.  I will just leave my parent home alone so I can go exercise...Anyway, I digress.  My body has fallen apart since caregiving for 10 years and I now use a tens unit, a cheap $30 tens unit.  They don't work for everyone, though.
 Lift with your legs, not your back. Pull the patient as close to you as possible to turn or stand up. On a two person lift, make sure you lift at the same time. Don’t lift and twist at the same time. Hot baths and a muscle rub helps get ready to do it again the next day.  Be careful!

,Abusive disabled parent?,"To put it simply, I’m 21, in school, and the breadwinner of my family since my mom and dad can’t work. My dads disability check has gone toward bills and I cover extra expenses. My moms still independent, but was a heavy smoker and had a heart attack so she’s very weak now. My dad can’t walk and has a brain injury.

But whenever my dad wants something, mainly coca colas, he gets very angry with me when I tell him he has to wait. Or cookies. Or how I won’t give him 5 dollars or something. So he threatens to “beat my ass” since I am his kid, loud yelling and beating on the wall, grabbing me, but today he’s resorted to repeatedly hitting me on the thigh with a picker-upper, enough to leave a bruise.

Is there anything I can do to stop this? I get really sick of him being under appreciative.","Was he like this while you were growing up? If not, it may be time to ask his doctor about meds for  his mood. He shouldn't be taking it out on you, but he may be depressed or otherwise unstable. 

Also, can you get any outside help? Medicare may be able to cover someone to give you a hand.
In-a-Blue-Moon, this isn't unappreciative, this is abusive, and this is far more than a 21-year-old college student should ever need deal with. I hope you find a way to leave this home and toxic environment as soon as possible.
Can you go to a free counseling session at your college? I had a similar situation and unfortunately didn’t have the resources to get through it in a healthy way until I moved out. 

I would definitely seek out a counselor or social worker to see what can be done in your case. Another suggestion was offered that you should speak to your father’s doctor, which sounds like a good idea too.
Is it a personality change for him? If it is, talk to his doctor. I'm assuming that you have medical power of attorney or can get it, given your parents' circumstances.

If you cant get him in to the doctor, at least call the office with your concerns, which are completely legitimate.
Excuse me, but it is NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to handle all of this stress on your own. This is what Medicare, disability, and extended family can help with. Do your parents have case managers for their Healthcare plan? If not, get one. If they are abusing you in any way, you do not have to tolerate it. You can leave. You are an adult and your earnings are not required to take care of them. You need to seek a therapist at your earliest possible time and get some good advice on specifics that you can do to lessen the stress.
Medicare should be able to provide an in- home care giver support to help alleviate some of the stress you're experiencing.  Please contact them to see if you qualify for assistance. Please also contact the Area Office on Aging in your local community. They can provide resources.
Also, when my dad initially came to live with me, he was acting out. I took him to his doctor and it was a matter of dealing with dad's depression and anxiety. Was it a magic cure? No, but it made a significant difference in the frequency and severity of the acting out. This might help with your dad's situation as well. 
Please feel free to reach out to me if you need further assistance or just to vent. Caregivers need to help each other so we don't feel isolated. ❤️😊

,Mom is too much for the Nursing home to handle.,"I moved in the care for my parents 5 or so years ago.  Dad passed in 2013 and Mom has had a stroke two years ago. Following the stroke she lost all reason. She was a clean freak and now her hygiene is terrible. Won't accept help to even brush her teeth.

Due to family drama I had almost no help with her care following her stroke.  This drama put me in a bind because one or more siblings thought I was neglecting my mom. They literally called adult services on me twice in a month's time. 

Well the social worker flagged it as a vindictive reporting but warned me it will continue to happen based on her experience. After seeing an attorney, I was told to put my mom in a home. I did just that. 

Fast forward to today and I get a call that the nursing home cannot continue to care for my mom due to her combativeness. They called 911 and sent her to the hospital for evaluation.

So here my wife and I were accused of criminal elder abuse because I wasn't trying hard enough to make her do things like take a bath. And now a skilled nursing facility is telling me she is too much for them.

I could ramble further but just want to know where difficult dementia patients go to? I'm pretty sure they don't want her back there and I can't really bring her home again without family help. Is there a reform school of sorts for bad seniors?","I agree, contact agingcare.com. Some on that forum have been in similar situations. Since they have sent your Mother for evaluation, she will more than likely be prescribed medicine to calm her mood. You will have to see how “calm” it makes her.  Best of luck.
She may need to go to a nursing home that specializes in dementia care (also known as memory care). Talk to her doctor about this. Nursing homes may specify that they care for Alzheimer’s or dementia patients in their advertising and online.
If a skilled nursing facility can't care for your mother how are you supposed to do it? I would start looking at different nursing homes in your area, preferably one with a ward specifically for patients who need extra attention because of their declining health. I know of at least one nursing home in my city that has a special dementia/Alzheimers ward. At least she is getting evaluated, I would highly suggest you insist the Doctors review what prescription medications she is on. See if you can get them to involve a toxicologist if there is evidence of too many medications or interactions. I have had to do this for my own mother. She was on close to 30 medications and we saw a toxicologist who slowly cut that list in half. I think you should also look into palliative care. I know this is all a lot all at once but I think so far you have gone about things the right way. Good luck!
I'm so very sorry for what you're going through, and I don't have the answer, but I have the found the aging care dot com  forums to be a huge help to me for questions, support, and validation. I think someone there might be able to help.
Meeting with the nursing home staff today. I will say Caremore completely mismanaged my Dad's last 6 months and it was hospice that got him on the right meds for his mental state.

It feels like a violation of my space. I don't like having strangers in my home and not knowing about it until hours later.

Edit: They are not live-in caregivers. We get about 37 hrs of care per week from a caregiver.","Try contacting the agency where you hire them, assuming that is where you get the caregivers as referrals. That can put the agency in a position of serious liability.
I've worked as a caregiver for 15 years. I would NEVER bring someone over without asking. This is definitely not normal.
This is a major violation and I guarantee NOT allowed. Call the company!!!
Definitely communicate that with the agency.  But my own personal thought would be to tell the caregivers you have nanny/granny cams in your place, and if you see anyone other than the caregiver you'll report them to the agency and they'll be fired.  Even if you don't actually put cameras in, its a good deterrent if they think they are being watched.  Just a thought.
First, talk to your Dad. Maybe they asked him and he gave the ok. Or he invited them over. You never know. Either way, tell the caregivers no one is to be in the house unless they are in your employment. Tell them it’s a liability issue, if you want an excuse.

At least I thought I had forgotten. Now I have to help this man bathe and dress, I have to smell his smells and clean up after him. He is so unsociable and it's utter misery to have him here. 

It's beginning to seriously mess with my head. All the Christian precepts about love and forgiveness, all the virtues of putting other before self, all of the things about honoring one's father -- all of these things feel like God is laughing his ass off at me. I've lost my independence, I've lost my happiness. I hate him and can't wait for him to die.","I don't know what your financial circumstances are, or any of the other decision making factors that led him to being in your house, but I don't think you're obligated to sacrifice your own life for his. His is not more important than yours.
Can you at least get respite or in-house assistance to give you a break from him? That's a really tough situation to find yourself in.

I thought I had healed, too. I was never so relieved as when my mother passed.
I'm sorry you're dealing with this. Look for respite care and dont spit in his food.
Omg im sp sorry. Caregiving is a hard jon and nobody recognizes it
First of all, it’s amazing that you have made it this far and kept your faith. So much respect for you! 

Second, where do you live? Is your dad contributing money to help with his care? There are always options to help take some of the stress off of you, whether it’s subsidized food programs, a part time caretaker, community care services, state-funded assisted living, etc. I work for a fairly large in-home care company in CA but I’d be happy to try and help you find resources in your area! 

And lastly, it’s so honorable that you took on this responsibility but do not let it burn you out. You’re allowed to ask for a break, to reach out to other family member if you have them, or to distance yourself from the situation if it gets too hard. God bless!
Fellow Christian here, and fellow paid caregiver. You are absolutely not required by God to sacrifice yourself and your sanity for an abuser, even a parent. Get help from Medicare and a care manager to get the care he needs. If it is too much for you, you may need to decide either to get in home caregivers coming in or to get assisted living or a nursing home. Try not to feel bad for this. You have to live your life, too, and God doesn't require you to drown to save him. Caregiver burnout is real, so get help. And therapy if necessary.
See if he qualifies for Medicaid. If so, begin the process of placing him. You've sacrificed enough in your life and no God's not laughing. He wants you to live a full , happy life and it's not possible due to this situation. See if he can get Medicaid and/ or Medicare and place him. Abuse is something you do NOT need.
Caregiving for crotchety old farts sucks however you look at it. Their needs exist and the job gets done. The past is the past. Mistakes were made. You will be judged by yourself and your maker. How you deal with the bitchy old fuck is between you and your conscience. The day to day madness of caregiving has many ups and downs with a wide variation in between. Try to find yourself a quiet place to de-compress every day. We both know how much the job sucks but you just need to keep on keepin on. Try to bite your tongue and keep looking forward. You can do this, now its time to cowboy up. I apologize if I sound preachy or harsh but it is what it is. I have been on the job for 2 family members since '06. Sanity is a fleeting commodity it seems sometimes. Good luck friend!",2019-04-23 10:18:52,AnnaLovesBobo,bggx67
,Finding friends for your parents?,"I’m helping out my 72-year-old dad, who has chronic pain - he lives alone and is retired, and doesn’t really have any friends where he lives. He finally is becoming aware he needs some friends, which is a good thing for him, but I don’t know how I can help him find them. His mobility issues means he is a bit limited (he can’t do anything too physically active), and he’s tried joining a church but organized religion doesn’t come naturally to him. He is quite intelligent and spiritual-seeking, loves animals, and I think would just love to have a friend he could go to a movie with. But it seems hard for older adults, especially men, to make friends out of the blue - any advice?","Is there a senior center in your town? Lots of different activities and sometimes daily or weekly lunches.  If he likes animals, maybe he could volunteer for the local SPCA or shelter.
He should check out some Meet Up groups. I was in one and met a great friend from there. There were also a lot of senior folks in that group, and as a middle aged woman, I was one of the younger ones. 

Those are great, because they will cater to his particular interests. 

Good luck.
Bingo? xD I know my grandparents loved going.
Rotary is a great place meet people, find volunteer opportunities and learn about interesting things in life.

Any service group would be good.
My grandpa has always been in the Lions club ever since I can remember. I don't know if it's specifically for older men but at least his chapter seemed to be. They did a lot of volunteer work but it was just a way of socializing too.
I think the church idea is a good one you should go with. He wouldn't have to join, but he could at least attend and make some friends. Also, if he has a cell phone he could maybe find some local  groups which interest him there. Local events could be good for outings, especially if he has a walker and wheelchair he can use. Getting out is very important for those with mobility issues. If he needs to call for a wheelchair access van to take him places, it can be a good way to feel he is still living.
A lot of YMCAs have programs for older adults including exercise or dance classes, language classes, card games, entertainment, holiday parties, trips to museums, plays, etc. via bus.",2019-04-21 22:12:42,dreams44,bfwops
,What to do when you have no training but someone needs to watch bf's great grandmother?,"I'm having a hard time with this and it's driving his mom crazy too. Just had to try to take care of her in the bathroom and it didn't go well.

We don't really have the money for in home care and I'm really really not trained for this. What the hell am I supposed to do? Sometimes I'm the only one home.... BF's mom is stressed out and probably annoyed at me and plans to hire someone but like I said, we don't really have the money for it.

Hospice comes to see her twice a week + a lady to help shower once a week but they're not here very long so not very helpful. I don't know her insurance or any other info though. 

I just don't know where to go to ask about this. I'm not trained and I know I'm doing stuff wrong..... I don't want her to end up hurt etc because of me. 

Can anyone help me here? Am I in the right place?","Like the other person said, you have come to the right place!! I have over 5 years of caregiving experience. What are some more specific questions you have? I'd love to help however I can. I'm trying to find some videos you can watch that will teach you some basics. What went wrong in the bathroom? Does she walk? And it's admirable you try to help but a little unfair your boyfriend's mother expects it, especially if you have absolutely no experience. You make an excellent point about not wanting to injure her and I'd bring that up. Injury is very very prevalent in this field, even more so if you don't know what you're doing (no offense). Please feel free to respond or reach out to me via DM.
You are not to take on an unnecessary responsibility for your bf's grandmother without being paid for it! That is not something they should expect of you. First, you re not even married to him, second she is his family member, not yours. Third, your time is valuable and unless they pay you, you will continue to be treated like slave labor by his entire family. I would suggest that they get an in home care agency to cover shifts in order to give your bf's mother a break. It is very boundary breaking of her to expect you to do this. Honestly, the smartest thing you could do is to get a job which requires you to be away from the home so that this heavy responsibility does not fall on you. Without any worker's comp. Insurance for yourself, not only could you injure yourself and have no way to get medical care for yourself, but also if anything worse happens to the grandmother, the family could blame you for it. If they cannot afford care, maybe they can get help through Medicare.
You’re in the right place.  I’m glad you found us.  First of all give yourself credit for stepping up and doing the best you can.  It’s not like there are lots of others flocking to step in.  I’d start by contacting the hospice and letting them know you’re out of your element here and could use some direction and training.  If you can, be there when they visit and ask to help so you can see what to do.  BF’s mom is under stress because her grandmother is dying so don’t take her speaking out personally.  You’ve never done this before.  And she’s still alive so you must have done something right.  Next time will be better.  If nobody else has told you, thank you for stepping up when others would freak out and find excuses why they couldn’t help.
I'm a new caregiver at an assisted living facility! Getting lisence still and everything so not huge help but have training with people, let me know if you need anything! Feel free to message me!
Hospice nurse here -- you can and should be able to expect a lot more from the hospice team.  Per the Medicare guidelines, you should get (for free):  

\-- health aides to visit at least once a day for at least an hour.  Good aides can teach you stuff about how to handle the patient / loved one, too.  If you are only getting aide service once a week, that is just not enough, and you have the right to ask for it up to 7 days a week.

\-- a medical social worker should be able to help identify programs for additional assistance or help your family brainstorm about other options for care.  What is available can vary a lot by location; for example, where I live in Philadelphia, there is a city program that provides in-home care.  There are sometimes programs that are available based on someone's illness -- eg., cancer.

\-- any basic assistive equipment (eg., wheelchair, bedside commode, canes, walkers, etc.)

MANY hospices, while not required to, nonetheless provide physical therapy and occupational therapy consults to help people learn how to transfer patients safely, figure out what assistive equipment they need.

Frankly, it sounds to me like you need to switch to another hospice.  It's not easy -- I'd avoid the for-profit places if you can, unless there's one with a stellar reputation.",2019-04-19 19:10:13,theflamecrow,bf5n61

,My roommate has an intellectual disability and I'm feeling angry and frustrated because I didn't sign up for this,"Not to sound mean but if you didn't know her you would think she has zero Common Sense. She takes a lot longer to grasp things than most people would and she has told me that she can't go to the store without having to go through the checkout three different times because of not being able to add up what she's spending. She cannot manage her money and it leaves me to pick up the slack on the bills. I have paid three-quarters of the bills around here for the last year. I thought having a roommate was supposed to help you save money, not cost more.

She also does very dangerous things like not wiping up water on the kitchen floor and it could cause one of us to slip and fall in injure ourselves, she has left the stove on all night on numerous occasions. I keep reminding her to remember to shut the stove off when she's done and she says I try to remember but she can't nine times out of 10. Sometimes I've wondered if it's not just her being lazy. 

I'm frustrated and fed up and I'm about ready to call her family and let them know that I don't think she should be living alone. I'm stressed and I am losing sleep all the time from feeling like I have to go around behind her keeping us out of danger. If this keeps up, she's going to end up burning or building down because she will spill oil on the burner and not wipe it up and she cooks everything and I mean everything on high. I keep telling her that she doesn't need to do that but she doesn't listen. 

I will admit that I've had some times where I finally just got frustrated with her and let her know how I was feeling and of course she became defensive. But I just know I can't live this way anymore. The stress is keeping me up at night and I sleep all day because I can't sleep at night. She does not clean up after herself either. I have literally gone in the bathroom and stepped in her urine on several occasions. I don't know how she's getting urine on the floor but I'm tired of stepping in it. I don't mean to sound mean but I'm just fed up and exhausted. Should I call her family?","Yes. Make the call. They may not know and this is, as you said, not what you signed up for.

Roommates are equals, not caregivers. Unless you have relationship beyond being a good human, the lady needs more help than you are obligated or care to.
I have been a caregiver to 2 such people, and I cannot imagine having to live with them. Yes, absolutely call the family, and even perhaps the landlord to get them out of your apartment, because someone with these types of problems should be living in a group home or with family.
Yes.  They know how she is and was hoping a roommate would carry the load.  However it was not made clear to you at the outset that this was their hope.  You’re right.  You didn’t sign up for this and you have I obligation to take it on.  Time to move on.",2019-04-15 17:43:41,throwaway679783,bdlocz
,"What to do when you're no longer capable of providing care, but have no backup?","Before I get into the long of it, the TL;DR is that I have been dropped into a situation where my mother's needs have suddenly surpassed my ability provide for her as her full time live-in caregiver, and I am worried that I a may hit the point of mental or physical collapse in a matter of days if things don't improve. I have help from an in-home care service that provides a caregiver for 8 hours a day, but they are all newly assigned to us and require my help and guidance for most of their shift because my mother has lost most of her ability to communicate intelligibly despite still being completely sound of mind. The long term plan is to move back to our home town because the cost of assisted living in the SF Bay area is in the $3,000-4,000+ range. What I feel helpless about is what to do in the short term, because I'm worried one of these days I'm just not going to be able to get her to an appointment or get her into bed either because my mental health is in the gutter or from sheer exhaustion. To further complicate things I am currently completely financially depended on my mother paying me to be her caregiver.

&#x200B;

The long story:

* The two of us moved from Atlanta to the SF Bay area 7-8 years ago. Before all of this started, about 5 years ago, my mother was supporting my slow progress through college as I grappled with chronic health issues of my own. I've been suffering from thyroid disease and a plethora of sleep disorders since I was a teenager, which makes holding a regular 9-5 job very difficult. I am her only family on this side of the country.
* My mother has MSA-P, which mimics Parkinson's in many ways. It doesn't respond to medication and progresses rapidly. This has severely impacted her mobility and made it difficult for her to speak. She went from still being able to work to needing a wheelchair in 2-3 years. She's very strong willed and has been determined to retain as much self-sufficiency as she can for as long as possible. Until the recent turn of events she has been able to walk short distances with a walker and do things like bathe herself without assistance if she has to, though help gets them done significantly faster.
* We moved in together 3 years ago so that I could be her live-in caretaker, and my mental health has progressively declined since. Unfortunately the depression and anxiety disorders that run in my family didn't skip me. This creates a negative feedback loop with my circadian rhythm disorder, where the depression and anxiety undermines my efforts to keep a schedule, and then the poor sleep worsens the depression and anxiety. We've managed to mitigate this with the help of an in-home care service, though things get more difficult when they have to change up our assigned caregivers because it can take a few weeks before they no longer need me to interpret her garbled speech pattern or tell them what to do.
* Because there is basically nothing else that can be done for her from a medical perspective outside of efforts to make her more comfortable as her health declines, she has been spending a few months out of the year at an Ayurvedic clinic in India for the last few years. I'm not a fan of alternative medicine, but they provide a level of 24/7 care and attention she probably wouldn't be able to get in the US for a mere $100 a day. Meanwhile I get a chance to recharge my batteries and work on getting my life in order, and generally fly back to Atlanta to visit friends and family for a few weeks.
* This year, however, things have really gone down hill. Despite having no obligations while she was in India, I suffered a major depressive episode and experienced anxiety like I never have before. What was Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder, where I am wired to fall asleep and wake up in later in the day, has progressed to full on Non-24 Sleep Wake Disorder. Mental health services through Kaiser Permanente are awful, so I've only been getting bare-bones professional help. Fortunately I had a bit of a rebound after a medication change a few days before my mother returned from India or I probably would have lost it already.
* And finally we get to the source of the current crisis: The progression of my mother's symptoms decided to take a huge leap forward during the last week of her time in India, accelerated by the stress induced by the 25 hours of travel it takes her to get back home. Her mobility has reduced to the point that she needs assistance doing just about everything, and even I find it almost impossible to understand her speech. She's had to resort to painfully slowly typing messages into her phone or computer to communicate much that is more complex than yes, no, and pointing. The apartment is currently set up to be intentionally somewhat cramped so she'd have plenty to brace herself on, which has limited our ability to get her around the house in ways other than manually assisting her shuffle step by step. I've never had to help her use the toilet or bathe, so the other caregivers and I have to figure things out as we go. Even if she wasn't having trouble communicating, this is all new for her as well, so it has been a struggle to figure out how to help. Everything is hard. Getting anything done more than surviving feels impossible.
* Meanwhile I can't sleep for more than a few hours a night because I'm up till at least 5am trying to fight off panic attacks and then I have to get up at 8am to help the new caregivers. Then I only get another few hours of sleep during the day before we need to start the getting to bed routine, assuming I can sleep at all. I have been too physically and mentally exhausted to do anything productive when I'm not needed for basic care stuff. We don't have anyone who can step in to help if I can't.

&#x200B;

What do I do in this situation? Having the in-home care agency add another daily shift after first doesn't help in the short term if I have to be there to tell them what to do. Putting her in assisted living here doesn't make a whole lot of sense if we're just going to move across country, and I have nowhere to go here if we have to give up the apartment. My mother has also been mentally distraught at her sudden inability to do things she could do herself a few weeks ago and the impact all this is having on me.  I'm afraid of losing control of her care because it would be easy to exploit her financially, and I don't have a support network unless I can get back to Atlanta.

&#x200B;","\> The long term plan is to move back to our home town because the cost of  assisted living in the SF Bay area is in the $3,000-4,000+ range.  

&#x200B;

That is cheap! My mom passed away seven years ago and then it was double that.

If you have friends/family in Atlanta Area I'd look to relocating back there for more reasonable cost of care and your own mental health. 

 MSA-P is a heart breaker, so you have my full sympathy as she will need more care as it progresses. 

You have some excellent medical resources in Atlanta, sounds like you have extended support network there, so that will be your best option. Thank you for taking care of your Mom.

I can understand that we need to take care ourselves first! I had my thyroid shut down when I was thirteen. That just doesn't happen, but have taken Synthroid for many years. Yes I have Parkinson's. I'm pushing myself, boxing, running, biking, and (learning to swim) so I can compete in Sprint Triathlons. Take care of yourself. Exercise, eating sensibly, and (try to) get a good nights sleep.

I wish you, and your Mom, all my best. 
Perhaps in the short term you need to have 24 hour in-home care from an agency while looking for a good nursing home for your mother. You need to separate yourself from the caregiver role and find a way to do some self care for a bit. Then you will be able to search for a less stressful job.

,"Need Advice: Wife Disabled, Young Children, and a Job","Hello,

&#x200B;

My wife has become disabled due to brain cancer.  Her symptoms are very similar to stroke (weakness on her left side, uses a walker, frequent falls), and dementia (poor decision making, no initiative for self-care, very short attention span, memory problems.)  Her current prognosis stable, and it looks like she might be alive for a very long time.  We are in our 30's, and we have two elementary school age children as well.  I have no living relatives available to assist me.  I have a decent middle class job, and good health care.   My health care will not cover any long term care.

&#x200B;

My problem is my wife needs someone home 24/7.  Paying $2-3000 a month for care so that I can work, with no end date, is not something I cannot do for very long.  My daughters share a room which leaves an extra room.  I thought of offering the room for free as part of the deal for a caregiver, but I have no idea what I should/could charge.  Also, I'm not sure if I ask too low if I'm violating minimum wage laws.

&#x200B;

I live in Florida and I've looked into Medicaid, but it is pretty overwhelming.  It seems like to qualify for assistance I need to have $3k or less in the bank.  I've managed to save money over the years even with a solo income. My wife has been home raising the kids, so she hasn't worked 3 of the last 7 years required to qualify for Social Security Benefits.  I thought of hiring a Medicaid Lawyer, but I'm not sure what I would get anything out of it except a bill for $5-7k.

&#x200B;

I was feeling miserable for myself thinking I was going to work 40-50 hours a week, then spend every waking moment taking care of my wife and children.  Now I'm fighting just for the opportunity to do that.  Because now in addition to that I'm going to lose everything I own as well.

&#x200B;

Any help is appreciated.  I'm not sure what I'm looking for at this point.  I'm running out of ideas.

&#x200B;

Edit: Spelling and Grammar ","you can get a lawyer who specializes in things like this for $500, if not free through an organization that helps people.

every state is different, but you may be able to have any amount in the bank, as long as it is not in your wifes name.

VNA did help me with my wife, they should have a social worker to answer questions like yours.
Have you tried calling the Visiting Nurse Association for help/advice ?
Call your local Area Agency on Aging on Monday.   [http://elderaffairs.state.fl.us/doea/arc.php](http://elderaffairs.state.fl.us/doea/arc.php) 

&#x200B;

They are a government agency that acts as a clearinghouse on information for people in your situation.  You wrote about Medicaid and its income limits--there are a lot of programs out there that help caregivers that don't count on Medicaid's income limits.  So call these guys, because there is help out there that you're not aware of (can't find by googling).
That sounds like an enormous amount of pressure and I'm proud of you for handling it as well as you have and you seem very coherent and brave. I believe in you if that's worth anythings. Hugs. That's crazy.
We are experiencing a similar issue. Husband became suddenly ill and became paraplegic with some brain damage. We have a 6 yr old daughter. For a year, I couldn’t work, bc he’d just gotten out of the hospital and we DID qualify for medicaid at the time, bc of our loss of income, BUT i could not find reliable caregivers. It was awful. Then ffw a year, and we got into a good enough rhythm with two caregivers, that i could return to work almost full-time. 6 months later, i have an opportunity to take a job that will lead me into a new career, and nearly insure my acceptance into a grad school program while i do it. Of course, i take it. All those months i was lucky to have a 401k to access, even though it came with a 25% penalty. We had no choice. His crappy caregivers would just randomly miss work without calling or anything. And much more, which i’ll post below my comment so you don’t have to wade through it unless you want.

Now my husband is home alone for most of the day, and since he’s unable to drive, he is getting depressed. I also worry bc every now and then his brain damage shows, and i’ll come home to him leaving a burner on, or having fallen asleep outside in the sun. (He has chronic nerve pain and feels like some direct sunshine is similar to a warm bath, which he’s not able to do, bc: paraplegia. He doesn’t take painkillers bc they don’t work on his type of pain. But his health condition can make him drowsy somedays. If he falls asleep in the sun, depending on the weather, he could get heatstroke or fall out of his chair and be injured.) no more caregiver bc we could NEVER afford to pay for one privately, and we no longer qualify for medicaid. In seattle area, and i bring home approximately $2500/month after taxes and health insurance. Health insurance through my job costs me $800/month for the three of us. And that is WITH a union/employer that covers another $800/month for health insurance. That does not include a $2500 deductible and $30 copays for each appointment and prescription.

It sucks. I want to work! I won’t give up. But yes, people in our situation are really screwed. A few months ago, he finally began receiving social security disability which helps a lot. He worked 40+ hour weeks for 20 yrs, so he was definitely eligible. But it doesn’t help enough to cover a privately paid caregiver, even 15hrs/week, which is MUCH less than he qualified for while on medicaid. It helps us pay for fun stuff like going to movies as a family every couple months or having a bday party for our girl at a trampoline place.

With young children, you look to the the many years of needing (wanting) to provide for them. Our daughter is only in 1st grade, and we haven’t even begun those years where they can be especially expensive. And what about college!

I did find some info in our state (wa) about laws that allow some spouses to hold their own income/assets separately from a disabled spouse’s; looks to be written with elderly in mind though. And, like you, i feel like I’d like to hire an attorney to help us figure it out, but can’t bear to part with $1000 with nothing to show for it.

Caregiver nightmares:
One caregiver asked to “borrow” a painkiller on 3 separate occasions (which he was on for the first couple of months post-hospitalization.) another started regularly eating our food for her lunch each day. One insisted on our two completely gentle/socialized/15lb dogs be locked up the 5 hours she was there. Still another started regularly divulging personal info about herself to my husband, and after several weeks of it he was exhausted (dealing with his own stuff, c’mon!) And then there was the one that was very clearly coming into our house high on something, falling asleep on our couch, and freaking the heck out of our child each day for a week of her summer vacation. And the caregiving agency was useless in stopping it. I had to finally get the state involved again, to get him the care that he needed. I was going insane, not working. I began volunteering at my daughter’s school each day. But I couldn’t go farther from home bc i was worried about my husband’s safety.",2019-04-06 11:40:11,Tweet_In_A_Can,ba5jmj

I don't know if she goes through the IHSS registry of caregivers and picks from that list, or if she just picks random people off the streets. I am honestly frustrated.

Meanwhile, my grandma is bad at vetting caregivers to hire, and keeps hiring unreliable people who weren't even professional caregivers nor have caregiving experience in the first place.

I think she also has a tendency to drive people away if they have better job options, because she talks people's ears off and has unpleasant personality traits (I think it's part of aging and struggling with illness) when she forgets to take her meds (mostly because the current IHSS workers don't do their jobs of arranging her meds and reminding her). I need to find caregivers who will just come in on time, do their jobs, and not take any of my grandma's rambling too seriously.

How do I go about finding competent people, preferably people with prior experience, and are current/former housecleaners/nurses by trade? I've been thinking about reaching out to a local school for their nursing students and see if any of them would be willing to work as well. Is that an idea?

Thanks for reading and hope to get some ideas soon.","So you can contact the center for aging and disability in her area or Google homecare agencies for your grandma. They will help you determine  if they participate with her insurance or program  and they will assess her situation and see what is needed. It is best to go through a company if you don't know anyone because they usually screen the applicants for you. Hope this helps.
It's tough to get good help if you can't monitor their work, and sometimes even people who start out great start to droop after a while, so it's an ongoing job. When my family hired people to help care for my grandmother, and then more recently, my father, no one person worked out for very long so we spent quite a bit of time looking for people. Having said that, we did have some wonderful people that helped quite a bit while they were there. My family found it helpful to reach out in all directions, putting ads in newspapers and up on bulletin boards, asking friends and family to put the word out to see if they knew anyone, and also going through agencies. Any idea that might help you find someone is a good idea.   


When you begin interviewing people, be as honest as possible about the challenges of the job, and don't hesitate to ask for references (then actually call the references and speak with them). If you know anyone in your grandmother's neighborhood that could pop in to check on her, it might be good to have them drop by sometime while the help is there, and then sometime immediately after the help leaves.   


Good luck!  
For my aunt and my grandmother we hired a number of different people, because one person all the time would probably burn out.

There was one really good nursing student. Other people were from agencies (personal care assistants or nurses). And word of mouth in our community (it's a small place). Looking in all directions is a great idea. We found one really really good person on Kijiji (like Craigslist only better). Her ad stood out because she had put up a resume and had experience. I wouldn't have trusted it if I hadn't been able to meet her in person though.

The meds are tricky because my grandmother always thought she had already taken them and my aunt just didn't want to sometimes. It helps to understand the challenges that hired people, who are not family, can face when trying to get people to do things.

,Do you agree with this statement?,I came across this person who viewed his caregiving for the partner he loved as “all the things I had to do and say and make to give her some semblance of a full life”.   ,"Wow....this is really relevant to me, in my life, right this second. 

To answer your question....**NO**

I was giving until it hurts for years and I do not recommend it. My wife has degenerative brain disease and ever since she was diagnosed I have been doing my best to make sure all of her needs were met. The problem with doing that is that leaves no room for your needs in fact you start feeling guilty for even having needs. 

I became depressed and literally lost my identity. We spent all of our time together  Only in the past year have I started slowly crawling my way back. I reclaimed my life and put my needs on the table. I started losing weight, getting in shape, and reclaiming my time.

You can imagine that this shift has not gone over so well with her. Claims of abandonment, emotional blackmail, not loving her, etc. I think we work through it but I will not go back to the way things were because I have seen the end game of what comes out of that and it is depression, resentment, anger, malice, and hate.

You cannot be someone's everything without losing everything that makes you, you. 
This thread strikes me with the truth that balancing self-care with caregiving is critical for both parties. There is no value, in my opinion, in sacrificing your quality of life for someone else's. There are solutions for getting assistance when the caregiving role becomes too taxing. I question how good a caregiver would be for their loved one's well-being if the caregiver's condition was depleted or emotionally conflicting. So I agree with the importance of a caregiver's effort to help a loved one have a quality of life. But not at the expense of the caregiver's quality of life. There is a battle for balance that is critical. As a caregiver, I'm no good to my mother if I'm in bad shape myself. So searching for alternate solutions makes better sense to me. Planning ahead is ideal, too.  Thanks for the question. Sparking forward-thinking for me as a caregiver!

,tips for dementia/memory loss caregivers,"i've checked some of the previous posts in hopes to avoid a repeat, but i honestly am writing to both vent and to ask a few questions.

my mom has lupus cerebritis, including a 3.2 cm menigioma on her right temporal lobe. she's had about a solid year of severe memory loss, constant depression/anxiety, and occasional complete loss of awareness or sense of self as a person. it's a brutal, scary thing to watch. 

&#x200B;

my main question is if there are any tips or methods that people employ to help their loved one alleviate their stress and even perhaps build a routine of easing their own anxieties partially on their own? for an example, my mom writes sticky notes all over the place to try and remind herself of things. but they end up being everywhere, and she ends up never reading them. i tried to encourage her to centralize her notes in a composition notepad, which she did, but forgets to re-read them when she's anxious. perhaps i'm asking too much of her. i want to help her, not ask her to to more work. 

&#x200B;

my daily frustration is that she will get extremely anxious about the smallest, tiniest thing, and will fixate on it over and over again. i'll sit down with her and talk her out of her dark place, and less than two hours later, she will have forgotten our talk, and is back to anxiety level 10.

&#x200B;

it's been a solid year of constant, constant 'coaching' down from dark places. i'm not the best person at talking things out, i'm more of a go-out-and-do stuff kinda guy. this takes so much patience and time, that i could really appreciate any tips available. thank you. sorry for the rant.","When my aunt had a similar note-taking habit, we bought large white dry-erase boards, and posted them in prominent places so she could clearly see the answers to her most stress-inducing questions. It also helped to occasionally have some visitors she trusted to step in for a little while, and help her while her main caregivers took a little break. I wish you much strength and patience with your mother.
[deleted]
That does sound like a tough situation for you. A lot of it, I imagine, is her trying to get some amount of control back into her life. I know you mentioned talking stuff out can be a tough thing for you, but when she does need to be talked down from her anxiety, it may help to acknowledge that she feels helpless instead of trying to solve whatever problem she is focusing on at that moment. If she is forgetting she has already had these conversations, though, it doesn't solve the underlying issue.

I agree with the other posters about finding ways to make her home more relaxing, and even asking a doctor about taking a second look at her medications could make sense. Giving her new outlets for her energy could help reduce her anxiety, since it gives her something else to focus on that she may feel more in control with- think about her hobbies or ways that she can easily help around the house. And even if the notetaking seems like it isn't being helpful, I am betting that the act of making those notes does help her calm down a little.
Giving her a notepad and/or dry erase board for her own personal thoughts can help. I've only been taking care of my husband's elderly relative for about a year now (my husband was here about 5-6 years before I came) but when I first came here she'd have random papers stuffed in her walker with commercial ad numbers and the beginnings of letters that she couldn't finish, let alone really even start. We have a magnetic dry erase board on the fridge but now her cataracts are so bad I don't think she's knows it's there. She used to have a dry erase board of her own where she'd write down grocery items she wanted, it's important they feel independent and helpful in any way even if it's small.

I have ""set"" conversations with her. This makes touchy subjects like changing her diaper easier, she knows what to expect so she doesn't get embarrassed about forgetting who I am, if I'm nervous I just revert to the ""script,"" etc.
keep some books, newspapers and magazines around.  even if he's not reading them, it still helps their mind by it being in the same room.

&#x200B;

my father has memory loss.   i take care of him.

there are actually some household items that can cause amnesia.

stacks of blank computer paper can cause amnesia.

suitcases can sometimes cause amnesia.

the plastic cover that the dry cleaners put over the clothes can cause amnesia.

too much plastic in a room can cause some temporary memory loss.

too many mirrors in a room can cause some memory loss.

your memory almost increases immediately when you remove a mirror from a room.",2019-03-04 10:21:23,,ax88xu
,Best high pressure shower head with hose?,"Hi, I have a 15 year old son who has low functioning autism. He is completely nonverbal and only partially potty trained. He can understand and follow very simple instructions but he has a tendency to get violent or self harm if he gets frustrated which includes attempting to force him to do anything that is overly complicated. In April 2017 I sustained a very serious injury to my right shoulder blade that has left me with only partial use of my right (dominant) arm. Since my son is only partially potty trained and is already deep into puberty, bathing him has become difficult. He is about 6’0 and over 200lbs with poor fine motor skills. He can run his own bath but he will just sit in the water and not really clean himself and it’s become extremely difficult for me to properly bathe him due to his size, how much body hair he has, his limited ability to contribute to his hygiene routine, and how I only have use of one arm. 
   I’m hoping to get some advice for a good shower head that has a long hose. My upstairs bathroom has a big walk-in shower but the current shower head has very low water pressure so I can’t get him very clean using it. I basically need a detachable shower wand that has strong water pressure so I can hose his butt down when he’s dirty. Does anyone have a suggestion for a powerful high pressure shower head that comes with a wand? I appreciate any suggestions and advice, thanks!","We've had good luck with waterpik, specifically the hair wand spa system. I like the way it has a nice long area, and the stream seems pretty good.

However, I would almost encourage you to go with this: https://www.homedepot.com/p/MOEN-Attract-6-Spray-5-5-in-Handheld-Shower-with-Magnetix-in-Spot-Resist-Brushed-Nickel-26603SRN/304715410

The reason why is that magnetic head is AMAZING! You can also get little extra magnet things to place it lower in your shower. My grandparents don't struggle to hang theirs up, my kids can work on showering themselves and hang it back up with a lower magnet. With your arm, it may be extra helpful. It also may encourage him to work on cleaning himself if he finds it interesting, and since it isn't hard to detach or attach it would be less complicated for him.

I have read online there is a washer in shower heads that you can take out or drill open to increase water flow. I don't know how true it is, but it could be the easiest fix for you too. They make cheap snap on shower wands also, I have no clue on how well they work though.

,Taking care of blind/bed ridden mother but work full time - options?,"Greetings Reddit!

&#x200B;

So I will try to make my long story short. For the last 10 years of my life, my father and I have been taking care of my bed ridden mother who recently became blind. This all came about after she was diagnosed with brain tumor. Her most recent surgery caused her to become blind as it removed all of the last optical fibers she had left. She has a hard time walking on her own, so for the last 5 years we have hired someone (pay around 1000 a week) to watch over her during the day, as both me and my father go to work. However, there are days that my father and I are not available after the home care lady leaves because of our work hours. However, now that she is blind it would be near impossible to have both of us out at the same time. We have come to an idea of hiring another person to watch over at night, but that would also cost more money which we do not have at the moment. 

To put things into perspective, imagine being waken up every 1-2 hours a day. The last time I had more than a full 8 hours of sleep was about 5 years ago. On average we get about 2-3 hours a day. Its very unhealthy, and we are now at the point that we need to hire another person to watch over her at night, especially now that she is blind. However, she is not eligible for medicare, and my father makes enough that she is not eligible to receive aid from the government. I have reached out to SSI and disabilities here in NYC, but they all declined.

&#x200B;

I'm not even sure if this is the right sub reddit, but if anyone has any light to share, please let me know! Ideally we would like her to be eligible for disability and use that money to hire someone during the night time.

,I'm not sure I can do it anymore.,"I've been with my girlfriend for 8.5 years now.  On our first date we went for a short walk around her neighborhood.  She told me she had fibromyalgia, I didn't know what it was at the time.  I really liked her though, and I figured out what it was, what it was like to be with her.  And I could do it.  In that time frame I went from being unemployed, to employed and renting, and eventually buying a house 3.5 years ago.  Shortly after that, she got approved for SSDI!  

But also in that time, she has regularly diminished in her capability to take care of herself/our living space.  She used to handle dishes and laundry, now sometimes she'll do her delicates for laundry, or pre-wash some dishes, but I mostly do both of those things.  She used to occasionally sweep and vacuum, but she fell while vacuuming and is now afraid to do so anymore.  She has varied lifting ability, sometimes she can hold our 40lb~ dog, sometimes she can't even lift a bowl of food or bottle of water.  She used to regularly get herself breakfast, now every day I need to wake up and get it for her.  I make her every meal with rare exception.

Tonight may have been it (who am I kidding, I've been at this stage before) however.  My body woke me up a couple hours before my usual wake up time, so I was tired and went to take a nap.  She was planning on taking a shower, so I told her to wake me up in an hour when she started, in this time I'll change the bed sheets and be around if she needs me.  She woke me up an hour later, but I was tired so I half-rolled onto my side and kept my eyes shut.  She started getting frustrated that I didn't jump right out of bed.  I told her to get started on the shower and I'll get up.  But she didn't want to believe I'd get up, she got frustrated, and when she went to take her shower bench (which she had in the bedroom) she dropped it in the hallway because she was too frustrated/anxious to lift anything.  She then started pleading/getting angry with me about how I needed to get up RIGHT NOW.  Now I'm angry that she's getting angry because I had to take a nap and am tired and she's now too riled up to be able to take care of herself.  I get up, put her bench in the tub, and she goes in.  I change the sheets on the bed, and she still hasn't started the water in the shower.  She used the toilet and fell on the floor and was stuck there.  She tells me she's not going to be able to wash herself, so take her back to bed unless I'm going to wash her.  Well sheets were clean so I toss her in the shower and wash her.  I then get her out and into the bed.  

I make dinner an hour later and bring her a plate, and an hour after that she comes down.  She apologizes for how she was acting, and she's crying, but she wants me to accept some of the blame.  And honestly, I...don't want to accept any.  Yeah, I could have been better, but if she hadn't gotten frustrated about me not jumping out of bed right away and gotten herself started, she would have been okay, and I would have gotten out of bed.  I don't think I've ever fallen back asleep in such a scenario in our entire relationship.  So she got herself frustrated and angry, and that kept her from being able to help herself, but somehow it's my fault?  I'm sick of it all.  She is clearly disabled, but her brain is what's keeping her from taking care of herself.  And I just don't have the optimistic mindset to help her through it.  I don't have that in me.  I can care for her daily needs, but I just don't think I can handle her mentality anymore.  It's self-defeating and toxic to us both.  And I'm thinking that since I can't see myself as the person to help her through that, I'm the wrong person for her.  But then if we break up, she'll be stuck living with her parents, who will do at most half of what I do for her, and leave her along for entire weekends on trips.  So I'm going to feel guilty as hell for putting her into that situation.  But she's toxic to herself and to me, and I don't think I can handle it anymore.

But I also know this is stress/anxiety.  We did a friend of hers a favor and let a friend stay here and she wants him gone and hasn't been able to feel relaxed with him in the house.  But I don't think that's a good enough excuse for things.  I've been slowly getting better about taking care of her and the house.  And I can point to ways I've been doing a better job of it.  And she keeps getting worse and worse, and I don't think I can be with someone that isn't only getting worse after all this time. Is this a common conclusion to come to?  Is it the right one?  Should I be trying harder?  Should I end it all and hope for the best?","Hello there! Let me start by saying everything you’ve said and are feeling is very valid. I’ve been married for almost 2 yrs, together with my wife for 3. About a year & a half ago she was diagnosed with MS- the most aggressive form of it. She went from thriving to wheelchair bound in that time.  Her type of MS doesn’t really have any recovery time like some kinds & she essentially is on a continuous decline. 

She does have some weeks of upswing where her symptoms level off & there aren’t severe deficits. And by deficits I mean, one day she can walk (her left leg uses a brace 100% of the time & her right leg was losing function) & the next day she loses the ability to walk entirely. For the rest of her life she will require assistive devices to be ambulatory/or wheel around, to use the bathroom,  get out bed, get dressed etc...to say this prospect is overwhelming (for us both) is a gross understatement. 

I make all the meals, help her shower, take care of house, (which I could be better at)/do all the chores, do all the driving because she has no ankle dorsiflexion, take care of the dogs, work full time & go to school.  I totally understand being exhausted all the time. And feeling the weight of knowing it’s only going to get worse. Of feeling unappreciated & like you’ve never got time for you. 

I went into my marriage already knowing that diagnoses like you did, and I think everyone believes it won’t be as bad as everyone says. And the shit of it is is that the real life day in/day out is usually worse. The deal though, as least with my wife, is that she too hates the predicament she’s in. She carries around guilt for being unable to do X,Y, Z & having to rely on me for just about everything in her daily life. And that guilt & the stress of having an autoimmune disease can cause her to be cranky, short & sometimes downright nasty...but what I’ve learned (or try to keep learning every day) is that my wife and probably your gf too, need more grace from their S/O than most. Is that fair all the time? Nope. Can some days be utterly crushing and the stress just feel like too much? Absolutely. But you’ve to weigh all that against what she gives you. 

What I can suggest is: 1) ask for help. Seek out support groups (this sub was a good start if you’re not ready for in person stuff :)), therapy etc. You should ask for help/support bc being a full time caregiver is utterly exhausting and often times causes the mental health decline of those helping. And ultimately, you cannot help her if you’re too ill/stressed out 2) take time for you. See previous. :) 3) really try to communicate. I know it can seem near impossible some days & from what you’ve said I’m sure you both have your triggers at this point that set the other one off-  but talking is so so important. Both of you need to be really heard by the other. Autoimmune diseases are terrifying and from my experience, uncertainty & lack of control creates anxiety; but you’ve got to be willing to keep talking no matter how tough the topic 4) take some breaks if you can 5) try to figure out compromising on certain tasks if she can manage (I know that’ll be an up & down thing depending) but that may help you feel like you’re not doing it all alone. 

I’m sorry for rambling! I hope some of this helps. At least in the way of seeing you’re not alone. I sadly cannot really answer if enough is enough for you. I think taking some time for you will make you feel better. But also think about the good things in the relationship. I’m sure there are many things :) but on the other hand, it wouldn’t be fair for you to stay in the relationship out of guilt. You must stay for love. Good luck!! 
Wife and I have been together 8 years now. Married for six.

I started dating a woman who was holding down three jobs, and spending as much free time as she could with friends and family.

When she walked down the aisle, she was down to one part-time job, but she still had her friends.

Today: she hasn't worked in five years, but isn't eligible for disability benefits. My income is too high and there's some cross-border complications where she can't benefit from the systems she spent 30 years paying into. She's isolated from her friends and just terribly lonely.

She gets irritable, and downright mean.

But she also has amazing days full of happiness and love.

Reading your story is tough. It sounds like mine. Your GF probably has more than just fibro going on, but I'm not a doctor. For what it's worth I highly recommend getting her on medical cannabis: a good CBD oil will help mellow out the pain flares without getting her high.

What I can tell you: it doesn't get easier to leave. The only thing that keeps me here some days is that I made a vow in front of friends and family. If we weren't already married, I would be gone.

But we are, and I'm okay with that.

If I knew then what I know now? I might have still taken on this job (and it IS a job.) I might not. I always wanted kids and we haven't been able to make it happen: now we're not sure we should. We're pushing 40, and I'm starting to feel the weight of chronic health issues myself. If we had a kid, we might neglect it more than we like and drive a further wedge in an already brittle relationship.

I don't know what to say. It's a tough road, but all of them are, in their own way.

If you need an ear, just reach out. We're here.
She should see if she's eligible for a PCA through Medicaid/medicare. They pay for it.

https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/home-health-services

Also, i've been told by a couple doctors that fibromyalgia is a symptom not a diagnosis but i'm sure shes heard that too.
I work as an in home caregiver, so I would like to say that you have taken on a big job, and you can get help doing it. Find out if she can get a care manager and some caregivers from an agency who can come to help you out so that she will not be so dependent on you only. If she has Medicare, she could probably be approved for this type of care.

Secondarily, My MIL has Fibromialgia, and the symptoms you are describing your gf to have don't seem to be only that. Here are some other possibilities, but I believe she needs to get them checked out by medical professionals: Thyroid disease, MS, and /or a personality disorder which causes her to demand more of you than is reasonable. Please look into these things, because medical care could improve a lot of the symptoms, except for the possible personality disorder. If what she has is the PD, that would be a good reason to consider releasing yourself from her care, because that probably can't be healed. 
I have Fibromyalgia, as well as several fairly severe autoimmune diseases - all of those put together do not affect me the way you describe your girlfriend’s behavior.  She appears quite helpless and that puts an unfair burden on you. That is the truth whether you stay or whether you go. So, she needs to get to the crux of her problem. Would she be able to go to therapy more often? I truly think that is where the best assistance lies. They can help her learn better coping mechanisms to get through her day, which will make her more secure, which will make her more self-confident. It sounds like now she has given up all responsibility for her life, so that you can take care of her and do everything for her. That is not healthy for either of you. If finances are an issue, look for a therapy whose rates are based on an income sliding scale. I hope you get some relief soon, one way or the other. Hugs from Florida.
>Should I end it all and hope for the best?

&#x200B;

I would take a step back and not make a rash decision when you are mentally spent. It sounds like you are clearly overwhelmed. That is not to say that you feelings are invalid or that you do not have a right to go or that you are a bad person because you want to leave. None of that is the case at all, only that we make poor decisions when under pressure.

&#x200B;

You mentioned her parents, would it be a possibility that they could watch her some days out of the week or if they do not live close pay to have an adult sitter watch her at least a day or two. I think at this point you need to make finding support your top priority and that might mean having difficult conversations with family and friends.

&#x200B;

Also some states have means tested in-home healthcare coverage:

[http://www.cdss.ca.gov/In-Home-Supportive-Services](http://www.cdss.ca.gov/In-Home-Supportive-Services)

It may be worthwhile to find a support group and/or organization that can help you figure out if there are resources available to you in your state. You can also contact your county health provider and see if they know if there are any programs available locally in your area as well.
I can say two separate things here. Since she has SSDI, she can most likely apply to get in home caregivers from an agency which come in and help out, giving you a break.

I’m healthy and mobile so that may make a difference.  I volunteer at my local hospice thrift store, currently pricing and keeping the book donations on the shelf.  Most of the volunteers are seniors as well so it puts me in touch with others in the same boat.  When I lost my husband the others were there to keep an eye on me.  One of the ladies eats lunch at the local senior center and invites me regularly.  I live in a small town full of retirees so a trip to the local gym in the middle of the day puts me in contact with a bunch of other seniors.  I’m gay.  It doesn’t seem to make a difference to everyone.  But  I think the big difference is service.  Volunteering.  One guy I know who’s 80 volunteers at the hospital and the local food bank.  Some ladies crochet baby hats for the newborns at the hospital and sew pillow cases for “cough pillows”.  Or staff the hospital gift shop.  Some drive cancer patients to chemo appointments it deliver meals.  We feel needed, like we can still contribute, and it puts us in touch with others in the same boat, which expands the opportunities even more.  We all have talents and sometimes we just need someone to ask for our help to make us feel useful and motivate us out of loneliness.  That’s what works for me.
Nothing and its a big problem.  At some point, if they become too isolated  the best place for them is assisted living.  Its not for their peace of mind but for yours.
A lot of communities have senior centers where they serve lunches, have all sorts of activities such as cards, crafts, music, speakers, entertainment, games, etc. Lunches can be free if someone can't afford to pay.

Most YMCAs also have senior activities such as exercise, art, language and music classes, luncheons, parties, Bible studies, speakers, cards, games, etc.

Frequently churches have senior groups and activities too.
In home care agencies can send someone to visit on a schedule. 
There are quite a few things you can do, although a lot of it depends on individual situations. Here are some ideas:

1. Communication devices - get them a cell phone, ipad or computer. Use video chat apps so they can see you when you call them. Have the kids and grandkids make daily calls. You can even have them read to your kids at night!
2. Bring grandparents to your kids sports games on the weekend
3. Schedule a weekly dinner, lunch or brunch with your parents
4. Enroll seniors in community activities at senior centers like bridge, mahjong, etc...
5. Enroll them in exercise programs at the local Y or gym
6. Volunteer at local charities, hospitals, etc...
7. Book club at the local library

While you can certainly schedule professional caregivers, let's just be mindful that having company and not being alone, doesn't necessarily solve being lonely. To solve being lonely you need to have deep or enjoyable connections with the people you're surrounding yourself with.

&#x200B;

Some seniors are also lonely because they want to live in their own home, reluctant to break from their own comfort zone. However, living in their own home can itself accentuate their isolation, causing them to be even more lonely, in addition to other health and safety issues.

,Coordinating with family about our loved one's well being,I am the primary caregiver and struggling with coordinating and updating my siblings/family about my parent's well being. Is there anyone who is or has faced a similar issue? How did you solve it?,"Separate those who can actually help with time and/or money from those who just want ""updates"" or to give advice.  The former is much more important, especially if primary caregiver ends up being, the only caregiver.
YMMV, and kind of echoing the previous comment, but I have a FB group in which I keep a wider community of helpers and well-wishers up to date (ish) and a message group with the real pinch hitters. The FB group gets an update of my mum's schedule and progression every week or so. I talk to the message group almost daily, asking for last-second visits and such. The message group is also my go-to for venting and seeking support for myself... Caregiving can be tough!

Wishing you all the best. 
We have done group chats (didn't work well-when I asked for help it turned into a drama fest) that included my siblings and nieces, nephews for my Mom.  I then did a Facebook  group with just the siblings-one removed herself from the group as she felt we were ignoring her.  That turned out fine because the other two siblings that are still in the group actually help.  I moved in with her this year and most of my family (except one nephew and sister) did not even lift a finger to help me with the move or with the care of Mom during the transition.  She has 4 children with 2 spouses, 5 grandchildren (3 live at college or elsewhere) that live within 15 minutes of her and out of those 11 people 6 saw her two or three times last year (her 90th birthday at her house and Christmas also at her house-we hosted both).  They never call either.  
Right after my husband's accident, I set up points of contact. We're fortunately in a position where this was fairly easy. My mom, sister, and BIL (via group chat) were in charge of my family, my MIL was in charge of his family (in person at first, now via group chat with my husband's sister because they live on the opposite coast), and a good friend who happens to work in my building *and* for the same department as my husband was in charge of friends and work contacts. I also set up a Caring Bridge page and gave access to my sister and MIL. They never posted, but I knew if I needed them to, I could count on them. Now that we're home and adjusting to our new normal, that's kind of been backburnered. Also we're working on legal stuff (the accident wasn't his fault) so I'm hesitant to post a lot of details publicly without talking to our lawyer first.

To choose your points of contact, you should decide what qualities you need for information sharing. My first priority was discretion because the accident was pretty bad and I didn't want everyone knowing that he'd lost his leg before we'd had a chance to have that conversation with him. Also, we didn't know how bad his spinal cord injury was at first so I wanted to avoid both giving false hope and causing panic. I didn't have the mental space to deal with either at the time. My second priority was reliability. Everyone I chose, I trusted to pass on what I wanted them to in a timely manner.

An obvious problem with no foolproof solution.  Here are a couple ideas.

If you have an Alexa, or some other AI device, you could set a timed reminder to announce every few waking hours that it is good idea to use a walker, then say the time, and the weather.

Nanny cams that you can speak through.

Is she using a standard issue walker?  Is it hard for her to use?  

I got my Dad a collapsible walker that was so much easier to use in his space.  He used it all the time.  It was light, collapsible, and he could get through narrow doorways.

Thanks for the suggestions. The staff at her assisted living is going to do well being checks on her, making sure she's using it. And we've decided to get firm with her about it, too. Talking to her, it seems like the main problem has been pride. ""Those are for old folks"". She didn't remember falls due to her dementia, but after this last one, she said ""this has happened a lot lately"". So hopefully she'll do it. Otherwise, yeah, she'll have to move to a nursing home...",2019-01-07 18:58:20,secretSanta17,ado0ro
,New and really uncomfortable,"Hi all,

My 80 year old mother just had a cancerous tumor removed from her bladder and they sent her home with a catheter. She is really weak and gets kind of confused because of the pain meds. I am her son and only child and have never experienced anything like this before. I'm just a little freaked out and need some advise on how to cope and deal with what is happening. I'm very very uncomfortable with the hands-on care.  I do have other family members helping me and during those times I feel more secure, but it's when I have to handle things alone, which is 18 or so hours a day, that are really messing with me.

Rick","One thing I'd remember is that this is a confusing and new time for everyone--both your mom, you and your family members.  So it's perfectly normal to feel freaked out and unsure.   Family roles are changing--your mom has to get used to being the one who is cared for, while you are stepping up to take care of her.   So keep reminding yourself that you're doing just fine--you'll figure things out as you go.  

I did some quick googling, this webpage might be helpful to give you a guide of stuff to be thinking about.  You said you felt pretty unsure about your new role--this will help give you a framework.  [https://www.caregiving.com/the-caregiving-years/stage-2/](https://www.caregiving.com/the-caregiving-years/stage-2/)

&#x200B;

Your local Area Agency on Aging (it's called different things in different states, but you should be able to find it by googling that) is a goverment-funded agency that offers information, support and resources for caregivers. 

As far as the hands-on stuff, there are new skills to learn.   Videotape your family members who are good at the hands-on stuff as they take care of your mom, so you can refer to those while you are alone.

You can also google terms like: tranferring, how to lift, etc.  Here's a series of videos.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUjOarB8XUc&list=PLa1B8idpEiEplIAyH\_swKvZvTQ9yAKH6t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUjOarB8XUc&list=PLa1B8idpEiEplIAyH_swKvZvTQ9yAKH6t)

As far as your mom being confused on the pain meds, here are some tips from [cancer.org](https://cancer.org) (note they have a 1-800 number you can call, too).

&#x200B;

Something to remember is that you are going to make mistakes along the way.  I did, when I took care of my dad, because I'm not a trained nurse and neither are you.  Don't feel guilty.  
Great response, OxfordDictionary. Blessings to you, Rick, for caring for your mom. The only thing I'd add is don't neglect your self care during this time. You will need respite and it can be hard to ask for help. Do it anyway, because it will help you take better care of her if you are well.

1. Me Before You.
2. Still Alice.
Gleason is a documentary on one young family's struggle with ALS.  The patient is a former NFL player for the New Orleans Saints.  It is unflinching and inspirational at the same time.

,What are reputable companies to find live-in care services for my post-stroke mother? [Virginia/D.C],"I'm having difficulty assessing live-in care companies online. Most of them feel fake or populated with stock photo reviews. I'm trying to find solutions for my mother. 

My mother has been struggling to recover after her second stroke. Her left arm is paralyzed right below the shoulder and her left leg is weak. My dad is there to help, but isn't capable of taking care of her during the workday. My mom needs help with bathing/dressing/incontinence/OT exercises/eating. 

Does anyone have any recommendations for companies I should look into or subreddits I should check out for ideas? I'm new to reddit, but I was told this may be a good place to start. 
","Call your local Area Agency on Aging.  They are a government-funded group that does information and referrals for all stuff senior-related.  They can refer your mom to a reputable agency.  If she is eligible for Medicaid, they will help her get signed up so she can get help paying for a caregiver.
Here in Maine , home healthcare agencys charge $25-30 per hour.  You could put a craigslist ad for someone, and possible get a decent homehealthcare worker for $13-18 per hour.
Another affordable option would be to use care.com. I used it to get the caregiving job I have now. You make a job posting with the schedule and pay and caregivers get back to you, and usually they get background checked as well. 
I am not an expert on all of the care giving companies, but I hope it is okay to list the company I work for. I have worked for the last two years for Visiting Angels, which is a good company which trains their staff and screens them well. All of the needs you listed are things I have done for my clients.

,New caregiver hired,"I’ve been caregiving for over 10 years. Both through agencies and privately. I’ve had maybe a handful of clients in that time who were uncooperative and stubborn. Some just plain mean. Fortunately, I worked with an agency and someone else could get reassigned to this difficult client. 

Currently I work with a difficult client. Not through an agency. Initially, I worked early morning hours and the client slept the whole time I was there. I met another caregiver who was hired the same time as me. She was a nurse for years. Very nice lady. We would talk and discuss the client during shift change. We both have the same care, competence and compassion for this job. She’s good to have around so we have each other to vent, laugh, share with. 

A few weeks ago, my hours changed so the client is awake during the last half of my shift. She’s very difficult. I never know who she’ll be when she wakes up. When she gets angry, which is more often than not, she cusses like a sailor. She’ll get pissed that I’m alive. I just leave the room. She declines any prescribed treatment, refuses her meds, hates being told what to do, etc. yes, this is dementia. I’ve never dealt with such an aggressive client. 

I’ve learned to let her wake up before I say anything besides ‘good morning’ and say my name. She loves to eat, so that’s an easy fix. I don’t ask her anything re: treatments, etc. until I know she’s agreeable to it. In the past, the cg that came in after me would take care of anything I couldn’t get done. It was never an issue. Between us cg, we got stuff done. 

Because the client is difficult, cg have come and gone. I understand that. No one should have to put up with some of the verbal abuse this client gives out.   So a new cg started Monday. She showed up, was pleasant enough. A bit too eager and excited. But, whatever. The next two days I didn’t talk to her. Clients son took his mom out for late lunch, so new cg showed up later. As is the norm, we communicate through cg notes. 
I come in this morning and this new girl wrote that ‘nothing was done. Her pills were still in the case, not in her bowl. I took them out and put them next to her.’
I also got an aggressive text from her. On top of this, there are things missing, not put back. The cord to the monitor is missing. The laundry room is askew. Where is the fabric softener? How strange. I’m sure there’s more. It’s just....weird and frustrating. 

So, I want to quit because there’s just too much negativity here. Plus, the adult children are lacking in communication. My frustration is high. Can’t afford to do that, so I need to vent here. 

How can I approach this new girl in a polite, constructive way? Something to the effect of ‘We’re a team, we work together to make things work for Client.’

I also want to say “You’re not the boss of me !#%. Are you even trained?”

Ok. Thanks for reading. I wish I was able to deal with this because I’m an adult. But this is very new to me - an aggressive caregiver is an oxymoron. ","Wanted both of you who responded to know, the day after I wrote this, the new cg called the clients daughter and told her she needed to spend more time with her mom. She was let go two days later. I’m relieved that her aggressive, overbearing behavior is no longer a part of my day. Had a great talk with clients daughter. New cg started yesterday. She was very pleasant. 

Happy New year. 
It is always a challenge to deal with difficult people in the workplace.  A difficult client combined with a new and challenging co-worker seems like things a recipe for tension.  The new caregiver is probably feeling the sting of this difficult client and communicating with you while under duress.  Kindness is contagious, so is crabbiness.  You might be getting second hand crabbiness in written form.  Just a thought.  

Calm, direct, face to face communication with the new caregiver during shift change seems to be the best way to clear the air and find out what is going on.  Maybe text her and ask her to arrive 5-10 minutes early next time your schedules overlap so you can turn things over to them in a way you both find agreeable and discuss your thoughts on earlier communication.  
Since you are a direct caregiver, is there a family contact person who hired you? I would see if you can let the family know what is going on with the new caregiver, because I suspect they would get rid of a caregiver who is a liar or not honest. As far as the client, you get to choose whether you are willing to put up with verbal abuse. If I were you, I would start looking for another client or go to an agency.

,"Just became a caregiver, looking for some kind of alarm system","My grandfather is extremely ill and I've moved in with them to help take care of him. He's fractured his hip from a fall, which makes him uncomfortable, so he likes to be moved a lot. This isn't so much of a problem during the day, but at night all the bedrooms are towards the back of the house and the sofa is in the living room (where he likes to move to) and it's very hard to hear him when we are asleep even with our doors open. Is there any kind of alert device that is very simple, maybe just one big button, that he could press and alarm us loud enough at night to know that he needs help?  


I'm completely new to caregiving but I don't want to leave him in a position where he is calling for us and I'm so sound asleep I can't hear him. I've heard most people use baby monitors, I'm just worried I'll either A. not hear him as I'm a very sound sleeper or B. The feedback will keep us awake. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.","Smart Caregiver Two Call Buttons & Wireless Caregiver Pager https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0032FMSWS/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_hUXbCbY6HTSDF

This thing has saved my life and his. Very loud and worn around the neck and the pager can stay in your pocket or on a belt. Works everywhere around my house and yard. Allows me to stay active at home and not worry about him doing something and not being able to call me. 

Cheaper than most baby monitors. 
I used a baby monitor to listen for my wife (she was in a hospital bed downstairs, I was up in our bedroom). It never bothered me with any sort of feedback, and I woke up instantly when she called. Admittedly, I'm a light sleeper, so YMMV, but it's a good first step before springing for something more fancy/expensive.
I care for my father with the wonderful assistance of Hospice. I realize Hospice may not be an option for your grandfather, but Hospice ordered a bed and chair alarm for him.  It’s called MultiPro Safety Alarm from the Skil-Care Association. It literally was just delivered so I can’t speak to the effectiveness yet or the cost as it was covered by insurance. It’s essentially a pad that has a pressure sensor and will alarm if he moves from it. Skil-care.com 
OP, sorry to hear his health has declined. I do want to thank your posting this question and keeping it up. It has helped me with deciding what to purchase so we can help out with my aunt as we care for her.
Whistle around his neck?
Another option that might work for some situations and people is a desk bell like you might see at a hotel front desk. You don't need to pick it up to use, just hit it with a part of ones hand. You can buy them online. I think the loud pager might be better but sometimes it is nice to have two ways for a patient to contact a caregiver or have different options to consider.",2018-12-04 13:23:03,Morthand,a33afa
,Elderly & Opioids,"So I've been my grandparents helper for the past year, and I'm really struggling and worried about my grandfather. 

My Grandfather (87) for the past decade plus has been taking Hydrocodone as a pain killer, primarily to help with the pain associated with all of his joints being replaced and extreme end stage rheumatoid arthritis. With the new laws and restrictions on Opiods we are running into problems finding an alternative pain killer. We spent the last 6 months trying Tramadol (strongest thing the doctors was willing to prescribe), and based off his comments and my observation it has have no to very little effect. Nothing like the Hydrocodone.

With the Hydrocodone at least he was moving and walking. Now he won't leave his chair and sleeps the day away. He says he's doing ok, and the pain isn't to bad, but its obvious he is avoiding movement. Even the amount he is eating is reduced, as he spends most meals just staring at the plate gripping his knees. He often asks to return to his chair after a few bites. I've talked to the doctors about this and each time all they suggest is he take over the counter Tylenol and order another round of X-rays. Surprise, the cartilage hasn't returned to his hands and his joints are still artificial, so helpful!

Just looking to see if others have struggled with the opioid crackdown, and with luck maybe get some new ideas on how to help him.","If CBD oil is available in your area please give it a try. I’m able to use it with my 92 year old mom and it does wonders for pain and anxiety. It doesn’t have thc in it so there’s no “high”. 
Request that his Primary Care doctor give him a referral to a Pain Management physician.  Most PCPs will not give hydrocodone (Vicodin) for chronic conditions.

Pain Management will but they may also require that he goes to various complementary therapies.  Otherwise, it looks at if he is just a state approved dope addict.  Sorry, that is how they look at things today. 
Ask your primary care doctor if your grandpa can be assessed for hospice.  They probably have a freer hand when it comes to prescribing opioids.
I second the recommendation for a Pain Management Doctor. General Practitioners are just unwilling to go out on a limb with opioids and get in trouble. Pain Management Doctors have more leeway to prescribe the stronger meds, since they’re specially trained in it. I think they would help, I wouldn’t think they would want to see an 87 year old in that much pain. His regular doctor would probably be relieved to turn over that part of his care.
If kratom is not illegal in your state, then I’d say a very high grade red strain to combat pain.          👍🏾🍃☺️",2018-11-29 13:38:07,rayblasdel,a1k0zx

I am trying to get a job as a live-in carer. It would be for an elderly lady who mostly needs help with chores and cooking, no bathroom help, and I have no PSW certification. 

They are asking what time I want off, and after scouring the internet I can't find any ""industry standards"" for how this usually worwks. 

Are there any regulations for time off for this kind of work? 

The pay would be a monthy salary plus room and board.

I am hoping to make a positive inpact in someones life, just want to say you all are very inspiring.","Hey thats awesomr you're going to be a caregiver. I heard that you get a 6 to 8 hour period to sleep and 4 hours in the day to do whatever. I could be wrong.

You've probavly already got this figured out but make sure you have boundaries set up in writing somewhere, to make sure they won't abuse your help, and to find out what they do and don't want.
I was a live-in for a year. Definitely not the greatest experience for me. I wish I had done more research but the situation I was in, wasn't the best (needed to find a place to live ASAP, no income...) so I was just grateful that the opportunity arose. My client had another care provider and she helped me fill out paperwork and such. She wasn't sure about certain things, like time off and stuff so it was all up in the air. I was only supposed to have worked (and paid) for a certain amount of hours but I was pretty much a servant to this woman. Lovely woman, but at the same time, she was fully capable of doing things on her own that she made me do. As someone else posted, my client did abuse my help.

I tried to make time for myself by taking a course at the community college but after one semester, she got upset and wouldn't let me enroll in anything else. She would get upset if I ever left the apartment to go to the store, go for a walk...go ANYWHERE!

She had a lot of issues that were not made clear to me before I signed up for all that. Not necessarily in the physical sense but mental. She eventually fired me because her mental state was so far gone that she began to accuse me of things I didn't do. I was ready to quit too but did not know where to go, but her firing me and kicking me out was the greatest thing ever! I was able to find another job fairly quickly, and a place to live. I'm still a care provider but not a live-in so I don't ""take my work home with me"" which is basically what you do when you're a live-in.

How do you persuade your Dad/Mom who refuses to take their prescribed bronchodilator?




","Did she say why she doesn’t want to? My mom *never* took her medicine when I tried to help educate her just like you. The only thing that helped was when I finally broke down in front of her in tears and told her I was afraid of her dying and no matter what I did to help, it wasn’t enough to make her care. I just hit my breaking point and it worked. I think it finally clicked that I was trying to help. 

Sometimes I think parents don’t understand the psychological effect it has when you’re trying to help health wise. 
I don't know.  I have a sister who will take the pills but will not do the other complimentary therapies that the doctors ask her to do.  They even told her that if she doesn't stop smoking, stop taking the pain killers and continues to just sit and watch TV that she will be dead in a year.  Still doesn't phase her. 
My mom’s doc told me just today we can’t make them do what they’re supposed to do. It was such a relief to hear advice so straightforward from a medical professional. I was afraid that someday I may have to explain myself as to why I didn’t “force” something. 
Sometimes, as it was with my mother, they have to learn the hard way.... through an exacerbation of their condition and/hospitalization.  Its like getting a 13 year old to eat their broccoli. I tried rationalizing consistent use.  It didn't sink in until it was an emergency and now she's on 24/7 oxygen support. She doesn't fight me on the inhaler and nebulizer treatments anymore.

,Hiring a Caregiver,"Hi! 

My father was diagnosed with ALS a little bit over a year ago.  Since then, my mother has been taking care of him with my help.  They encouraged me to return to college this semester, with the mindset being that my mom would hire a caregiver to at least give her a few hours off a day.  However, she's been incredibly busy taking care of him and is yet to hire someone.  I was wondering if you guys had any advice for hiring someone for part time help?  I think what she'd really like is for someone to come in for an hour in the morning then two hours at night.  However, as most you probably know, my father's condition will worsen and his needs will change - and the doctors cannot give us a timetable for that. Any advice for where to find potential caregivers and how to discuss his progressing condition with them?  Any assistance is appreciated!! 

  
Thanks","This is a difficult time.  In the US, you can see if there are any caregiving support groups in your area.  I found an independent caregiver this way, to help with my mother when I was going through this.

You can also call your local Office of Aging to see what they have available.

At some point, your father may have to go into a home as the care required will be too much.  You may want to start this search sooner rather than later as I found that many places have waiting lists.  Here again, the Office of Aging can advise you of your options.  Again, this is a difficult time.  Good Luck.",2018-11-12 09:12:18,BergIsToasted,9wec0p
,"I'm a PCA, and I feel the person I'm caring for is committing Fraud.","Hello, r/caregivers

A few months ago I was approached by a man named Edward, and offered a job as his personal care attendant.  I registered with Stavros Fiscal Intermediary, where I would fax my timesheets in order to be paid for the services I provide for Edward. This was wonderful, he seemed like an amazing man, even took me and my fiance out to dinner to build rapport with us.

But these are common tactics.

When discussing payment, he originally said that I would be making 20 dollars an hour according to the original E-mail. This was great! However, when filling out my first timesheet, where I had only worked about 6 hours, he told me that it was standard procedure to write 16 hours down on the timesheet. I found this odd, as the rules said I would be paid directly via the number of hours I put down. When I asked any questions about payment, he was very very vague. It wasn't until I received my first paycheck of 750 dollars, far more than I had worked for with 6 hours of work, he told me that I would be writing him checks for the remainder of the money, excluding my 20%. 20%? Of the money paid to me for hours worked, that he told me it was standard procedure to write more hours on... This doesn't seem right.

He said this is how payment will be done. He will be receiving around 600 dollars, and I will be taking 150.

The worst part, is that he made it seem like the extra money was mine, and that it was just a standard payment (I'm very new to all of this, including being employed at a job higher than Macdonalds.) And so- I've already spent far more than 20% of this now seemingly fraud money.

What do I do? Is this normal, or is this straight up fraud?","I'm disabled and hire caregivers through a fiscal intermediary.

As u/philmo69 said, this is straight up fraud. You have to report this to the fiscal intermediary. You could actually probably get in a lot of trouble if you don't report this, because then you would be seen as going along with it (even though it's hugely exploitative of you). 

I would report it to Stavros and plan to leave the job ASAP, in case he lashes out at you.

Let me know if you have more questions. I'm always happy to help where I'm able. 
Yeah thats straight up fraud. Sounds like is basicly stealing your time and probably from whoever is paying for his care. Its people like that who screw over those who are in legit need and aren't looking to screw over the people caring for them.
This is 100% fraud.  People like Stavros, and there are too many to count, are traitors to this country.  

Document this fraud and give it to your representative in congress, medicare/medicaid.

,Senior following surgery,"Hello all - I searched around a bit on Reddit for the right place to ask this, so if this isn't correct, let me know!

I'm asking for advice on behalf of my family. My 85 year-old grandpa just came home after 11 days in the hospital following colon cancer surgery (he's now cancer-free!). He was supposed to go to physical therapy before returning home, but he was doing so well that they didn't send him, I guess. He's actually doing pretty well, eating okay and sleeping okay. The main problem is that he's not moving a lot. He spends too much time in his recliner watching TV. 
My question is, what's the best way for someone his age to get a bit of exercise or to stay as active as he can? He also has neuropathy and normally can't walk around for long periods of time. Walking outside would be nice, except it's starting to get cold out (yay Indiana weather...).

Can you think of a reason why they would target you, or something that they may associate with you, like if you are always the one giving showers or bringing meds? Is there something you could change in your approach that could help improve the mood, or is it probable to accept that the client may just not work well with you? Without knowing the client, I don't want to make any assumptions, but if they always orient on you and seem to behave differently for other staff, it may be worth working with other staff to limit your exposure to them. It's a weird feeling to think that someone may not come around to liking you, but everyone has their own preferences and sometimes becoming friendly with them is just not in the cards!",2018-10-30 18:53:36,theguzman20,9st05x

,I have a question,"I work for an in home care giving agency, and I would like to know if any of you other caregivers have experienced something similar. My client ended up sinking to the floor and I am not strong enough to get him up, so we used his life alert and they sent a policeman to help. Usually in the past they have been very kind and helpful, but this time I requested the cop to stay a couple of minutes because my client needed to use the bathroom and I didn't think that in his current state he could get standing up (Usually he has done okay in the past but was weak this time) the policeman did stay a few minutes and help. Everything worked out okay without injuries. So this policeman requested to speak with me afterwards and basically made me feel like crap, like I should just quit my job and let someone else do it, although I have been working it for 2 years. He then took down my full name, phone number and DOB. As if he was threatening me. And chewed me out for him ""having to do my job"" . Like, dude, I just made dinner, cleaned the house, paid all this guy's bills using his checks, and helped him use the toilet. I do the work! Isn't that what the EMTs and police are for in this small town with little crime? Has anyone else here had issues like this with some police? Sheesh, he made me feel like quitting. ","I'm sorry he gave you such a hard time. The last thing you need while caregiving is negativity. I've never had to deal with that attitude, but if I did, then I'd try to brush it off as a bad day.
The cop was completely out of line. I do think that they should have called an EMT(s) instead of a policeman to help you, but the EMTs may have all been busy. And as a public servant, there are parts of the job that aren't always the most exciting. You are fine - don't let this asshat upset you. Does your area have a community police officer? I might bring it up with him/her - explain the situation and that the officer took your information, and you just want to make sure you were correct in what you did (and you ARE, but by raising it to the community officer, hopefully they'll turn around and give this jerk a wake-up call about what ""serve and protect"" can sometimes consist of).

Keep doing you. You're a [superstar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_nOzJWjxTo)! :)
Keep up your good works.  People just don't understand until they walk through a similar experience.  Sometimes you have to pat yourself on the back as a caregiver because not everyone knows what you are actually doing.   It is like this hidden little world until you are thrust into it.  People with the means quickly outsource it because they find out how unbelievably demanding it can be.  

I am also willing to give Officer Grumps a little compassion too, I have no idea what kind of day they had.  Everyone is fighting some sort of personal battle.  The most important thing is the patient, who can no longer fight their own battles, had both you and the officer to get them through.  Hopefully they officer will do better next time they are called.
I have had to deal with grumpy EMTs, firefighters, and police but never to this extent. Unfortunately, it seems like the officer took it too far. You can make a complaint (I'm sure they have a record at the station of what happened) if it becomes a problem. Next time, ask for a ""lift-assist"" if the person you're caring for isn't in immediate danger. They will send over EMTs instead of police/firefighters and they are much more prepared and deal with these situations more often than anyone else. My mother has Parkinson's and falls a lot so I have to do the same thing often.
Technically, you should have requested EMTs.  The is really their domain.  The police are often called for things like this but it really isn't their domain. Their job is fighting crime not helping the elderly off the floor.

If your patient continues to fall, the family will have to be notified and he/she may have to be placed in an assisted living facility. 
Next time a patient falls on you try using a flat sheet to help you lift that. I’m a caregiver to my wheelchair bound dad and I use that, a back brace and all my strength to hoist him when he falls.

,Stressed out caregiver seeking advice,"Hello! I am a caregiver for a severely handicapped child. The child that I am paid to take care of is amazing and sweet. Her younger sibling is the opposite. Before I became the handicapped child’s caregiver I babysat both children. Now I am only paid to take care of the handicapped one, not the younger sibling, but I am still expected to watch both of them. The youngest is a complete brat, disrespects me, talks back to me, hits me, and is just a horrible child. I have voiced my concerns to the mother a few times and after that things are better for a week or so, then they just get worse. She is the youngest of 5 children with her closest sibling in age being handicapped, so I understand that she wants attention.  But out of the five children, she is the most spoiled and gets the most attention, so that’s really no excuse. I just don’t know what to do about her. I can’t quit because I love the rest of the family and I need the money. If you have any advice, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!","I'm sure it's confusing for a kid who has gotten used to thinking of you as her babysitter to suddenly be told, ""You aren't covered by the pay anymore, and you're already getting enough attention."" That would be a tough adjustment for anyone, and not all kids deal with loss well (and it is a loss for her). Unfortunately, as kids get needier, they don't usually get more charming.

If you're expected to watch both kids, make plans to keep both kids busy with specific activities. Figure out some kind of reward system for when the younger one entertains herself with a book or toy for ten minutes (or longer, depending on her age & ability), to boost her interest in independent play. Figure out some kind of reward system for when she shows good manners. I'd include her parents in these plans, and specifically ask, ""What's the plan to keep youngest kid busy today? Who's responsible for her?"" Maybe she could have some playdates with other friends a few days a week to give you a break so you can focus on her sibling. Maybe her parents will pay you to have a special time each week when you can have one-on-one time with this younger kid, so she knows there's a scheduled time when she has your undivided attention.   


I hope you figure out a way to help her build her social skills and make things easier for you!
That’s very helpful! I will try to work out a schedule, but it’s a bit hard because the girl with disabilities needs my attention for the entire time that I am there. There was a point in time where the youngest wasn’t allowed talking to me for a week and that was pretty great. I got a lot done that week haha! And it is confusing for the youngest because she sees me as a sister, so I think that’s probably why she behaves the way that she does. I think it will get better over time. Hopefully!

We use twice daily blister packs. You can buy them on Amazon and fill them yourself, but our local pharmacy also offer this service for $10/month. The pills are pre-sorted and placed into 2x-4x daily individually sealed packs that are labeled with the date and time. 

For example, my grandma takes pills 2x daily, so today’s pill packs were labeled “9/26, 7am” and “9/26, 4pm.” The meds are also individual listed in smaller print on each package when you get them from a pharmacy. I peel open the blister packs, deposit them in her hand and she takes them. 
Our local pharmacy does a service whereby they handle all of the prescriptions and put them in dosage blister packs, so that you can just open each dose at the correct time and all the meds are there. The pills are all identified by shape size, color on a list. They do deliveries as well, and you can usually have the meds within a couple hours if you need them delivered.

you may be able to get someone for $15-18 per hour, but you are taking your chances.  i found out the agencies that charge $25 per . hour actually pay the employees 11-15 per hour depending on skills and experience. it sure is fun trying to find an affordable , competent caregiver.

Minor experience with this in the Valley of the Sun. A lot of clients have AHCCCS (pronounced ""access"") and they (AHCCCS) pay for case management services. The case managers, amongst other things, determine what services are needed, including caregivers and the allotted hours. Sometimes they contract with hospice services who offer mobile care. The agencies I dealt with also had Private Pay, where the clients (or families) paid out of pocket \*for caregiving services but if they're elderly, it's worthwhile to give AHCCCS a call.

[https://www.azahcccs.gov/shared/AHCCCScontacts.html](https://www.azahcccs.gov/shared/AHCCCScontacts.html)

edit to add: you can PM me if you want the names of specific agencies.

edit edit to add regarding craigslist: yeah, a lot of agencies charge north of $20 per hour and pay the caregivers closer to $10, but part of why they're doing that is because they have an agency to run that provides CPR / First Aid training, training with gait belts and slide boards and pericare, deals with scheduling, monitors DMV records of their caregivers, can coordinate care if someone calls off their shift, performs home visits to make sure that caregivers are actually doing their jobs, actually vets the caregivers for having a valid Fingerprint Clearance Card (legally required in the state of Arizona to be a caregiver) etc etc. No, the agencies aren't perfect, but in a way you're paying insurance on your investment.   
If you have to pay out of pocket, the $18 per hour caregiver is obviously cheaper, but there isn't as any infrastructure in place (except you!) to make sure they ARE qualified for their jobs, and they AREN'T abusing their clients.  Concerns about this will vary from person to person, but yeah, you can also ask me what you should be looking for if you decide to contract with an individual instead of an agency.

The best caregivers in my experience are the ones who can truly connect with the residents they serve. To them, it's not just a job. (And yes, I know caregivers are pitifully paid, so it's asking a lot. I so want caregivers to be paid much better.)
As long as you don't have anything glaringly problematic in your background, you show up on time, and act interested, they will probably hire you. Unfortunately, most places that hire caregivers don't have a rigorous interviewing process. It's almost an attitude of: if you can walk and breathe, you're in!

The carer being fatigue from transferring my granpa by himself, without any utility but his own body, is harmful for both the carer and my granpa, as the carer gets burnt out and the transfers themselves become sloppy and so can result in injury.

In short, I see a need for some kind of utility that will help the carer, and while money is not an issue..it can't be something of the size of a hoyer lift, at least not right now.

If it was my home I'd order a hoyer lift tomorrow, but my grandparents won't put such a big machine in their home, and I have to play by their rules.

&#x200B;

I've searched all the elderly care related subreddits and came up with these:

1. A gait belt, not sure if it's useful for a person who can hardly support his weight. what do you think?
2. I found [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/72x83t/desperate_need_of_advice_on_how_to_help_my_father/dnmhvxy/) which described a product that can be good but the comment doesn't mention a name and I didn't find it with Google:

>One of those straps they use at physical therapy might help depending on how strong you are. It's basically a big canvas belt you loop around (under armpits) and they use that as an option in PT in case the patient falls. It helps you not injure the person as you help them get up and allows you to use better motion/force to get them up with less strength. I watched a 90 lb woman pick up my 250lb father off the floor with one (granted.. this lady was a badass :))

&#x200B;","Gait belts can be very helpful. (The canvas belt mentioned in that comment could be a form of gait belt, though I've never heard of putting it under your armpits.) You might also look into getting a wheelchair with moveable arms that lift up out of the way along with a sliding board. (If you do an internet search for ""sliding board transfer"" you can see examples of how this works.) A sliding board dramatically shortens the length of time and distance needed to lift a person.   


Also, it might be worth investing in a home visit from a physiotherapist to see how your grandpa is moving/being moved at home, and then make specific suggestions. Good luck!
Wish your grandparents had room for a hoyer lift, it sounds like the solution.  The only other thing I can imagine as a compromise would be an easy chair with a motorized lift. Also an ""upeasy"" pneumatic lift(power or manual) for his dining chair, etc.  This would lift your grandfather part of the way and allow more leverage for his carers.  Then the gait belt from bed, or an adjustable bed that can be raised and lowered for more leverage.  
When it comes time for my mother, I will definitely get a hoyer lift and rearrange the home to accommodate it where possible.  Best wishes.
I learned transfers from a couple of experienced CNAs. On numerous occasions I was better able to transfer my clients than the PTs. I once got hired for the sole reason that I was able to transfer a client that more experienced carers had dropped. 

It's all about proper technique. Watch a lot of videos and then get someone who has a lot of experience to show you. Proper pivoting is key.

Gait belts are wonderful, if used correctly. Transfer boards take some practice, but are also great. 

The most important thing that I learned was to make the patient participate. As they rise get them to focus all of their energy on stiffening up. A board is much easier to move than a sack of potatoes.
I'd definitely would be willing to try it out! It may not be a bad idea to call a PT location and ask for advise or get someone to visit your home, they're probably more knowledgeable about helpful devices/exercises for your specific situation. You should encourage your grandpa to do small PT exercises at home so he can have some strength (Mine doesn't like them but we try as a game sometimes to make him do some movement on his own). it takes a lot of encouragement but the patients need to keep trying and not fully rely on a machine or on someone to lift them if they're still capable to move a little   
A sit to stand machine could be helpful, or a sliding board if he can support his weight with his arms.  The sit to stand will take up some space, And if hallways are narrow, perhaps accommodations could be made to move his bed into another room of the house which has less narrow spaces.  If they do not agree to this, I would stress that he needs to be in a nursing home. I have dealt extensively with this issue with a couple of my clients. I was so glad to hear that they have moved him to an assisted living place., although I think even the assisted living home  will send him to a nursing home instead. My shoulder was injured there and don't wish that on anyone, including his wife. Also, I reread your post and realized that the transfers he has been doing are WAY TOO MUCH for or only one person! He should have 2 people FOR EVERY TRANSFER. It is dangerous for the caregiver, and if they are permanently injured they will not be able to work at all. ",2018-09-18 14:58:09,,9gxo49
,"Guilt, guilt, and more guilt. How do you handle it?","My father is a widower of 3 years, is nearly 60 years old, and has a laundry list of medical conditions (Parkinson's, diabetes, congestive heart failure, depression). He currently lives by himself about 1 hour from me. He does have a paid caretaker that comes by for an hour or two on weekdays, but other than that, I'm the caregiver. The problem is I'm a newly wed with a new career. I'm struggling with the guilt of feeling annoyed when he needs something from me. He's not very shy about asking for help even with little things. I never say anything to him as he struggles with depression himself.  He doesn't need me more than once every two weeks or so. I'm trying to set some boundaries where if I have plans, I'll tell him I can't come and then he will break down and ask the paid caretaker to come. But then the guilt I feel is debilitating. It also makes me want to always have a bank of excuses to use if it's a non-vital reason he wants me to come over.

I know compared to many people, this is a non-issue since I have to do so little. But I'm young (28) and I feel like I can't talk to anyone about this other than my husband since my friends' parents are all still healthy. My husband is supportive but also doesn't want to spend all his time with his new father in law. My mother in her last few months expressed concern about who was going to take care of my dad when she passed. So I feel additional pressure and guilt from that as well as I am not a full time caregiver for him. I know my dad is only going to go downhill from here and I have got to find a way to cope. Not only with the guilt, but with balancing time for myself, time for my husband, and time for care giving. 

How do you do it?! Especially with no one your age to talk to about it? Do I just accept that this is my life now? I feel guilty for even posting this. ","My caregiving journey began 10 years ago, and became full time about 8 years ago.  My father was also the catalyst for bringing caregiving into my reality.  Several chronic ailments not unlike your father.   He succumbed at 86 years of age after fighting through countless challenges about a year and a half ago.  Caregiving is intellectually, emotionally, financially and physically taxing.  Finding balance is an ongoing act, readjusting all along the way.  Feeling guilt is a fairly big part of the landscape.  Keep a mental file of the things you are grateful for, things you are proud of, and things you overcame.  You can draw strength from them.  I did things I never thought I could do.  Also take a few deep breaths when the guilt monster comes to visit, let it pass.  Dig in and keep grounded in the present, adopt a servant's heart, and press on.   It also helped me immensely on the emotional front to appreciate the clinical aspects of my father's conditions.  For instance, when someone like your father suffers from congestive heart failure, their brain receives less oxygen.  They can not reason well due to a lack of oxygen.  They are literally incapable, they need help even with small things.  It is far easier to forgive yourself and others when you realize things are simply out of their control at this point and guilt subsides.   Do the best you can and know that is all anyone can do.

I will say I think expectations of women are still very high in caregiving.  Even though men, like me, are taking the role of primary caregiver more and more.  It is nearly 40% now.  It seems to me women have always had the greater burden in caregiving.  My grandmother took in her father-in-law while raising three young children.  My Aunt and Uncle cared for my other grandmother for years at home while raising their two children.  It is just what people did.  Now families are far flung across the nation, women have careers they can't abandon, and people with chronic conditions live longer.  It is a dilemma for those in their most productive years, like yourself.  There will come a point where there is no time for guilt and it will just melt away temporarily.

If there are any resources available, ask for help.  Siblings, your father's friends/family, neighbors, church, support groups, etc.  The sad fact is that there is only so much others can do, but they can give you a respite every now and then.   My view is that it was my duty.  My father served his family, country, and his wife.  I served him in turn.  I now serve my mother in her widowhood and currently moderate decline.  Thankfully she is relatively healthy, but that in itself promises me a long support/caregiving role ahead.  We also lost our home to Hurricane Harvey just over a year ago.  We chose to move away because there was no practical way to rebuild in our circumstance, particularly with an octogenarian.  We had to walk away from neighbors of 40 years, doctors, and our home.  I must simply accept that and do the best I can even though I get older too.  It is my duty and it must be done.  Thankfully we can do it.  I resent that this is my lot in life sometimes, and feel guilty about that, but will do my best to make the best of it like countless others before me.

tldr:  Caregiving is hard, but it is our duty.  Guilt is part and parcel of the landscape.   Accept that and love yourself and others despite it.
I used to be a caregiver for my mother and I also struggled with guilt. It's hard to deal with, so I sympathize. But I think you're doing the right thing in maintaining balance: as hard as it is, you need to focus on your own life too.

If you're really struggling, perhaps talking to a counselor could help. I find it's helpful just to be able to express myself and share my feelings with someone who has a completely objective perspective.

&#x200B;
This is literally my exact situation, except with my mother and I still live with her. I'm 26, about to get married. My mom has Parkinson's, diabetes, congestive heart, depression... You name it. It's so hard juggling life with caretaking but it's just a part of my life now. And I'm sorry to say, it's only going to get worse since Parkinson's is a progressive disease. I feel guilty all the time, because I get very agitated towards my mother but it's so hard. I don't have any time for myself anymore, but I also have to care for her. Then I feel guilty knowing I shouldn't get angry or upset. Repeat. It's hard but I just have to live with it I guess. I have no other choice.
I'm a caregiver too, and maybe this will help: I wrote a free ebook, Journaling for Caregivers. It's available on amazon.com/books. I journal myself and I have released alot of emotion this way. Hope that helps. 
I can understand exactly where you are coming from, as you might guess from my handle, ReluctantCaregiver.  I was a bit older than you, mid-30's, when I became a caregiver for my parents. My dad had dementia and my mother developed colon cancer just six months after he died. I had just started a new job (I put a career change on hold while my dad was still alive.) I quit my job and moved across the country to take care of her for half a year, leaving  my partner and pets behind. Mom and I had opposite personalities and fought more than I wish we had. She recovered, but a year and a half later, she had a recurrence and died. Being there during her last month was the toughest thing I've ever done, I'm still haunted by it, but it did take some of the guilt away about not being a good daughter.

You are right in that you must set boundaries, even though these are guilt-inducing. If your dad is lonely, if there's an adult day care service or something similar he could go to, that might help take the pressure off of you. If it's more of a control thing, or he only wants your company, then it might be necessary to have a frank discussion with him. Even if you weren't a newlywed, you would  likely burn out quickly with being a primary caregiver and starting a new career. If getting more help or friends/family to assist is possible, that could be another option. 

What you don't want is to end up so bitter/burned out that the time you have left with your father is wasted. 

There are a growing number of millennial caregivers going through similar situations. It would probably be helpful if you can find a group of caregivers your age in your area or online. You can do a Google search to read more about the growing community. The Scan Foundation has a ""Do you give a care"" campaign supporting younger caregivers. 

I wrote a collection of personal essays on my struggle with the guilt and demands of being a caregiver while you are young. It's called The Reluctant Caregiver if you are interested. I'd be happy to send you a free copy.
I hope you're still on reddit. 

If your friends are really your friends, they'll understand if you want to vent, even if they can't relate. When all this started for me (My mom went downhill in a bad way and fast because of MS), I was only 22 and one of my friends was soon engaged and had stuff on her plate, but was still there for me and had 0 gripes about how I acted, supporting me all the way. My cousin was way less supportive at times in a time I really needed her and couldn't relate/didn't know how to handle my clingy-ness. So, everyone's going to react differently, but it's times like this you know who your TRUE friends are.  So, if you haven't already, talk to your friends about it.

As to the guilt, you have been doing the best you can. You're starting a new chapter in your life and doing things most caregivers can't.  Your dad wants you to be happy. Maybe a few months down the road, if it's in your circumstances and is affordable, you can move closer to him if your husband's okay with it.  Maybe you could request the caretaker come in a couple more days out of the week if you can afford it, if you haven't already. (I know everyone has different budgets. I'm sure you're not broke! I just don't know what your income is, I can only guess.) Outside of that, I'd suggest setting aside a few days out of the week to visit if you're not already. I wish I had more or better advice, I'm sorry. Hope things have improved for you by now. I'm sure other redditors helped more than me, but I just thought I'd pitch in because you sounded like you really needed it. 
Do you not have anyone else to share this burden with you? Other family members? Maybe if you do, you can share your thoughts with siblings, etc. And come up with a plan.  I totally get it that this is a very heavy responsibility for a newlywed, and you should definitely help your father to see that you must spend the bulk of your time on your own future plans.  The best way I am avoiding the guilt is that my husband and I moved a couple hours away from my parents so that we are not perceived as accessible daily or even weekly to help with caregiving.  This may change in the not too distant future, but the guilt is whatever he is saddling you with. It is not real. You should not have to feel guilty. If he is guilting you about it, I am sad to say, but then he is toxic. 
If there is no one else to help you my first suggestion would be to look for outside resources, senior community centers in the US oftentimes offer counseling for family members and they really do help. You are not all alone dealing with this situation! As someone also commented if your dad has Medicaid depending on the case as it evolves he'll be able to get more hours with his caregiver. It isn't an easy road, but balance is key and counseling in regards to your situation is common and recommended.  
28 m new caregiver for children here. I have callous days. My clients have moody days. I forgive myself for internal thoughts as I forgive them for their actions. As long as you keep with it, never become so bitter that you actually let it affect your judgement (refusing reasonable requests or other negligence) then you're just being a human.

,Am i not a care giver?,"Dear users of this subreddit,

I'm a 20 year old guy who works in a facility for mentally disabled people in the Netherlands. I always thought that that was called  caregiving but after reading the posts on this subreddit i'm beginning to think caregiving is only called so if you take care of 1 individual or a loved one. Can someone please clarify this for me?","I would consider you a caregiver.  If you do the work, you get the title.  I think this group is richer with caregivers from all situations. We're all here to help each other, either by simply giving a listen or offering advice. Advice from a caregiving professional would be personally welcome to me if I received it.  Please feel welcome in this subredit.

And you're English is fine.  It's much better than my nederlans.
You are doing caregiving! Most of the people on this subreddit just happen to be family caregivers, but there what you are doing is absolutely caregiving. And difficult caregiving too! 

As u/achter17g said, you should feel quite welcome here. 
A professional caregiver has boundaries with their patients, but they are caregivers nonetheless.  A familial caregiver has practically no boundaries.  It requires a more complete devotion and sublimation of self.  I have often been very grateful to those who devoted their careers to helping patients, because caring for profoundly ill people would be impossible without them.   Even though there are boundaries, one is still facing the challenges of caregiving.
I apologize for my english if i made mistakes btw

,Need advise on how to handle making sure someone is meeting dietary/nutritional/hydration needs when they refuse to accept they are not being met,"I've been caretaking for my father who has fairly advanced Parkinson's Disease (PD) for a while now. He prefers to keep some autonomy, which can be helpful and take some of the burden off of myself and my family, but has it's own difficulties. As of the last year I've been more closely observing his water and nutritional intake and began to grow concerned about a few things, chiefly not drinking much water and having a very low protein intake.

First step, I got a general idea of a minimum daily water intake, found an appropriate container and kept it simple: Make sure you drink this entire container (~60 fl.oz.) of water a day to be in a fairly safe place. 

The next step, we started recording what foods he was eating so that we could enter them into a food tracker so that we could see information such as calories, macronutrients, etc. and have an idea of what needed to be adjusted. It was also a good excuse to get him to challenge himself physically and mentally by learning to input this information on a computer.

Well, we started. And then it all fell apart. 

All of a sudden he stops drinking enough water, and more-over, stops using the water jug set out specifically for him. His reason was, ""Oh, I thought we were done tracking my water,"" even though nothing of the sort was ever even brought up. It was always intended as a permanent solution to ensure his hydration, but he just out of nowhere comes up with that.

Now he's drinking very little water, with the worst day recently being something around 16oz of fluid, which I find concerning. When I talk to him about this, there's always some reason or excuse. Stuff like: 

* ""Well, when we first started tracking my water I was doing really well""
* ""Well, yesterday I drank enough water."" (usually not actually the case)
* ""I thought I was doing well.""
*  ""I drank a lot of water today,"" (he hadn't, and if I show him the jug of water he finds another convenient excuse)
* ""I didn't know we were still doing that.""
* ""I didn't feel I had to.""
* ""I'm working on it."" (x hours later he hasn't drank more than a sip of any liquid)

When confronted with the facts, he just finds another excuse. If I show him how much water is left in the container, he ignores it and changes the subject. If cornered, he simply becomes upset and tries to disengage from the conversation.

Tracking food and nutrition is almost the same exact thing. He doesn't always meet caloric goals, and he's generally very low on protein. Because of his condition with PD, musculature is a big deal since he doesn't have very much to begin with - he is a very small man and very low on weight with very little muscle to boot. He can't really afford to lose weight or muscle mass, but over the last year he's dropped a few pounds, and with his eating trends, it's concerning.

Reason doesn't seem to work. There's always an excuse. I want to be able to give him some sort of autonomy, but it's beginning to seem like that's simply not realistic. I'm not really sure how to handle this. I can't just force-feed him, and it feels wrong to tell him he has to sit at the dinner table and drink all of his water and eat all of his veggies before he can leave the table. I can't get him to eat or drink the way he should and there doesn't seem to be a way to make sure he's going to. So some support and advice on how some of you have tackled similar situations would be really helpful and appreciated. Thanks.","I am a caregiver for my grandmother who does not like to drink water. Sometimes if you put flavor in the water they will be more likely to drink more. For protein, you could try an protein shake or ensure or boost as a meal replacement if you are really concerned. Make sure you check with his doctor before you decide to use a meal replacement.  Good luck.
My dad won't drink water without Mio drops anymore and he has a chocolate  protein shake every afternoon. I used to worry about everything too then finally realized that it doesn't make a difference.
Don't overlook cognitive issues.  

It takes work and effort keeping track of fluid and what you are eating.  I have a hard enough time tracking my medications, thankfully now every four hours for Sinement due to DBS, but other meds are every six hours (I can eat those with foods), but tracking water is a challenge.  Bottled water is expensive, so I like your idea of the jug of water but still hard to keep track to remember to fill that.  

My wife often will ask what I had for lunch. Somedays I just get sidetracked and forget to eat.

In a way having a scale that automatically measures the weight of the jug would help in tracking and reminding him to have a glass of water.   Our Parkinson's workout coach always reminds us ""1 oz for every two pounds of body weight"".  I'm at 240# at 6'3"" but 120z of water just seems too much. Yet I can drink four 22 oz bottle of water without much thought.

Oh, Parkinson's also plays havoc on our bladder.  Both loss of control, and not being able to empty it.  I've learned it is easy to empty more of my bladder sitting down than standing, but that takes time!  Other times my bladder lets loose without warning, yes there are Pads for that, but my not drinking water before running errands or long drives, less of an issue.   I realize not good.  





I take care of my grandparents, both have many dietary restrictions and my grandmother, who also has parkinsons, is insanely picky. When I've spoken to their doctors about similar issues they've told me, generally speaking, that as long as they know the consequences of disregarding the restrictions -and in my grandmothers case usually refusing to eat anything healthy- then leave them to it. 

You can also try Gatorade or similar if he is not responding to water. Ensure and other nutritional drinks could be an option as well. My grandfather is on a strict water intake but he gets incredibly bored with plain water. Adding in some fruit juice/tea/gatorade or other flavoring helps it become palatable. 

Could it also be he just doesn't think about taking a drink? He may not feel thirsty so he just doesn't think of it? Maybe set a timer to remind him to take a drink a few times an hour or if someone is home with him bring him a smaller cup (8 oz or less) of water a couple times an hour and have him take a drink then. Possibly bring him a few grapes or a small piece watermelon or other fruit at the same time and try to encourage him to take a bite or two. You'll get a little more nutrition and fluid into him and may also help encourage thirst. 

You are right that you can't force feed him but if you feel that he isn't mentally sound to make these decisions for himself speak with his physicians directly, they may suggest a feeding tube if he is fairly (of his own accord) malnourished. To that end, pointing out to my grandmother that a feeding tube might be necessary if she won't eat something healthy each day does help. It's not mean or a threat it's just a reminder of the reality of the situation. We've only had to remind her a few times but if there are memory issues you are dealing with it may have to be a frequent conversation. 

Aside from all of that, take a breath. You are doing all that you can do. It's extremely difficult taking care of an adult who has their own ideas about what is right/enough and add in any memory issues or extreme stubbornness and it can all feel impossible. Remind yourself- as much as you remind him to drink water and eat right- that you are doing the best you can and that is all you can do.

I use tricks to get them to drink more.  Jello with EmergenC in it is good. Apple sauce, variety of drinks, no one  drink plain water. Same with foods, my goal is to make food they eat healthier rather than feed them healthy food. Small servings that look good help. I have been taking a client to the senior center for low impact aerobics, bingo and lunch. The socialization is helping. 
Although to you the facts and reasoning are extremely valid talking to an elder oftentimes is like talking with a child, in my family the nurse that takes care of my father plays with him to make him drink water ""did you notice who finished that cup? i thought it was for me?! "" Maybe finding a ""fun"" way to get him to eat/drink could help you!
My Grandmother lost a ton of weight when she was in a nursing home and was actually diagnosed with anorexia. After I had her transferred to assisted living, I started buying her protein enhanced water and a special high calorie ice cream. The protein water is flavored, so she enjoys drinking it and she loves ice cream so she didn’t even notice that it was actually a nutritional supplement. She also takes a daily multivitamin to help meet her nutritional goals. She was able to gain 30 pounds in a year with these minor changes. Similarly, when my dad was going through chemotherapy, he often refused to eat or drink anything but strawberry milkshakes. Nutrition is important, but when someone is dangerously thin, getting them to eat or drink anything is better than nothing. 
""Food fights"" were among the most heated and frustrating when I provided caregiving for my father.  The first few years we were caring for him we were actively trying to keep him healthy and avoid suffering.  The stubborn insistence on dietary and fluid control made sense to me, his caregiver.  What was I doing if I just facilitated or tolerated insufficient or indulgent food & drink choices?  Caregiving is always an emotional roller coaster where regular rules don't apply.  A patient may be dealing with something they don't want to share with you...urinating may be getting increasingly difficult...so they choose not to hydrate.  They may find it humiliating and exhausting they are being micromanaged by their child.  This is a critical juncture where their remaining autonomy is important.  Yes, their choices may backfire on them and even cause you more work and suffering.  Perfection is the enemy of the good.  Don't aim too high.  Find accommodations where you can.   Bless you for caring so much, and for wading through the turbulent waters of caregiving for one's own parent.  Role reversal is one of the trickiest components of it.  I often used this thought to calm myself.  ""Would I be mad at a toddler for not eating their veggies and drinking their milk?""  No, just concerned.  I would also work to find creative ways to get the desired result.
Sometimes people with cognitive difficulties can't explain why they don't like something, so come up with ""other ways"" to say it.

Has his voice changed any?  More slurred, or softer or lower or raspy or mumbled?  He might be losing control of his throat muscles.  That affects speech but also how we swallow.  Could be he is slightly choking when he swallows water, so he tries to avoid it.  If you see any of those signs, take him to a speech therapist who can retrain those muscles to work together.

Is your Dad still able to use the toilet on his own?  Some people avoid drinking water if they're afraid they won't make it to the toilet in time.

He might just not be able to remember to drink water or eat the right foods.  But rather than admitting it, he says stuff like ""I thought we were done with that.""

Another possibility is that Parkinson's plays with the autonomic systems, so he might not be feeling thirsty or hungry, even if he is.

Talk to his doctor.  Maybe he needs a caregiver to come in and be with him while you're at work, to make sure he's getting nutrients.

Another thought--if he's topped up on meds before he eats, then he might eat more because he feels like it's easier to move.

Does he like soup?  That's an easy way to get veggies and water in at the same time.  Ensure tastes good and is water and protein together--another benefit is that it's very easy to drink so it doesn't take much energy.

Are you aware of the interactions between protein and l-dopa medications?

I hear ya. I've been a caregiver since 2005 and my pay has only gone up $.50 an hour. It's pathetic. I luckily don't have many hours with the agency anymore, but mostly have private clients. At this point, I'm not willing to work for that pay. I will just get a different job. I love helping people, but resigning myself to a lifetime of financial stress isn't a happy future.

,How to handle essentially being a confessional?,"Hello, my current client sometimes goes into detail about previous wrongdoings (especially marital in this case).

I just don't fully know what to do in this situation. It's a little strange sometimes because I think the client has different beliefs from me (he was raised Catholic, but I don't think he believes in God; I was raised Protestant and do). He'll sometimes somewhat joke about these things offhandedly as well -- my gut tells me as a defense mechanism to play off guilt.","I absolutely think it's not just a defense mechanism, but also his attempt to alleviate some of that guilt. To put it out there, see how you react, if his guilt/lack thereof is justified, if he should feel better/worse... Sometimes even just stating something out loud helps people feel better about what they've done - hearing it spoken let's them better analyze it in their own minds.

I'd suggest just remaining open to what they're saying - you're not there to pass judgement nor absolve them of sin; you can just be that open ear they need. It might be hard to listen to some of the things and not have it affect your opinion of them, and that's ok - just try and keep it from changing how you treat them.

(just a guess, not speaking from experience!) :)
You might want to suggest arranging for a priest to visit and see what your clients reaction is.  The client might benefit from unburdening themselves to a priest, and receiving forgiveness/absolution if they are very sick. Priests sit with the afflicted, listen, pray, and depending on how ill they are, offer the sacrament of the sick and/or absolution.
I would just be a friend. It does help to be a Christian and be able to direct your client to Jesus, but if you're not, at least you can say you get it and that everybody makes mistakes. If a client asked me to I would pray with them. I have done it before. ",2018-07-27 01:19:09,Starlorde007,929qv9

,Should I tell my brother about his mental handicap? How can I do it kindly?,"Hi there, I hope this is an okay question to ask here! If anyone knows of any other pertinent subreddits, I would be very interested in hearing about them if this one isn't the correct one to post this.

I **bolded** some lines for organization and there's a TLDR at the bottom.

**I'm a 22 year old woman who recently helped my 20-year-old, mentally disabled brother move in with me** and out of a semi-neglectful home with our aunt/second cousin. We have no parents and our aunt is not supportive and shows no interest in him, and my brother has turned down communication with her when offered. We live with another sibling and my fiancee, but due to work or other issues I'm the one who's been administrating things for him.  My brother has a mental handicap and is unable to function properly without help, and has an IQ of \~70. For example, he can't budget for himself, sometimes forgets certain hygienic tasks, and ignores illnesses because (I think) he's unsure of how to get help. **I do think that once I can help him get some training for living skills he may become more independent, but I'm not sure to what extent yet**. I'm okay with living with him for the rest of my life f need be, as he's very positive and kind. He's not violent and has no severe physical issues, so it's safe for him to live with us. He has AISH payments, so there's no worry about costs, thank god.

My issue is that I haven't had a real conversation with him where I've told him in concrete terms about his mental handicap and what that means about his life, and I don't know if anyone else in his life has done so either. I've said that **""some people need more help than others with certain things.""** I've told him everyone has different needs and given him examples of ways that I need help from others or ways that I take extra measures because I have issues such as forgetfulness. For example, I write a lot of notes for myself, which he also does. **I think he's self-aware of his differences,** He has told me he can't say what he means or talk well, and that he thinks he's not smart but that he thinks I'm very smart, etc. He's been bullied before and he was in special ed to completed strongly modified high school courses, and has been treated very differently from his siblings, including me, his entire life. He was often ignored to a degree while others were praised, and didn't recieve the same type of conversations about his grades and other things.

**I try to give my brother as much power over his own life as possible**, especially since it's been removed from him for so long. I ask him permission to call people on his behalf and tell him everything going on with things like his AISH account or doctors office. I never log into his bank account unless I ask him, and even then it's on his computer while he's in the room. I want to give him as much information as possible about everything so that he can make real decisions and live with as much dignity and respect as possible. He needs a lot of help right now, though. **I've asked my brother if it's okay if I apply to be his legal guardian so that I can help him make decisions, and have outlined other options** and asked him how he feels about it. He says it's okay and doesn't seem distressed about it, even though I've told him he wouldn't be an independent adult anymore and what that means legally in simple terms. This was difficult for me to explain to him, and I worry that I didn't do it honestly because I was so vague. Even in vague terms there were obvious implications that he's different from others, especially me. I'm not sure but it may be more obvious to him as well because as kids we were in the foster system and ""legal guardian"" was an oft-used term in our vocabulary, except we ALL had a guardian that was an older figure, and now it's only him who needs one and it's someone on more of a peer level to him. I was also praised as having the highest grades and being intelligent. It was my niche in all of our family groups so I think to him I became a paragon of intelligence.  (I'm not trying to brag. That praise actually really fucked me over later in life and my grades dropped when I was 14.) **He will also need a capacity assessment done by a psychologist who is legally obligated to tell him his abilities are being called into question and ensure he knows what this means legally.**  I don't know how the assessor will broach this. I also don't know if the assessor will confirm that he needs guardianship, but I strongly suspect he will from my research and from a past cognitive report. I would like to apply under the terms that he gets assessed again every two years, and work on his independence in the meantime.

**If he's already aware of the differences, then I worry that the way I speak about his differences to him makes it sound like it's a shameful secret.**

**There  have also been other points where I've had to dance around his diagnosis.** There was also a fair amount of drama of him coming to live with us, and at one point we thought my aunt had guardianship of him. My aunt told me she was putting him in a care home that also housed other mentally disabled people, but mostly seniors. I asked her if my brother knew, and she said she'd told him, but he said he didn't remember. I didnt want him to suddenly be foisted into a new environment without a kind explanation, so I talked to him about how it might be to live in a care home like that in as positive a way as possible. However, this is one of those things that I explained vaguely and in retrospect I don't think I did a good job of it and there were a lot of obvious implications he may have picked up on.

Today I was looking into advocacy groups that could help give him training for life skills so he can build his independence, but I don't know how to properly inform him about services or involve someone with his  condition without rudely ducking out of the room to make the call/talk with the other party. His goals are also to eventually get a job, and I would like to involve him in inclusive community events, but **the more people he gets involved with the higher the risk that he might hear about his diagnosis or specific issues from someone else.**

**I've been wondering whether telling him and having a conversation about it would help him see the ways that he's different from others, but also help him see how he's the same, and help him find people who have the same diagnoses as him**. In my experience, it seemed like a lot of people would dance around telling him anything, but many would talk about him like he wasn't there in a way that was critical or strongly suggested he was different than others. I don't want to treat him in the same vague manner. **I want to let him know what's going on so that he can understand himself better, understand why  it's not his fault, and also see that he can still have a normal life.** If I were to look up success stories to do with his condition, maybe he would be able to have a better sense of pride. And the farther he progresses, the more people he's going to be in contact with that will not understand him or that may be more direct about his diagnosis than me,.

**TLDR:** My mentally handicapped brother just started living with me. I don't think he's been told his diagnosis or how it may affect his life. I've been doing or helping with administrative tasks in his life and am applying to be his guardian. I'm doing my best to keep him informed of his affairs so he can make as many choices as possible, that I can then act out. The information I give him, the more I have to dance around telling him about his diagnosis concretely. I feel like I'm talking about his issues condescendingly and being dishonestly vague, especially since he likely knows he's different from others. I'm even considering whether telling him more about it would bring it out in the open in a more positive way.

**Should I tell him about his diagnosis? If so, how can I be as kind as possible while still remaining honest?**","Not really an answer but you could try emailing or calling a counselor at your local human service department and talking to them about what the best course of action is.

,dysphagia and my dad's Parkinson's,"Not sure the best sub for this; considered r/Parkinsons too but figured non-Parkinson's people might have dealt with this or similar things too since it can also be associated with Alz and other disorders. I've never posted here and I'm using a throwaway because my mom uses Reddit, sorry if this is against the grain of what this sub is for.

So, as stated in the title, my dad has pretty bad dysphagia due to PD. He was diagnosed more than fifteen years ago, when I was very young, and the disease has been progressing relatively slowly since then but with an acceleration in the past few years. He's mentally mostly all still there (he does have some personality changes but that's a separate issue maybe for a different post), very lucid and able to have an in-depth conversation with you. But he finds it extremely hard to swallow. He drools all the time now, and he chokes often while eating - never ""jump in and Heimlich him"" choking, but gagging and coughing and wheezing until he can manage to clear his own airway. It's always really scary when it happens. He's also lost a lot of weight in the past few years, and become extremely picky when it comes to food. He weighs less than me despite being a good 6 inches taller, and I'm definitely on the leaner side. The food pickiness, he says, is because whenever he chokes on a particular food, the memory of doing so renders that food unpleasant for him. But honestly the most concerning thing (yes, more concerning than frequent choking) is how phlegmy his voice always is. He's always got a frog in his throat and he always has to hack up a lung to talk clearly. I'm so scared he's going to develop aspiration pneumonia one day because of it.

His diet could definitely change. He already drinks a lot of his meals, so if he started adding a thickener that could help for a while. But he also has a lot of denial about his disease progression and he's a very strong-willed, often stubborn person. and worse than that, I've read up on the subject and for neurodegenerative diseases, measures like that are kind of temporary since the disease will progress and the issue will just get worse and worse. I know that eventually he'll probably need a tube. But I'm scared that he'll still be cognitively all there like he is now when that becomes necessary, given how bad his dysphagia has gotten. I'm scared he won't let himself have a tube placed because he wants to be independent and eat on his own. 

I also am not in a place to be making that decision - I'm 21 and other than occasional talks with my mom about his health I have very little input about his care. I don't want him to get pneumonia but it seems like it could happen so easily. Like I said, he's already underweight, he doesn't get much exercise at all - pneumonia could wreck him. But he doesn't seem to want to do anything about it and since he's still in possession of all or most of his mental faculties, no one can force him.

Other than advice on how to convince my mom and him that this is a serious issue that could have really serious consequences, and advice on how to deal with dysphagia, I'm not sure what I'm asking for specifically other than support/commiserating.

It's late at night and I might sleep before this gets any replies - if you reply and don't get a response, wait 7 hours or so.

TL;DR Dad has Parkinson's which causes him difficulty swallowing, and I'm scared he'll develop aspiration pneumonia which could be life-threatening for him. As his son (edit: *college-age son*) I have very little input on his care anyay and don't know how to deal with it.","It is tough. My Dad had some trouble with dysphagia, and it was so stressful. I'll tell you some things that worked for us, in case they help you, too: You could try fixing things that are naturally thicker, like smoothies and pureed soups. If he's drinking one of those nutritional shakes, you could put it in a blender with a banana or other fruit to thicken it up without drawing attention to the texture. I would also shake a tablespoon of oil into my Dad's shakes to give him a little more fat, and he didn't think it changed the taste much. I added a spoonful of oil to just about everything he ate to help him maintain his weight. Near the end of my Dad's life, I went to one of those athletic supplement stores, and they had powdered shake mix with much higher calories than the usual shakes, and pretty good nutrition. There are also a lot of cookbooks out there for people with swallowing disorders, and I bought stack of them from Amazon after searching ""swallowing disorder cookbook"".Good luck!
Is he willing to go to a speech therapist?  

They are trained to help him coordinate the muscles in mouth and throat so he will choke less.  They will also try him on different textures of food to find the best texture for him, so he will choke less.   It will also help him talk more loudly and clearly and with less effort, so he can have better, easier conversations.

Any speech therapist can help, but the best ones for Parkinson's have a certification called LSVT (or LSVT Loud).  That means they have specialized Parkinson's training.  https://lsvtglobal.secure.force.com/portal/LSVTFindClinicians
also, I considered posting this on r/caregiving but my dad is 55 and not what I would call a ""senior"" yet. my mom is only a year younger than him and still in the workforce. if it belongs there instead of here, I'll crosspost it.
Speech Therapist ASAP.   They will work with swallowing issues in addition to using a big voice. 

I take Sinemet with water, head down chin down. Swallow. You need a full glass of water to move the medication form the stomach into the small intestine to be absorbed. A sip of water doesn't do it.

Yes, you can get the powder to thicken water, so it is easier to drink. Way too easy to get dehydrated.
Example source:
https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/walgreens-thick-now-instant-food-thickener-powder/ID=prod6099707-product

I have to concentrate on how to drink fluids so I don't choke.

Pills that I can take with food, most comfortable to get them down using yogurt. 

Lots of good tips. Over here. Yes, I'm usually over at /r/Parkinsons I've been living with this for 35 years (yopd at 25). A speech therapist is fantastic. I've done great with stepping up my exercise after DBS.

,"America Is Running Out of Family Caregivers, Just When It Needs Them Most",,"America is also refusing to pay paid caregivers enough to stay on the job.

,Need some suggestions for outdoor activities.,"I am my cousins caregiver. He is 57 with spinabifida has no stomach muscles because of a botched lower g.i. The problem is he  has everything around his bed that he needs to keep him entertained. We got him an xbox 360 a few years ago and he doesn't have the facilities or muscle memory to use the controller to make it work. He in my opinion is about 10/12 mentally.  He watches nick and disney all day long. When he gets up the only thing he has at his disposal is a tv remote. So really getting up and into his wheelchair is pretty boring to him. His batteries on his wheelchair are bad and were waiting on a new chair for him because his is over 10 years old now. He used to go down to the park down the street and go fishing but lately his batteries wont last the trip so he doesn't even want to get up to do that.  


I want him to get outside doing something he enjoys. I was thinking about getting him a drone but i cant stand there with him and retrieve it every time he messes up and it lands in the neighbors yard because I'm also a caregiver for his mother who had a stroke about 4 months ago. Today i got him out and brought his coloring books out to him and he colored for a bit but im looking for suggestions for things he can do outside that im not familiar with.   


Any help or suggestion is appreciated. ","My heart goes out to you both! Gosh sounds very frustrating and somewhat similar to my situation. Although my patient can always be motivated by the promise of tasy food haha!   It sounds like you are going to have an uphill battle until the new chair arrives. And it also sounds like getting out and about in any way would be hugely beneficial. How long does the current battery last?Or is it a case of still trying to organize and fund one? 

We have really struggled with this in the past so I do have a few ideas... Are there any day centers for handicapped adults? We have a handful around here and they usually arrange a variety of outings that are handicap friendly. Even if you cant get him in to one of those places (round here they are fairly flexible and inexpensive) - you can check out their facebook/instagram and poach some outing ideas :) Search for autism adult day center and similar. Another goodie we recently discovered (if he is an animal lover) is to head down to the adoption days that animal shelters organize ... We call it free puppy therapy and really does wonders for the soul. Usually you can pet and cuddle the puppies and kittens without actually adopting one.  Also, could you get him excited about growing food? A little veggie patch in a raised planter can be super rewarding and has the added benefit of sweet sunshine and fresh air. If he has a competitive spirit you may be able to find Special Olympics related groups. .. maybe he has a talent for shotput or something? 

Whew that turned into a ramble! Hopefully there is something helpful to you in there. Is it just soul crushing when they arent motivated to get out of bed! ",2018-07-11 20:58:36,tornadojustice,8y58d3

,I'm going to be looking after my MIL with MS soon. I'm really nervous. Any tips?,"My MILs primary caregiver is her husband, but him, my fiancé, and SIL are all leaving for a couple of days. As far as I can gather, my MIL has started to sometimes use a wheelchair and has used a walker for as long as I've known her. 

I live about a 10 min drive away and of course agreed to help look after her. I am more than happy to do things like taking the rubbish out and some yard stuff etc but I'm more worried about things like what if she has a fall. 

My current plan is to go over in the morning, get some of the chores done that she can't do, be on call all day (and night), and then go back in the afternoon for their dog walking/dog park, and then maybe check up on her in the evening. 


I'm super nervous about this. I'm training to be a nurse but this is very different. Does anyone have any tips for looking after her? ","What sort of care does your fiancé, SIL, and FIL usually provide? I would get a detailed list from them and go from there.
Ask her what she needs. She is probably pretty used to being sick at this point and will have some idea both about what she needs about about how she likes it done.

I'm not sure if this is happening tomorrow or another day but if there's a few days you could ask her husband to write down a list of tasks that you might do, and important things for you to know.

You can also ask her directly what you should do in case she has a fall. She's probably had doctors speak to her about it - I'm disabled and when I got a bit wobblier I know I had about 10 different people try to train me in how to avoid falls and what to do if I did fall.

You might check in with her to see the most basic things when you go for the first time - can she get herself to the bathroom if needed? Can she get herself food and water? How often does she need you around during the day? How often do you think you need to be around in order to get done what she needs?

She may be hesitant to ask for help because she might be worried about imposing on you so it's great to both ask directly what she wants and look at what needs to be done and suggest an alternate plan. So like, if she says she's fine with you being around to help her get breakfast and dinner but you think she might stretch herself to get lunch, you could offer to her with that too. Just let her have the final say in things if she's able to communicate clearly. She might not want extra help you're offering. It's important to let people do as much as they're able to.

If falling is a risk, you might also just make sure that all the paths around the house are wide and clear for her. Throw rugs can be a problem, as can bags, boxes, books, anything left in the path - especially the path to the bathroom. Healthy people will step over or go through a narrow path without thinking but someone who has trouble with balance might need a little more space.

I think you'll be fine :).

Hope that's helpful!
I have 2 MS clients (I work as a caregiver for an in home agency) so I hope I can give you some ideas. You really need to know her preferences and limitations to give her the best care possible. Does she have a life alert button? This is very important. Also, I would say you can look up some YouTube videos about transferring people with MS and different ways to do it.  Ask her what she wants help with specifically.  The clients I currently care for have needs for help with cleaning themselves, dressing, toileting, showering, shaving, and making food and eating.  For a well-progressed disease, 2 to 3 separate times per day may be enough, unless she needs toileting more often. My main client gets care twice per day for 3 or 4 hours each time.  I make meals and snacks ahead so he can get them on his own when no caregiver is there.  I help with getting up from bed, transfers, and tioleting, as well as dressing. She will probably tell you what she needs. Do your best to keep good humor going and keep her active with something that doesn't use a lot of energy. Talk to her main caregivers to find out everything else you need to know.  ",2018-07-10 19:55:37,throwawayfrustrat,8xumsm

I regret the choice we made. It was a mistake. We are both childfree and honestly, it's like taking care of a child. His mind is mostly still there but his body is falling apart. I hate the doctor appointments. I hate hearing him fall and picking him up off the floor. I hate that he won't ask for help, even when I ask ""anything I can do for you?"" I hate his special diets that I have to build and that he whines about. I hate taking his cat to the vet and finding out that she is diabetic. Now I have to give this cat a shot twice per day. We miss our freedom. We miss the quiet of just the two of us in the house, without a sudden crash when he just drops things on the floor. He fights me on keeping his living area  semi-tidy. I'm tired of it. 

BUT - I voluntarily took on this role. I offered to care for him because he could no longer live on his own. If it weren't for me he wouldn't have moved two states away from where he'd lived for 15 years, that he'd gotten used to and established in. It's my responsibility, and no one else's, to keep him safe and healthy (as healthy as I possibly can). I hate the situation, but I committed to it so until he dies or decides that he's done with us, this is life. All we can do is roll with his attitudes, keep him comfortable, and hope that we can make it through this trying time I brought on us. 

tldr; a feeling of obligation. That's how I do it. Probably not the answer you're looking for, but I guess I had to word vomit. If this is offensive to anyone I'll take it down.
I’m a gay guy who finally got to marry my partner after being together for 40 years.  I got another five before he passed away in May.  The work was hard but I don’t regret a thing. You do it for those you love. No matter how bad things are for you, they’re worse for who you’re taking care of.
I just hope that the care I give to my residents is the kind of care I receive when I am in need.
I care for my mother who has alzheimers. It's extremely difficult at times. Heart breaking and emotionally taxing. I have to separate my myself from certain situations because if I don't I'll lose it completely. Humour is our saving grace here. I can generally turn a tense and confusing incident into something light hearted. She has a wicked sense of humour. She's currently stage 4/5. The ability to desensitise myself is both a blessing and a curse. I manage to 'get on with it' but boy am I an emotional wreck out of sight. This is one of the many reasons we need an occasional break. It's essential because our heart batteries especially, need to be recharged. 
I take care of my mother. It's become more of an obligation than anything else. I am clinically depressed, but I do it for my fiance and dog (honestly). I don't think about myself anymore, my needs have come secondary to those around me. My motivation is that someday in the future I might be happier, but I run on autopilot most days and don't do this out of any sense of heroism or anything. I just got stuck in a shitty situation, and when people say I'm ""selfless"" or ""a good person"" I can't help but think otherwise.
I have many memories of my Dad making sacrifices to take care of me, so I didn't hesitate to care for him when he needed it. He was a great role model for learning selfless behavior. Seeing my Dad's condition improve under my supervision was a huge motivator to keep working at it, and the better I ate/slept/took care of myself, the easier it was to focus on his needs.

,How do I support my mother who is providing care for her mother?,"My maternal grandmother is 90 years old and has always been in great health and until very recently was able to live on her own, about three hours from my parents' home. A few freak medical episodes later, she has moved into a care facility, which was agreed upon by my mother and my uncles and begrudgingly by my grandma. My uncles do not live close enough to visit regularly, but call her on the phone for chats. Before this all started my mom and grandma would talk on the phone every few days, but now my grandmother calls multiple times a day, and if she doesn't reach my mom then she'll call my dad or call me. My mother is at a stress level I have never seen before. I couldn't even begin to describe all that she has and is experiencing because of her new role, partly because I know she's doing what she can to shield it from me (early 20's). As caregivers yourselves, what can I do to provide care for my mom in this new phase of life?","So sorry that your family is going through this. The part to remember is how awful this must be for your grandmother and your mother. You sound like a very thoughtful and conscientious child!

I'll share a few things that might help ease the stress for all of you:

**Step 1:** Engage with the facility's social worker and activities director. Have them help your grandmother to get engaged in the amenities and activities.

**Step 2:** Ensure Grandma that she will not be abandoned. Everyone should a schedule for visits and phone calls and take the initiative to contact her at the scheduled time. Let her know that, beyond the scheduled calls, her additional calls will be returned, once, before bedtime. You can make that call and say ""Hi Grandma, Mom is too exhausted to talk, right now; so I'm checking in on you. I've got a couple of minutes before I have to clean up from dinner (etc.). How are you doing?""

**Step 3:** Clean house, do laundry, shop, cook, gas up the car, give your mom shoulder rubs. Take over and send your parents out on a date. You are old enough to not need shielded from this. In fact, it's a great growth opportunity! Step up and take off any load that you can.
Your family is lucky to have someone like you, with such a kind and caring heart. 

When my Mom was dying, the nearest family was thousands of miles away from us. One of my cousins sent a huge care package of gourmet frozen food. I was able to make what I wanted while the rest was frozen until I needed it. It was a godsend. 

Can you either make meals or pick something up, or send meals over for your Mom? Also, maybe pick up some errands or tasks for her. 

Can you fill in on visits with your grandma? It is awesome for you to pick up slack with phone calls. 

In my experience (and in the States due to HIPPA laws), staff won’t give non-signatories much info or feedback about anything having to do with a resident / patient. If you can visit, that would be the best. 

Also, why not just ask your Mom what she wants or needs? She would know best. Give her some of the suggestions you see here in the replies as examples. 

Again, your family is lucky to have you. Hang in there. 
I have a similar situation and the first thing we did as a family to deal with my grandpa's situation was a counseling session. He used to go to a senior center and they offered the resources for families with patients who had alzheimers/dementia, each family member had a session to understand what role we played in the equation and how  we could help each other in this new situation. 

More often than not what your mom may need is someone to vent to, but making sure everyone understands the reality of the patient through counseling changes everyones mindset. Everyone has to accept the new reality, everyone must learn what it means for their loved one and implement changes in their lives to deal with it. ",2018-07-08 20:24:54,onewordeightletters,8x685f
,How to get some help for my dad... where to go from here?,"**TL;DR:** Looking for advice on how to hire someone as a live in nurse (or cna) to care for dad. 


Hi all, been lurking in here for a few pages of posts, hope this is an appropriate place for this post. 

My dad (79)  was recently (mid May) diagnosed with stage IV metastatic  intestinal cancer that started in his colon. Since then he's been up and down, in and out of the hospital for 5 to 8 days at a time, then home for a week or 2, and back in the hospital. 

They want to start chemo asap, but this last trip was diagnosed as pneumonia, and that pushed his start back until at least  next week, and even then we know he'll get worse in the short term. 

In the mean time, he's got me as a care giver, and my wife, but we both have jobs and commitments that will take time to put on hold if we're to be his full time care givers, and frankly I'm not sure I'm even up to the task, at least not unassisted. 

About 10 years ago my dad built his dream home, and included in it a well appointed apartment with the goal of it being for a live in care taker. The issue is, how do we even start finding such a person?  Every nurse and doctor we spoke to is dismissive of the idea, they keep ""reminding"" us that Medicare won't pay for it. My dad's fortunate enough that he doesn't need to rely on Medicare or his private insurance to cover what would likely be a near to low 6 figure salary for the time he's got left, but no one really seems to understand that here. 

We did hire a service before his last hospital stay that provides a non medical home aide 24/7 but it was a never ending rotation of 2 to 3 people a day, several of whom just didn't really click with him. Also, as they don't have any medical training (not even CPR or first aid) they have a strict hands off policy where if he falls, or is having trouble getting out of bed, they're not allowed to assist, instead they call a family member or non emergency ambulance. 

We'd love to figure out how to hire someone who is a nurse, maybe someone who is still in school for more education, or just a skilled nurse who does private nursing. I think a CNA who could assist in falls and have a little more experience making medical observations to communicate to a doctor or nurse in an emergency would be great, and have an RN come by a day or 2 a week to check in. 

For now my wife and I are here this weekend and can put some of our work on hold for a week or so, but this is something we'd like to get help with, I'm already feeling overwhelmed and it's barely been a month of days outside of a hospital, and in the last week he's become worse mentally and physically I'm just worried it's going to be too much... 

Thank you all for your great community, I look forward to the advice you all have.","Hi! For the moment why don't you see if you can get respite care? That should give you a few weeks of care to allow you and your wife to take time to set up long term care. 

Agencies can be wonderful because they take care of the scheduling, background checks, taxes etc., but they also can be difficult because they often charge a lot, often underpay their aides, and I've sometimes found a culture where aides don't show up reliably, won't get off the phone and aren't willing to engage with me as a person.

If you don't need funding and don't want to go through an agency you can hire privately. This gives you much more control over who you get and what they do for your dad, but it's a lot more work to get someone in the door.

To advertise, you could look on [care.com](https://care.com) or advertise on craigslist. I'm disabled and hire caregivers privately (though it's funded through medicaid) and I get most of my caregivers on craigslist. You might also consider advertising in religious institutions, the grocery store, community center, and nursing schools. 

We do a 5 minute phone interview, a 45 minute live interview and then I call references. Then we have a probation period where they have to prove to me that they can do the tasks needed to care for me. It sounds like a lot but I've found that the more I say my needs and look for someone who can fill them, the more stable my care situation has gotten. 

If you decide to hire privately rather than go through a company your family may want to think about a few things:

* What kind of salary or wages can you offer? 
* If someone is 24 hour/live in care, what would their off hours be? Will you have something in place so that your father will be OK while they are off work? 
* If you need someone for more than 40 hours a week, would you consider splitting the job between several people?
* Will you offer the caregiver vacation time? Are you able to afford paying them for vacation time or will you offer it unpaid? 
* How will you handle it when the caregiver is sick or if they need to care for a sick child or an ailing family member? Will they be able to stay away from work that day and recover? Who will care for your dad during that time? Will you offer paid sick leave?
* If you're in the US, will you pay under the table or will you do it legally? As an employer of a domestic laborer you'll have to pay the ""nanny tax"" but places like [care.com](https://care.com) can help with that. It's just an extra cost to be aware of. 
* If there is a disciplinary issue (lateness, no-show, theft, not doing care tasks) who will handle this? 

Whether you go with an agency or private pay:

* What will your house rules be? Can they smoke indoors? Talk on their phone or text while they're with your dad? Are you OK with perfumes? Can they bring friends over if they're living there?

I hope this isn't too overwhelming amount of information. I'm happy to talk to you about my setup if you like and answer any questions you have. I don't have live-in care so there may be norms and expectations there that I'm not aware of but I can speak to a lot of the rest of it and hopefully others here will chime in as well.  

When I first got sick I remember everything being super overwhelming and feeling like I wished a handbook just came with illness and disability. Don't worry, it does get easier with time. 
Try sites such as care.com. I've gotten hired from that site and have worked with other excellent caregivers who also use it. We are independent, which means that you have to either pay via payroll or a 1099. However, you are in control of who you hire and are paying less than you would to an agency.

I recommend the background check and to check their references. Best of luck to you!

,Confabulation and how to deal with it,"Hello. 3 years ago my wife suffered a brain injury @ 36 years old due to lesions in her brain. She lost most her mobility, maybe a 1/3 - 1/2 of her long term memory, and her short term memory is almost non-existent. When she was in the hospital immediately after getting sick, she was saying lots of things that were not true. Accusing me of sleeping with the nurses, all sorts of weird stuff. Docs explained it as confabulation because so much of her memory is corrupted, her brain fabricating false memories to fill in the blanks. This quickly dialed way down as time went on, but still occurred on a small scale. Was never anything super important. Recently, however, she has been accusing me of some things. I was called a liar over some personal stuff we went through. Just the other day though, she accused me of trying to do something absolutely terrible. I am mortified. She is convinced of it. Kept trying to get me to ""remember"" and would not except anything I had to say. If I try to bring up confabulation she says that's ""convenient"". I have  no idea how to deal with this situation. I am hurt, but its obviously not her fault. I just can't be married to someone accusing me of these things. And no, there is no real expectation of improvement. Thank you for letting me share.","Let me start by saying, I cannot imagine what you're going through and I am so very sorry. My heart goes out to you. I did go through a form of this with my mother who died of cancer. When I had to make the decision to call in hospice, she accused me of giving up on her and said that I wanted her to die. When a beloved one, who you are doing your best for and striving to care for, thinks the worst of you, it's absolutely heart-shattering. It's not as easy as just reasoning those accusations away by blaming it on her condition, but I would remind myself over and over that she's still in there, the real her, her spirit, the one who knows the real me, sees and appreciates my efforts, and feels my love. I only had to endure that for a very short time before she passed, though. After she was gone, I saw a documentary on Netflix called ""Alive Inside"" about how music brought back memories and joy to people with dementia and brain injuries. You may want to check it out, because it was fascinating and the research shows that music therapy is able to help so many. If the two of you share a special song, hearing it may inspire new thoughts and good memories about you for her. I hope something works for her and you! Sending you love...
6 years ago my husband had a brain aneurysm.   I would recommend getting her to write down what she thinks and how she feels. If something is a wild accusation she needs to write down how she came to that conclusion. This really helps him.

,"My very disabled wife keeps trying to 'help' around the house but she falls, gets hurt, or gets confused in the middle of a task. How can I redirect her?","I've been my wife's caretaker for the last 15 years.  It wasn't this bad in the past of course but it's gotten worse and worse.  There are areas of her symptoms that have come and gone, but at this point the doctors are at a loss, we don't live anywhere near medical centers that might be able to figure out what is happening and her condition just keeps getting more unpredictable.  At this point, I'd characterize it as closing in on dementia or something along those lines.  She can barely walk, she's confused, absent-minded, and/or hallucinating most of the time.  But she insists on 'helping'.  Earlier she fell in the kitchen trying to clean some water that splashed on the floor when she was rinsing her bowl.  I'm so damn frustrated.  I know that she isn't doing this on purpose but I just want her to stay in her chair or in bed so I'm not picking up more mess and helping her with more pain.  I'm disabled myself and I've got no one to help me.  I just don't know.  Also, not even 40 yet.
","Has she had brain scans and things like that? 

I understand my husband is like this. Unfortunately there isn’t a lot you can do. You can’t physically control another adult. If you truly fear you are unable to prevent her from seriously injuring herself you need to tell her gp or adult protective services. Otherwise nature will take its course and do it for you. This is what home health and hospice social workers told me. It’s not pleasant but the reality. 
I am so sorry this really blows.
I'm so sorry for what you are going through. Perhaps it is time for placement in long term care?
If you want answers, you need to make a trip to a medical center and get those answers.  It could be anything from TIA effects, Lewy Body dementia, or Alzheimers. Many medications may be able to help her with symptoms, and you may need to change her diet and supplement regimen to get better results. If you truly care about her, please get her the medical care she deserves. If you need to move closer to a town where she can regularly get care, do it for her. I will also suggest that you get her a life alert button system and that you get the proper equipment to help her. If she needs a walker to keep her steady, get one.  If she needs orthotic shoes get them  if she needs meds, get them.  If she needs in home care when you can't be there with her, hire an agency to send you helpers when you need them. It is a long road but if you get the help you need for her, you can make her life better. ",2018-06-21 21:33:34,Annakha,8sxf7z

Thanks!","Is this a common issue for residents/staff in assisted living? My Grandma lives in an assisted living facility and anything not purchased by family members is simply added to the bill at a massive markup, (it’s in the lease I signed when she moved in) so as far as I’m aware, family members typically stay on top of that stuff to avoid paying $3 for a single roll of toilet paper or $12 to have a single load of clothing laundered. 

I have heard the concierge at the front desk make a courtesy call to a family member to notify them that their loved one was out of body wash, but I have all of my grandmother’s disposable supplies (magazines, depends, chux, denture tablets, snacks, toilet paper, paper towels, body wash, etc...) set up to auto deliver via amazon subscribe and save. 

I have heard stories of folks being dumped and left to fend for themselves in AL, but IMO if a lack of standard or typical supplies are a recurring issue, family members shouldn’t be surprised to see those items added to their monthly bill at a premium. It’s *assisted* living; Not a skilled nursing facility.

,Son living away from father with congestive heart failure,"Can you recommend a good app/tool/system for  helping a person with congestive heart failure monitor their symptoms on an ongoing basis and for a caregiver to monitor their progress?

For context: my father, 67, recently experienced heart failure that doctors say was brought on by [Takotsubo cardiomyopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takotsubo_cardiomyopathy) \(read: no blockages or cholesterol problems\).

His cardiologist instructed him to monitor his weight, fluid and sodium intake daily. He's done a great job of tracking so far, but he's using pen and paper which I fear he could lose. Using pen and paper also makes it difficult for his doctors, my family and I to monitor and support him in his efforts from afar.

This Sunday, I'll be leaving my dad \(he lives on the East Coast, U.S.\) to return to the West Coast \(U.S.\), where I  live . Before then, I'd like to make sure we have a dependable system in place and I figured someone here might have advice to offer.

Some more details about everything below, but if any more information would be helpful please please ask! Sorry this got so long...

I am looking for a tool that will:

1\) Help the \*\*patient\*\* \(my dad\) easily log their weight, sodium intake and fluid intake, daily

2\) Allow the \*\*caregiver\*\* \(me\) to monitor the patient's logs in real\-time

3\) Prominently display the \*\*patient's\*\* weight, fluid and sodium intakes in the app

Thus far, it seems diet and weight tracking apps are best suited to accommodate the workflows we're after. And of the  apps we've looked at, MyFitnessPal and LoseIt! are top for they both allow for weight, fluid and sodium intake logging. However, they  feel quite bloated and neither allow you to include fluids in your primary goal tracking dashboard among other things.

Edit: clarity and grammar","What about just setting up a shared Google spreadsheet? You can put a shortcut to it right on the screen of his phone (at least in Android - not sure about Apple?). You can do stuff with autoformatting to highlight cells where any particular figure is way high (or low) that would let you see in a glance if there's a problem.


Something else I'm really a fan of is Alexa devices - get a pair of Amazon Echo Spots, one for each of you. That allows you to ""drop in"" on him any time you want to check in on him. A lot of people are stressing about privacy and all that, and I get that - but for a caregiver that's not on-site, they are a godsend. Your dad doesn't have to do anything - you tell your Spot to drop in on him, and it automatically connects and you get a view of wherever you've got it set up. If you put it someplace central, he/you can even hear from pretty much anywhere nearby.

Hope that helps - good luck to you both!",2018-05-16 14:15:19,stussll,8jx691
,"So I've been at this for about 5 months now, and I could use some pointers.","I work in an assisted living that ranges from supervisory to hospice. I get along great with the residents and I love what I do, I just get so mentally exhausted all the time. I'm very sure this is something that I want to do, I just need to figure out how to switch off when I go home. I've tried the gym, yoga, video games, and quality time with the missus, but I feel myself operating on 10% less than the day before every time I go in. Any advice would be helpful. ","I think it is huge that you are noticing these changes in yourself- that is such an important skill to in a career that demands so much emotional and physical attention. Make sure that you are experiencing regular fatigue first, and not the initial signs of burnout. Check in with yourself and make sure you do not need some mental health time.

You may want to try some queues for yourself that snap you in and out of work modes, so you can keep your self care time separate and be fully present in both places. I've known people that put a lot of stock in physically changing clothes and telling themselves that they are stepping out of of work and into leisure time outfits to transition. Or giving yourself the ride to and from work to focus on getting in and out of the mindset, but promising to yourself that you do not take those thoughts outside of the car and into home. It can be really easy to carry the problems of the residents home with you, since you know the difficulties of what they are experiencing and have a passion for helping them, but you need to recognize in yourself how to help them in a sustainable way. You know that you can do more for them if you are able to take care of yourself, too!
When I taught I had a lot of trouble turning off my thoughts about my students because I cared about them so much. It sounds similar to what you talk about with thinking about your residents. I'll second u/kamerakase 's recommendation to change clothes. Anything that takes you out of the physical space of work. I personally also would generally take a 20 minutes nap \(or just close my eyes\) to create a little mental barrier between work and home. 

Learning to stop thinking about your resident after work doesn't mean you care about them any less. And from my perspective as someone disabled who has caregivers, my most successful employees are actually the people who are able to stop thinking about me on their off time. It's hard and is honestly not a skill I was ever very good at as a teacher. But I've watched a lot of my assistants \(caregivers\) go through this.  

Some other things that my assistants do to take good care of themselves:

* Exactly what you're doing. Be aware of when you're physically or mentally stressed out. What are the signs that you're starting to get there?
* Find little things that you can do throughout the day that are helpful for you as stress relievers. It sounds like you've been trying some good things there, like gym, yoga, video games, missus. Keep looking around and remember that they can be really really small.  One of my assistants writes in her journals for 2\-3 minutes during work. Another takes walks on her lunch. Another likes to talk to himself in the kitchen, little mini arguments if he needs. It's really personal for each person. I'm personally a huge fan of chocolate.
* Identify and lean on your support network. If you need to vent or let off steam, whether it's about a resident or a colleague or something at home, it's nice to be able to lean on someone \(or several someones\). This can be friends, family, colleagues, a therapist, or people from your religious community \(if that's your jam\). Just knowing who to turn to makes it easier to call up that friend and say, hey! Want to get together on Saturday?
*  Ask your colleagues for their tips! They probably have lots of ways that they approach it. 

My assistants all have an adjustment period of exactly this when they start working for me. It's really a skill to develop and it just takes some time to find your rhythm. 
i bet that because you’re in this field you probably have more than your fair share of compassion and empathy, but you need to be careful of being TOO empathetic and feeling TOO much.  Make sure you’re not just internalizing everything due to your personal ties or even potential personal ties to the situations you see.  it can be really intense at first, but you do have to accept a certain level of this-is-normal withOUT taking it to heart too much.  remember, the residents need people who are professional at their job, not just people who want to help.  reminding yourself to stay detached is probably one of the hardest things you can try to do but it’s also really helpful for the people you’re taking care of!",2018-05-11 23:57:57,WhirlyTwirlyMustache,8itmmw

,Podcast seeking true + interesting stories about caregiving,"CBC's award-winning podcast, Love Me, is looking for pitches! The show is all about the messiness of human connection and touches on relationships (not just romantic! any kind of interpersonal encounter or desire for connection). In particular, we're looking for stories about unconventional or interesting relationships between caregivers and carers. 
 
A Love Me story can be funny, adventurous, dark, sad, touching... as long as it explores the realm of our personal, emotional lives. And if your story is still unfolding at present, all the better! 
 
Stories we’ve featured in the past: a woman finds herself in a competitive love triangle with her fiance and a bonobo, a sea fungus crawls inside a young woman’s knee and she must learn to live with it, a widow comes to grieve her husband by dating her worst match, an ex-con talks about the characters who still haunt him from prison… These are just some examples. All participants will receive a modest honorarium.

Please fill out the form below if you have a story idea, or dm me if you know someone with a great story who might be interested. More info about the show and the sort of stories we're looking for on the form. Thanks!

,Is there something like state paid caregiving for anxiety anywhere in the US?,"I don't know if caregiver is too strong of a word. I need someone to be around to help me focus on tasks that I have mental blocks against doing due to childhood trauma. Something between a personal assistant, attendant, caregiver, manager, mother, wife, little voice. Unfortunately it often requires cooperation, so phone assistance isn't very effective. Yeah, I know, sounds very codependent. My current helper uses that word every day. I'm M/30 so it's extra awkward I guess.

...

In WA it looks like caregiver isn't the right fit. I feel like I've exhausted all of my options after over a decade. Therapy and home caregiving is not very available in the area I'm in, and I'm extremely willing to move to get proper treatment, but I have a poorly managed autoimmune disorder and possible ADD/OCD and a sleep disorder and major depression in addition to social anxiety, and I've never held a job, so I have to rely on the kindness of complete strangers for help. I have no real life friends or family who can help.

...

There's a real and valid need, and I know I have potential to work if I get help, at least that's what everyone (offline) tells me anyways. Problem is, I don't fit the criteria for a caregiver, and I need help just to make phone calls, the anxiety is that bad with talking to strangers. Plus, caregivers are mega expensive, and life coach and personal assistant goes on up the price scale from there.","You should try a Home Health Aid! I work as a certified caregiver and for some of my clients I help them with a wide range of things, not just the medical aspect! 
I hope you find what you’re looking for! I’m always here if you ever need to talk and I’m more than willing to help in anyway possible! ",2018-04-24 23:36:00,KLWiz1987,8eqkw2
,Local Caregiver Issue,"Hey everyone, I jumped into your sub-reddit to ask a question.

There is an elderly man on my street with advanced Alzheimer's.  The caregiver that is with him let's him wander the neighborhood while she stays at the door.  He goes around and knocks on peoples' doors looking for ""stray cats"".  He's wandered super far away quite a few times to where the police has had to bring him back.

My question is:  Does the caregiver have a duty to ensure the safety of the individual and others but not letting him wander outside of the home, even if she is watching from the door?  

I confronted her today about it, because as soon as I parked he came out of nowhere and started asking me about stray cats.  I live 3 houses down and on the other side of the street.  She just told me she doesn't have any duty to keep him in the house or the yard.

I would figure 3 houses away is a bit far for her to have to travel if he falls, or something happens to him.  Is this poor ethics on her part, or is she actually breaking rules that caregivers are to enforce?

I just don't want to see the guy get hit by some punk who's flying down the road at 45 mph.","Professional caregiver here. I know this was a couple weeks ago now but for future reference, if you see someone who is known to have Alzheimer's wandering the streets and their caregiver cannot also be seen near them, you can contact Adult Protective Services or even the local police station. If this happens again, give a full description of what the individual is wearing and state you are concerned for their safety. This person's caregiver should have been fired. 
Call APS. Is this person a paid caregiver?",2018-04-23 19:32:05,letsplayyatzee,8efzi6
,Is working at multiple caregiving agencies ok?,I’m not getting as much hours as I would like at my agency. Would working at multiple agencies pose a problem?,"Only to your own mental health. 
Some agencies do have rules about working for competitors- check your employee handbook. If they do, you will have to consider if you are okay with keeping your situation a secret from both agencies. You may be able to find a way around that, though, by finding another part time job at an assisted living facility or something similar. It would give you regular hours to schedule your current job around, too.
IF you are still looking for possible job offerings in the caregiving space-- be sure to give this site a visit [agnahomecare](https://agnahomecare.com). cheers
Thank you. I have another question. 

 one time a client that I was driving to grocery had a stinky jacket and when I turned on the AC while giving him the ride, thereafter every time I turn on the AC, the air coming from AC smells like him. 

So next time I had him I rolled down the rear windows  instead of turning on the AC, so it was a bit hot but he didn’t seem to mind. 

I don’t do him anymore but many day shifts require taking the clients to the groceries, and I was wondering if I roll down the rear windows instead of turning AC on at the cost of it being somewhat hot would be ok with most clients? I guess some people have their own cars, in which case it wouldn’t be a problem. 
It depends on your agency's rules about it, although if you have proven yourself, they may keep you on even if they have a rule against it. The only major problem could be schedules clashing. I know several caregivers who work for 2 agencies at once, in order to get enough hours per week. I personally do not, but it has always been a consideration. ",2018-04-20 04:11:35,caregiv,8dlzx9
,How do I get my mom to go to a doctor?,"I think my mother is seriously ill but she does not want to go to her doctor. She's lost a lot of weight in short period of time, hardly eats anymore blaming loss of appetite and changes in taste/structure and loss of strength. When I borrow her car I've noticed the handbrake is hardly engaged and she's called on me to disengage it after I put it back. 

I've already talked to her about it and during that conversation she said she had a doctor appointment this week. I tried soothing her a bit and gave her some advice on using greasier/wet food and force herself to eat more. She was dehydrated so I also told her to drink water at set intervals throughout the day and try and drink less wine (she's an alcoholic).

I looked up all my observations and the general consensus on acute weight loss plus loss of appetite and loss of strength is see a doctor asap.
She's an incredible stubborn and private woman and not addressing health issues has been a problem in the past, fe she refuses to go see a specialist for her crippling arthrosis.

I do not trust her to confide in her physician so I visited him behind her back. My plan was to describe all her symptoms and tell him she's an alcoholic in case he did not know. He surprised me by going over her history and last exam and told me her bloodwork results. She shown signs of diminished kidney function for a while and dropped to levels of kidney deficiency on her last blood test.

So now I'm more worried and when pressed today about her going to the doctor she basically trew my soothing advice back in my face as a motivation to tough it out a little longer. She lied about having an appointment this week and the kidney thing and I can't reveal I went behind her back and know about it because she's likely to drop a very good doctor over it, if not completely stop going to one. As I said she's REALLY sensitive about private issues.

It's clear to me she needs to get checked up asap but she won't listen to me. I could involve my 2 sisters but I'm afraid pressuring her will have the opposite effect. She so stubborn and allergic to advise...

If anyone has any tips or advice on how I can successfully coerce my irrational stubborn mother I could really use it at this point.","My husband had to go to court to get his mother to go to the doctor. It was not a pretty situation.
The only way I got my mother to go was to pretend the visit was for me. I realize my situation may not be reproducible in your case, but I hope you can figure your own version. 

I told her I was having problems and the doctor needed to see both of us to compare. The doctor was very helpful and got everyone in on it. 

Good luck--it's awful to face these issues. I feel for you and wish you all well.
Please do it soon. My mom was refusing for so long and I kept arguing about it over and over with her because I felt she was having issues. Turns out she was having mini strokes the whole time until she got to where she is now, which is unable to even say her name.

,Ideas for Caregiving 'Life Hacks'?,"Hi everyone, my wife has Huntington's Disease and I've been her caregiver for the past 10 years.  I'm giving a talk at this year's national HD conference on using technology to make caregiving a little bit easier.  

I'm planning on covering a bunch of things already and am curious if anyone has topics to share?  The talk is in June and will be recorded.  I'll share a link here when it's live!

Some of the things I'm talking about already

- Personal Wellbeing
   - Journaling / Meditation 
   - Documentation / Finances
- Smart Home Tech
   - tracking with cameras and sensors
   - hands free tools (lights, doors, etc)
   - Media
   - Virtual Assitants (Alexa, etc)
- Apps and Things
   - GPS Tracking
   - Working with Health Aids / Nurses
   - Video Chat","Not directly related to caregiving, but there are a lot of startups that are focusing on bringing care directly to the home in a technology connected way. It can be a huge help to get someone to come to you, rather than having to take someone you are caring for to an office.

Some examples:

* https://pager.com/
* https://www.joinhonor.com/
* https://www.carolhealth.com/
This sounds amazing! I'll be really interested to see the talk once you post it.
I'm coming at this from the other side - I'm someone who's sick and employs a team of caregivers that are in my house all day every day. Scheduling is a HUGE issue for us, especially if someone is sick and I'm not well enough to find subs, or if people are having trouble remembering their work schedule. We use ~~and~~ an app called *When I Work* for that but there are many comparable apps out there. We also rely heavily on checklists for regular daily tasks and even though we use paper ones, I could see that being easily done on a tablet as well.

Will you talk about any adaptive technology that enables communication from the person who's being cared for? I'm a very active part in dictating the care that I need and the way that I want to live my life and I think that it's so stressful to be a caregiver that sometimes it's hard for people to remember the wants of the person being cared for - we all get so wrapped up in the needs.

Here's a very small and simple example: I can't type on a phone very easily so being able to text doctors, email insurance companies and coordinate caregivers from my computer is key. If I'm not feeling well enough to talk I can type and show it to someone. There's a whole rabbit hole of adaptive technology as well that I'm not sure you want to go down, but I wonder if you might just bring into your talk ways that technology can be used to welcome the person being cared for into the process of caregiving

,I Gave Her Too Much Leeway,"I've been a paid caregiver for a woman for 9 years. She's the sweetest person. When I first met her she was taking care of her husband who had Alzheimer's. She's had a very sharp memory for most of the time I've known her. The last year or so, I've noticed that her memory has not been as good. She used to be fastidious about her medications. But over recent months, not so much. I would question her about it, and she would blow it off. I assumed she was CHOOSING not to take her meds on those days. I urged, but didn't force the issue.

She was recently in the hospital for the flu. She got out and now has a bunch of visiting nurses are coming in to make assessments. Their questions are making me realize: I should've notified her daughter that she was missing doses at times!! Oh lord. I screwed up. I don't know if I've been in denial or what. Or if I don't want to take away her control by ""making"" her take her meds. But I've been thinking about this for hours and my stomach is hurting from the anxiety. 

What do you guys think? I love this woman and I think I neglected her needs.","You clearly care for this woman, which makes professionally providing care both much easier and much harder to deal with. Take this as a lesson for moving forward and make sure to notify her daughter in the future about changes, but don't beat yourself up about what has already happened. You respected your client's autonomy and dignity, and did what you could to make sure she still felt in charge of her own life in spite of her decline, which is the best thing you can provide as a caregiver.",2018-03-31 03:07:08,Tbird1725,88h2n7

But I get enough bites that it's been worth it for me to keep up the membership. 

I'd say give it a try. It's definitely worth a shot, That being slice, whatever your method of advertising, make sure you screen the person before you hire them. Even if you don't want to be as intensive as I am, set a time to talk with them on the phone and see if they show up at that time. Don't be scared to ask for references and call them.

,Former caregiver suffering from anxiety and possible PTSD. Any tips for getting by? :(,"Cancer runs in my family... I've grown up around sick people and been a caregiver at various points in my life. All three lost their fights.

I'm only 28 years old but I've developed anxiety as a result and struggle being in medical settings. I have incredibly negative and catastrophic thoughts during routine tests. Overall I'd say I've developed a habit of assuming the worse case scenario and am pessimistic in life.

The worst is that my blood pressure and heart rate go up like clockwork just sitting in a doctors office. Bloodwork and imaging scans cause me immense stress. I had to get an IV recently and broke down crying thinking of my cousins PIC line and chemo treatments.

I dont wan't to live like this and be hopeful and happy again. I am in therapy and working through a grief recovery program.

Negative/catastrophic thoughts - especially given three experiences of loss - aren't surprising, nor are they unusual. I wish I had advice or suggestions on how to make it better, but all I can say is that it is good you're doing therapy and reiterate that we're here for you. 

And as long as I'm wishing things for you, I wish that you have some awesome experiences soon that overshadow your dark thoughts. I know it's hard when you've been surrounded by the darkness for so long, but remember: were it not for the depths of grief, how then could we measure the heights of joy? When you do experience the good - and you WILL experience it, it will happen - it will be so much sweeter and so much more appreciated by you because of what you've endured.

All of those terrible things that happened: nothing is ever going to make them better nor easier to bear. But I'm sure none of those three loved ones would want you focusing on the negatives; they'd want you to look for better times, to savor every moment you can... and yeah, I know... easier said than done. But keep your head down, do the job in front of you, and get through moment by moment.

I hope you are well. My sincerest apologies if research projects are not welcome here, but I would like to tell you about a study we are conducting at the University of Newcastle:

You are invited to participate in the research project identified above, which is being conducted by a team of researchers led by Professor Billie Bonevski from the Faculty of Health and Medicine at the University of Newcastle. This project has been approved by the University’s Human Research Ethics Committee, Approval No. H-2017-0312.

My name is Alexandra Denham <https://www.newcastle.edu.au/profile/alexandra-denham>. I am a PhD student at the University of Newcastle (AU) who is leading the study, “Caring for those who care: A global survey of the health behaviours and health-related needs of informal caregivers.” 

This study aims to investigate the prevalence of health risk behaviours and unmet needs of informal caregivers of a person with a health concern requiring in-home care by conducting a global online survey of caregivers. The caregiver groups that we are interested in include, but are not limited to: (1) Alcohol and other drug issues; (2) Alzheimer’s, or other dementia; (3) Cancer; (4) Mental/emotional illness; (5) Mobility/physical disability; (6) Stroke; and (7) Surgery/wounds. However, caregivers will have the opportunity to specify another group if they feel that they care for someone with a different health concern. The survey will be conducted in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. 

With this information, we will be able to develop helpful tools and resources to support caregivers in achieving healthier lifestyles, and address their unmet needs. This will also be the first study

Our survey is now available online from the 16th of March 2018 to the 14th of June 2018.

,Help with my grandmother,"My grandmother has some form of dementia. She is also legally blind. She is only 67 years old about to turn 68. Long story short, she is not eligible for Medicaid right now and therefor we cannot afford nursing home care or in home health care or adult day care. I am only 25 and have been caring for her for three going on four years.  She is wrecking my life. I know that is probably a selfish thing to say but I cannot have anything materialistic, I can’t have friends over, I can’t go on vacations, and she is a huge stressor on any relationship that I try to have. She gets into everything. I can’t afford to not work, so I have a full time job and she is usually left alone while I am at work. Between when I am sleeping and when I am at work, she causes chaos. I can’t let her have toilet paper or access to paper towels or any kind of cloth because she will cram it in the toilet and flush until I overflows down the hall. She gets into any food or drinks in the house and can not determine when she has had enough. She will eat an entire pizza in a sitting or drink a twelve pack of sodas in a day. I have to hide all food. Sometimes she gets into things that aren’t food. She used my cross stitch dolly as toilet paper and flushed it, she tried to drink cooking oil and poured it all over the floor, she ate a lavender scented exfoliating foot sponge. I have put a lock on my fridge but she still searches the cabinets and pantry. She goes through my bags, lunchboxes, and bedroom.  She will drink my coffee off the coffee table in the time it takes me to go to the bathroom. She has started getting aggressive too, threatening to bite people if they take something away from her, threatening to leave if she doesn’t get her way. I am at my wits end.  I have no idea what to do with her or how to make my quality of life better. I want to be able to come home and relax instead of dealing with messes and catastrophe every day. It is really weighing on my mental health. Does anyone have any ideas of how I can keep her from getting into things or what I can do about her aggression? ","You absolutely aren't a terrible person, you are a wonderful person for helping your grandma.  Everything you are feeling right now is normal and understandable.  I will help you figure out the right people to contact so you can get some help taking care of your grandma.

To start out with--has your grandma been to her family doctor to get diagnosed with dementia?

What city are you in?  Or what large city is nearest to you?  PM that info to me if it makes you more comfortable.

What happened when you called the Council on Aging, etc?  


I found some possible resources for you:

You said you already called Area Agency on Aging.  Did you just call a state-wide phone number?

There are something like 15 different Area Agencies on Aging in North Carolina.  Check out this map to see which area you live in so you can call the district you live in.

https://www.ncdhhs.gov/assistance/adult-services/area-agencies-on-aging

Ok, now that you see the map, forget clicking on the pins like they suggest.  Instead, click on the link that says: Area Agencies on Aging Staff Rosters.

That will download a file in a Word document.  Figure out what region you are in, and look for people who have titles like: Project C.A.R.E Family Consultant, or Family Caregiver support specialist, or Human Services Planner, or Aging Specialist. 

Call up one of those people and tell them:

Your grandma is blind and has dementia.  You (25) are her only caregiver, but since you have to work, your grandma is home alone for 8 hours a day.

Here are the reasons it isn't safe for her to be alone: she doesn't use the toilet, she doesn't recognize what is safe food to eat, she's starting to get aggressive (biting people).  (The list that you gave us, showing that she doesn't recognize what items are used for anymore).

You need help taking care of her, but you've been told she has too much money to get Medicaid---but she doesn't have enough money that you can afford to pay someone to come in and take care of her.  None of her other family members will help take care of her.

Also point out that the doctor wants her to go see a specialist, but you can't take time off work to get her to a specialist.

You need someone to explain to you what care options are available for your grandma in your town.  (A caregiver, adult day care, or a nursing home).

You need someone to explain to you how your grandma can apply for medicaid.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't know the exact rules for Medicaid in North Carolina, but generally a person can't own stuff worth more than $2000 (can't have more than $2000 in assets).  

If your grandma has more than $2000 in assets (which I am guessing is the case because they said she wasn't eligible for Medicaid), you (or whoever is in charge of her money) can do a ""Medicaid spend down.""  This is where you spend money on a caregiver or something until she has less than $2000 in assets.
--------------------------------------------------------

Medicaid also depends on how much money your grandma makes a month (like from a pension or from social security or from investments).  When you talked to all those agencies, did they ask how much money your grandma made a month? 

**Even if you and your grandma live together, you count as separate households.  So if you told them how much money you make, in addition to her social security, that could make her have too much money to be eligible for Medicaid.  So make sure they know there's a difference between how much you make at your job and how much she gets a month. 

---------------------------------------------------------
It looks like you need to talk to a social worker at NC Division of Social Services to apply for Medicaid.   Each county has its own branch.  Use this map to find out who to call for your county.  

https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/dss/local-county-social-services-offices

Explain to them the same things I said above--grandma's health conditions, age and that she needs some sort of help.  Ask how to apply for Medicaid, see if that spend down applies to her situation.

You can also apply online for Medicaid, though I recommend that you call up NC DSS and ask for a social worker, just because there will probably be a lot of questions on the application you don't know how to answer--better to ask and make sure!  

Here's where you apply online--check it out so you can see what types of financial paperwork the social worker will ask you for.

,Hopeless,"Been my wife's caregiver for about 15 years now.    That's 3/4 of our marriage.  The last few months the meds she is on for her pain and seizures have made her become increasingly delirious with constant visual and audio hallucinations.   At the end of my rope.  Trying to take care of our house and kids and her while going to school full-time.  These are all things that have to be done and I can't do it.  We have no friends near us.  She's my best friend, my only friend, and I haven't been able to talk to her in months.  I'm so lost and heartbroken and tired and just fucking hopeless.","First, you are an amazing person for handling so many difficult times and navigating life to support both your wife and your children. Never lose sight of what that must mean to them.

If you are really losing hope, then find someone you can reach out to. Explain your situation to your wife's doctor and discuss what other options may be available- seek a second opinion if that may help. I don't know where you live, but there may be options for in-home assistance from volunteer workers, or some short-term help that will give you respite and time to reflect on how to push through it. You have done so much for the woman you love, and I am sure you know how much she would appreciate all you have done and understand if you needed a moment to take care of yourself, too.
I am so sorry that this is happening. It sounds like you are just overwhelmed. 

Is your wife on medicaid? Do you have any kind of caseworker? They may be able to find you respite assistance, to get someone to come in and help you out a bit. Have you contacted your state's assistance agency?


No advice.... just *big internet hugs*
I wonder if medical marijuana would help with her pain and seizures?  
Lots of internet love for you.  Being epileptic I can kind of understand parts of your situation quite well.  I'm a part-time caregiver for my Papa, but I have my own issues as well.  I'm lucky enough to be supported by my best friend/fiance when I'm at home and he, like you, helps me when the seizures or pain get bad.  It means so much to just know someone is there and cares for you when you're going through seizures and the resulting confusion.  


It sounds as though she's had a recent med change, was she doing any better before?  I've had med changes that left me unable to function until a good Neuro finally found something workable for me.  I still have seizures, but not as frequently, and I'm able to function independently (outside of driving or bathing unless he's home due to drowning risks).  From the sound of your post though, her seizures are probably more of a problem than mine are.


I personally want to thank you for being there for her.  I appreciate the hell out of my SO for all of the things he goes through for my sake.  As a fellow caregiver, I know how hard it is to have any sort of a life outside of that.  You can't make plans, you have to live for the next crisis, you want to escape and then feel guilty because you love the people that are in your life that are making it so hard to live.  Don't give up.  You have your children, you have your wife - even if it doesn't feel like it right now, you are doing your best to do right by your family and that's enough.  I'm proud of you for everything you are doing.  I hope that you see some progress and that you do well in school. 


Perhaps if it wouldn't be an intrusion, I know having other people in the house can sometimes make things worse, you could contact a church or school that could send someone in once in a while to help with the housework or yard work.  Sometimes they have kids who need to put in hours of community service not for crime related issues, but to provide them experience in being a part of a community.  Having that extra hour or two can really make a difference when you're scrambling around trying not to lose your mind.  My mother had a neighbor who needed some community service hours for their grandson at church so he did yard work for her for a couple of weekends.  All of the local High Schools require community service for graduation now where I live.  This is why I brought this up.


Once again, thank you for doing what you do.  I'm sorry about how bad you're feeling, I hope something happens that changes your life for the better soon.  Giant internet hugs.
What everyone has already said. I know it's a nightmare thing to consider, but have you thought about nursing care for your wife? It's terrible, but sometimes it can be the only option. My wife went into the nursing home before she was 40. It was horrible - but the place is fantastic, they take great care of her, and she thrives there. No, it's not perfect and I feel like part of me is missing - but I don't have to worry about her, and I see her several times a week and we go on trips when we can (sometimes just to stay overnight at a pet-friendly hotel so we can share time with the pup!).

As such, he can't really lay down to sleep and for the last year or two has been sleeping in a reclining chair. 

I'm thinking that there has to be a better way. Perhaps some motorized or adjustable bed? Like a hospital bed? I just know he can't lay flat or he'll be up all night with coughing fits. My grandma sleeps in the spare bed room since that bed is lower to the ground so the bed in the master bed room hasn't really been used in awhile. Thinking I could replace it, but where to look?

Medicare and/or Medicaid will provide for a hospital bed. But while your navigating that nonsense (it took forever for us to get approved), you can also check your local VFWs or American Legions - many of them have ""hospital rooms"" where they donate hospital equipment for free to the community.

Hmmm.... I have seen people use the option that you have suggested. However, you still may need several layers to still protect the fabric. 
If the chair you're purchasing has a removable seat cushion, you could wrap/cover the foam insert with a sheet of plastic and then apply the fabric cover to that. This way the foam stays clean and will not smell.
If the cushion doesn't come out, then several layers of protection. An amazon search for ""washable incontinence chair protectors"" may be beneficial.

,best way to help lift a leg disabled person off the floor after a fall?,"Hello,
My mother in law has multiple sclerosis that affects both her legs.
She fall on her back today, bending her knees..
Me and my wifes brother managed to help her go to the bed eventually but I assume we could have done a better job in helping her to get to the bed.
Since her legs are weak, getting her to stand up after a fall is not an option.

I would like to hear some tips or maybe if someone has some video instructions it will be appreciated  ","Do you want to lift her or have a sling and a hoyer lift might be a better way. I work in a group home for the disabled most of my clients can walk but those that have difficulties we use gait belts and slings + hoyer lifts. Rarely do we do manual floor lifts unless we’re training or doing a fire drill. Which we do blanket drags but this could be use to as lift someone into a bed. 
Here is a video that may help.  I work in a group home,  and you are absolutely smart to find out about proper lifting. You'll be safer, and so will your mom in law.

A lot of fire departments have a ""lift assist"" service.  You can call the non-emergency number of your local FD and find out if they offer it and how you would get help when she falls down.

I use a gait belt and put the person on a low step stool by lifting from the back and pulling. Next, I position a wheelchair or sturdy chair beside the client, arrange their legs so that the feet are flat on the floor and the knees bent, I ask them for help, and I lift or jerk the gait belt and get them into the chair.

,"2 years as a caregiver, starting a business to support caregivers - what are your biggest problems?","Hey everyone,
My name is Morgan and I'm the founder of a startup called Supports Health. After caring for my family member with severe depression and anxiety for 2 years, and burning myself out in the process, I decided to do something about it. I'm building out a business to give caregivers of loved ones with mental illness the information, tools, and access to counselling that they need. I have a good idea for a base, but want to learn more.

SIMPLE QUESTION: What is your biggest problem as a caregiver, or what do you want most in terms of support?","Hello! I thought I'd comment on this seeing as I've been a caregiver for the last 8 years now.

Now, I can't speak for others as their issues may very well be different from mine, but the two biggest I've noticed are the general lack of appreciation and dealing with burn out.

While being appreciated for my services, it's usually all the negativity that's brought up far more often.

As for the burn out, I'm currently the only graveyard since our other staff quit and haven't had a proper day off since Christmas.
I think the biggest problems I have seen are other caregivers not having compassion or caring. And over working themselves because they can work more shifts. I have seen people work a day shift at one home and a night shift at a different home and just sleep a little bit during the night. So they are neglecting their residents during the night and they are too tired for their resident during the day. Turns into a nasty cycle. 
I've been a partial caregiver (along with my parents) for my great aunt for the past 3ish years. She is about to turn 95, and has vascular dementia. She moved in with us after having a stroke while on a vacation with my mother, after which she was in rehab, and then my mother felt it necessary for her to move in with us rather than return to the studio apartment in which she'd previously lived alone since the 60s.

My biggest problem might be that I don't know, based on my great aunt's behaviors, how bad her dementia is, at what point it is too much for us to reasonably handle, and how to handle her affairs when we hit that point. Things have gotten worse -- she doesn't pay her bills, she loses her checkbook, she's frequently confused and frustrated, she needs all meals prepared and requires transportation to all appointments (and communication on her behalf with her medical team), she suffers from incontinence, etc., etc. She can occasionally hold a very coherent conversation, which makes us think she's somewhat capable, and then we'll find her hoarding used diapers in her bathroom, sneaking into the kitchen to boil water (and using the stove incorrectly), or acting in other ways that are at best nonsensical and at worst, dangerous.

My parents and I want to do as much as we can for her, but we realize she needs more support than we can provide. However, we're trying as much as possible to respect her agency and wishes, so we don't want to force her to move to assisted living unless she wants it too. But then the question becomes, how much does she understand, and how capable is she of making meaningful informed decisions?

An additional complicating factor is that my mother's side of the family is Japanese, and there are cultural issues there, the two most relevant being:
1) indirect communication and the fact that it's considered rude to make direct statements or ask blunt questions
2) adult children are expected to provide care for their elders indefinitely

For me, I feel it would be helpful to have someone (a social worker or some other mental health professional) to consult with about the situation, an outside perspective, who could hear about our experience is and advise us on how to handle this, incorporating aspects of empathy/compassion, understanding of various legal issues, and knowledge of her particular condition and what she is capable of mentally at the stage of her dementia she's in. We would want to include my great aunt as much as possible in the decision-making, but ultimately we know it may be too late for her to participate meaningfully in the decision, because she believes she is capable of living independently, and we know for a fact that that is no longer an option.

We're all super burned out and doing our best, but it's been a struggle. My grandfather on my father's side did not get as much attention from us as we would have liked on account of our having to handle my great aunt's day-to-day needs (he'd been ill since September), and he passed away two weeks ago. We're grieving for him, and we simply don't have the time, energy, or resources to handle those feelings, plus caregiving, plus our regular lives, all at once. I know that people recommend caregiver support groups, and I'd like to attend one, but with all of us working different schedules, caring for my great aunt, and other obligations (I'm attending school full-time), it's just not feasible. (I do have a therapist, who has been a big help, but I see her only sporadically.)

This may have been a higher venting:answer ratio than you were looking for, but I only just discovered this sub and am very glad it exists. Thank you for the work you do.
Access to therapy and education for caregivers and the impact caregiving has on children and young adults. Care/resources for transitioning into life post-caregiving.

As a kid my parents stepped in to help various family with cancer treatment and palliative care. My sibling and I were asked to be strong and nice at home to help. Sometimes our needs went unnoticed or were minimized because my other relatives had ""real problems"".

Overtime I developed my own issues and hid them from my parents until I couldnt do it anymore. Seeing my mom cry about ""neglecting"" her kids for other family was awful.

We are ok now, everyone was doing their best, but I wish we had some information or resources to check in and support eachother during those times.
My biggest issue is dealing with verbally abusive
 clients & families. Manners go a long way(hearing please & thank you, I’d like a gift to a caregiver, it’s very rare, we get criticized so badly if we aren’t perfect & reading minds) , basic home training on how to treat a person goes a long way ….

,Looking for advice. Mental health and financially incapable parent.,"My mother (70+) has never been the most mentally stable person her entire life.  Without getting into details, I myself don't even know or can't explain.  She visibly suffers from a need to do ""everything"" herself.  Ie; no one can do right except for her, OCD tendencies, and unaccepting of mistakes of her Husband (not my dad) makes.  Professed she can no longer take ""care"" of him and it's driving her ""batty"".  She is financially dependant on him other than a supposedly $1500 a month social security (details I have not confirmed).  I know she goes to a psychiatrist and is heavily medicated as well.  But honestly, she either doesn't take them, it's a terrible psych or after years of medicating she's immune... o_0

A recent event of her Husband hurting himself (in her mind due to him not listening to her) has prompted fears of financial difficulties.  Putting all this to a head that she wants to leave him as she can't ""take it anymore"".  Irrationally tho, she wants to control how he heals even tho she also wants to leave him, so as he'll be ok but she'll be screwed as far as the logic I can gather.

She has 3 siblings, although she's close, I think most personally realize her mental tendencies tend to conflict with the norm.  Then there is myself and my brother. Neither of us at 30+ can financially support her let alone assist.  Our Dad, although currently ""stable"" in his life.  He has a rocky situation that can teter all the time.  Also, not being able to support himself at a similar social security wage.  

Our parents have gone their own ways and raised my brother and I well enough we where can support ourselves.  My brother's (older) catching up to me!  But both parents as mentioned will sooner rather than later I fear need our ""care"".

On another note, my mom's parent(s) at least one committed suicide.  She has very carelessly used the term of offing herself (whether it be by weapon or medication).  I wouldn't say I fear for her life, because it's said so much it's almost like the boy who cried wolf at times.  But given the history and her continued visible mental health deteriorating, it is a concern as of recently uses in statements.  When her husband is working she is at home alone moreso than not and lives away from relatives due to other situations.  So we don't have the personal touch except by phone with holidays and random occurrences.  As far as her Husband's care for her, I know he cares but a lot right now I get the impression he's along for the ride due to her mental state of how she perceives her current situation and the uncertainty this recent injury has caused. Belittling him and grinding him down where she's not the woman he once knew. For example she's got the flu right now but supposedly she won't let him care for her because he can't do it right.

Both single, myself and my brother's living arrangements make things difficult in one way or another.  I have renters, he has kids.  He's accepting off the bat of her but she ignores this for her irrational reasons ""cant fit her pots and pans, etc"".  As mentioned we barely support ourselves.

My question for advice is, how do I deal with my mom's mental instability and what options do we have under senior living arrangements living with social security and no retirement. Is this even capable?  If she's mentally not accepting of giving up her independence in how see she's fit with fear she may take her life?  How do we deal with this?  She has a pet, a tiny dog, that soon with the rest of the doom and gloom she spots ""have to be put down"" because no care excepts pets which as typical with her is a falsehood.  My brother and I don't know what to do, we've tried to be supportive but she's a very negative person in any situation.  Just believes nothing will work out.  

I can go on and on but I hope I got a gist of the current situation, my fears, and questions.  I've spoken with her Husband and he believes it will work out regardless of how serious the injury is but he can't stop her from leaving him obviously.  He seems rational enough but I don't know him THAT well.  But he can be at times stubborn and throw his hands up to just walk away.

And last note, supposedly she can't work due to physically unable to in her words such as unable to use her hands well, cant drive at night or see certain things etc.  Don't know the fact fullness of it.  She can be quite clumsy, she rushes a lot and makes amany mistakes that she's hurt herself by accident before.  Doesn't stop to smell the roses persay...

She cries or gets irrationally upset and brings up the better off dead more often than not and I just don't know how to help.  I've been googling but I haven't found things that seemingly give me some insight, so I thought I'd ask.

Very likely she's depressed as well.","Came here looking for a few pointers on how to handle my elderly mom who's difficult and negative and probably needs more care than any of us can afford to provide for her. Even though she can be a royal pita, she's still my mom. She's got about three weeks left on a 20-day wound-care nursing home visa (don't know its official name), doesn't qualify for Medicaid, and doesn't have a lot other than SSI and a small pension. We found a person with a home health care background who can stay with her most days. Other than that, I don't know what we're going to do. Just here for moral support, to let you know you aren't alone. Noticed no one else had responded yet. Take care of yourself and see if you can get your mom to ix-nay on the suicide talk, that can't be good to hear. Here's how I've managed to curb mom's negativity: I make some excuse and leave, right away. She seems to have noticed that when she stays positive, I stay...longer. hth",2018-01-07 00:24:18,Klownicle,7oosu5
,Grandma with dementia.,"I recently just moved cross country to take care of my Grandma in Florida.  I have never been a caregiver and I was here initially to get a job and help her sometimes.  But being with her the past month has shown me that she may perhaps need me to be a full-time caregiver.

I have NO idea where to start.  I have tried looking into elderly affairs but ANY advice would be helpful.  ","I moved my granny in with me to help her when my family suspected that she has Alzheimer's (her current diagnosis is ""mild cognitive impairment"") and reading *The 36-Hour Day* was a great starting point to help me to understand her mindset and to prevent/reduce meltdowns when she gets confused or overwhelmed. 


**Some things that work for us:**  Find out if she has a nurse advocate through her doctor or health insurance, and don't be afraid to ask any and all questions at her doctor's/specialists' appointments. Establish a routine that disrupts her current routine as little as possible, invest in a pillminder (we have a Sun-Sat AM/PM pillminder) if she takes medications, get a shower seat if she is concerned about falling in the tub, consider buying or making a calendar that she can see (and that you can mark) and easily access to help her track time/dates and appointments (I keep a cheap magnetic dry erase calendar on the refrigerator), and learn what foods she can/can't and will/won't eat in case she can't go with you to the grocery store.



That's all I can think of right now. Remember to make time for yourself, build a support group, and get out of the house when you can (even if it's for a short walk around the block) ☺
Before you do anything, make sure that you have durable power of attorney and  that she has a living will. It's important to get these before she is deemed incompetent. The Alzheimer's association is a great resource for these forms and general information about her condition.

If she is sundowning and getting violent, you will probably find that a memory care unit is the safest place for her. It's good to take tours of your local options and have a place picked out, in advance. The good ones will often have a waiting list. 

In the meantime, you can look to a homehealth agency, or an independent caregiver site (such as care.com) to hire some help. 

If you don't mind sharing a more specific location, I may have more info on local resources. If she cannot afford to pay for the services, there are ways to get her fasttracked onto Medicaid.

Feel free to PM me.


You'll want to look for and ask about aging and disability services, in-home care, and family caregiver support. If her income is low, she may qualify for Meals on Wheels, Medicaid (additional healthcare services), and free/very low cost services that will help you help her. I don't live in FL, but I've had better luck calling my county's ADRC and asking a million questions than trying to figure it out on my own. Definitely write everything down and keep records now before she gets to a point where she can't report on her needs and wants effectively.

,"Helping Spouse with Chronic Pain, TOS, Orthostatic Intolerance, and Migraines.","I am not sure if this is the place to post this as I am new to reddit, but I would appreciate help or a push in the right direction.  My wife has a vast array of health issues and they seem to be getting worse over the past 2 years.  She has TOS in both shoulders, daily migraines (sometimes to the point of nausea/vomiting), Orthostatic Intolerance, and basic chronic pain (assuming its from all this shit piled on top of each other).

I love her more than life itself, but my mental health has been rocky trying to compartmentalize all this health stuff.  Bills are piling up into the high thousands with no end in site.  I want her to get better and I have fully supported her in everything that has to be done.  From driving her to appointments to taking off work to be with her in another city at Freodert Medical Clinic for autonomic testing.

My main concern is how do you cope or help with someone who is turning into a former shell of her once vibrant and joyful self?  This has all made our relationship stronger but it is so incredibly hard, and going to counseling is just not getting me where I need to be.

I need to know I am not alone, and maybe learn from real people dealing with similar situations with a loved one.  How do you keep staying positive?  Some days are harder than others but the most depressing thought is we are only 26 and this is where we are at in our lives.  She is on about 10 different pills a day, sees a therapist, and has had just about every test done you can name.

Any form of help is welcome, even if its just a positive quote or something to keep me going.  Not sure what the future is going to hold for us but I hope things start to get better.  This isn't too fun most days.","Husband and I went through this for 12 years, while also raising 2 boys (I was the sick one- mystery ailment “world class” doctors could not corral, got several diagnosis that I came to learn 1 year ago were also wrong.  I finally had to diagnose myself.  And from there, I started improving and am pretty well now & looking forward to doing better).  Those 12 years were hard, but there’s lots you can do to help improve her health and your outlook.  

1.  Since her health is compromised, you need to be the researcher.  PubMed health is a great place to start.  Find out what these diagnosis indicate about the larger picture of her “condition.” More information = power.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/

     When my health started improving I dove in to reading lots of books, listening to podcasts, lurking in subreddits focused on my symptoms and diagnosis.  Everything I read contributed to me becoming more aware that this generation can no longer rely solely on doctors to “fix” us.  We have to be savagely proactive in seeking the information we need in order to heal.

2.  Optimizing your partner’s nutrition is paramount.  I follow Dr Terry Whal’s eating lifestyle.  Dr Whals is a dr in Iowa who reversed her MS.  After being in a wheelchair for 2 years, she began to reverse her condition with a nutrition plan she developed, something that none of her prescriptions were able to do.  If I remember correctly, within 18 months of starting her nutrition plan she was cycling.  She has a cookbook by which I now organize my life.

3.  My pain was all consuming, and nothing helped for 12 years.  Had I done some research I could have found the alternatives that are a big help for me today.  Research the following combination that **might** help with pain:
Malic Acid
Magnesium (I use magnesium glycinate)
Vitamin B complex (in place of supplement, I use Braggs yeast...something or other-I can’t remember proper name, but google it, it’s a famous product)

Sometimes just having 1 or 2 hours break from the pain is a Godsend.  I often wished for temporary decapitation:(

There is hope.  I made it through.  Often had my doubts.  But here I am, sharing from the other end of the tunnel.

Hang in there.
Hey, I'm currently a caregiver and have been for the past 5 years. It's a tough thing to do and I've taken a bunch of hits mentally. I was going to start up a telegram group for caregivers if you or anyone else is interested let me know. 

Sometimes just talking to someone else helps a bunch, even if it's not about illness. 
Thank you to everyone that took the time to comment on this thread.  Honestly this is the very first time I have used reddit, and so far I am impressed.  Quick response and most of all quality responses.  I appreciate being apart of a community that cares for one another.

That being said I will be looking into the financial plans as people have suggested.  Outside of that does anyone know of a good migraine diet that works?  My wife and I have been researching to find a diet that will work for her, but if there is anyone with any personal experience I am open to ideas.  

Thank you all so much.  I am looking forward to keeping a conversation going to support each other.  Have a great day!
I've never been a caregiver for a partner, so I can't offer support from that standpoint. But I do have pretty much all the same medical problems as your wife. I actually found out that my chronic pain, dysautonomia, migraines, and every other problem were caused by a connective tissue disorder called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (might be worth looking into if she hasn't already). 

And my orthostatic intolerance has greatly improved since I started taking a new drug called Northera. It's the first drug that was actually developed to treat dysautonomia. I'd tried so many combinations of medications over 15+ years and nothing worked. I had to literally crawl up stairs to avoid passing out (I actually passed out, fell down a flight of steps, and fractured my leg last year). But on Northera, I can actually *run* up stairs. She will need to have tried and failed other therapies to get approved. Here's the [form](https://www.northeraenrollment.com/content/dam/lundbeck/active/neurology/northera/northeraenrollment/pdf/northera-treatment-form.pdf) her doctor will need if she's interested in pursuing it.",2017-12-29 17:27:19,Kidsnthesandbox,7mxjd7
,Caregiving for parents long distance and husband with MS,"I'm an only child 900 miles from my parents with a husband who recently got diagnosed with MS. 

My parents are fairly healthy, but looking into the future I'm scared. Neither of my parents will move out of state to be closer to me, and my job and husband's medical care (and the life I've built here) prevent me from moving back home. There will come a day when my parents will need care, and I'm not sure what to do or where to even start. 

I've talked to my parents about end of life situations, but not of what to do when they can't take care of themselves. With MS now in the picture, as much as I love my parents, my husband comes first. 

I have always felt guilty moving away from them and anxious about the future, but now with MS a part of my life I don't know what to do. It all feels so isolating. Most people I know have siblings that can help, or are close to family.  ","[deleted]
So not too sound to cold about this, but with your husband having MS, you need to take care of the immediate needs, as your parents see what your life is like between work and taking care of your MSer, they should understand what is required.  Like you said they are fairly healthy now, I commend you wanting to plan, but if you don't focus on the care your husband needs and worry about your parents now, you the pressure of the reality will come crushing in.  Figure out you Husbands care, in time your parents will see and understand, and then they might start a different conversion with you, not an easy place, I made the choice will over a decade ago to move and take care of my wife (also MS), in the time, Mom passed from cancer, it was quick as it was mostly undiagnosed, and my Dad just passed in his sleep, nothing any on the kids could have done, in short handle what you can do today, your parents will understand tomorrow
Similar situation with my parents. They live in Florida and I live in Arizona. Dad is 80 and In ok health, but mom is post surgical colostomy and back/spine issues. How do you convince them they need to move closer to family who would more than willing to take care of them. Why are older parents so stubborn.

,100 year old Grandma,"My parents have their entire lives dedicated to my Grandma in the past 6 years and it hurts me inside to see how much they sacrifice for her. She's currently a resident at a assisted living home with other Chinese men and women, staffed by Cantonese speaking individuals who do as best of a job as they can, but they are not nurses and do not have medical backgrounds. She has had trouble swallowing for years now, and after Pneumonia 4 years ago, is unable to eat anything other than Ensure. 

My parents visit her 5 times a week (used to live at her home for 2 years before the Pneumonia..., didn't even have a chance to go back to their own home). She is now having continuous UTIs, and they are getting far worse. They are resulting in hallucinations (she thought that her husband just passed away and needs to be buried. Happened 50 years ago before I was ever born...), and later, high aggression and violence. She was kicking and screaming and scratching at people, including one of her relatives the other day. This was after a 7 day antibiotics regime. We're at our wits end. Her doctor refuses to prescribe preventative daily antibiotics, and now the assisted living home owner is suggesting we find a hospice, probably super freaked out by the whole incident. Any suggestions? The current home is perfect because of the Chinese connection, there aren't many of those around and she increasingly just speaks Cantonese. As much as she used to speak in English and was fluent, she's coming back to her original native tongue. She's so attached to my parents that when we leave for a 2 week vacation, she freaks out. And our relatives nearby don't help nearly as much as they should. This might be the hardest thing my family has gone through. We have the money, but all the money in the world can't fix this. My family has given up 6 years of happiness and freedom. My friends always ask me why I don't have time to visit them when I'm back in the area, but it's because my duty to my parents is utmost. Any bit I can relieve for them is a victory. 

The hardest part is that we don't know when the end is. Grandma's a fighter through and through, lived through the Japanese bombings of WWII and this can carry on for a few more years. I can't stand to see my parents throw away a decade of their lives, right after retiring, to this situation.    

IMO, she doesn't qualify for hospice care and we're up a rut if the nursing home doesn't want to serve her anymore. ","Is the house telling you they are 100% not gonna take care of her anymore? If so, then is there a different home? If they aren't sure if they will continue caring for her then I would start researching other options. Start planning for when she can't live at the place she is now. There's gotta be some ""unable to live in assited living but not ready for hospice"" home. 

You could try posting this in r/advice. Maybe someone there can give you more info and options, this sub doesn't get a ton of traffic. 
Her aggression is not good and the constant UTIs can could be from lack of care or possibly self doing. This rings out to me as PTSD. But I think it’s time for hospice at least till her health clears up especially if money isn’t a problem. 
I'd definitely be worried about the infection spreading at her age (or any age with that frequency).

One thing I can suggest is a slight change to her diet. The bacteria that causes UTIs thrive on sugar and Ensure is pretty high in sugar. I've been on a liquid diet for the past 7 months and I switched from Ensure/Boost to a plant-based, all-natural formula from [Kate Farms](https://shop.katefarms.com/products/core-essentials-1-0-vanilla). I know you said money isn't an issue (and I'm not sure if we're even in the same country), but my insurance is covering it (I get it through CVS Coram).

[Liquid Hope](http://www.functionalformularies.com/liquid-hope-information.html) was another that was supposed to be healthy, but Coram didn't carry it so I haven't tried it.

,Caring for parents,Wondering how many other people have experienced this with their older parents. Went to both parents doctors appointments today. I️ couldn’t help to think how many times they took me to the doctor when I was child? Roles reversed now🤔,"Me. I spent hours yesterday trying to figure out how to get my stepdad to make friends in their assisted living. He wants to move bc ""ain't nothing for me to do here."" He and my mom have been there 3 months and I *just started being able to relax. I almost lost it when thinking of another move.

Probably going to call the director and ask for some ""men's"" stuff, try to get him some outside activities (maybe find someone for him to practice Spanish with, I think he'd like that), encourage him to initiate his own activities (you don't need the staff to set up a card game for you), and ask their church to send someone to visit more often.

Pretty sure my mom rarely put this much thought into my development. She loved me but was a bit hands off and I was a good kid.
I went through four years of doctors visits with my mum. She had COPD and throat cancer. So, she was on 24/7 oxygen, had a feeding tube, and a tracheostomy. Also a port in her shoulder for chemo. Lots and *LOTS* of doctor appointments. 

She wouldn't take care of any of this on her own. I think she thought she was not going to last as long as she did.
My wife and I care for my dad, 85, wheelchair bound and with bags and tubes. Getting him to a doctor visit is especially challenging since not everything where I live is disabled or wheelchair friendly. At the clinic too, he is among the older and more infirm. Since he never gets to go out, we try and club his doctor visits with a long drive or a roadside eatery kind of experience. And yes, I think of all that he and Mom have done for us and how roles reverse. Have some amount of regret for the lack of compassion I have experienced for his and Mom's struggles with coming to terms with their infirmity. The least I can do is make his life comfortable today.

,Caregiver for fiance with MS - mood issues,"Hello I needed a place to vent and get good feedback/opinions.

The day after my birthday my boyfriend of 5 years said he couldnt stand to be around me. We have been arguing more in the last few months and its mostly because im having a hard time just accepting how to shut up. I cant help but take some of the things he says in pain as anger. If I confuse/upset/annoy him, he will sometimes warn me and if I dont shut up he will throw a fit by throwing things and yelling and breaking stuff. Even if he detects an ounce of attitude in my voice he will lash out. He has terrible mood swings and is on medication (generic lexapro) but theres a part of me that wants to say he can do something about the intensity of his reactions yet he has told me that it is his MS and he cannot control that himself. It seems that whenever we discuss finding a solution for our out of control arguments, its because im not ""shutting the fuck up."" Hes a totally different person upset and he correlates being upset to boiling in water, with pain increasing with how upset he is. He has said so many hurtful things and im so fucking hurt by it all that its hard to rise above what he says and actually try to help him the way he wants to be helped. I just want to know if anyone goes through something similar and is stuck between taking things personally and trying to be a caretaker and a lover at the same time. I feel like giving up on the relationship but Ive never loved and hurt from the same person so intensly. He suffers from nearly every symptom on and off the books. I do everything for him from driving to injecting his meds every night. I dont want to lose him but I our arguing is wearing thin.","Hey there, cottonmouth. I'm a caregiver for my wife of 15 years who has (very aggressive) MS and was diagnosed 4 months after we met. I was by her side the whole time  She's now in a nursing home because I was no longer able to care for her at home and didn't feel she was safe with the lone aide we were lucky enough to qualify for through her Medicare/aide.  

So yeah, I've been there. Oh man, have I been there - knock-down, drag-out yelling matches where she just acted crazy and refused to acknowledge any fault of her own, fueled by my short temper and impatience/frustration.

For starters, he needs therapy. That's non-negotiable. If he is not willing to do that, he is not serious about helping himself and helping you. And that will be a toxic environment that you'll never win against; it will only get worse. MS is a *cause* of anger and explosive behavior, sure - but it's not an ***excuse***. MS is horrible; a terrible plight I wouldn't wish upon anybody (well, there are some politicians/policy makers at insurance companies I'd love to see afflicted, but that's another topic). It sucks badly. No one can argue with that. But it's not an excuse to treat the people who love you (and who give up so much to care for you) like shit.

My wife/wife and I started counseling, and it was a big help. There were things both of us had to take a look at, and having an outside calmly talk about them with us (even if we couldn't be calm) was a game-changer.

Also, he might want to look into support groups. It's great that you're there for him, but he might need to talk with someone that really understands what he's going through. As much as we caregivers are there and involved, we don't really know what it's like to be living in our loved one's skins, so finding people who are going through the same thing is a big help.

Lastly: take care of you. Walking away may be the hardest thing you have ever had to do; but if he's not going to take steps to take care of himself, he will absolutely drag you down with him and destroy you. Don't let that happen. Love him, respect him, and value him. But don't give yourself up for him - you won't be helping yourself, and you're not going to help *him* that way, either.

Good luck, and please feel free to come here as often as you need to vent!
So sorry for what you are going through. Let go of your guilt, and take care of yourself.

He will suffer, no matter what. Why allow him to make you suffer, too? This is beyond your pay grade, and you deserve a life!
I don’t have MS, my partner does, but I have struggled with mental health for a while.  If he is having mood swings that bad he needs his meds changed.  SSRIs make me have weird symptoms and I’ve had mood swings like that on them and terrible nightmares.

Also, if may prove beneficial if you can talk him into seeing a therapist.  He probably has a lot going on weighing on him that is making him feel resentful.  Either way, he shouldn’t talk to you like that.  It’s unacceptable.",2017-10-30 23:39:59,cottonmouth_24,79t86d

,New Caregiver Needing to Vent,"I have recently became a caregiver to both my parents. I was away at college for my final semester when my dad quickly lost his ability to walk/control his bowels. In May he had surgery on his spine to hopefully correct these issues. He can now walk with a walker and has almost regained full control of his bowels. After graduation I decided to come home and care for him full-time. My mother was working at the time and helping me when she could. Now, she no longer works and is not helping whatsoever and having me help take care of her as well (medicines, food, bringing her what she needs). I do all the laundry, cooking, and cleaning for 4 adults two of which have bowel issues (TONS of laundry).

I just feel like I am drowning. Drowning in housework, anxiety, and guilt. I feel so guilty because part of me is angry? I can't place the anger because I am not sure if it's my situation, some higher power, or myself that I am so angry at.

Babies are cute, they smell sweet, their poops are cute, and the hardships of caring for them are all forgotten when a baby smiles or laughs.  Not so with adult dependents.  Once adult urine and poo are involved you have to learn to barf backwards to save their dignity, and to be able to keep going.  Harsh words to type, harsh image to read, but all true.  

Caregiving in modern day is as difficult as it gets, as extended family now rarely live close enough to help.  Given the physical, medical, social, financial, dietary, administrative, and household maintenance needs of the elderly, I've calculated that each infirm individual actually needs 2 caretakers.  There were times when I truly wanted to kick myself for not joining a cult or for not participating in plural marriage before I got sucked in to caregiving (all the help you need comes with the package).  

Best advice I can offer: find ways to care for yourself, (take walks and naps whenever you can); heap loads of compassion on yourself for the less than desirable  thoughts, fears, anger, resentment-all normal in my book; take up writing and/or psych therapy, because pent up emotions prime your body for illness.

Second best advice I've received:  seek respite care!  Don't think you can go at this alone.  Contact your local CNA/medical assistant training colleges  to see if they offer low fee caregiving; notify your parents' friends & neighbors of their situation, they're likely to offer a much needed hour or 3 of care.

Caregiving can be a truly isolating experience.  We need our own version of the AA support group, but I'm sure we'd all be too busy or too tired to attend :(

Your life was high jacked when you were about to enter a much-deserved phase of carefree living.  I'm sorry.  The unexpected happens to all of us.  You are not being targeted for past lives transgressions.  You are not alone.

I keep coming back to this and seeing so many kind words brings me to tears. Since the original post, I have had a talk with my parents to let them know that I am overwhelmed. Which, helped me a lot more than I thought it would. We are looking into hiring another caretaker a few days a week as well as, my mother is going to put forth more of an effort during the evenings (when I need help the most). But the most exciting thing is, is that, I had been asked to be the maid of honor at my best friend's wedding a few months back but thought there was no way I could attend. Going would cause me to be away for a weekend and that wasn't possible. Luckily, with my mother's help and some extended family I will be going. I am so thankful to be getting a small break and knowing that my dad will be taken care of while I am gone.

I truly can't thank everyone enough for all of the kind words and advice. It has really turned my thoughts on the whole situation around.
I understand where you're coming from. I became a caregiver to my grandparents my sophomore year of high school, 10 years ago. My grandfather had cancer and passed away in 2009. My grandmother never drove, so I started taking care of her, too. Now she has severe arthritis, cataracts, and is losing her memory. Their son (my father) suffers from mental illness. I graduated college and worked in nightlife to take care of her during the day.

That being said, I am so sorry for all that has happened. Being a caregiver is so much harder than we thought. 

You will feel like you're drowning. You will feel guilty. And angry. And tired. And then, out of nowhere, you have a great day. You'll become close to them in a way you hadn't been before. You'll have great conversations about all variety of topics and you'll fall into a routine. And yes, you'll have bad days where you feel like shit, filled with guilt and anger and disgust. But then you have a good day and the cycle continues. 

We do this because we love them. We do this because no one else can. 

Feel free to PM me if you ever need to talk. Good luck, and keep your head up.
Both of the previous comments are great advice, and I'd like to add to /u/zamorafountains comment about seeking help with caregiving: if your parents are on Medicare/caid they will qualify for aides to come to the home and help them (and you!) with care, meal prep and light cleaning/housekeeping duties. That is a HUGE sanity saver - give yourself some time off and a break!
This is an incredible amount of work, responsibility, and stress for just one person.  It would be tough for any experienced CNA.  Not sure if / why your Mom is ill, and who the fourth adult is.  Regardless, I can see why you're overwhelmed.

My very overweight Mom was paralyzed due to a stroke when I was 11, and I was her hands-on caregiver until I was 20.  It was an unrealistic expectation on me, obviously.  My Dad had motor coordination problems and I assisted him when he allowed me to (unlike my Mom, he was self aware and wanted to preserve his ability to help himself as much as possible).  All of this prepared me to become my sister's caregiver when she became debilitated by brain cancer; she was much like my Dad in that she took pride in doing as much as she could herself.

All the advice here is great.  You're an angel for placing your own life on hold for your parents.  But, please make it a priority to find additional help, or delegate some of that care.  Even consider hiring a housekeeper a couple of times a week to help with laundry / cooking / cleaning.

Decades later, I have a very unhealthy tendency to see my value as a ""helper"" to others, even when they don't want or need it.  My parents held me back from college to care for them (especially my Mom's care) when they definitely had the means to hire out.  I am at midlife and am finally working on completing college, off and on.  

I am relieved to read that you finished your degree.  But, as zamorafountains indicated, your life should be eventually moving forward, not backward.  Be proud of what you are doing for your parents, but know how important it is to partner with others or hire out for their care.  

Please give some thought to building your plan for your own eventual goals outside of this situation.  Don't let caregiving define you, and don't keep taking on sole responsibility for everything, b/c that can lead to resentment.  It's very important to preserve who you are so that you don't lose yourself through over-giving.

The VA is a great idea.  I have no info there, but I am sure they would have suggestions.  
You are not alone. You are luckier than many who get sucked into this role, and try and play along without realizing either the rules of the game or the damage done by not playing by the rules. My wife and I (both working day/nights to look after our toddler) were suddenly required to care for my 85-y-o Dad after Mom passed away. He was already in serious need for care, which Mom had been struggling with, but after her death, he deteriorated rapidly. Mobility, memory, continence, the works. We went at it, out of love, pity, sense of duty, etc., and it was many months before we realized what a mess we were making of all our lives. We were at rock bottom with regards to self care, our relationship, parenting, careers, and ironically, even caring for Dad. That was when we looked around for help, and the reddit subs helped greatly. 
Quick tips - self care first, if you are not in shape, you will not be able to give care. - your receiver did not choose his condition, you did not choose your condition, no blaming, no guilting. - take caregiving as a ""part of life"" not all of life, be sure to apportion time and energy and attention to all areas of your life, you will be surprised that the care receiver will actually understand this on most days. - most of us get busy with life where we lose out on a real meaningful relationship with our parents or elders, use this opportunity to restore some of it, and it will not be easy, but your parents will feel good to get to know you more intimately just as you will them. 

Feel free to PM if you need to vent. 
I want to thank everyone for their kind words! I haven't attempted assistance because I have had this notion that since it is MY dad it is MY responsibility and I now realize how harmful that mindset can be. Although, I'm curious if anyone has tried to get assistance through a VA center? My dad has state worker insurance as well as VA coverage. I'm curious if I could get some help through them?

Again, thank you to everyone and your kind words, you have no idea how great it was to read your comments. They made me feel so much better about myself and even hopeful about my situation.",2017-10-28 00:28:47,Succinum_Suspendisse,79894t
,Looking for beta testers for a new app to help our families,"First, thank you to the moderators for accepting my request to post here to find beta users for our app. I currently care for a son with Type 1 and a mother with multiple health conditions. I have a friend who is caring for her mother who was diagnosed in 2015 with Alzheimer’s. We both see a need for a better way for us to manage communications concerning the care of our loved ones. This friend is developing an app that all families involved with caring for a loved one can use to help manage communications between family members and daily tasks to help keep our loved ones healthy and alive. We were tired of communications through texts and emails, and hope this tool will help all of us better manage our loved ones' conditions by having their information in one place for all involved to access at any time from anywhere. We need others like us (caring for family members with chronic conditions) to help test this app to see if it really meets the caregiving needs of our users. There will be no charge for this app when it is released, hopefully in January of 2018. To participate as a beta user, you need to have an iPhone or iPad, be involved in the care of a loved one, and able to test the app during the months of November and December 2017. Let me know if you would like to help, or go to our website vitalally.com and click on the beta invite button to sign up. We need your input!

,21st Birthday Spent Being a Caregiver,"Last night was my 21st birthday. My mom the go getter she is wanted to help set up everything even though my aunts kept telling to sit and not over strain herself. Fast forward to dinner and the waiter is asking me what kind of alcoholic beverage I want. My mom(who doesn't drive at night cause she needs to get her eyes checked) interjects and says ""She's never had alcohol before and needs to drive so we are going to skip it."" The final sting was her ordering two drinks herself cause she knows she doesn't have to drive. 
I don't get to enjoy my 21st because she refuses to get her eyes checked. I love my mom and realise I'm the only she's got to take care of her but sometimes it feels like I don't get to catch a break and be a normal 20 something. I feel like I'm always in caregiver mode.","[deleted]
I know this was posted awhile ago, but my Mom was paralyzed and I was her caregiver for many years.  I am not sure what your Mom's disabilities are, but is there a mobility access service for the disabled in your area?  Someone else does the driving, and as caregiver, you ride along, too.  It is for people who have a bit of difficulty getting around (the driver helps the disabled passenger into the access services car, for example) all the way to ramp van services.

We used to go out with my Mom all the time with these services.  If you're not familiar with them and want to know more, please PM me and I can explain how they worked for us.

Another idea is, maybe you can have a party at your place so you can look in on your Mom.  Not as fun, but just a thought.  You deserve to celebrate, especially with all that responsibility.  Happy belated birthday.",2017-10-08 12:19:09,15CEH02,752m9n

,New to the world of caregiving. Desperately needing support.,"Hi. 

My husband of one year - we have known each other for three years - sustained a spinal cord injury and is paraplegic. 

He was in the ICU for like 7 weeks and then had like 6 weeks of rehab. I was by his side every minute, and the rehab facility did a really good job of teaching me the skills I need to take care of him. 

They didn't warn me about the emotional parts of it all, though. 

We've been home for 6 weeks and I'm just fucking exhausted to my core. Every part of my life revolves around his needs. I spend hours every day doing disgusting things that I really thought you could never pay me enough to do. 

I used to be a successful professional woman. I don't even recognize myself anymore and I'm so tired. Becoming a servant was never, ever in my life plan. I'm beside myself. ","[deleted]
can you hire a caregiver to come in for 2 hours/day to give you a break?  i pay $18/hour for someone to come in.
You sound like you're under so much stress. I'm so sorry for your loss. I can't imagine how terrible it must be as a newlywed to have your partner become paralyzed. 

I think you should go back to work. Your husband needs a team of people to take care of him; you can't do it alone. 

If you're in the States, have you tried www.care.com?
Hi, I can imagine this new lifestyle is totally different for you. As time passes you will eventually swing into things. But it is very important to take time for yourself, even if it is 5 minutes here and there. Have you thought about home health care? Caregivers can help take care of your husband on certain days.
I really have no helpful words besides that I am in the same position as you and it fucking sucks. I quit my job to take care of my FIL, he had a stroke and started developing dementia like symptoms. 
From cooking breakfast, changing his underwear, making sure he showered and giving him meds I am also making sure he doesn't take off without his clothes or shoes because he is very confused.
I cry like six times a day. He is a shell of a man he used to be and I am not ready to see him lose his mind. I can't watch a movie or turn on music because he may try to sneak out of the house. When I take a shower in the morning my son is watching him (husband is at work, leaves the house at 4 am but that's a different story).
All I can say is read books, watch movies, do some online shopping, light up scented candles, try some crafts, eat ice cream, I try to find  comfort and happiness in the little things. And message me if you need to talk!

I hope it helps, Good Luck :)...
First, have you seen a social worker at the hospital? They should be able to provide you with some guidance as to what programs and services are available to you, from emotional support to caregiving support, to funding.

Second, does he have family? Have you spoken to them about helping you?

Bottom line is, you'll need some time to yourself. But you'll also need to slowly realize the new normal, without feeling resentment (although it's a normal emotion). At some point, you can start to create a strategy for moving forward. Every emotion your feeling is valid. Now you have to start dealing with them, before exhaustion, frustration and resentment skew your thinking. ",2017-10-01 14:48:07,-NewNormal-,73ngsv
,ethics of locking the fridge?,"I'm struggling with an ethical dilemma and could really use some advice...

I'm the primary caregiver for my mother, who has fairly severe Alzheimer's.  For the past four or so months we've been having a major problem with her either leaving the fridge door wide open or putting food from the freezer in the fridge (where it then melts/defrosts).  This isn't a huge problem during the day, since I'm likely to catch any issues early.  But she's also been getting up in the middle of the night and rooting through the fridge...she never eats anything during these times, she just moves stuff around.  She also CONSTANTLY tries to feed our four cats various things, including things that are actively dangerous for them.  Examples: chocolate chip cookies, dry cereal, raw meat, entire cups of milk...miraculously so far I've either caught her in time or the cats decided not to touch her offerings, but I feel like it's only a matter of time before she seriously hurts them.  

I've had to throw out hundreds of dollar worth of food because she let it defrost or I found the fridge was left open overnight. 

So...would it be ethical to buy child locks for the fridge?  I think I would only need to use them at night, but I still feel bad for even considering it.  I do want her to have access to food when she's hungry, including overnight (although again, it really doesn't seem like she's actually eating anything when she roots around...I""m not entirely sure why she has such a habit of it.)  On the other hand, I NEED a solution for this problem. 
Help??","I think moving the fridge to the garage should be your last resort. I would try experimenting with different childproof locks on the fridge first. Hopefully you have success with these. 
Remove the fridge from her kitchen and put it in the garage, and make sure there are locks on the door to the garage.  If she wants cold drinks, get a mini fridge instead.   Leave only safe snacks out in  cabinets, labeled ""cat treats"" in large letters. You can order meals on wheels so she doesn't have to cook or need a refrigerator. Another tip I have seen done for gas stoves:  switch the gas off from outdoors, and if you need to cook, switch it back on for that short time. Prevents fires.
My mom has Lewey Body dementia, and for a period of time would get up in the middle of the night and stroll through the house. Not sleep walk. Not good as her mobility is bad, and she's prone to falling (head through a glass door, too many bruises to count). It got worse as several times she left the house, despite a locked, deadbolted, and barred door, and 3 kids here. Police were called, she returned, never left the development we live in, no harm. We have since turned her bedroom door privacy lock around so it locks from the outside of her room. She was turning the lock before, locking herself in and not realizing it. I'm handy, so simple to undo. We've only have locked her in a few times, and her night time wanderings have pretty much stopped. Not sure if you'd rather this option, but if she's venturing to the kitchen, not much to stop her from going further or elsewhere.
I like the other comment suggesting a mini-fridge for her to keep a few drinks or snacks in so you can child proof the regular refrigerator at night or during the day while still giving her access to food and beverages. I think moving the fridge into the garage is a little much, as long as it is child proofed. I think that's probably the most convenient/logical/ethical. ",2017-09-23 19:07:35,lockingethics,721lp7

Taking care of others means also taking care of yourself.
Keep in mind that not only does it benefit you, it also benefits the person you care for. Getting time away to recharge your batteries gives you some much-needed space and relaxation that will (hopefully!) allow you to approach your caregiving with some new energy.
I am a caregiver burnout and someone could have told me it would be this way..
please take the time you need in between because going towards that place where it is emotionally and phisically exhausting to even lift a finger is wrong... and it is very hard to find a place back to normal

I had convinced her to see a therapist, which she hadn't seen in a while, and they got her to go inpatient.

I'm fine with that but I'm upset that she let her self get bad enough that she needed to go there again (she wasn't seeing a therapist or going to any counseling or group sessions, etc).  She called me today and said she didn't go to any classes the day after she got there, she went to some today.  While she intellectually knows she has myself and her kids who want her in their lives, she said she feels selfish because it doesn't matter (enough?) for her to want to live. 

I'm sure this is just the depression talking but it felt like a gut punch.   We got married fairly young and we've been married for a long time.  She's my bestfriend and it hurts thinking of her wanting to leave my life.  It doesn't help that both my parents died young and I have no real close friends.

And any advice on how to find them? Word of mouth would be ideal but thats been a bit difficult thus far. We'd be providing room and board in addition to pay.  

","You might try a site like care.com.

It does have a background check feature.

Best of luck to you!
Do you have any support groups you are a part of? Do you, your family, or your mother attend a church or similar community group? I am a private caregiver and I and most caregivers I have worked with or know have gotten their positions by word of mouth or recommendations this way. 

If a pastor knows of a family who has used a caregiver before that he may have met on a home visit(common for the elderly) he'd likely know where to point you for some recommendations. Same with book groups, cancer support groups, or hey, even the hair dresser who needed help with their parents during a transition. 

A big thing to ask, though, is if the caregiver is healthy enough to care for someone who needs physical assistance. Most private caregivers without licenses such as PCA or CNA I know are older themselves. Also, its not very common(in my experience) to have background check/drug test/tb test even occur to families, much less considering taking out taxes. These are all considerations to take into account when you don't go through an agency. I myself have no qualms with any of these(in fact I would have much appreciated the gesture) but I would be surprised if some who were interested wouldn't be surprised. 
Your local senior center might be a good resource. ",2017-08-15 21:07:08,supernova2424,6tynii
,"I work in a memory care facility, staff know i worked two days with 102°+ temps while coughing so hard i nearly vomited one day.","Finally, yesterday i was able to go to convenient care. Got a diagnosis of bronchitis and some rxs. The copays from my insurance were about 85 percent of the cost of them items without insurance. $100 for six arithromyzin pills, an albuterol inhaler, and a chamber so it doesn't cover my tongue.

Now i'm short sixty of the 220 i need to pay for the storage of my stuff after getting evicted because 10.5 an hour at 37.5 hours a week is not enough to live on obviously.

One would think a health care company would have good insurance. Right? Of course not, they're a for profit that finds paying 10.5 an hour an acceptable wage.

And even though the resident aide supervisor knows i'm sick she said i missed a morning shift—i so didn't—then tries to call me in for an evening shift.

I gotta find an a live-in care position soon. This company is trying to kill its employees.",[deleted],2017-08-01 16:34:41,viol8er,6qz2sh
,Can't find a decent PCA,"Short story: My Mom with MS needs a PCA during the day. We've keep getting people who just stop showing up. We can't get one to last more than a few months before going a week without any help, and then interviewing and training a new one. The turn over cycle is so frustrating and at a loss of how to secure a decent PCA.
More background: My Dad and I are caregiver's for my Mom who is 67 and has had advanced progressive MS for the past 20 years or so, and needs constant care. We live in Minnesota and can use home care agencies to find a Personal Care Attendant (PCA) to be with her during the day (8am-3pm). Medicare pays for the agencies, who pay the PCA's and they only get about $10/hour. Thus there is a lot of turn over, people with no experience, no reliable transportation, etc. In years past we've had OK ones who have lasted a year or so. For some reason this year, we can't get one to last more than a month or so. We had one who was stealing from my Dad's wallet, one who just doesn't show up or call after a month. And today we had a new PCA start, she showed up an hour late with no explanation, and after an hour of light training, my dad went out to work on his garden and came back to the front door open, her car gone and my Mom alone in the room.
I know the quality of employee is low because the pay is low, and I feel for the PCAs who are low-income and don't have reliable transportation, etc. But I'm at a loss. They have no respect for the fact that their job is caring for vulnerable adults. Ugh! With the last one we contributed a few dollars an hour of our own money on top of what the agency pays, to make it more competitive and to try and retain the PCA. I just don't know how we could afford a private service like 'visiting angels' (those private senior care companies.) Does anyone have experience with this? Would Medicare pay for part of a better quality agency, with us picking up the rest of the tab? Or any other PCA advice?","You can switch agencies, if that would help - not sure that's a solution or if you'd be going from one bad group to another. The agency you're working with now sounds like a nightmare, I would at least do that (unless you've already done that, in which case never mind!). The other option is that you can hire your own caregiver and have Medicare/Medicaid pay for it (I forget which one pays, but I think it was Medicare). I don't remember the name of that program, but it would give you greater control of who gets hired - even though they're still going to get paid crap. 

I hate to bring up an ugly subject, but have you given any thought to a nursing home for your mother? I know how hard it is, but sometimes that can really be a huge help - she'll get the care she needs from professionals (hopefully - if there's a good home near you) and relieve a huge deal of stress from you/your dad.
My dad has long term health care insurance, so I'm not familiar with how medicare/Medicaid handles home care.  When daddy first moved in with me, we used a national senior in home care service.  It was a nightmare....just like you're describing.  My husband just started casually talking to the caregivers the company was sending and got a lot of good information.  Most of the caregivers know other caregivers that work for different companies or work independently.  The in home services in my area charge about $20 and hour, we found an independent who would do it for $16, she's been with us for about 18 months. You can also try calling A Place for Mom and they will give you referrals.   Also check with your local vo-tech or trade school for people who are getting ready to finish up their CNA course.  The only stipulation we ran into is the caregiver must be licensed or certified.   Good Luck.  


also contact your Areawide Aging Agency.  They have a lot of good information and resources.
It is a lot of trouble, but you can hire caregiver's directly instead of having an agency. You would be able to pay them more, but would not have coverage if they were unable to work. Talk to your state department of long term care and aging for options.
Another option, if you have space, bring in some one else that needs care, and share assistance. I know a couple, the woman has MS, which are renting rooms in their home and providing 24-hour care in a home, not a facility. ",2017-07-31 15:33:34,fiddleleafan,6qqtwr

How do i fight for him to stay? thx!,,"More info: Dad 85 on medicare, could not walk or speak 20 days ago, and we were first told even though he was supposed to stay for another month, they are now sending dad home friday from willows the acute rehab center in lansing MI, because of his walking progress. he is against it, and my step mother is too, is too as he is not strong enough, and will relapse without structure and strength. he is just kicking ass in the PT, but no where near ready to go home, They have already talked to the the PT to no avail, who would have some power in this decision and what are his patient rights? how can we argue for him? I am 300 miles away. thx. what would you do?
Here is all the info I can come up with....


1) the PT is not the decider they only give info to the attending DR. who can overrule the PT and decides.
looking Possible VALIID LEGAL PRAGMATIC REASONS FOR KEEPING HIM LONGER. ?


2) he has a history of and is still a severe fall risk even though he is able to walk better than when he arrived.


3) what is the law that says if he has to come back again after being taking care of by the facility gets penalized and loses money? might be an angle.


what is he entitled too in medicare etc. and what are his patient rights if he feels this is not in his best interest?
any other things we can do to strengthen his case. ?

suggestions so far: please add more if they come to your or for clarification.


appreciated!


1) if can’t extend. social worker look int getting getting dad placed into a Skilled Nursing Facility if he isn't ready to go home. This can act as a further bridge to discharge home and people usually stay there for 2-3 weeks.

 2) appeals process of discharge at willow facility level 

3) If it's a Medicare or insurance cut, there are multiple appeal levels. However dad or step mother must do the request of appeal before the date runs out. 

4)Severe historical Fall risk and he has not progressed as far as he can in PT, 

5) attending dr can suggest more PT if PT wont. 

6) if can’t extend, social worker can set up in home nursing and in or out patient PT OT etc. all i got for now. 

Anything Else?
Make sure that home health is ordered by the MD.
This benefit is covered by Meficare 100%.
All home health agencies are state licensed and medicare certified. When they take over care at the home, they are obligated to ensure the patients saftey.
If need be, they can send to a higher level of care.

Ask to see his plan of care. Maybe that will stop them a bit. ",2017-07-18 21:56:35,izwizard,6o5fjw

Jello? You could do something like jello shots, small size cubes. Ice pops, or freeze Gatorade type drinks in ice cube trays with toothpick holders. Better than plain water.
I am going through the same thing with my Father.  We gave him water after he had a surgery and he aspirated, which means he was not swallowing, but the water and food went into his lungs.  I suspect your Grandfather is hooked up to IV fluids and will need will need to pass a swallow test in order to get water.  Surgery was in April and I hope my Father passes his swallow test 7/18.  I get a sponge pop, wring it out and moisten his mouth.  It is hard, but listen to the doctors and nurses.  What I do to comfort my Father is put a wet wash cloth on his forehead.  
 
If he's already got an iv hydrate that way or enema bag. 
Jello is good, but you can add thickener to anything. It is available at any drug store, and it is easy to use. I've even tried it on iced tea. It is wonderful for patients that have difficulty swallowing or are bed bound and might choke.",2017-06-26 23:40:38,80085-,6jq6gn

Have other caregivers struggled to keep their desire for their spouse or partner/patient?  I find that the longer he deals with his chronic pain and medical issues, the less I see him as a viable sexual partner.  It almost feels wrong to even think of him in a sexual way given all of the pain and issues he is dealing with.  Slowly, this has completely killed any desire I had for him.  I find myself making excuses to avoid any form of intimacy with him.  I feel terrible for this and I know he'd be devastated to know the real reason for my recent refusals.

,Growing up as a progressive MS sibling,"I guess I am just looking for a place to let go of some of my thoughts. So I apologize if this is the wrong place to do so.
When I was about 11 years old my older brother at college was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis which later appeared to be primary progressive MS. I have very minimal memories of anything before that really.
At that age and for the next 15 years I never realized how I was developing and why. It was only 2 years ago, and after going through some extreme personal trauma and events that I started to do some deep introspection. I started to realize who I was.
You see I thought my situation while unfortunate was unavoidable and that it was simply my luck of the draw. That anyone in my situation would feel this burdened and this conflicted. I thought that me spending years and years wishing that I would die is normal and that it was just my fault for not being strong enough. hoping that each plane ride would be my last. that my car would just fly off the edge of the highway somehow. hoping that the next lump would bring that devastating news that would tell me that I only had a year to live. I would smile and say finally I can rest and finally it would be over. I always thought that I was just born this way with a messed up head or something. I spent my late teens and all the way into my mid-twenties with these recurrent thoughts. I felt like I had no soul. Or a broken one. I felt a prisoner and I could not escape. doomed Into I life I did not chose but forever bound by it.
Ever since he was diagnosed, I grew up in what I would call a broken home. It has been 18 years since.
I know that my parents did the best they could but sadly effort is not enough.
My mother quit her job and went to live with them during his last years of uni. After that they came back and we all lived together. I remember that I started giving him his injections when I was around 14 or 15. As he progressed and the myriad of medications and alternative treatments failed. There was a new normal developing in the house. My sister and I became cargivers as well . Everything was MS and brother related. At this point for the following years brother and mother barely went out and they mostly shut in even though she was the primary caregiver the burden often spilled over. We are and were always part time nurses. Family vacations were mainly about being stuck in a hotel room the whole day getting ""ready"" to go out for a couple hours. Then back to the hotel again to watch tv for hours. I remember getting like 3 or 4 books on every vacation that were over 1000 pages long. Going out alone was guiltridden and just boring. I would always wait for him to go back and wait a while then go out for a walk alone to feel some sense of freedom and sanity.
I did not go out or hang out with any other family members for any social event without him being there since it would be insensitive to him. And that rarely happened anyways because of difficult mobility.
Resenting him made me feel even more guilty. And so the vicious cycle continued.
Life was just life that's it. I tried not to think about and I did not think or feel there other options These behaviors were not rules they were just becoming familial norms.
I went to University down the street. granted it was a good one but all so I would not add burden to my family and so I can be around to pull my weight. I really wanted to go some where. I did extremely good in school and got a scholarship to go anywhere.
My achievements were not celebrated. Birthdays were 5 members and a cake. People were not invited. My graduation ceremony from med school was my mom coming for about an hour and watching me get my name called and leaving before I even said hello or goodbye. Happiness was almost unspeakably forbidden.
I grew up being viciously independent, reserved, quiet, inexpressive, but extremely responsible at least. But mainly Ive always been just empty.
By the time I graduated. I was what I would describe as a machine. Closer to a robot than a human being. I had no soul. no dreams no hope no anger I felt nothing all the time and just went on with life taking decisions by what made sense and what was the ""greater good"" whatever the hell that meant.
I realized recently that it had mainly been my mother who created this eternal bubble of apprehension and and stressful environment we were always in continuous mourning and I thought that how it should be . I was robbed of almost every normal milestone a guy goes through as he grows up. Do not get me wrong I saw friends and traveled as well. I have had a pretty decent life and my mom is wonderful person who did her best for her kids, But some essentials never there. Everything was just guilt-ridden. I felt forgotten and marginal all the time but at the same time a prisoner. I would sit in my car outside my families house for an hour before coming in so I would not run into anybody.
This is just a part of how I have felt. and a part of my life. Things that I have never uttered to another human for fear of... I do not know. All the while my heart breaks and aches watching him just continuing to suffer for years to no end.
I have been able to break free mentally and if only partially.
I am just writing this because... well because I am human and we are selfish and self important and we want our voices to be heard. but also because maybe some one just one person who is either the sibling or the disabled will read this and realize something and do something about it.","I relate to you, my Mom has had MS most of of my life and experienced a lot of the isolation you talk about. My Dad and I are caregivers, and yes our live is centered around her and the disease. The lack of mobility makes vacations or family functions or anything outside of the house a struggle. My Dad wants to rent cabins for vacation and we do once or twice a year, but it's quite painful for me. Like you said I feel like we just watch TV all day, with one activity, like going out to dinner a day. So to me, it's like why are we even here, we can't do anything! And I also feel robbed of a lot of 'normal' things as well. I'm in the creative industry so luckily I can work from home and have flexible hours. There's always a doctor's appointment or a PCA who quit, and I need to come help during 'working' hours. This has made me not as able to move on my career track or take a higher-pace full time job that wouldn't let me dip out to care for my Mom. I also think you are experiencing 'ambiguous loss' it's the type of grief that is long and nebulous. Unlike losing a family member to cancer or something with a faster timeline, with grieving milestones, MS is a long, slow horrible process. My mom is 67 and still hanging in there, but just getting weaker and weaker every day. I can't process the grief of slowly losing my mother my whole life, because she is still here. For a long time I never talked to anyone about my Mom and kept it bottled up. About a year ago I got terrible anxiety and panic attacks, I was already in therapy, and I think a lot of it was that I was finally talking about the grief I have about my Mom and all these emotions came to the surface at once. I have got my panic under control these days and can talk about my Mom's situation without bursting into tears (which I couldn't do before therapy.) I often feel like no one else understands MS or my situation, which is actually why I sought out this subreddit. I'm so sorry you and your families lives has been affected by this disease, it truly sucks. I think it's good you wrote out your thoughts here. It's good to get it out. If you feel up to talking to a therapist I think it could be helpful. I have a lot of guilt and resentment to, that affects me constantly, therapy has helped relief some of it. I'm wishing you some relief. ",2017-06-09 08:31:42,kooki87,6g840j

When I tell her no we can't drive two vehicles somewhere because that would be eight hours of driving in one day when she isn't supposed to drive at all, that hurts her feelings.  In the past we've been forced by circumstance to have her drive short distances, even those have been terribly dangerous.  I'm trying to make sure that we won't ever be in a situation which would require her to drive ever again but I don't know what else I can do.  But, when I try to gently say that she can't do something I hurt her feelings and she resents me.  I hate being the badguy when I'm just trying to keep us all safe.","Not sure what the particular situation is, so I'll just add my own personal experience with this matter.

I've found that making the doctor the ""bad guy"" sometimes works. The doctor assesses one's physical and cognitive capabilities and judges whether they are fit to drive. Sometimes this means they need to report them and have their license revoked. This will ensure that they no longer drive, however people take this loss of independence in two ways generally:

1) hate that doctor and never go back (not so good in the long run for continuity of care)

2) welcome the loss of the license so long as there is a caregiver available to chauffeur them around (ie. worry free transportation for them while they sit in the passenger seat and enjoy the views).

Whatever the case, it's a tough discussion to have and some people are not ready to hear that they can no longer do the things that they have been doing their whole lives. Using the doctor as the bearer of bad news isn't always the best approach, but can certainly be considered an option, especially if driving for your partner puts them or others at risk.",2017-05-24 21:02:51,Annakha,6d6eqx
,Medicare caregiver funding/family members,"My mother was finally diagnosed with dementia (been saying it all along). Is there some kind of Medicare or federal program whereby I could receive money for being her caregiver? My 2 sisters work, and I waqs between jobs when she has really taken a downward turn. We have 2 dogs and they'd have to be locked up if an outside person came in. Plus, our schedules would be all over the place making someone coming in tough for scheduling. I thought there was such a program to allow family members to care for someone, and receive some compensation. Any pointers on where to look would be appreciated.","Depends on the state. Where we are in Minnesota the person can choose to have their Medicare coverage for a nursing assistant or home aid directed to a specific person. There are some pretty specific requirements but you may want to look in to her Medicare eligibility in your state.
Thanks to everyone for your input! Looking into things, but not getting hopes up.
Has your mother had a caregiver in the past? If so, you can contact the company, usually they can pay you instead of them finding an aide for her. Depending on the company requirements you may have to be certified as a PCA or CNA. 
If she has never had an aide, you should call the department of aging and disability. She will have to be evaluated and they can help you start the process. 
Contact your Dept of Aging. It might be state or county level, just look into it. You might be able to get funding, but it might not be enough to pay, just enough for it to provide respite care.
I don't think Medicare does.  In some states, Medicaid provides a caregiver stipend, but it is minuscule.  If she qualifies for Medicaid, there may also be some home health agencies in town that accept Medicaid that could help provide care.
Other than that, unless your mother has the resources to pay YOU for her care, there isn't anything available (I know - just went through this with my dad).  If her paying you is an option, I highly recommend consulting an elder law attorney and getting a Personal Care Contract drafted.

My state has a grant that reimburses some of the cost of caregiving. You find out information at your local senior center. It is called ""Respite"". They also have medical equipment that you can borrow.

,There appear to be no reasonable options,"My SO has been in treatment for a variety of mental illnesses for a decade which inflict them with frequent suicidal ideation.  I can't be at home 24x7x365 if I wish to remain employed (which, after all does feed my children and keep a roof over our heads).  And even if I did, there's no guarantee that I could stop a determined effort to end his/her own life.  He/she has recently voluntarily discontinued therapy and has no intention of finding a new Doctor to resume getting the help he/she needs.

It appears to me that the only option is hospitalization, which I have done before.  However it also appears the best they can do is keep my SO for a few days, run up a bill of many thousands of dollars, and then release him/her.  Since the suicidal thoughts often go on for weeks, this accomplishes nothing toward helping.

It's so frustrating that there are no options for helping someone who is a danger to themselves.  I would blame myself extremely if something happened to him/her and I hadn't done everything humanly possible to stop it.  

Is there some option I'm not seeing here or is this just the state of mental health care in 2017?","
Petition the courts for guardianship. Also (gently): If you're married, have you considered filing for divorce so the medical bills don't become your debt? For guardianship, you will need a Physician's Statement from a physician/psychiatrist that has seen your SO within the last 90 days. The statement must detail the reasons why the physician believes your SO is mentally incapacitated/a danger to himself or others. Any other evidence that can detail the decline and reasons the alleged mentally incapacitated person is in danger is very helpful. Arrest records, history of hospitalizations, etc. 

Under a Guardianship, *you* will be able to decide with the doctor, and (when possible) your SO what care/therapy/placement is needed. This will ensure that if/when your SO goes off of their medications, or experiences a mental health or other health crisis, you can step in and make those for decisions for him/her. 

Guardianship removes an individuals rights, but that doesn't mean the ward cannot be involved in the decision making that affects their life. It is imperative that a ward take part in all of the decision making they are capable of. A Guardian is to insure the ward is living in safety but also with dignity. 

Guardianship is not going to solve all of your or his/her problems. But, you will have control of his/her healthcare decisions, residential placement, hospitalization when needed to help re-stabilize him/her, applying for benefits, or to be able to be kept in the loop with health care and service providers. I wish you the best. It sounds like you're doing your best to handle an incredibly difficult situation with grace while working and caring for children. 
That is seriously heavy. I wish you the best of luck.
Can you work on the desire to blame yourself if something does happen? This is a superhuman scenario. You need to have reasonable expectations about what is within your control and possible. ",2017-05-02 10:44:19,word_terrorist,68tjcz

,I don't know what to do.. Life is crazy,"People are stealing $ and i can’t do anything. It has been like that since I moved in 5 years ago. I feel so powerless to do anything. Any time I want to do anything my dad fights with me and belittles me. Saying I’m not capable of doing it. He has apartments that people are stealing 15k a month from. 

I’m now 26 and he is 86. When i talk to him about my feelings and the way the things he says affect me, he just insults me further calling me a pussy, bitch, piece of shit, etc. (every name in the book). He has this same story he always tells me about my history. How my mother is a whore and my sister isn’t my real sister etc. If I talk about my feelings, he’ll turn it around and talk about himself. He always makes himself a victim when I’m telling him how I’m suffering and unhappy. I feel like a dog. I don't really have a life. I’ve been depressed for years. And when I talk to my dad about it he just says I’m crazy and have a mental condition.. I’m just depressed.. Then he acts like a victim and that I’m there attacking him just because I’m telling him how I feel and that I want change.. I don’t know why he is so mean to me and I can’t reason with him. He always twists things and blames me for everything, makes things up that really hurt me. Every problem is my fault. He blames me for his arthritis flaring up even though it was caused with him getting furious with his horse trainer; I was there taking care of him every day all by myself and he was blaming me all the time... I died and stopped sleeping…  I’ve been doing this for almost 6 years all by myself. My dad is racing horses all over the country. He mindlessly spends 100k+ a year on horses and doesn’t even make 15% of it back. You’d think he’d help me out a little bit with some necessities? I’m driving a 97 Honda with no airbags and in bad condition (I’m dead if I get in a wreck on the freeway, he doesn’t even care.), I don’t have nice things, no life and I’ve given up on it. He doesn’t want me to have nice things. I’m doing anything just to keep him happy so he doesn’t blow up on me. I’m lacking courage and knowledge on what to do. My life has slipped away from me. I’m now 26 and have been here alone since 21. I haven’t done anything for my life in that whole time, I dropped out of college when he got sick with a bowel obstruction and that was it. I haven’t had a life since then. I’ve been so depressed that I don’t even go out; I feel so much anxiety all the time. I have/get social anxiety and this is part of the reason that has stopped me from really finding proper help. I feel like a freak.

When I tell him I need help and I need to talk to someone. He tells me that if I do then I’m out of here! That I won’t get a penny from him. That he’ll just replace me with my brother because he is easier to control. My brother tried taking care of him before, my dad ended up calling the police and getting him kicked out when he threatened he’d shoot him, he lasted a year. I think my dad needs professional help, someone that can actually talk to him. Because the way my dad is he doesn’t listen to anyone. He doesn’t have a problem cursing at people anywhere when he’s upset, even in public. He insults me in public in front of other people.. The memory of him telling me how worthless I am and how he wishes his daughter was still alive taking care of him when we were at the bank has scarred me… I was just trying to help him… He was destroying me in front of the whole bank (echoing all over) just yelling at me how I’m a pussy and I need to be made into a man all because the teller said we had to pay $6 for some copies of checks and I didn’t want to fight with her to get it for free because it is irrational (it feels like fighting for free food from a restaurant..) He thinks only he knows. He is a control freak..  Even if he can’t do things he has to be the one that is in control. I don’t want to stop being around my dad and I do care a whole lot about him. He can be a nice person too. But I just don’t know what to do.. The years are multiplying and my life has slipped from me.  

This is my dad’s life; getting up, watching fox news or going on pc, eating his oatmeal with raisins, blueberries. Talking to his workers, the only people that talk to him are people that work for him.. And my dad doesn’t really treat them too well which is why there is always problems with his horse racing.. He never wins and his trainers usually don’t even care because in my opinion they are upset about the way they are talked to. My dad will hire anyone that will talk to him on the phone and answer it. He doesn’t care for my opinions, I can tell right away when a trainer won’t work out and he doesn’t listen. I’ve been right every time.. He is always having conflict at the race track, complaints and conflicts about every season. I’m not trying to make him stop because I know it makes him happy but I know there are better ways to do things and he doesn’t care for it. Even though he is just throwing everything away.. 0% chance to make anything back and I’m there helping him along the whole way, doing what he orders.. So my dad spends his days watching fox news, on the phone, or on the pc(writing letters, reading articles, watching videos.) He can walk around. But he will hardly do anything important for himself no matter if I remind him every day. He will never fix himself something to eat even though the fridge is full of food. He would rather just eat an apple for the day or a can of sardines so I'm forced to feed him every day because he refuses to feed himself. It feels like the only thing he cares about are politics and his horses. I wrote more than I thought and if you made it this far thank you for taking the time.
","Do you have any ability to support yourself? Do you work outside the home?
 
There is a really good caregiver's website at https://www.agingcare.com/caregiver-forum/caregiver-burnout
 
I would suggest that you go there are repost your story while carefully covering some of the language. (Use p****y instead). You need help and you need it now from people who've been there. Take extremely good care of yourself in the meantime. Go out more. Go for a walk. Grab a coffee. Find a park to sit in where you can catch your breath. Use caregiver forum for mental support. Do anything and everything to protect your mind. 
 
You might also seriously consider taking a class locally that you'd enjoy. You need a distraction and mental break. It would benefit you greatly to interact with others who aren't mentally unstable. It would help you regain perspective about yourself.
 
You should also make an appointment with a doctor to seek treatment for depression. An antidepressant could help your whole situation more bearable and feel less oppressive.

,My mom won't eat,"Hi, I'm in need of advice or even just commiseration.  

She is 82, and has very recently become ill.  Prior to December 2016 she's lived independently and seemed 10 years younger than her age, no serious chronic health problems.

In December she had a fall which turned out to be related to an undiagnosed UTI, which I know (now) can cause terrible whacky symptoms in elderly people while younger people are just uncomfortable.  After the fall she seemed to slowly and steadily decline... she became very weak and lost her appetite.  It came back briefly when she was treated for the UTI but at this point she has fallen off a cliff health wise.  She was eventually diagnosed with a large ulcer in her small intestine which obviously would have contributed to her loss of appetite, although she has been treated for it and by all signs the ulcer isn't bleeding anymore.  Nevertheless the lingering, most difficult issue to treat is turning out to be her loss of appetite and refusal to eat.  She will have a few bites of something, but it's barely enough to sustain her.  

She's in a rehab unit of a nursing home but I don't see her being able to ever leave due to how weak she is, unless she can turn things around and start eating relatively normally again.  I know the nursing home food is probably not great but it honestly doesn't seem to matter.  Prior to her health deteriorating to the point that she needed to leave her home she had access to any and every kind of food she could think of that she might like to have, and nothing tasted good to her.

At this point I'm wondering if it is what I've seen described as 'failure to thrive,' or if she has some terrible undiagnosed cancer that we haven't found yet.  That seems unlikely but I won't say it's impossible.  She was in the hospital for a few days prior to the nursing home and they did a number of tests to rule things out.    

Thanks for reading, any advice, words of encouragement or a reality check are welcome.  ","Maybe try a supplement drink like Ensure or Boost. See which one she likes best. It can be substituted for meals as well. Check with her doctor first to see if it's a good option for her. I'm sorry you're going through this and I hope she gets strong enough go home soon. 
It could definitely be a learned fear of food from the recent ulcer. If she experiences pain when swallowing or nausea afterwards, it could definitely cause her to not want to eat. Likely that's not the case as you said tests were already run, but it never hurts to double check. 

Is there a particular food that she always loved prior to this? Try bringing that food over for her to try and slowly incorporate into her nursing home meals. Alternatively, look at this post I made yesterday for some other strategies to help increase one's intake of food. It is possible that she has experienced a change in her taste buds given all the recent changes. https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/5zv7c4/finicky_eaterbored_wmeals_but_doesnt_know_what/df2qzow/
My dad is not eating either.  Claims he has no appetite.  His morning caregiver has caught him throwing out most of his breakfast.  When I get home and get him dinner, he usually picks at it or when I walk away, throws it away.  I've started making him protein shakes. He loves them and he drinks the whole thing.  If I make him a berry flavored shake/smoothie I add It Works Greens.  At least I know when he has a shake/smoothie he's getting the nutrition he needs, although actually eating a meal is hands down better. 

I've been told that one reason older folks stop eating is because their taste buds aren't as sensitive anymore and nothing has any flavor and that ""sweet"" is the last flavor to go.  That's why they start gravitating towards sweet things and smoothies usually taste sweet.

I worry about failure to thrive also, daddy is down to 125 lbs.  Have you tried talking to you mom about it?  Ask her why she's not eating? Is she worried about the ulcer?  Nothing taste good?  Stomach hurting?  Having a hard time swallowing?  Having difficulty feeding herself?  Also ask her doctor(s) about giving her something to increase her appetite.

I know that when daddy is in the hospital/rehab he gets depressed and stops eating.  You might want to check on that too.  I have removed my dad from a rehab facility because he was horribly depressed, had stopped eating, and was failing to thrive, The ""medical professionals"" wouldn't listen to me they just kept saying he was old and it was a normal end of life process.  Once I got him home, he perked right up.
I read some time back a situation with a child whose mother would not eat. They at first tried ultimatums like if you don't eat then you cannot do X or Y. Frankly, this is the way I would have approached it. However, the poster said that approach was only marginally successful but when one of the other caregivers who worked with her would frame the discussion during chit chat as more of a negotiation - something like - 'if you eat all your lunch now we can catch the nursing home bus to the mall and get that sweater you mentioned to me' the mother would eat. Needless to say it sounded like meal time was a chore but the post made sense after reading thru the caregivers logic.

If I can find the post I'll post in here for you. Best of luck.
There is a mouth wipe they use in hospitals to induce thirst. I have found that gently giving them one spoonful of water or liquid at a time works. Jello can be made a little healthier, doesn't cause aspiration, and is a familiar food. Work your way into smoothies.  Give very small portions and come back again and again. Be cheerful and loving.
I don't mean to pry, but did the hospital diagnose your grandmother with sepsis by any chance? That always takes my mom time to bounce back from, particularly appetite-wise.

My mom gets UTIs ALL the time (about every two and a half months like clockwork). About half the time the infection becomes sepsis, which is when a ""normal"" infection like a UTI enters the bloodstream and becomes a sort of full-body infection.

A lot of times sepsis results in an altered mental state after recovery. Exactly how altered, and for how long, varies between people. My mom has snapped back to her normal mentation before we've left the hospital before, but I think the longest it took was five months.

During those times after sepsis... Zero appetite. So I guess what I'm taking a really long time to say is, it's possible your grandmother will gradually grow to like food all on her own. Just, after a serious infection, the brain takes a bit of time to return to normal, if it's a super bad one :(. 

Additionally... I have some sneaky tips to share :). When my mom isn't eating, we try to slip in calories in, say, the cooking oil. Half again or double oil in the stir fry, just add extra seasonings and flour and call it the sauce. Butter or avocado on the bread under the egg. Cream in the soup as a thickener with the flour. Fruit and protein powder in the cereal. Extra slice of cheese in the sandwich, etc. 

In a nursing home this is harder to do, but if you can encourage her to eat a meal with you and bring the food in (""I just won a radio contest! Celebratory lunch time!""... lame I know, but it's worked on my mom before :) ), you can maybe encourage her to eat as a celebration of something.

It's definitely not a lot of extra calories, but if I can add 100 or 150 calories to the one egg sandwich she eats as her only meal over the course of two days... Sometimes I think it might help :(. 
When my grandmother stopped eating much, i began using boost vhc and boost breeze and benecalorie to increase caloric intake. All three items together are about eighteen ounces in total and about 1200 calories.",2017-03-18 20:45:56,timmmmah,607htf

,Self-care Time!,"Self-care is often neglected among caregivers. However, a lack of self-care and poor wellbeing will affect the way you interact with your loved ones. 

What are some of the ways you practice self-care? ","I've been a caregiver for about 9 years, now.  My preferred method of self care is meditation in various forms and spending time with my girlfriend. My meditation comes in the form of physical activity where I focus on nothing but the activity. For me, these are weightlifting, yoga, shooting (guns), playing videogames, journaling, and cooking. My girlfriend plays an important role in that she allows me to vent to her, but once it's over we have a rule that I'm not allowed to talk about those I care for. 

Good luck, and remember that your well being is just as important as those you are for!
Saw a post about caregivers who don't prioritize their own needs. The article I read mentioned a caregiver who wanted to goto church but minimized the importance of the desire by saying I might want to goto church this weekend if anyone is around to help care for mom. The article said the caregiver should be more specific in their statement and direct in their desire for self. The article said the person should have said I want to goto church this weekend and need your help watching mom while I go. the article said if the person gets shot down its not typically a personal attack and positions the person for the next opportunity.

There was a bit more to the story but I thought you might find this little bit I remember helpful.
I have a hard time justifying self care when I have so little time left to take care of my wife.    I've been going to school full-time and soon I'll be bumping up to full-time work and full-time school.  Along with taking care of her and everything else I'm not sure when I'll sleep but that's what has to happen or else we'll sink.  I want to think it'll be okay as it's only for a few years to get my degrees finished but that's what I've been telling myself already for so long.  My self care is sleeping, and my own medical crap prevents that from helping much.  Im 100% VA disabled but I'm the caregiver, parent, salary worker too.  I don't know.
Taking a few breaks and just being alone with my thoughts helps a lot when things feel stressful or I am feeling overwhelmed. I agree that physical activity helps a ton. Going to the gym for at least 20 min helps refresh my mind and I am able to take on more problems in calm positive manner. Deep breaths! ",2017-03-01 12:05:03,,5wx73n

,"AMA Announcment: Judy Cornish, Sunday 19th, 11 a.m. EST –11 am Monday the 20th","Hi, 
My name is Judy Cornish. I’d like to share something we’ve discovered at DAWN; there is very good news for families with someone experiencing dementia—that people with dementia can live happily and safely when we support their intuitive thought skills and experiential selves.  We’ve found that when we focus on and support the abilities rather than disabilities of dementia, our clients are happier and their families can postpone costly long-term care. 
I’m an elder law attorney who became involved with dementia. I’ve spent the past six years working with people with dementia, most of whom live in their own homes. I began to see a pattern in their functioning that medical science does not pick up: they were losing rational thought but not intuitive thought, and losing their remembering selves but not their experiential selves. 
I’ve written a book outlining my findings, which will be available on Amazon this spring. We’re trying to get the word out to families so that more people with dementia will be cared for in ways that support their autonomy and dignity, and more families will be able to avoid being bankrupted by institutional care. 
I’m hoping to take part in your AMA program.

Best regards,

Judy Cornish

,"Dementia, mental sharpness & caregiving.","I recently learned from a social worker that ""Dementia"" covers a massive range of disorders. Just as mental ""healthiness"" is also a wide range.

She does a support group for the spouses of dementia patients, and found that just by having spouses attending a group, the rate of the patient's decline actually slowed.

On the other end... I have 92 year old friends who act and think like someone half their age, and it's as if their mental capabilities never declined. They don't need caregivers unless physically sick. I asked one of them to share his advice and he said most seniors have no ""imagination"" about aging and that the stereotypes people have about it is why die earlier, and ADP makes them sick. 

The thing they have in common is they're artists, and don't have any attachment to the way ""society"" wants them to be and act.

It would be so incredible if there were a transformative program for patients and caregivers to help them get inspired and be like these people. I know there are creative arts programs in the senior and patient communities, and wouldn't it be awesome to take it to the next level there with real rigor?

I wonder if you all know about programs or other communities that support this kind of thing. I hate how people talk about seniors as if they are all the same. It's like talking about adolescents, 20 to 40somethings as if they all had the same tendencies.

And beyond keeping them healthy, I also believe the wisdom of the wise ""silver"" generations needs to be gathered somehow.

I really love my older counterparts in humanity and want to help spread the love... thoughts?



","I have an older friend who I've known for quite awhile. Since I've lived in the same house for a number of years, I've assumed the care-giving duties. I was heartbroken about the hard line that the son took when he spoke about his fears about losing his license. His son replied ""Everyone loses their driving license."" as if it was somehow inevitable. I really hate the way his son talks to him. Seems to me that before my friend got ill, he was treated with a lot more respect.",2017-02-13 17:28:50,_oracle-,5tw2sd

With that, educate a new caregiver. 

What are the issues that you have found is some of the hardest to deal with or learn around?","Frustration/impatience. When you deal with someone that has memory issues and repeats the same question OVER and OVER - you feel like you want to explode at them for being so... I don't know, dumb and/or forgetful. But to THEM, they're asking the question for the first time, every time. It's really hard to keep that at the forefront of your mind when it's 4am and you had to get up to clean them up from an accident and they want to ask you a bunch of questions (ie, the same one over and over). Or even if they're doing it in the middle of the day, really - just harder at night when you're already exhausted and trying to deal with everything.
Massive amounts of patience helps.  Not only as Kwip mentions, for memory issues, but also speed at which they can do anything.  Get out of a car, make a decision, etc.  You'll want to find a balance between letting them participate in decisions (e.g. whats for dinner) vs. the time they take to make such choices.  For this example, give them a limited list of options and go from there.... ""This or That"" questions are much easier on everyone then open ended ones.

Also, keep in mind that emotional and mental hit they are taking as they have largely lost their independence and now need help for basic survival.  That weighs heavily on a lot of sick people, there's guilt on their end & they may express it in ways that aren't helpful.
Perhaps you were like me and some of my friends as kids- we would eagerly wait until our parents would leave for an extended trip or couldn't wait to get out of the house. So to answer your question from my perspective- some of the things that annoyed me as a child in the care of my parent came back as a child now caring for the parent where said parent is living with my wife and I. If you had a personality conflict when you lived with them or your spouse did then think through how to navigate some of the landmines that may come up. If you drink and your parents frowned on it then having them close again where you might still be sipping the sauce is sure to get a cross eye if not one of those under the breath comments. 

Under the breath comments are the worst- its a statement phrased in a way to criticize you and your behavior without directly calling you out on it. 

Lastly- the manipulations. If your parents were master manipulators of your behavior be ready for some form of that to possibly come roaring back.

Best of luck!

I am a young man of 38 who has had a long career in sales, but recently had to find a different job/career.
I will soon be starting as a care giver for a spastic, who is wheel chair bound, and will need help with everyday tasks.
The person i will be caring for is very nice & kind. We hit it off pretty well during the interview, and no experience was needed. I will be trained to all the tasks, but i still feel i need some tools to prepare me for the task. I was hopping you could help me prepare psychologically to the task.

Of course the hygiene is my top concern, and how i will cope with that, but i am sure that there must be other areas to the job that will be challenging, that i don't know of.

what advice can you give a complete newbie?

,How to confront,"So, I'm an in-home caregiver for a 78 year old Alzheimer's patient that lives with her granddaughter and granddaughter's husband. In my contract, it says I am responsible for ""light housework."" I take this to mean, the dishes we use, her laundry, light tidying, vacuuming. 

Well, I come in and the kitchen has been torn apart, no dishes done (and its worse ten fold on Monday's!), trash left all over the counters, tables and floors. They literally put no effort into cleaning up after themselves.

I have been doing the dishes for the past couple months, but it's just unloading and loading a dishwasher. Over the past couple of weeks it has escalated into me needing to deep clean the kitchen every day.

I also had a note waiting for me this morning asking me to dust and clean the bathtub and mop.

Any suggestions on confronting this? Part of me wants to leave a snarky note that' says ""I'm not your damn maid,"" but that's obviously not the most professional route.

Edit to add: my client hasn't been given basic care all weekend either. Her hair hasn't been brushed, she's still in the same clothes as she was on Friday, her medicine reminder is empty. ","You can call social services. This is elder neglect. Straight up. Also, I would suggest asking for an updated, detailed list of expectations. If the expectations are that you are a caregiver and maid, well... You can either request a pay raise based on that or tell them to hire a maid. You need to get their expectations in writing, an agreement regarding the plan of care. [This site](http://www.homesweethomecareinc.com/cargiving-training-education/what-is-in-home-elder-care/light-housekeeping/) details what light housekeeping is, basically maintaining the space the CLIENT uses and picking up after the CLIENT. Not the family. Just a thought.  
Who hired you? Was it the patient's children or the grandchildren? If it was the children, I'd definitely take it up with them. Well - regardless, you're probably going to have to take it up with whoever hired you, even if it was the grandchildren. But /u/peace_core is right, not caring for the client is elder neglect. And not to be a jerk or anything, but it is worth noting that if you're aware of it and don't intercede, you're liable (and that's such an asshole statement I hate to even point it out - I only do so to give you more fuel for your fire!).

I'm so sorry you're having to deal with this - I can only imagine how incredibly infuriating it's got to be. You're a better person than me - I would have been flipping tables about the second time I walked in on that. =P",2017-01-17 08:50:26,steadymachete,5oi5gb
,What can I do to make sure I give the best care for my clients and their families?,"Hi, it's my first time posting on here and I just want some input mostly. I'm working as a caregiver full time in order to gain some more experience before pursuing a nursing career. Anyway, just by reading these posts and by interacting with my families, I understand how stressful it can be when you have to be the main care provider for a loved one. What can I do in order to go above and beyond in order to help my families and relive some of that stress? When I'm at their home I do the basics. Continence care, making sure they don't fall, basic meal prep, light housecleaning, companionship, staying alert (as in not sleeping while I'm working) and if they have dementia or Alzheimer's then I make sure they don't wander off. I really do love all of my clients and most of the time their families are just as wonderful and kind as they are. So I'm just wondering what else could I do in order to make sure I'm providing the best care that I possibly can? If you have a caregiver come into your home to relieve you for a few hours what do you like that they do and what do you wish they would do differently, if anything at all? What would make your life a little easier?  

Edit: I've only been a paid caregiver since October so I'm still learning. I have prior experience when my grandmother was in hospice, but I was still in high school so I wasn't nearly as involved as I am now. ","The basic necessities are helpful but going above and beyond to help these families could be just as rewarding and as simple as your presence. Their stress and worries will not dissolve by a simple task but you being there is helping them physically and emotionally, even if it doesn't always feel as though it is enough at times. If you want to do more you could always engage with the client and do some form of hobby with them. I've heard from our caregivers that doing activities with patients and/or getting them out and about can boost not only their attitude but it reflects on their family as well. Maybe ask your patient or their family what kind of activities they used to enjoy and help them participate in them again. 

You seem like a wonderful caregiver and I wish you all the best. 
Sounds like you have it covered:)

I suggest, keeping a log, left with your client for their family. 

Documenting is very important to having program hours maintained or even increased.

Stay on top of communication. 

Ask the families what you could do to help relieve their stress. 

Take your client outside on nice days, if it is possible. 

Take care of yourself. Recognize the signs of *burn out* and act accordingly. Caring too much can leave you raw.

,Encouraging mother to get exercise?,"In many ways, I am lucky to have a mother who's in her eighties, but still in relatively good physical and mental condition. She lives on her own (with her cat), can still drive locally, works in the yard sometimes, etc... She's not overweight, walks perfectly upright, and has good balance. 

On the other hand, she is allowing herself to become physically deconditioned, and I can't seem to talk her into getting some regular exercise even though it is the obvious answer to the problems she has. Her blood pressure is getting higher, she's having some trouble sleeping, and complains about feeling tired. She still pays to belong to a nice country club that has a gym and paid staff who know how to help older members, but she always has some excuse like, ""I don't know what I would wear."" I also suspect that she's depressed, particularly after my older brother died three years ago. I think getting some regular exercise would help her stay stronger, improve her mood, and help her blood pressure, and it would probably help her get a better night's sleep. 

Whenever I check on her, I find her sitting on the sofa watching TV. There's nothing preventing her from getting exercise except sheer obstinance. 

I'm concerned that if she doesn't start getting more exercise, her health will decline. 

Has anyone had any success with this? ","Can you go with her? Sometimes, at least at first, it can be helpful to have company.
I would recommend talking to her about seeing therapist. It seems like she has anxiety about going to workout at the gym or maybe has some social anxiety that's stopping her. The noncompliance with behaviors to keep herself healthy makes this more of a mental issue than anything else. Maybe she's anxious or depressed, but I've found that therapists are a huge help when it comes to physical health that many people don't take advantage of. I hope this made sense, it's super early in the morning. But good luck to you and your mother!
Being up and active besides spending time exercising can definitely help her at her age. Does she have hobbies that might get her up and off the couch, like gardening, mall shopping, or easy walking trails nearby? I also agree about making it a social activity- she'll be more likely to go and do things if she has friends and family expecting her there.",2017-01-01 22:22:38,Astabledivider,5lj1df

,Alzheimer's/Dementia Question,"I live with and take care of my father. In the last week he has gone from mostly engaged to very quiet and detached. Otherwise, health is fine. My question is does he know how much time passes in between me interacting with him? I am worrying myself to death that I am not providing enough companionship for him even though I speak to him and engage him at least once an hour.","I am not a doctor so I can not say for sure what stage your father is in or if he is definitely cognitively aware, however we do have hundreds of clients similar to him so from my knowledge and experience I would say yes. A lot of times dementia/Alzheimer patients will become withdrawn when their memory starts to slip more but they do know what is going on around them. They don't want others to notice or judge them for repeating or not understanding something so they become detached. I'm sure it's not that he doesn't want to talk but that he doesn't want to say something wrong or worry you if he does. I would continue interacting with him like you are and remind him that you are there for whatever he needs. Remind him that his opinion is important regardless of how silly he might think it sounds. Doing activities together that you both would enjoy is a great way to keep his mind active and to increase conversation as well. 

I hope this helps!

,How to care for a caregiver..,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post...little background...my dad (70 yrs old) has been my mom's (67 years old) primary caregiver at home for the last 8 years after she suffered a heart attack, and has had increasingly occurring CHF, being hospitalized up to 16 times last year. She has developed dementia in the last few years which causes a ton of problems from refusing to take medications to refusing to acknowledge her condition. It became too much for my Dad to deal with at home, and in September we were able to get her approved for Medicaid and transferred to a nursing home. 

She HATES it. She's on hospice, so she can refuse all her medications, so at least there's is that battle we don't have to fight anymore. But she hates being there, she's mean to some of the staff, her dementia is getting worse, and she's just downright mean to most people who are trying to help her.

Dad goes to visit with her most days. Brings her snacks and coffee, and sits with her while she watches the fish tank in the day room. But she's generally just depressed and wants to go home.

Fast forward to today and Dad just called me crying. He just can't take it anymore, the thought of doing christmas with her in the nursing home is tearing him up. He feels like he's just going through the motions, not able to get anything accomplished. Finds himself at home just staring at the wall. A few months ago his Dr prescribed Lexapro to help with depression and anxiety, with my coaxing.  I don't know if he's still taking it, but I know that in some cases it can make depression more severe. 

And now mom JUST called him and asked him to see if he can find a priest to come pray for her because she doesn't think she is going to be around much longer...

I don't know how to help.

TL;DR Dad is having a hard time coping with the first christmas with mom in the nursing home. I don't know how to help.","I'm the primary caregiver for my wife. She's blind, on dialysis, can't walk and lacks control of her left arm. This is the short list. She spent 8 months last year in the hospital and nursing home.  I at least was able to take her home for the holidays. The depression set in for me after she came home. Having to constantly care for her was rough, mentally and physically.  Severe anxiety set in. I could not get any thing done without breaking down into tears. Suicide was on my mind all the time. I was driving home from dropping her at dialysis one day, and pulled into a psychologists office. They got me in immediately.  She recommended antidepressants. I start those and continued with therapy. Best thing I've done. The biweekly appointments for talk therapy are great. It's a chance for me to say what I want without judgment.  I rarely remember much of the conversation the next day. I just know that I was able to lift a big weight off of my shoulders. And that gets me through.  Support groups dot work for me. I don't like large groups and would never talk about what u do with the therapist. Maybe dad needs that opportunity. 
Depending on the area, there may be support groups for family caregivers, or ones dealing with dementia in particular. The nursing home staff may be able to connect him with one. It can help IMMENSELY to be able to talk with someone in a similar situation.
Does he have family nearby to take him out for a few hours to give him a brief respite from his situation? 
I'm so sorry to hear about your parents. Caregiving depression and ""burnout"" is not uncommon in family caregivers. It is a full time job and a life that many have a hard time coping with, especially over the holidays. We here at GT call it the ""holiday blues"" and we see it all too often in our caregivers and clients during December. Hopefully now that the holidays are over he's feeling a little better. I see many have said medication and counseling. Although both of those are definitely key to helping with depression we also suggest to our employees to remember to take care of themselves first. Reducing stress by journaling their thoughts, talking with family members, seeking help, taking long walks, getting a dog, even finding a center that offers activities for your fathers age will help. It sound to me like he needs to get out. It's hard to watch your loved one dissipate while you're forced to move forward with your life. It's something many have a hard time coping with but it has to be done.

Hopefully your father will find the answer he needs. Dementia is not easy to watch a loved one go through, but we hope that they both find peace. ",2016-12-21 17:18:53,Archiesmom,5jmthb

,Single mom of 14 yo with CP. I'm crumbling.,"In this last year my son's father, my ex-husband, passed away after losing his battle with mental illness. His heart gave out from the scar tissue that engulfed it, secondary to open heart surgery he had to save his life after stabbing himself three years ago on my porch. He passed away while my son was in a pediatric rehab facility for three months recovering from an orthopedic surgery. I lived in that hospital for three months. 

I work full time. I go to nursing school part time. I receive no financial assistance of any sort. I do get help in the form of an aide who comes in the morning, and most recently someone who comes for 6 hours on a Sunday so I can go and get my nails done or study. 

All my life I've always been able to adapt so quickly. I wake up each day with a smile, with the hope that today will be better. 

But lately. Lately is different. The heartbreak that my son may never marry, or learn to read, or drive a car. The dozens of medical needs that I have to file in my brain on a daily basis (GI, urologist, orthotics, wheelchair, neuro, PT, OT etc.). The excruciating pain of his father's death. I loved that man with every cell of my body, but had to let him go when his mental illness threatened my son's safety and mine. The burden of paying the rent, the bills. Trying to involve my son in activities, sports. Alone. If I don't do it, no one else will. And as time has gone on, family slowly has distanced themselves. Evan is too hard for everyone. Too heavy to lift, requires a patience few of them have. Can't just throw him in the car and go to the park for a selfie session. 

I am so tired. There are no words to describe my exhaustion. And there is no longer a light.  It's gone. All I see is a grey expanse of exhaustion. 

I just needed to share. Are there any single mom's of a physically disabled child out there? With no siblings? Just an only child? Because the solitude of just me and my son. It's a battle all it's own. If there's anyone out there, please say hello. 

Even writing this though, lightened the burden a smidge. I can get through today. Put on a smile. Throw some Christmas music on. I have to be okay. I'm all he has. ","Hey there. I'm in a different situation (eldercare for a disabled parent with no capacity for self-care), but I do understand the exhaustion and the feeling of ""If I don't, no one will"". Even those few hours a week when someone else is there to shoulder that load is so important, and I want to say I'm glad you take that time to, at least some of the time, do something for yourself. 

It's hard to be immersed in constant vigilance for another and not lose yourself to the situation. We have to find things, even little ones, that are just for us, and hang on tight to those. We have to remember, we are living for ourselves, so that we can help them live better lives.

I'm sure it's a different feeling when caring for a child, because the parental care instinct is coupled with the feeling that you're so needed. Don't worry though, it's not about comparing his life to what others have, it's about him having the best quality of life he can. That's all any of us, disabled or not, can hope for, and you're providing that.

This sub is very low traffic, so I'm sorry that you haven't gotten much response, but just know there are people with similar situations, quite possibly close to you. Sometimes all you need is another person listening and saying no more than ""I hear you, and I understand"". Support groups might be a valid option but finding them is often hard, I'd check with the professionals who help with your son to see if they know of any, or know others who might be able t point you in the right direction. Or, barring that, you can always put up a few flyers for a coffee meetup in your area, if you can find the time with your schedule.

I hear you, and I understand.
It's amazing how cathartic it can be to share your problems, the anonymous internet is good for that at least :)

I wasn't caring for a child, but I was the sole support for my husband (recently passed away).  I felt like this many times, but in the end, I feel like I did the best job I could and made his quality of life the best we could afford until his body gave out.  I guess what I'm trying to say is in the end if you outlive him, you won't have any regrets about your life if do the best you can.  

It's ok to get tired of it all, just don't let it drag you down too far.  

Not sure if a 'hindsight' post is useful or not, but it's my first on this sub since he passed away.  I'm not sure if I fit into this group anymore or not but I'm a mod so I'll try. :)

You may want to find CP specific forums or reddit subs as well, they are probably more populated.  It's amazing how much strength you can get from internet friends.
Thank you both for your kind and thoughtful responses. They meant the world to me. I tried replying to each of you individually but the app I'm using makes it impossible. After a few lines the keyboard covers your words! 🙄 And you can't scroll up! 

I try, every day, to fully embrace the concept of making his life as happy and complete and fulfilled as can be, and spend less time comparing his life to others. But I'm not quite there yet, and that is what is haunting me right now. Especially with adolescence, as the divide between him and his peers widens exponentially. He's 15 and still frequently incontinent, barely reading, and can't be left alone while other kids his age are starting to think about college. It's painfully heartbreaking. But I know for him, I have to get through this. And for myself. I can't succumb to the grief. 

Again, thank you both, truly. 
That sounds so overwhelming.  I know you feel like you are crumbling, but if you read what you wrote, you will realize how strong you truly are.  Not many people can do all the things that you do.

,Still not sure what to do...,"My main question is how do I get care if I don't qualify and can't pay?

I was lucky when I developed Crohn's at puberty, my mom was a hospice nurse long before and was able to bathe me several times per day. She had a slow progressing cancer and died soon after stabilized. The only problem is, I never really stabilized. Now I'm 29 and I still am not sure how to get help to become a productive member of society. I don't know how much longer I should hold out hope. Those who have family to care for them are so lucky. My family preferred to throw things away rather than offer them to me.

The Crohn's is bearable. It's not being able to do anything more than meet my most basic needs that is frustrating, and that I will never be able to find love, and friendship often seems out of reach.

When I'm sick, it gets 100 times worse. Yes, just sick, no special name for it. I've been to the ER so many times for dehydration I can't even count. Sorry but some people are not cut out for giving care, not even for themselves. I'm actually a bit optimistic that, if I were to get care, maybe my health will improve enough so I can get a job or go to college. I don't need someone to bathe me or wipe my butt or wheel me around, so I don't get anything.","1) Are you eligible for disability?

,I just realized my mom may have Schizophrenia,"So my mom has an incurable illness(MS) and is completely bedridden  and so me and my dad take care of her. Over the years I noticed that she has become increasingly unstable at times. Like 99% of the time she's rational but that 1% of the time she's completely irrational. I mean hearing voices thinking its Jesus telling her things. Now I would love to get her professional help but she's completely against doctors to the point of I usually have to over rule her decision not to go to the doctor if I believe it is necessary. So I only force it when completely necessary. She has a very hard life I don't want to make it harder by forcing unnecessary hardships like power of attorney or anything else like that and no having someone come to the home isn't possible. She barely tolerates the doctor prescribed nurses and I don't want to turn her against the idea of having medical professionals come to the home because she has done that in the past. 

I simply want to know if anyone else has dealt with a similar situation and if so how have you handled it?","Are you her health care surrogate? Meaning, will her doctors talk to you about her care? I'd suggest calling her doctor and tell him/her your concerns. Give them specific examples. If she's on medication, it could be a side effect and they may want to change what she's taking. Or if it's actually a mental disorder manifesting, they'll definitely want to address that, too.
Honkey gave great advice, but unfortunately if your mom is completely unwilling to take part in improving her own situation there is not much you can do, even with a POA, aside from having her committed.

Sorry you are going through this, you are not alone.

 I appreciate the replies. Sometimes I get frustrated that life can be so cruel. My mom is a great person and seeing her go through this just breaks me sometimes. 
I'm new here but I wanted to suggest two alternatives to schizophrenia. 

1. Bladder and urinary tract infections can make older people see and hear things and can look like dementia. They can be REALLY hard to clear up. **That would be my first suggestion since she is bedridden and avoids doctors and I'm assuming things like regular blood work that would catch them early.**

  My grandma swears there is no pain when she has one. 

   My grandma gets them frequently and when she clear of them she is super sharp. We always know she's getting one because she stops being on top of things at 101. 

2. (TWO) I'm a caregiver to two of my children who have schizoaffective. It's cycling so they psychotic part is infrequent. 

It may not be schizophrenia. I would check into those two angles first.

,What skills do you recommend learning as a caregiver?,"I'm trying to prepare for when I take care of my parents. The dream is they will retire on the lake in Arizona and I'll take care of them. Hopefully we have at least 15 years before then. 

As my mother-in-law has early onset Alzheimer's, I know sh@& happens and life is short.

What do you wish you knew earlier as a caregiver. What skills should I acquire now while my parents are still relatively young and active?

Thanks!","Not sure about skills... more like preparation. Very honest conversations about their wishes and finances (example: is there ever a situation in which they'd prefer to be in a nursing home? some people are very uncomfortable with family doing 'hands on' care like diaper changes, etc). Very honest conversations about DNR and medical decisions. Access to bank accounts/finances, POA for medical and financial decisions. Make a back up plan for if/when you can't care for them. 
Social service support, where to find it & how to get it when you need it. Office on Aging, home health care. You also need to know the ins and outs of their medical issues, medications. 
I wish I would have known when to hand over her care to professionals. I about killed myself over her care at the end, because she was beyond what I could help with and i was burning out. Yet, there was still a process that required work on my part to get her into a facility that could care for her. It is stressful and you need to take care of yourself. If you feel their care is too much for you then trust yourself and get help before you crash and burn. They usually are oblivious to the amount of stress you feel, but that doesn't make it less important.
I wish we had practiced how to assist with dressing/undressing. Having those set routines would have made things a bit easier, and maybe gotten some ideas about wardrobe changes we should have made sooner (e.g. swapping out bras for camisoles).

Honestly though, as other commenters said, preparation is more important than developing any particular skill. You will learn those when the time comes. The other commenters have given lots of good ideas of things to prepare: Power of Attorney, DNR/end of life plans, etc


Some of the skills I've acquired were the results of problems that arose.  Four days after my wife was admitted into hospice care, the on-call hospice nurse gave me a quick & dirty in-service on safe patient transfers, due to a fall that resulted in EMS performing a patient transfer to the hospital bed.  Related to that incident, my wife's regular hospice nurse provided a quick tip on how to safely clean the patient's rear after doing #2 (have them lean forward while you go to town with tp and baby wipes from the back).

Also, if and when durable medical equipment is required, take into account space needed for the furniture, as well as moving the patient around.  For example, if the likelihood of falling is high, you may need to consider things like a bedside commode and a gait belt.  This would be especially true if the bathroom is not ADA compliant.
Getting Ready!  Learn what you can about Alzheimer's. Start practicing health habits for yourself and self-care, So when the time comes these are habits you have in place to keep YOU healthy too!

,Let's talk about promotional posts,"Hi guys - posting here on behalf of myself and /u/Turn478, your friendly neighborhood mods. As you may know, we're pretty strict about any sort of promotional or self-publicizing posts, particularly from anyone that's not a ""real"" Redditor (that is, someone with SOME sort of post history). We don't allow links to blogs, media websites, etc, unless they come from someone other than the author/creator and someone with a post history demonstrating they've engaged in conversation on Reddit - they don't have to have submitted posts, but they must have commented/engaged SOMEwhere.

I feel pretty strongly about that, because I want this place to be sort of a peer-to-peer support sub - a place for venting and talking with people in the same/similar situation. I don't want this to be a place for proselytizing, selling products, promoting your blog, etc. 

However, with /u/ravenmxc's post, we had to take a long look at our policy. My knee-jerk reaction was to drop the banhammer, because it's self-promotion to a site where (s)he gets paid from. BUT - it is a pretty useful site. There are a lot of good products on there that I've personally used, organized in a very easy-to-find fashion. This isn't meant as a ringing endorsement, simply what it is.

Sooooo... I say all this to say: /u/Turn478 and I have talked it over, and we want to get some input from you guys, since this is *our* community: should we allow *useful* promotional sites? Maybe in a sidebar? A sticky post, rotated once a month/week or something? Something different? Let us know, we'd love for your input to work out policies/rules that work for all of us!

Wub,
Your mods

TL;DR - How should we handle promotional posts?","I am fine with relevant products and services. that are respectful, clear, and in integrity personally. 
As kwip says, most of the mod work here revolves around self promotional posts and deciding what's acceptable. So we'd like to know what you all prefer. I like the sticky post idea so it all stays in one place and can be ignored.

My main concern is to keep the more predatory posts out of the sub, ones made by people pushing caregiving services through questionable websites, whose user names and post histories clearly indicate they are shills :). 
I don't know the post you're speaking about, but as a reminder;

**Just about every wound care supplier will send free samples.**

I didn't need this for my mom, but this saved me SO MUCH money after my colostomy, when I was still figuring out which products worked best for me. I went home from the hospital with a few samples from my Wound Care nurse, who told me to call, and holy crap, every one of them came through.

I'd never invest in a full supply of anything before trying it, especially where something like compromised skin is concerned (and you might not have unlimited insurance/funds). After my reversal, I donated everything I had left to my wound care nurse, to pass on to the next person still figuring it out.

,"Hi there, can I join you guys? And also vent a little?","I just found this sub, and I think it may be a big help to me.  This may be long and very whiny, but I feel like I can't vent to anyone IRL besides my best friend (who is in a similar situation with her mother, but she doesn't live with her yet) or I'll sound like an asshole.  Maybe I am an asshole.  I don't know.  I just know I'm tired.

So, I'm 41. I'm divorced with 3 children, and engaged to a wonderful, patient man.  Last year, my dad decided he wanted to retire and move down to live with us.  It was nice at first, but it's starting to wear me down.  

I guess I should have known what I was in for from the beginning.  We had to move to a new house so we'd have enough room for everyone, doubling our rent.  We moved in over a weekend, then the next Monday drove two states away to bring him and his stuff back.  When we got there, he hadn't packed a single thing.  So we spent two days packing his stuff, then moving him down.  This was how we spent our summer ""vacation"" last year.  He agreed to pay part of the rent.  What I didn't know was that my father, who has been an accountant his entire adult life, had absolutely no retirement plan, no savings, nothing.  He's living off his Social Security.  Which would be ok, but he blows that money within a week of getting it, mostly just by going out to eat every day for lunch, then constantly asks me for money because of an ""unexpected bill"".  (How was this guy actually employed as an accountant for 40 years????).

Here's the thing, if it was just me, it would be ok.  But it's not.  My SO is in the middle of a bankruptcy (courtesy of his ex-wife), I have two children in college, and a younger child involved in travel sports, so I am absolutely stretched to the limit and falling deeper into debt every month because someone constantly needs something from me.  I'm so overwhelmed I could cry.

The other issue is that he doesn't do anything.  Like, AT ALL.  He sleeps off and on during the day, then he's up half the night, banging around the house because he's nearly deaf and doesn't realize how loud he is, which wakes me up constantly, so I'm extra stabby because of that.  I've tried to encourage him to go to the Senior Center, take some classes, anything at all to get him out of the house, but he has no interest (except going out to lunch - he has all the time in the world for that!).  

I know I should be grateful to have him with me.  He and my mom divorced when I was 5, so I only got to see him for a couple of weeks in the summers when I was growing up, but Christ.  I just want 5 minutes where someone isn't asking me for something.  I'm tempted to rent a hotel room just to get an hour of fucking peace.

My best friend suggested taking his Social Security checks when he gets them and just giving him an allowance.  That probably would work in theory, but just try taking an old man's SS check and see if you don't pull back a bloody stump.  I may work on a budget with him, the hard part is getting him to stick to it.  

If you've made it this far, thank you.  It feels good to get all that out.  I know I probably sound selfish and horrible.  I truly love him, I promise.  I'm just frustrated.

","You don't sound horrible at all - if anything, you sound like a saint for putting up with all that!

Dumb question, but have you tried talking with him? How about ""laying down the law"" - explaining to him how hard this is on all of you and that if it keeps up the way it's going, you'll lose the house and be forced to ""downsize"" into a place he can't live with you? Maybe work with him to come up with a specific list of ""chores"" he can do that would help you out - and some ground rules that would help even more (quiet time after 9pm!)?

Sorry, I'm sure all of that is easier to say (type?) than actually do, but good luck - wish I had better advice!

,I hope we can get thru the next two weeks.,"I’m 26 and have been helping with my 93 y/o grandmother’s care since I was 14. She has heart failure, Dementia, epilepsy and is on oxygen to name the big things. Her Aide that she LOVES and has a great connection with is going out on workers comp from her other job for the next two weeks. Nan was in the Hospital for major trouble breathing and just got back about two weeks ago. She REFUSES to listen to my mother and me and it seems has had another mental decline since this latest hospitalization. She got very verbally abusive to us last week and gets up at all hours of the night and refuses to get back into bed. My dad is unemployed so he handles that unless she has gotten undressed for some reason but now he’s exhausted. I work as an aide in a special needs preschool and am one-on-one with an autistic child every other day. Some days I come home and sleep for two hours.  My patience for her is minimal because this year is so hard. I have no idea how we are going to get thru until her aide comes back. ","Try to give everyone involved some personal time, even if it's getting out to the grocery store. 
In situations like that, I pull a [Kimmy Schmidt](https://youtu.be/xSX3KG1hisk) and take it 10 seconds at a time. Two weeks might feel overwhelming, so just try to get through the next 10 seconds. When you do, try to get through the *next* 10 seconds. Repeat as needed, and try to increase it to the next 60 seconds, next half hour, etc. It won't last forever. If you can just survive the next two weeks, things will get better. Remember that this too shall pass.

,Update on mom's hip.,"They did the surgery today, using a spinal instead of general anesthesia.

,I really need help and don't know what to do. I really want to talk to someone.,"I don't know what to do about my aging father. He is entirely dependent on me for his well being but he does not let me do the things that I need to do. He is a very tough person. He was a manager at a company most of his life and that is what he still tries to do.


 If I don't want to do what he wants the way he wants it he goes berserk. I've lived in anxiety in this house for years, always so worried about doing something that'll set him off. I always get blamed for any health problems. I feel powerless, like the only thing I can do is just keep him healthy. But just doing that is a fight.


My dad has apartments that he does not care for. People have been stealing from him for over 10 years. Now they don't even deposit any money. He doesn't do a thing and will not let me do anything. He thinks he is the only one that can do things but he never does it. He is a gambling addict spending hundreds of thousands a year on horse racing. And he forces me to help him or else he throws a tantrum. He doesn't care if he loses money. At this rate its been about 130k a year gone. 

I am the only thing keeping him going and am going insane watching all this crazy stuff happening that I feel so powerless about. All i want to do is make him happy. Treat him as i wish my son would treat me if I make it to his age. Please I don't know what to do and am so tired of living this way. I have lost my mind so many times. I've stopped sleeping so many times. I'm so tired of this. I am a person full of anxiety, depression, and insomnia. I've had psychological problems all my life. My father can be abusive and snaps into mind states that are like a sociopath. Oh and he is 86 years old, I am 25. We live alone.
","You need to find a lawyer and put him on a conservatorship.  I know that's hard.  But that's what you need to do.

You also need to find a doctor who deals with dementia patients and who will prescribe a mild anti-psychotic so that you are can feel safe in your own home.  

Once you do these two things, many other solutions will fall into place.
Hi there, first I want to say I am so sorry you are going through this.

I am the same age as you and am going through something similar. My mom is sick and doesn't approve of the help I give. It was destroying me mentally and physically. I eventually had to pack my bags and move out because it was so unhealthy for me to continue to live with her and I did/do believe deep down that in a clear state she would've wanted me to live my life.

I don't know if this is the right advice to give but in a similar situation this is what helped me. Your father is an adult and he should be treating you better. If he pushes you away then allow yourself to be pushed away. If he is only being emotionally abusive and refuses your help then I think you should consider moving out and living your life. Of course you can still be there for him, I still visit my mom a few days a week and help her with things she needs. It had a major impact on my health by doing this and you need to be healthy, both physically and mentally, if you're going to be there to support someone. I had severe anxiety and depression from the situation I was in and moving out has nearly removed it completely. 

Now I'm not entirely sure what you're father is suffering from in terms of illnesses but if it's possible for him to live on his own I would suggest taking the first step of moving out. If he's not capable of living on his own then perhaps it is time to talk to him about an in care facility? My mom is very against this, as I'm sure most people are, but she was also capable of living on her own. She certainly did not want to live on her own and used guilt and other abusive ways to try and get me to stay but I stood my ground.

Just from reading your story it sounds like your dad isn't really being a good father and you need to start thinking about yourself. And trust me I know how absolutely difficult that is, especially when you've spent so many years caring for someone you love, and I had a group of friends who supported me through the transition and without them I would probably still be there. SO I am here for you. Whether you need to vent or you need advice please feel free to reach out to me.

Again, I am so sorry you're dealing with this but know you are not alone. I am here and please do not hesitate to reach out. Even if you just need to vent to a stranger, I know how helpful that can be. <3 ",2016-09-06 20:45:33,Care24,51ij75
,Something for my ill father to do that can relieve depression?,"Hi, my father is very ill and has gotten to the point where he is unable to do much of what he once enjoyed.  When I ask him how he is doing his response is that he doesnt have anything to do other than eat or sleep.  I dont live in the same state and he sounds very depressed.  It hurts knowing that he feels like he is just getting by day to day and I am trying to think of something that perhaps we can do together over long distance or even something he can do.  He is on oxygen so is unable to participate in very physical activities.  I have suggested playing games online, but he is completely disinterested in that.  I have given him some tv series to watch, but I am running out, and he is not much of a book reader. 
  
 

I would love any suggestions anyone has - or if you know if a better subreddit to ask this please let me know. ","Start him smoking medical marijuana.
Can you get someone in a couple of days a week to play card games or just talk? Is there a senior center in his town? they have activities like games, movies, really cheap lunches (sliding scale, it costs my mom $4 when she goes). They'll also provide transportation to and from (he does have a portable O2 tank, right?).

I have no idea where to start looking, but I hear therapy animals are great for depression. Not one of his own, a visiting service. maybe look into that? 

Sorry I don't have more ideas, mom seems to be able to entertain herself with daytime television and endless CSI re-runs, but she's not very social anyway. She does enjoy jigsaw puzzles.
It might sound silly, but medical marijuana really might help. Not smoking as suggested below (since he is on oxygen), but an edible might be genuinely beneficial to him. I'm not sure what the laws are like in your state or his. If he's old school he might balk, but I have broached the subject with my own mother (who I am caregiver for) and she was not opposed to trying out an edible.  
  
You might need to do some of the leg work looking for resources in his area, as it sounds like his depression might keep him from being a good advocate for himself. Elder services might be able to hook him up with different options.  If he is not homebound, senior centers are a wealth of activity! The one in our town has about 10 things planned a day, from classes on using the ipad, to stretching/aerobics classes and BINGO. 

Good luck!
check out his local county's department of aging website, they  usually have a contact person. you can also check local park districts to see what community events they have for elderly people in the area! as a nurse, i try to provide some of this information to my patients and i'm trying to find something for my ailing grandmother that i help take care of (with my mom).

Long story short, after my wife's car accident 8 years ago, her needs and wants are all consuming. I am the sole caregiver for her and the household ever since.  Resentment set in a long time ago and I feel like such and ass complaining about anything because hey, not like I have to deal with the conic pain and countless surgery's right ? 

She survived her horrible accident but did not return as my wife, both mentally and physically.

I'm tired of talking about the accident and her medical issues. When we get together with family and friends the conversation always ends ups there. I'm done with reliving the past 8 years everyday. She doesn't remember the day of her accident, but I do and it was the worst day of my life. Now I mostly change the subject, tune out or leave the conversation.

Why isn't she helping herself to improve her situation ? She was not a heavy person when we met. Did put on some weight before the accident, but now acts like she shouldn't be expected to be able to loose weight or workout due to the pain and disability she has. It's to the point she is obese and I can't help and think ""well no shit you hurting"" I tried to reason about it. Reassure it's not about appearances but that her health is in further jeopardy every day. I fear the day a heart attack or diabetes adds to her list of medical issues. She just wont do the right thing's to improve and its affecting my health. I'm gaining weight myself now and feel like shit but if I try and lead, I get guilt from her that I hyper focus on her weight and get the o'l ""I'll never be good enough for you"" I think I need to just move on and shift focus to myself in living healthier if that means doing it alone.

Why am I the one that has to ensure the family's financial stability? The accident ruined us financially as we went from dual income to single over night. We did everything we could and did get some help through insurance's, government aid, etc. But that just got us through. We need to rebuild and make progress, not just get by. Again even through the crappy 8 years I busted my butt to insure what was happening didn't effect my job as the family was depending on me. It's been years now since she worked, but wont even pursue something she can do at home to contribute. I'm not expecting her to jump into a full time job somewhere but not even perusing something she can do from home just boggles my mind. If she was healthier she could probably even do something out of the house. Am I just expected to be the sole provider for the rest of our lives ? I don't think I can accept this.

When do we focus on the things that make ME happy ? My wife is an off-road fanatic. I like to race sports cars. When we financially couldn't keep up both after the accident I got rid of my vehicle and sold everything related to it so we could ensure she had hers and could continue to do what she loved. It was one of the few things that brought her joy during all this so I made damn sure she could still do it. Any extra money, I put into her passion. We go to events, meets and anything related, she beams with joy when we do, so how can I not? But when's it my turn ?  When do I get to take the bonus I earned and spend it on my passion ? I guess I'm just done with all that right ? Would be selfish to care about such things after all she's going through right ?

I don't know, I fell like such a dick feeling these things and more. I could go on and on about things but in the end, I just don't feel like I have a partner in life anymore most days, rather a dependent. She's given up on even attempting to look good or feel good about herself.  I know depression is the root of it. She's been to counseling, doctors and takes the prescribed meds. It just seems like she is content with where she is now in life. Wants me to read facebook comments/articles in accident victim and disability groups. I have no interest in this. I live it everyday, why do I want to consume more of my mental energy on it. I can not accept this is it and don't know when it's OK if ever to look after myself again and what I need to be happy.

Thanks for listening.","I'm so sorry for your situation. You mentioned depression, but only in regards to your wife. Have you sought help for yourself? 

One thing I have learned is that you cannot force people to do things you want them to do if they don't want to do them, especially your spouse. I think you talking with a counselor could be beneficial to you sorting through your feelings. And if you haven't yet, call in backup so you can have a break, whether for a few hours or even days. You need time to refresh and clear your head. 

Good luck to you and I hope things start looking up for you and your family! 
I agree that talking with a therapist your self can be a huge help in getting yourself on the road to happiness.  Perhaps couples therapy at your home would be an option after you do some on your own. 
I think almost anybody would struggle with what you describe.  you're not a jerk.  Well... Maybe you are but not for what you described here.
I am sorry to hear about all of your stress. It sounds like you have a lot to say, too, that's been bottled up. I highly recommend a therapist with whom you feel comfortable and connect. This is SO important. If you don't have a therapist, a trusted friend or family member who gives you the space to talk and will listen to you is a gem. 

You are and have been going through a lot. You know in planes when the attendant says to put on your oxygen mask before helping other people? As cliche as it may sound, it's true. I don't think you've been giving yourself enough self-care. It doesn't sound like you're an ""asshole;"" it sounds like you're feeling run-down and resentful. Those feelings are fine and understandable; it just matter what you do about them.

I'm the sole caretaker for my husband who has a brain tumor, and I've learned this through my experience of being alone and carrying the burden without caring for myself. Best of luck to both you and your wife.
You're a good man.

I go through all kinds of emotions caring for a wife with progressive ms.  I know that things will never be better than today, and that the future will be a slow and at times painful journey into more and more disability.  I feel anger at times, taken for granted, and question why I don't just take off.  For me, I think it's selfish in a way and feel like I'd always look at myself in the mirror and feel like a coward.  Then I remember, it's because I love her.  Based on what you shared, regardless of the bad stuff it's obvious you love her and want the best for her.

That said, you do have a valid point that she perhaps isn't full filling her end of the bargain.  There are many other ways to control weight with just healthy eating and very minimal exercise.  Remind her that you love her.  Tell her you feel taken advantage of at times and why.   Remind her you haven't gone anywhere and don't want to, but that you really need her to be all-in as well.  Maybe some talk therapy would help her.

Thanks for sharing, you aren't alone, and you are not a bad person for having the feelings you are having.
You're not an asshole because you're still trying, or at least you were 5 months ago.

What you described sounds similar to when my husband had a stroke. He already had other issues affecting his mobility, but the stroke pushed me over the edge. He came home a different person and it was the first time I ever really thought about divorce--I couldn't imagine my life as his unpaid nurse and verbal punching bag. Fortunately he improved in a lot of ways and we stayed together (though I still get pangs of angst, followed by guilt, over our present situation, improved as it may be). I remember how awful it was and however your situation has progressed, I have a lot of respect for your ability to stick it out for so long.",2016-08-23 13:50:49,unplannedjourney,4z7rwx
,Programs that pay family caregivers,,"I just found this article on how family caregivers can get paid. There are a TON of different programs with different requirements and lots of hoops to jump through, but anything is better than nothing, right? I hope this helps someone.
I am a paid caregiver for my aged mother (and father before he died in 2013) under the IHSS program in CA.  That's the good news.  The only good news.  I am currently working 24/7 at part-time wages.  I'm not supposed to work above my allotted hours but since it's just me Mom has, what am I going to do?  I am paid minimum wage (San Diego.  I understand the rates are higher (and lower) elsewhere in the state.)  Actually, I am paid below minimum wage right now--A raise was voted in months ago, but I haven't seen it yet.  And I may well not see it.  Because I 'live with my patient', the IRS declared my wages not-wages last year (I don't recall the official designation. Sorry) and so, tax-exempt.  Which means I can neither collect SS nor Medicare. a scary thing when you are as close to 60 as I am.  I am also subject to yearly inspections and surprise drop-bys just to make sure I'm doing my job. Finally, the entire program spends time on the chopping block every year when the State Budget is negotiated (Sometimes its just squeaked through at the last minute)  and they only just rescinded the 7% hours cut imposed several years ago.  But the cut could return (Probably will.) pending the Nov election.        I guess what I'm trying to say is, although the pay helps, the rules and conditions can be a headache.

,Daily check in app for seniors living alone,"Hey all – 

I'm working with a team on [Snug Safety](http://snugsafe.com/), a daily check in app for individuals living alone. It's super simple and designed with seniors in mind. This is our second safety focused app, and so far we have gotten great response from a few senior living communities. 

How it works:

1. Users sign up by providing their name, phone number, address, emergency contact information, and preferred check in time.
- Every day, the app sends a push notification to remind them to ""check in"" at the time they specified.
- If they visit the app and push the green button, all is well and the timer resets for 24 hours.
- If they miss their check in, one of our operators gives them a call. If they miss the call, our operators alert their emergency contacts and request a ""wellness check"" at their address from local law enforcement. 

You can try it free for 14 days and then it becomes $9.99 / month or $99.99 / year. I wish we could offer it free for all, but we think it's important to pay our operators! :) 

If you know someone who could benefit from an automated daily check in, we would love for them to try it out and let us know how it goes. We value community feedback and want to hear your questions and suggestions for improvement!

His health has recently taken a turn for the worse after a long, slow decline. He lives in my guestroom, and I've cleaned up shit twice today, out of carpet, clothes, sheets and off of him. I wasn't sure if I needed to buy adult diapers today; we're glad I did.

He's in some degree of kidney failure and has already begun dialysis. It's going to be an adventure figuring out what he can and shouldn't eat. The fucktastic part of it all is he brought this on himself by not taking his medications.

I have my own problems: major depression, unemployed, Asperger's (the majority of the time it's a gift rather than a curse). For the next few months we're going to live off of my retirement and I won't even look for a job while I get R taken care of and wrangle our state and federal agencies for assistance.

,25 and a sole caregiver for 6 years.,"I can't say how happy i am to find this subreddit. And I apologize in advance that this may be a long post but I'm tired of trying to talk to people who don't have the slightest idea of what I'm going through.

I'm 25 and have been taking care of my mom for 6 years now. I am completely alone, as in I am her sole caregiver. I've been taking care of her on my own for the past six years and I feel like dying. Not in a suicidal way but in a way where I'm just so tired.

My mom has liver disease. I lived with her for the past five years and I thought she was getting better so I moved out a year ago. I needed to, for my physical and mental health. Now she's deteriorating again. I'm writing this from her hospital room.

When I first started taking care of her I completely stopped my life. I lost my friends bc they would get mad that I couldn't hang out. I couldn't pursue the career I wanted. And during this whole thing my mom was horribly mean to me.. Which I guess will happen when you're so sick all of the time. It destroyed me. Any time I wanted to go out and take a break she would threaten to kill herself, she would say ""you go out and you'll come back to my dead body"". A lot of stuff like that happened. She never appreciated anything I did. I've since slowly distanced myself because I couldn't continue to give and give and only get shit on. I feel guilty for this a lot, like I'm a bad daughter and that's a big struggle for me which drains me emotionally.

I don't really know where I'm going with this. I'm tired I'm so tired. I'm sick of being in hospitals and Doctor appointments and being yelled at because I'm not doing things right or because I'm not doing enough. I'm sick of my friends telling me that I need to just do me ""I wouldn't keep my mom in my life if she treated me like your treated after all you do"". They don't realize she was the best mom before she was sick, how can you suggest I just abandon her?  I guess I just want to talk to people who understand and don't just pity you or tell you you're doing it all wrong when they have no idea. 

TLDR; I'm tired.","It's a shame no one sees that you **are** doing you. But it's a common theme in the US, where anything painful or negative at all is to be avoided at all costs, and parents are to be put in a home ASAP.

I have to hold my tongue both at home and abroad. Reactions vary from I am some kind of weirdo to some kind of saint. Why is it weird to take care of your mother? What is going on in our society where this is weird, even looked down upon at times?

Is mom irritable/easily upset? Shit yes! How would you feel when faced with the prospect of an imminent death, coupled with the knowledge that you are slowly losing all cognitive ability? Sound a little scary? Think you might lash out now and again? I know I would!

It is totally exhausting dealing with all this, and I totally support (and aspire to) your decision to move out. People have limits and it is definitely possible to take on more than you can handle, so moving out is a very healthy, sane & understandable thing to do.


Well, it's not pity, but I wish you didn't have to carry this burden. It's a heavy one to share alone. I always come back to this: what kind of person do I want to be? When I look back in twenty years, will I be proud of myself or will I have regrets? 

Is there a way you can remain involved with your mom's care, but in a less demanding way? Can you hire someone to give you a break, or to provide mom's actual care while you do other helpful tasks like bills and cleaning? Sometimes we can show our love (as complicated as it may be) in ways that aren't so soul-sucking. 
Hi from the ICU :). I'm a little too tired to say much but wanted to say hi and glad you found the sub. 

I also frequently think about care in terms of ""being the person I want to be"" that's a really interesting common thread it seems.

As for your mom, if she was a great mom before she's probably projecting her self-anger on to you.  Do you both ever talk about her illness, if she carries guilt about it, or other emotionally charged issues?  It really sounds like she needs therapy to come to terms with her life.  Not all chronically ill people are bitter and lashing out at those who  help, so don't accept it as normal or acceptable. Maybe start by talking to her and then move to her PCP if she's unwilling to start having a conversation about it.
Hey, ((hugs))

Glad you found us, Welcome!

I gave up my SO and business, moved 3k miles to take care of my mom. Some days she's just so pissy, I want tell her to fend for herself. We don't even know if she has normal memory loss, or the beginning stages of Alzheimer, because every time I make an appointment with the neurologist, she cancels it, refuses to go (says she doesn't want to know). (and that's on top of her other issues, the COPD, emphysema, broken bones, etc.)

My SO also moved back here to see his dad through the last stages of liver disease. Not pretty, at one point they wanted to amputate his feet. On a 86yo dying guy. He was only here 3 years, I've been here eight.

And yes, so, so tired. Exhausted. SO tells me to 'take care of myself', My BFF the social worker tells me the same. I DON'T KNOW HOW!
The more family you have involved, the harder it is. My brother is financial power of attorney, my sister is medical power of attorney, and neither one is involved in actually caring for mom & hardly do their parts at all. I wonder if I'm doing the right thing, but then I remember that my mom did the same thing for me with little or no reward. It's all because of love. Family just complicates this whole process. Take care.
I'm just looking for people that are going through what I'm going through. Glad I found this. I know it's been a while since this post, so I hope you have found some respite and are able to keep yourself healthy. ",2016-08-03 22:29:16,mountaingirl1212,4w2bko
,Tired of being blamed for shit,Vent...my wife has seizures but she's actually for the first time in 10 years actually getting better.  She is desperate for independence and being allowed to drive herself again.  And it's not like we haven't had to have her drive herself or pick up kids in fucked up emergencies when I just couldn't get out of work to do it.  But when I say I don't think we should just go through with getting her a new drivers license.  When I say please can we wait until we're sure that things are actually better.  Please can we just follow the guideline of 6 months without a seizure.  Somehow that means I don't trust her.  Fuck me.  How is being the one who has been there through 10 fucking years of unpredictable seizures saying let's be careful...how does that mean I don't trust her.  Fucking damn it.  I hate that she treats this like I think my opinion matters more than hers.  I don't think it's an opinion.  I'm talking about safety and legal liability ffs.  But I don't trust her now.  Damn it.,"What does her doctor say? I'd follow that.

(I just spoke to mom's doc yesterday. She said it would be better if mom didn't drive herself (she got lost at the dentist office, had to get an Uber to get her home) but she's not at the point of taking mom's licence away. And FML, I just discovered my own licence is expired. Aren't they supposed to notify you when it's due for renewal?)

,"Argh! Just had to get my SO to pay for an Uber for my mom, to get her home from the dentist.","Mom had a dentist appointment she never told me about, drove herself (I was still sleeping). The office called me when she was a half hour late, asking where she was. Another 15 minutes they called back and told me someone had just brought her in, she'd been wandering around the building all that time. And she forgot her inhaler.

Then when it was time to leave, she couldn't remember where she parked the car (it's my car and the only one we have), and didn't feel like she could/should drive. A nice Samaritan brought her inside (she'd been waiting outside in the sun for a ride) (don't ask me why, maybe she forgot she drove there?), and called me. Sending a cab would be the easy answer, but neither of us have a dime to our name at this time of the month.

So my SO (2k miles away) stepped up, and arranged the Uber. Driver was a doll, and amazingly, happened to be a paramedic for the Brooklyn FD. He picked me up, drove her home, and saw her safely inside, while I took my car home. (I asked SO if he tipped, he said he didn't know how to. I told him to figure it out.)

No real question, just a rant. But I guess it's time to take the keys away? She does OK getting herself to Walgreen's and back?

**Shout-out to the kindness of strangers.** I just called the person who brought my mom into the lobby, and called to tell me of mom's predicament, to thank her again. She gave me resources at easterseal.org, (I gather she's in the same situation)

One thing, I'm getting mom that $10/month cellphone that AARP offers. It's maddening, not knowing where she is and what's going on with her. Even if she's not not driving, she can get lost in TJ Maxx (or a medical office building).

","The key question was much easier for me, since mom actually lost her car out in the woods somewhere it didn't take much convincing that maybe she shouldn't be driving any more. Always a tough call though, and the only advice I would give is to have this discussion supervised by doctors/friends/family, this way it's not just coming from you but from everyone who cares about her.

A phone is also a good idea, my mom has my old flip phone with me as the only contact, and she takes it with her wherever she goes. The hard part was, of course, convincing her that she needs to do this.

Sometimes incidents like this are a blessing in disguise. They can force mom into a moment of clarity where she understands what is happening and that something needs to be done, these are the moments we have to take advantage of.
Wow, an absolutely terrifying experience - I mean, it went great, thanks to the kindness of strangers! But to think how badly it could have gone is really frightening. Good on your SO and everyone involved - and definitely a good idea getting that cellphone. And how about a medical ID bracelet, would she wear that, do you think? They sound silly I know, but they can really be a huge help - even if it just has your name/number on it.",2016-08-01 14:56:12,ChiliFlake,4vo4oo
,Advice Needed Please! Too much on Our Plate.,"Hello everyone,

I apologize in advance for the length of this post, but I wanted to give as much detail as I could to help give some insight to my problem.

My 68 year old mother (retired nurse) currently has mild dementia. She's a diabetic that suffered a stroke and a heart attack from pneumonia back in 2011. We had the dementia diagnosis back in 2014 and another dementia diagnosis this spring in 2016 as a second opinion. She lives with my sister (37), bro in law, 8 year old niece and newborn nephew. I'm 30 and I live about an hour and 45 minutes from my mother, sister and brother in law. Every month I come up for at least a week to help out and I have been increasing the frequency of visits due to my sister being pregnant and then having the newborn about two weeks ago. I've been here for two weeks, took my mom back with me to my house for the weekend and now I'm back for the last week which comes as a suprise to my sister. I told her I'd be helping for two to three weeks and she was surprised to hear I was planning on going back home by the end of the week. Unfortunately, her husband goes back to work on Saturday, so it's less help with is very tricky.


My sister and my mother's relationship has tarnished fully. My sister can't stand her any longer. My mother can be very nice, but she has a very stubborn side and she can be very ungrateful and manipulative. She puts on a nice act in front of others, but she can be the total opposite when there's no company. She doesn't quite abide by a diabetic diet... she loves raisin bread and carbs. We have to portion certain foods for her and hide certain foods or she will polish off the entire or almost the entire thing in a day (for example, if we left a loaf of raisin bread on the table, she'd eat either half or 3/4 of it by the time night comes). She went through a pound and a half bag of grapes in two days. Remember, she's a diabetic!!  My sister does all she can do, and my mother complains. They hardly talk except for giving out medication and regarding when it's time to eat. 


My sister is in charge of her finances (she's power of attorney). When I'm not at her home, she gives the medications and either she or my bro in law cook. 

During the weekday, she goes to an adult program 9 am to 3pm which helps. I coordinate her ride service times (a service that picks her up and drops her off at places she needs or wants to go). Since February, when I'm home, I call every morning to wake her up and then every evening to wake her up from a nap to remind her to take her medication and eat. When I visit the house, I do laundry, clean her room, cook and disperse her medicine along with some other things here and there.


We cannot afford a nursing home at this time as she's on a bankruptcy plan that my sister set up that helped save the house. Mom didn't live with my husband and I because she, my sis and bro in law bought a new house in 2007 or 08 (house not paid off though), my husband smoked (but he's actually cut down to liquid nicotine now) and all of her doctors are back in the city. We don't have the same space and safety measures as she does in her home that she shares with sis and bro.in law and the kids. Her house is in HER name and she selfishly refused to put my sis and bro in law on the deed even though they have contributed quite a lot to the house. 


I'm getting very concerned about our future- my marriage, my sister and brother in law with two children and my mother slowly getting worse. I'm feeling extremely hopeless and a part of me feels I shouldn't have married my husband so he wouldn't have to deal with all of this burden. I don't know what to do. I've been leaving my husband for weeks at a time since 2008 when my niece was born and my sister needed help. I understand that my sister is the primary caregiver, but I feel that this situation isn't fair on both parts! My husband has tried to be as patient as he can, but I know he doesn't like this situation one bit and I feel so guilty. I feel guilt when I leave him and I feel guilt when I leave my mom and sister.

Am I helping enough? Am I not helping enough? Is it selfish? I feel like I get conflicting input when I'm told I do so much to help and then I feel like my sister appreciates some of what I do, but it's probably not enough as a whole. If I had the money, I'd have her move in a home near my husband and I and either have a visiting nurse or a get her into a really great nursing home, but it's too expensive. 


I'm willing to answer any questions. This post is probably all over the place and I'm sorry... I think I just let it out in this post. Any advice is welcomed, please!",[deleted],2016-07-31 19:08:27,LightSeeking,4vjk4e

,I need to talk.... 27yrs old and now I've lost both of my parents.,"I'm having a really difficult time handling my grief since mom died. I know that it was 19 month ago, but it still feels like yesterday. I took care of her for 13 years; my dad died, and there wasn't anyone else to be her caregiver, and she had cancer.... She died from cancer, too. She had it three times in her lifetime.
I've been in the mental health hospital twice now, with the most recent time being the first two weeks of May. I don't feel like anything is getting any better.... And I just keep feeling depressed, and like I should just end it....
My mom's siblings blame me for her death, saying that I didn't take well enough care of her, even though they were never around to help out....
I'm just drained and exhausted and trying to find meaning in living is a dream more than a reality. The life insurance was denied, the house and possessions are in probate, and I can't even pay this months bills....
I'm 27, yet I feel old and tired, and like I'm just done. Done with life, done with everything.
I don't know what to do now. What do you do when you've been caring for someone for 13 years and they pass?","Hey, wish I had some good advice for you, but not sure what to offer.  I suppose you need to work on redefining your life, it sounds like this will be your first opportunity to live for yourself, and that can be a great opportunity but scary too.

For now, allow yourself to grieve and accept that you made her life far better then it would have been without your help.  Definitely don't listen to her siblings, if you haven't been a caregiver, you really have no idea what it's like.

Maybe start doing small things to reclaim your life, they don't have to cost money. You may also want to post in /r/NeedAdvice or /r/findapath to help you move forward.

I've been in the caregiver roll for about 9 years now, sometimes I try to imagine what it'll be like when this ends, but it's hard to imagine.  hugs from the internet.",2016-07-10 18:20:07,Faedlyn,4s7pjn

,I'm facing arrest,Mom has fallen numerous times. Called 911 false times. Yet she is holding this over my head. What do I do?,"How are you 'facing arrest'? Have you heard from the the police, or is this just something your mom is saying? What does she call 911 for, a medical emergency, or something else? What do the police say when they get there?

If the police have contacted you, get a lawyer. If it's just your mom being crazy, I'd call APS and tell them she's unstable and making wild accusations. Good luck.

edit: I say that because if your mom really is going to call the cops on you but hasn't yet, you want to get something documented now. (whoever calls the police/authorities first is generally seen as more believable). 

You could also try to speak to her doctor about this. Will she let you speak to her doc, do you go her appointments with her? My mom's PCP (also her pulmonary special) has been incredibly helpful. When I recently called to make an appointment for her breathing issues, the first thing she asked was 'Is her dementia getting worse'? That's a valuable thing to have on record, someone on my side, if mom started making allegations of abuse (she's fragile, and breaks a lot of bones).

If the police haven't contacted you, you're being a little dramatic. Calm down, take a few breaths. If you react to every thing a demented parent says, you'll make yourself nuts.

,When to over-ride?,"Mom just came back from the hospital for the second time in two weeks, third time in a month. As usual, she doesn't want any home care (she hates people/strangers in her house). She's eligible for a visiting nurse and even a house cleaner, but *nooo*.

I don't mind about the cleaning, (though it would be nice -I live with her), but she's non-compliant with her meds, and I'm sick of fighting her. It's making our personal relationship really strained. I feel like Hitler, she sees me as a tin-pot despot, when I tell her to use her $8 nebulizer, and not the $50 inhaler. Or even to put her fucking oxygen on.

(I tried taking the inhaler away, telling her she only gets it when she's out of the house. Boom, 3am call to 911 :(

She doesn't even take it correctly. Doesn't empty her lungs, doesn't hold for ten seconds. Just two quick puffs, it's like she medicating her mouth. She's making me crazy.)","If you have the power, now is probably the time. I'm starting to feel the same way, and get the same reaction. Even more maddening because she has admitted she needs help in the past, but once it comes time to actually do something about it she falls back on the old classics. Getting better, don't need help, etc.

Any chance you could turn it around? Make it so YOU need help and not her, would she be more amenable?

,What are the caregiver services that matter most to you?,"Hi,

I am not here to promote my service, but I do work in the field, and I wanted to try and get some feedback on something. 

The service we offer is intended to help you find the right caregiver and part of doing that is identifying the services family caregivers are looking for when they hire a caregiver.

Here's our list:
Meal Preparation

Housekeeping

Bathing & Dressing

Medication Reminders

Transportation Services

Toileting

Alzheimer's/Dementia Care

Respite Care

Are there services you need and/or currently use that aren't on the list? I'd love to know so we could include them :)  

Are there services you need but can't find professional caregivers to perform?

I have been a family caregiver myself, so I respect your time and commitment, but we really want to screen better for needed services and try to improve what little assistance we can offer families.

,Need to vent get emotional support,"I've read a few of these post and while I realize my problems are not as big as most, I still need help.

In the last 10 years, almost everyone I love has died.  My dad died 8 years ago, mother died close to three and my grandmother died last year.  I have a sister I am not close to.

I am in my early 40s and my wife, also in her early  40's, was diagnosed with RA, fibro, chronic migraines, trigeminal neuralgia, vertigo and tinnitus starting about 2 years ago.  She has been out of work for over a year.

I love her to pieces and I want to take are of her to the best of my ability.  The problem that I'm running into is that I feel like I'm not allowed to have a bad day, to be sad, or otherwise be the one who needs to be taken are of.  My worst day is still better than her best.

Crap happened at work today that put me in a bad mood and my wife called, asking if she can have a tattoo.  I told her that we don't have the money (since we are living on half our old income and a meager inheritance ) and then she asks about where she can get a razor blade.  Se got it through her head that in order to combat the relentless pain she needs to be in control of it, through cutting or getting a tattoo.  Needless to say, I didn't take it well and now she feels that she can't talk to me about her problems.

She is on anti-depressants and the doctor she has seen just gives her a pill.  I'm not sure why she hasn't followed through with a therapist referral, and she only recently got a referral to a pain management doctor. I talked her down and I don't currently think she is a threat to herself, aside from eating gluten which could cause a migraine.

My point in all this is, I have no one else to turn to.  I have no close friends, all my parents are dead and I don't believe in religion.  I need to vent to someone who understands what it is like to have to be the strong one all the time.  If this was AA I'd be looking for a sponsor.

Thanks","Sympathy is normal, empathy is good, but telling yourself that your pain is inferior because it doesn't seem as bad as someone else's, that's damaging. 

As a couple, you need to be able to share what is going on in your lives, otherwise it will devolve into caregiving with a marriage license. And by that I mean you will drift apart, away from being a couple and into a caregiver and care recipient relationship. Which can become a breeding ground for resentment without emotional support for both of you. And the biggest support one can have is permission to be human, to have a bad day, to have problems, to feel bad, to want something different. And that's a permission you have to give yourself and fight to keep others from taking away. 

People will try to take that permission away, the looks of ghastly horror as you relate that you were (gasp, horror) at work or on the phone or in the bathroom or getting the newspaper when something went wrong. The ""how are you doing"" that begins to mean ""how is she doing"" that everyone stares blankly until you get off the topic of you and onto the topic of her. It seems like little things, but they become dehumanizing. 

And I most certainly understand the issues of being a non-believer in a role in which it seems like everyone has some magical being guiding, helping, and caring about them, at least based on what one hears. Which can be overwhelming in and of itself. Like, how did you get so lucky to get a fairy God-father/mother to get you through this? And I really haven't found much of a way to deal with that. Eye rolls and head pinching aside.

 
There is almost certainly some sort of local support group for those in your situation. Ours is done through the local senior center.

Anti-depressants are commonly used for pain management, but you both sound like you could use some talk therapy as well. The only solution to these problems is to talk through them and without honest communication that isn't possible.

I'm here though if you need to talk more, feel free to PM me. I can totally relate to your situation. My only brother passed away & the only surviving family we have is hundreds of miles away.
Support groups are the best thing for this, they helped me! ",2016-06-14 11:54:43,mrpbeaar,4o22cx

I didn't need this for my mom, but this saved me SO MUCH money after my colostomy, when I was still figuring out which products worked best for me. I went home from the hospital with a few samples from my Wound Care nurse, who told me to call, and holy crap, every one of them came through.

I'd never invest in a full supply of anything before trying it, especially where something like compromised skin is concerned (and you might not have unlimited insurance/funds).

,Mom is in the hospital again,"Called 911 for her at 3am, will probably be discharged tomorrow (breathing issues).

(shout-out to John, her nurse, told me everything and not to worry, he was keeping an eye out.

(edited to remove TMI)


Edit: well two whole days respite (for me), she's home again and pissy as ever. I learned some interesting things (which no one ever thought to mention to me). Her tiredness and napping all day, which I suspected might be linked to her deficit of oxygen is actually a thing called 'tissue hypoxia'. And her mental deficits: short term memory loss, confusion, might be brain hypoxia. We tried to take her to a neurologist, but she refused to go back after the first visit, said she didn't want to know if she had Alzheimer or was losing her mind. But I was just told that any mental tests done on her would be useless, unless there was a baseline of her being properly oxygenated. 

I am SO MAD we weren't told these things. Especially at the neurologist, was he just going to charge us for the tests without mentioning there might be another cause?


","Doesn't make you terrible at all, enjoy the break. :)

I end up spending my entire day at the hospital since there isn't other family here for him, but even the relief of knowing I'm not responsible for helping him monitor his health is a huge relief.

,"Need advice, how to get doctors to do their jobs?","Ok, had trouble with the title... here's the situation:

My husband has a lot of health problems, we see lots of specialists and have a primary care physician. We want the doctors to actually take early warning signs seriously and schedule tests as an out patient, then based on results, admit him directly to the hospital if necessary.  Or better yet, test it as an outpatient.

What keeps happening, we'll contact the doctors, starting with the pc, or maybe the dialysis clinic and explain what's going on. Nothing happens, it drags on, husband gets worse off until they eventually just say ""go to the emergency room"". Is it insane to  not want a trip to the ER to be the point where they take it seriously? Once in ER, you end up working with doctors who don't know his complex history. 

Do they not want the responsibility of working with the hospital? Do we just have crappy doctors? How can I approach this issue without alienating them?  

In this latest incident, he's felt bad for a few months, we've brought it up with every doctor we've seen. Over the last week we messaged with the PC, expecting her to have him come in, evaluate him, suggest some blood tests, maybe xrays, then diagnose and treat.  What happened... She asks some questions, we sent replies, days go by, on Friday we get the ""if it gets worse go to the ER"".... Sunday we give up, go to ER and now he'll likely be in for over a week, narrowly dodging ICU (might still end up in it). I'm so fed up with this system and their lack of investment in early treatment... Sorry it's turned into a rant....We are trying to do the right thing, contacting them in a timely manner, sharing information and it just gets us no where. I don't think the ER should be the default point of entry for treatment.","Have you had this conversation with the doctors?  Specifically, that you want him tested as an outpatient, you do not want ER to be the first resort?  Rather than saying ""he's feeling X"" say you want this tested for because he's feeling X and last time it progressed to a hospital stay.  You want that prevented.

I'm sure you are very proactive, and cannot suggest anything more specific.  I have to be very agressive with providers for my peeps, all three of them.
The best way is to talk to them and also let them know that everyone is being rated online, so if they don't do their jobs then the rating will lower. ",2016-06-07 02:05:14,Turn478,4mxmuk
,Losing my damn mind.,"Caregiver to my mother, here. She's 81 and has moderate dementia. She functions fine but I live with her. Unemployed. I've cared for her for almost 10 years. (It went by fast yet, i've watched the world move along and i've stood still) I am angry. I do well most days considering I am alone, no friends, no money, etc. We've now drifted into her doubting everything I do for her. Her meds, etc. May I add, that her blood work is spectacular for an 81 year old woman. Better than mine I bet. (Me= Heart palpitations, Nerve issues, Anxiety, and slowly reaching the depression stage) I've done EVERYTHING for her. Yet, I am subjected to her doubts. I should add that this has ALWAYS been my mother. She has a history of deceit and I can only assume, she thinks me capable of doing the same. I would not. I am alive ONLY to care for her. I don't even go to the Dr. myself. I am at a loss. I am tempted to just become homeless, re-home my beautiful cats (mother loves them too) and just leave word with her Dr. that she needs someone to step in and help her handle her home, finances, and get her help. I'm desperate and I thought i'd post here. I am sorry for the desperate tone but the truth is, I am heartbreakingly desperate. ","Hey, so sorry to hear how much stress you are under.  I definitely get it, even if I can only offer empathy.  I imagine the dementia is terrible to deal with.  I can relate to feeling like you are only living for someone else and the lack of personal healthcare, when spending ridiculous amounts of time sitting in waiting rooms and dealing with doctors for someone else.

If she has moderate dementia, is it possible to carve out some time for yourself?  A part-time job, volunteer work, or even just getting out to a movie... really anything to help you reclaim your own sense of identity?  At 81, I think you should be looking into some home-aide help (find out what her insurance can cover).  If it's really bad, why not look into assisted living for her.

As for the cats, they are probably the thing that keeps you going on most days, so don't re-home them unless it's temporary while you sort out your situation. You have to learn to be selfish and be ok with that, not an easy task and one I can't say I've succeeded with, but it's the path forward.
Hi! I'm very sorry to hear all this. I think if your mental and physical health is struggling, it's time to move on. You still have a lot of your life ahead of you. Call her doctor, make an appointment, and ask for help/who to call about getting her placed into memory care. Doctors can usually get the process moving faster than if you do it yourself. 
Late to this thread but it is so much like my own situation that I want to chime in.

It's hard enough being a caregiver, add chronic pain to the mix & it makes an adventurous cocktail. And to have your own mother not recognize when you are hurting, well, that's pain on a whole different level. 

Just don't forget that your mothers behavior towards you is directly affected by the dementia. She is only doubting you because she is doubting everything right now, so try not to take things too personally.

I just hope you don't make a rash decision. I've thought I was at the end of my rope quite a few times now and it turned out I wasn't. It's hard to know sometimes when you're really hurting.

,Military Caregivers are the unsung heroes of war,"Just watched a trailer for a new documentary being filmed about military caregivers --the spouses, parents, and friends of catastrophically wounded warriors.  Being the ""feel good"" moments of seeing veterans coming home to brand new homes, the caregivers' stories haven't come out as much.  And the caregivers, unlike others who take care of Alzheimers victims, as almost all uniformly young, some as young as 21. The outlook from that vantage point must be one with an unsparring long view.  I guess they probably have as much in common with parents of children with special needs who also need 24/7 care. Anyway, its at [The Weight of Honor](http://www.theweightofhonormovie.com).","The only study on military caregivers, and great place to start learning is here:http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR499.html. It was commissioned by the Elizabeth Dole Foundation. 
I don't understand your point about Alzheimers caregivers... And there's no reason to compare which disease/syndrome is the worst, or which caregivers have the most difficult struggle. 
I am the wife of a Marine veteran who has injuries from his time in service as well as the mother and full time caregiver for my 22 yr old special needs autistic son. Granted my husband did not sustain injuries like we have seen in some of our fellow military families we can sympathize with their struggles with a lot of things. Having a special needs child who is 22 physically yet mentally average age 9 yrs old... that is a very loose average. He was born with microcephaly (what you have been hearing about lately with the zika virus and mosquitoes) seizures, his immune system isn't that of a normal person, and several other medical issues. It has been a sacrifice like no other. I chose to give up what life I had to care for my son ( my husband isn't my childrens biological father) 
I think caregiving in general definitely has it's challenges but then to add on them being your (husband, child, etc) adds even more strain. A lot of times I feel the caregivers that are not family or have some sort of emotional attachment can be a little easier. I say this only because my sister-in-law is a caregiver for ailing elderly persons who for the most part have been near their time on this earth. My sister-in-law has seen many of her clients pass away and since she didn't really have that previous attachment it has made it easier for her to transition from one client to the next. I know that kind of sounds a little cold but just like in medical fields the staff have to separate their emotions from their jobs in order for them to focus on the job at hand. My daughter is actually is in her last weeks of training in the military in becoming a combat medic. She has always wanted to become a doctor in some form or fashion. She has been the caregiver for me and my son throughout her life. I myself have has multiple mini-strokes, one stroke, broke my spine, etc. (since this wasn't about my medical issues).

Also, my biological father had a near death incident a little over a year ago and has since been detained in a dementia unit because of the damage to his brain. I have been asked if I could take him in and care for him but as much as it was hard to say no I just couldn't do it. I know one thing...I would love to go on a motorcycle ride with my husband but unless we have a sidecar for his motorcycle that'll happen every blue moon.
Props to all caregivers milspouses or not. I know we all want to pull out our hair at times but then there are those times we wouldn't want to trade for anything. ",2016-05-17 10:23:55,NaNaCatNoRay,4jr56j

,Selfish caregiver?,"Hi everyone,

Thank you for reading. I just need some advice on how to cope right now. I am thirty, and my 28 year old husband is currently in the hospital for a month undergoing a bone marrow transplant. He had advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma and there is a fifty fifty chance he will make it.

He has already undergoing a year of treatment, and we face another year after this. Before this I have dealt with some health issues, a difficult job, and some depression issues. We moved a year before his diagnosis, so I don't have a big net of friends to lean on, and my husband is very introverted and really just hangs around me. I feel so embarrassed saying this, but I have developed bulemia as a result of the stress. It hurts to eat due to my medical issues I just purge every night now. Since I am at the hospital with him every day and come home and spend the night alone It has evolved over the last few months into binging and taking anxiety medications and sleeping pills to stay calm.

Everyone in my life feels sorry for me. It makes me feel pathetic...I wish I was able to be more positive and optimistic about our situation, but I try my best just to hide it enough from my husband. 

I feel so selfish I am so depressed I can even take care of myself enough to do the dishes or keep the house clean. For the most part, I have spent all my free time lying around in bed because I just don't want to face anything outside of work and the cancer.

Thanks for reading. I called a therapist to talk to someone about the bulemia issue and to help get me back on track, but an other advice would be welcome.","My heart goes out to you. I'm considerably older and take care of my wife with AD, however I can certainly relate with the feelings of depression and loneliness that comes with carrying the torch alone.
A few weeks ago, I stumbled upon journaling as a technique that might help get my head straight. I started to read a lot of very positive comments about the technique and found a free app called ""Journey"" that could be used. So I started. Interesting that after only a couple of weeks, I'm beginning to look forward to each day sitting with a coffee before my wife awakes, and just babbling to noone.
One of the bits of advice was to include a comment about what I am grateful for....hello...grateful? Actually, I have a lot to be grateful for, and thinking about it and writing it down and then rereading it a few days later is helpful. Actually does lift the spirit. So look into journaling....it's free, easy to do, helps to get some focus on your feelings, and lots of people swear that it helps.
Another item that might help is to read the recent commencement speech by Sheryl Sandberg. I saw it in the news and was impressed by her comments....she also speaks about recording a joy from each day. A helpful speech.

Remember that there are always people that have it worse than we do, and be inspired by how they cope. Best of luck to you.
From my perspective you are beating yourself up over some perfectly rational & valid behavior. You have an awful lot to deal with right now, so it's no wonder you don't have energy left for the dishes. It's easy to underestimate just how physically taxing emotional exhaustion is.

Quiet time in bed is one of my main coping skills. Kick back, pet the cat, maybe watch something on TV. Best way to recharge. The trick for me is to give my brain something else to do besides think about things.",2016-05-14 22:29:49,Gumdropland,4jea1z
,the lady I care for put me in a difficult position,"
I work overnight for a quadriplegic woman, Sarah. She is very wealthy, and her adult children live in homes on either side of hers. One of her son's live in the house. (Something I was never told, it was sprung on me) as does her teenage daughter. 



 So the newest saga to my job is that Adam (31M adult son lives in the home) got kicked out last night, his mom found drugs and paraphernalia in his room. I get there and he is outside completely high. I get inside and Sarah tells me what is going on and to keep the doors locked and to physically keep him from getting inside. She is watching him from the cameras.

 The girl that works the shift before I do, she's only 19 or 20  and looks terrified.  So I offer to walk with her to her car. This is where the blow up happens. Sarah overheard me talking to her. I asked YM ( yo iii ng woman that works before me) -"" do you want me to walk with you to your car."" She says ""yes! Thank you for asking me, I wanted to ask if someone would but I thoughtvit would be weird. Ill give you a ride back"". She has to park in the cul de sac past the gates. Maybe a quarter of a mile from the house. 


Sarah overhears us.  I round the corner in the hall to her sceaming at me that I offended her and that she can't believe I would act like her son and brother( who are high on meth right then) would ever do anything violent.  Yatta yatta yatta. Her daughter (15YO) can walk her to her car but I cannot. And why haven't I asked if she wanted to go down yet. I had officially been clocked I for 6 minutes and I just got hit with a ton of drama I wasn't expecting and was just trying to process it. 

Am I overreacting to put in a two week notice?  What would you do in my situation? How should I proceed. I couldn't walk out at the moment because it would have put all the caregiving on a teenagers shoulders when she should only be worrying about going to school the next day. I've been working for her for 9 months.
","She locked him out & was watching him via cameras and thinks you are paranoid?  If you can, I'd look for a new job.  

She may be under pressure due to her son's addiction, but she shouldn't take it out on her staff or have double standards for them.  Give the two weeks notice and be ready to explain why you left in upcoming job interviews.   

If she's usually much more reasonable, you can try to have a conversation with her about it and see if she's more reasonable and apologizes or admits she made a mistake.
You're not overreacting at all. Do you work thru an agency? If so I would get them involved. 
Next shift I'd look Sarah in the eye and calmly say that you need to discuss what happened. If she offers no apology, then yeah hand in your notice.

,Secondary PTSD? Caregiver Burden? The cost of being a Caregiver.,,,2016-05-11 12:46:44,TheImprovCaregiver,4ivu23
,New to This-Crash Course Needed,"Hi, I've been sort of back-up caregiver for a while to my sister (her husband is/was primary)  but now I'm primary for a while at least.  My older  sister is frail, diabetic, level 5/6 dementia, incontinent, etc.  I never had children so this business of constant laundry, changing clothes, ""suggesting"" someone brush her teeth or change her panties, cleaning up if she doesn't... And the feeding, my stars, what do you do about the unending food preparation and clean-up?  Help.  Tricks for tact would be appreciated.  Easy food & snacks needed.  And how to develop patience?  I cut her nails for the first time today!  I was so scared I'd nip her toe.  How do I Know what to do?  ","Crash Course Caregiver Info in Order of How You Listed Concerns:
1. The assumption is your sister is type 2 diabetic- too high blood glucose may cause increased urination- is her blood glucose monitored by finger stick at home? If she is on oral medication for control and her glucose is too high- she needs a change in medication or to possibly have infection ruled-out (such as a urinary tract infection which may also cause sense of ""urgency"" needing to urinate frequently but not high volume).  Note- a blood sugar that is too low in a diabetic is often caused by taking diabetic medication (which lowers the blood sugar because the pancreas is not working well) then NOT eating enough to keep the glucose stable- the too low glucose will cause weakness and increased confusion, which may contribute to everyone assuming it is just her dementia worsening.  A written log of her finger stick glucose levels should be kept by date and time to monitor if she fluctuates too high or too low.
2.  Is she incontinent of urine or bowel movements or both?  Rule-out underlying causes first, urinary tract infection as mentioned, or bowel problems, and if no diagnosis other than frailty and dementia/not knowing she has to use the toilet, then purchase adult pull-up diapers- they are less expensive in large volume at ""big box stores"" Costco/Sam's Club- even cheaper, non-brand names are better than no diapers. Try scheduled toileting first- as in when she first wakes up, and 30 minutes-one hour after meals or fluid intake,  Put on two adult diapers at bedtime to save changing an entire soiled bed. 
3.  To lessen the effort changing entire wet/soiled bed linens: (look for a YouTube demo if my instructions can't be comprehended) Invest in a breathable, but ""water proof"" mattress pad.  Then cover with a fitted sheet.  Then fold a flat sheet into about 1/2 and center this in the middle of the bed and tuck-in each side under mattress so it does not move while your sister is in bed. This is called a ""draw sheet"" in hospital lingo (yes, I'm an RN- I've changed thousands of beds in 35 years). Place a clean disposable or washable ""chux"" (can be bought at big box stores, sometimes or online, or at health supply stores) anyway, place on top of the draw sheet.  If your sister wets or soils the bed, you can turn her to one side, (have her husband hold her if you think she will roll off of bed) clean her with moist wipes, remove the soiled chux, then untuck & roll-up the soiled draw sheet to her back, then place a  clean draw sheet & chux on the bed- tuck in the side nearest you & roll the other 1/2 of the draw sheet & clean chux next to the soiled draw sheet, then roll her back toward you over the rolled up dirty draw sheet & clean draw sheet- then you can reach over her and pull the soiled draw sheet away, and unroll the other half of the clean draw sheet & chux, & tuck that side of draw sheet into the other side of the mattress- then your sister may be turned to lie on her back, if that is the position she prefers- if she becomes unable to turn her self-she will need to be turned side-to-side every few hours to prevent pressure sores.  
-In the daytime, schedule hygiene activities together- for example, after breakfast- help with toileting, shower and teeth brushing- then toileting after lunch, then toileting and teeth brushing at bedtime, and double diapers before going to bed. For her ambulating safety, you may need to invest in a rolling ""walker"" to prevent falls- some have a seat she can sit on if she tires while walking- insurance may cover this expense if a doctor writes for a ""prescription""
4.  Your sister should be dressed in easy to wear & change clothing- anything that requires buttoning and zipping is not easy for her or you.
5.  Your sister should be on a diabetic diet - if her primary care doctor's office hasn't provided her with reading material/menus- diets can be found online- look for American Diabetic Association (ADA) or a valid or reputable government or university site-   As far as food preparation- you are better off making large volumes once a week, and freezing portions if possible, rather than separate, new meals all day. Also prepare simple, healthy food that doesn't require multiple plates or bowls or utensils- such as Greek yogurt and cut-up fruit, or cheese slices, etc. As a break for you, even if it's not ""earth friendly,"" use disposable plates for one of the meals. Income wise- (if you are in America) she may qualify for meals-on-wheels, a daily, free lunch delivered, which would give you one break from meal making.
6.  You have to be very careful trimming toenails on diabetics to not cause breaks in the skin, because it may cause infection and diabetics do not heal easily and are prone to infections, especially on the feet. If her insurance covers the cost, she should go to podiatrist for foot care.
7.  You and your brother-in-law probably can't continue to care for your sister alone- it is a lot of work that will cause you and him to become exhausted and resentful, and then your sister will suffer from less than quality care.  You will both need breaks from care giving.
My child had a nanny growing up, so I had *no* experience with caretaking when I retired early in order to take care of my mother when my father died.  (I'm her only relative living in-state and she wasn't thriving in the nursing home my sister had put her in.  Okay, 
""wasn't thriving"" is an understatement; she was calling me multiple times a day begging me to get her out of there!)    

First:  You're a saint for being willing to jump in and help out.  When the going gets hard, remember that.  You're doing a really good thing and doing a really good thing is rarely easy. 

Second:  It's going to get worse -- but then it will get better!  So as it gets harder and harder, and it will, remember that.  As you figure things out and get in a routine, it actually does get lot better.  

Third:  Don't beat yourself up if your sister's health declines.  Given her health challenges, her path is somewhat set and, as a result, the best ""win"" you can probably hope for here is to stabilize her health.  There will be other things you can do that will help your sister and her husband, but I think it's kind of important -- and hard! -- to realize that ""getting better"" oftentimes isn't one of them.  If you can get your head in the right place for that, it will help. 

Fourth:  Set a time limit.  It's hard to do this difficult work if you're thinking that there's no end in sight.  I really suggest that you have a conversation with yourself that goes something like, ""I will commit to doing this for X weeks/months.""  Calculating how far you've come -- and the time remaining! -- will really help you get through the difficult times.  And as that deadline gets closer, you will start to think about and plan for the future.   Has BIL fully recovered?  Will they need home health aides to support them?  Think about your own life and the people in it who are sacrificing *you* to this effort.  Make a careful assessment of what you're sacrificing in your own life so you can think about it and make a knowledgeable and concerted decision about whether you want to go on and on what terms.

Here's how, after seven long, hard, head-bangingly difficult years as my mother's caregiver, I figured out some of the things that you mentioned: 

**Constant Laundry, Part 1** - *Find a fluff-and-fold service ASAP.*  Yes, you can do it yourself and, once things settle down a bit, you will.  But right now, stabilizing your sister's health and mastering the routine is your top priority.  If money is a barrier, you can save by washing heavier sheets or blankets at home and letting the fluff-and-fold service do her clothes.  (They typically charge by the pound.)  This will save you a lot more time -- and frankly, effort -- than you'll realize.  I discovered this in desperation when I fell ill and it's been a super safety net at times when things get crazy or I'm overwhelmed.  

**Constant Laundry Part 2** - Make sure she's got enough clothes, sheets, waterproof mattress covers, mattress pads, and anything else you're washing all the time.  You don't want to find yourself needing to change the bed or put her to bed only to realize that you're out of sheets or nightgowns!  Having more than enough of the things you launder the most means that you won't be constantly chasing the laundry.

**Changing clothes** - If you're changing clothes a lot because of incontinence, the incontinence products may not be working effectively and it's worth investigating why that might be the case.  Your sister may need different ""panties"" -- my mother wears the heavy-duty ""overnight"" ones during the day, for example; there are also products called ""doublers"" (pads that you put inside the ""panties"") that you can use at night.  We've also found that some brands work better than others.  (We tried a wide range and finally settled on TENA products at the recommendation of a friend.)  

It may be that the system for changing her panties may need some tweaking as well, i.e., she may simply need to have help changing them more often.  

Figuring out how to improve the incontinence issues is probably the best time (and money) you'll ever spend.  It means you don't have to spend as much time ""cleaning up"", it reduces laundry, preserves her skin and self-respect, makes it less likely that she'll get a urinary tract infection -- and improves everyone's spirits!

It's often suggested, moreover, that you can get someone on a schedule for emptying their bowels by having them go sit on the toilet at certain times of the day -- ""training"" the body that now is the time to urinate/defecate.  If you can get her on a schedule -- and I suspect she probably is on some kind of a schedule; it's just difficult to perceive and you don't know what it is! -- that will help a lot with EVERYTHING!  I.e., you don't have to ""suggest"" that it's time to brush her teeth; it's just something that always happens every day after X and before Y.  

If bad breath despite brushing is an issue, she may not be drinking enough water.  (People with incontinence often try to drink less because they think they won't have to urinate so much; this results in their becoming dehydrated and you just have more problems, so it's definitely worth it to do everything possible to encourage them to drink.)  You can encourage it by having a glass of water sitting beside her at all times.  I try to make the glass of water more attractive for my mother by using ice water and a straw; flavored water might also be more attractive to your sister.   

If you can figure out what the barrier to tooth brushing is -- tooth pain, difficulty holding a brush, difficulty standing, or even not wanting to leave a certain TV show, whatever -- you'll have a better chance at figuring out how to get over it so it's not a constant issue.  

There are also ""adult teeth wipes"" that can be put on a finger and the teeth can be cleaned that way.  They are not a substitute for brushing but they could be helpful if mobility is a barrier. 

**Feeding** - Again, a schedule is super helpful!  If possible, try to find out from her or your BIL what she generally has for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks.  Because she is undoubtedly on a special diabetic diet and I am unfamiliar with what that might entail, I'm reluctant to make any specific suggestions.   I do, however, buy single servings of anything that I can to reduce spoilage.  

Another suggestion, kind of along the lines of using a fluff-and-fold laundry service until you get your sea legs under you, is to use paper plates!  Even if you have a dishwasher, someone has to load it, run it, unload it and put the dishes away.  Paper plates just go in the trash!  We use them rather a lot; my mother doesn't care and it really reduces the amount of dishes.  

**Smell** - You didn't mention it but, along the same lines, if your sister is incontinent, smell is an issue.  Febreeze is now your best friend!  I used to try to economize by using generic trashbags but, honestly, one of the smartest things I've ever done is pay just a tiny bit more for trash bags that have been treated with Febreeze.  I spray it on upholstery, the rug. I use the 2X air freshener kind in the air.  This is a difficult enough job to do in the first place; you don't need to be hit by stinky smells every time you open the door!  

By the way, I also always keep a spray can of Lysol -- or the generic brand -- along with (1) a pump dispenser of hand sanitizer, (2) Clorox antibacterial wipes, and (3) paper towels on hand all the time.  I also keep disposable latex gloves (I don't have a latex allergy; if you do, there are alternative disposable gloves available as well) to put on my hands for ""clean ups.""   

Having what you need when you need it is really critical; it gives you a lot more confidence!  Keeping yourself healthy is important to everybody and, since you're being exposed to a lot of germs here, it's not something you'd want to overlook.  If your sister uses a commode, I'd suggest using the plastic liners; that will make that chore much faster and easier as well!  

**Patience** - Knowing that you have a ""stop date"" will help.  It's also helpful, I find, to put a smile on my face -- whether it wants to be there or not!  Keep pleasant thoughts about your sister in your mind, maybe remembering good times you've had or things she's done for you.  Make yourself think three nice thoughts about her every morning.  

Be aware of your own needs; I find, for example, that I am less patient if I am in pain (tennis elbow, for example), so being aware of that reminds me to take an aspirin or whatever.  I'm also less patient if my own needs -- for sleep, for peace and quiet, for alone time -- aren't being met, so be aware of what you need and be creative, if necessary, in finding ways to meet them.  (Having at times no other option, I've even sat in my car in my mother's driveway.  It wasn't entirely satisfying, but it worked in a pinch!)

Your BIL's reluctance to call in home health aides is almost universal among caregivers -- they all want to wait until the last possible minute -- and it is a **universal mistake.**  If you can encourage him to integrate someone into their routine -- perhaps as he continues his own recovery -- you will be doing everyone a great favor.  And if payment is the concern, almost every state has a program that can provide assistance since aging in place is much less expensive than in a nursing home.  

I hope this helps!  I'm sure I haven't thought of everything so, if I can be of any additional assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out.  And best of luck!!!!  ",2016-04-23 11:50:25,WinstonDresden,4g3zpk
,My comments as a caregiver,"Caregiving is complex.

Each patient being cared for is so completely unique that each approach (by definition) has to be different.

Each Caregiver is unique in experience, temperament, knowledge, attitude, etc, so each caregiver’s approach will be different.

For a caregiver looking for guidance on what to do with a given patient, I don’t believe there is a handbook beyond the basics of patience, kindness, etc. Seeing how others handle the task is a way to formulate your own approach. So I share my situation to try to be helpful.

I am a caregiver for my wife who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s some 3 years ago. We have an excellent relationship, and I consider her my best friend. But I’m slowly losing her. I often think of Nancy Reagan’s long good-by.

About 2 years ago, I decided that being her caregiver was going to have to become my full time job. I became uncomfortable leaving her alone. She would get anxious and worried and forget where I went, even though I would write it on a whiteboard on the refrigerator. Once the decision was made to do this full time, it wasn’t a problem to give up the golf, the lunches/beers with the guys, or simply running off to the store or the driving range when I wanted. At first she would come along and drive the cart, then last year she had a stroke and lost the use of her left hand, so she could only ride in the cart. Without being able to practice my game (my putting is abysmal), it seemed best that I shift the focus totally to her. Besides, she now has difficulty dressing, showering, etc., and the workload is increasing with laundry, cleaning, cooking, shopping, etc. To think that my wife did all this stuff for 50 years while raising 3 kids and being our social secretary and never complaining....I have a lot to learn.

My son suggested I get someone to come in to help with Mom. Being a bit macho, I resisted. But then I said it would be OK for the wife of one of his employees to spend half a day a week with my wife. Wow, suddenly I could go get a haircut, go to the bank, get groceries, get an oil change, have a doctor visit, etc. without worry. The girl (40ish) is a Godsend and my wife loves her. Took my wife to get nails done, hair done, buy women’s things, etc. Now we are up to 6 hours/day, 3 days a week. A bit expensive, but my wife is energized, and I am getting my stuff done...even went to the driving range last week. This additional caregiver is very, very helpful and more valuable than I originally thought.

Interesting observation regarding Alzheimer’s…...people are uncomfortable with the disease. It becomes difficult to hold a conversation, so people that were friends for years begin to fade away. Even see it a bit with the children. Some loneliness begins to creep in. My wife asks…”how come we don’t see so and so anymore?” ….and the caregiver’s friends fade away because he’s busy with his wife now. This side impact needs to be managed by the caregiver.

The disease will not get better, so I’m not sure where this is going to take us. Reading all the stuff about caregiving and what to do can be mind boggling. I’m just taking things a day at a time feeling blessed that I still have her as my companion. The smile, the hand holding, the occasional hug is wonderful and irreplaceable. Hopefully, sharing my experience can help someone else.","You are from the honorable, dying generation of spouses who follow all wedding vows that in essence convey staying with a spouse ""for better and worse, and sickness and in health"" (two wedding vows specific for your situation) and not just staying for only times that are ""better and in health.""  That said, you need to maintain your role as your wife's husband, not around-the-clock caregiver or you will become exhausted and resentful.  How do I know? Because I have been married more than 30 years, and my husband, who is seven years older than I am, developed a progressive neurological disease 15 years ago, while we still had school-age children. He is now in a wheelchair, and cannot drive, but can still manage most of his activities of daily living independently because we remodeled our home for safety and to accommodate his disability. I am an RN, who has always worked full-time in clinical patient care, and unfortunately also assumed the role of my husband's private duty nurse after my hospital shifts, in addition to managing our home and my husband's transportation to doctor's appointments ""on my days off.""  Blurring my roles as a working RN and wife, who was expected to also be a nurse at home, started to become unmanageable.  I transitioned out of hospital nursing two years ago and became a nurse educator in a college of nursing, but I  accompany students to hospital shifts in addition to teaching lectures and clinical skills, so my life is essentially patient care at work and at home.  Family and friends tell me how ""great it is that I am a nurse and know how to care for my husband,"" but can't comprehend that no, I am a nurse at work, but need to be a wife at home, and that when I state I need to eventually hire help, it's because I have to be wife at home, not a 24 hour nurse, and I need breaks from both roles. We, too lost most of our friends when my husband was diagnosed, but that's human nature- some people don't know what to say or do, some don't want us to socialize with them, and some are just glad they aren't in our shoes, yet... but with time and by chance, every one experiences health issues. You are exactly right when you wrote that people with an ill spouse must live a day at a time and not dwell on what may happen or how life used to be.  I know life could be worse, so I think of the times we had that were great, and that we have two wonderful children, and that we can still enjoy many things that brought us together, mainly as you also wrote- companionship- just enjoying each other's company.
I have found my clients some assistance through our local senior centers. Our state dept. Of long term care and aging has a program called respite assistance. It pays for some of the cost of having personal caregivers. Our local senior center also has a room of lending medical assist equipment like wheelchairs, walkers, portable toilets, crutches, etc,",2016-04-20 16:36:56,NH_vet,4fpf2s
,(CA) paying for a caregiver I didn't hire?,"I live with my mother who has dimentia. There is a sibling here and has decided to hire a caregiver because he probably doesn't want to take care of her. She's currently peeing herself but it's only whenever he's watching her, so he's not doing something right. Anyways do I have to pay for this caregiver? He said he wants me to pay for half of the expenses.

I already wash her, feed her, and everything. ","Of course not.  You are taking good care of your mother, and if he chooses to hire someone instead of helping you himself, that's on him.

He's not hiring someone to help YOU, but to take over for HIM, no matter what he says.  
You should only pay for half of the cost for a caregiver if you are involved in hiring a caregiver and the caregiver is giving you a break from assisting your mother. A real concern is your mother is urinating on herself while being ""cared for"" by the ""caregiver"" your sibling hired.  This ""caregiver"" is either not educated and trained to assist your mother with activities of daily living, which includes scheduled bathroom breaks to avoid ""accidents,"" or your mother may be stressed by this ""stranger-caregiver.""  Elderly people (especially females) also may urinate on themselves if they are developing a urinary tract or bladder infection- so that should be assessed. If you are providing your mother with assistance bathing and eating, and your sibling is not, then, no you shouldn't be obligated to pay for the supplemental caregiver.  I would also be home for a few hours to observe how a caregiver interacts with your mother - especially because she has dementia and is vulnerable and cannot tell what her needs are.  When you or your sibling leave, do not tell the caregiver when you will be home exactly, so you can arrive without notice and see how the caregiver is ""watching"" your mother.",2016-04-19 18:02:46,SR20SE,4fk1hx

,Tired and Unappreciated,God I just don't know what else I can do. ,"You have to find time every day to do something for yourself, and not feel guilty.
We understand how you feel. It sucks. Take some deep breaths, try to clear your mind of all thoughts, go for a walk around the block, listen to music if you want, just get out and breathe and forget or try to forget for a little while. It's not much but it's so much better than nothing, especially if you can do it regularly. 
Tired? Yes....that goes with the job. Baseball players get tired.

Unappreciated?....no way. Open your eyes. Look around at all the people that see the care you are giving and are envious that they are unable to get that attention themselves, or that they are unable to give another that level of care. And the recipient, think about how grateful they are inside even though they may not express it. Without you, where would they be? And you, why do you need others to appreciate and recognize what you do?  Like an artist, express yourself through the best caregiving you know how to do....and accept that not everyone will agree, but you will feel great inside for having done the best you can....and once in awhile, smile at what a good job you do.
I feel your pain! It's easy to FEEL unappreciated, but know that you ARE. The person your caring for knows they couldn't do it without you. They may not say ""thank you,"" but their very way of life is a testament to your love and care. Hang in there, because when you do hear ""thank you,"" it makes it all the better.

,I need help with finding an automatic pill dispenser!,"My grandmother is in really good shape for her age, 79. She has started to have issues with memory but nothing close to an issue where we would need to remove her from her home. She lives alone and I've been worried about her remembering to take her medicine and to refill her weekly dispenser. I'm looking for something that would let me keep it filled with 1-3 month supply of medicine as I live 8 hours away and can't fill it for her more than that. She takes 9 pills twice a day. I also would like for it to alert me call/text/app/whatever when she doesn't open or seem to take her pills.

I've looked all over the internet and have found 3 options:

* [MedMinder](https://www.medminder.com): This seems like a good option but it would have to be filled every two weeks. I see that you can have the trays sent to a pharmacist and have them fill it. She has a small local pharmacist that already delivers her medicine to her, he's a sweetheart, but she would be upset if we put a ""burden"" on his to fill the trays. And even if I could get her to let him do it she would have to be able to fill the alert again.

* [Hero](https://herohealth.com/): This one seems like the least likely option. Expensive. Doesn't really seem to hold much. And only holds up to 10 types. If she gets any more medication I would have issues. Also you have to pay for a subscription to the alert system after 90 days.

* [Livi](http://liviathome.com/): This seems like the best option to meet our needs but no idea when it's actually going to be released or the cost.


Does anyone have experiences with these? Or other products out there? Any advice would be great!


Thanks so much!","I was going to say, just buy a bunch of them, but then I realized you can't even get a three month supply of most meds. 

I'd say she needs an actual caregiver, not someone who lives 8 hours away and can only come by every 1-3 months (no dis on you, it is what it is). If you could get someone in even once a week, you could rest a lot easier.

Good luck.",2016-04-08 12:11:48,Kaewee,4dx36z

now it makes more sense.   I am glad I wrote it down and am getting more clear. 

No wonder i am exhausted and have not even been in the sun yet! 

AWARENESS IS THE FIRST STEP. 

Now that i know this...
I am scared to write down all I have been doing for my GF back in chicago.   its probably even longer.    I need to learn to do it differently.  no wonder i had a heart attack ; ) 

all constructive criticism, links, and language most welcome. 
I wish I could offer any kind of advice. I feel like this is the line we all tread trying to help others. Just today I was thinking about how much I do that I'm not supposed to be/ wasn't hired to do; things that drain precious time from my own day. I wish I could offer some advice, but I hope knowing that you're not the only one who struggles with asserting your boundaries gives you a sense of community. Best of luck, cheers to being a considerate person to the point of self-sacrifice. This drink's for you.

,"Caregivers, please don't forget to take care of yourselves.","I moved back home 2 years ago to help my mother with my father with Alzheimer's.  He became increasingly more violent and erratic as the disease became worse.  We put him into a home because I have Multiple Sclerosis, and the stress of taking care of not only my father, but now my mother who developed terrible depression (she wasn't even showering herself) became too much for me.

My mom decided to remove my father from the home and take on caring for him full-time, even though me and my sister live 400+ miles away.  When an ER nurse called me last thursday to tell me my mother had a heart attack, my sister and I came down to watch my father.  The house looked like an episode of Hoarders but minus the bugs.  I've only been gone for 6 months and the house was in TERRIBLE condition.  

Point is -- please take care of yourselves.  My mother who assumed full time caregiving gave up on caring for herself.  At only 60, she suffered a massive heart attack and her heart is only at 20% capacity.  ","I am so sorry. I hope your mother recovers. Best luck to you.
I really hope your mom recovers, and I wish you luck on your journey.

On the top of caring for yourself, I feel as if many people get this idea caring for yourself first may take away the care from your parents or whoever you are caring for, which is the opposite from the truth.

Imagine having a robot that washes the dishes. At 50% strength, the dishes will end up dirty due to the robot not being cared for. However, at 100% strength, the dishes will become better with the robot.

Caring for yourself is a win-win scenario for both you and the person you are caring for, and it is important to see that.

Once again, may your mom get better, and good luck to all.",2016-03-16 10:51:10,rocknroll_heart,4ao520
,"I'm full time caregiver for my man. I'm just 33, miss having sex.","Hi,
Thanks for reading.  i was very happy in a healthy relationship , lots of sex and happiness with my fiance until he had a really brutal car accident, now I'm his caregiver. I love him to death and I'm not planning to leave him, but I'm just 33 and feel like I'm 80. Lots of obligations and sadly our sex is very limited now. How do you do this? how do I approach people? i'm afraid people may think I'm an asshole cheating on my disable man. It's so complicated.","Sounds like you need to discuss it with your fiance first.  You need to lock down the open relationship part before looking elsewhere. 
Does your fiancé care about you seeing other people? If you're just looking for casual sex and not a relationship, go about it the same way other people do- Tinder, meet ups, plenty of fish, etc. You don't have to divulge every detail of your life to people you're meeting/having sex with. If it comes up, keep it simple- ""I have a boyfriend, but it's an open relationship. He knows I'm here, it's all good"" and move on. 
I am seperated from my wife (divorce for poor people), you can check with her. I also help care for my mother (up in years). I'm not old, but the work beats me up and I really want to date on a low key level. I think it's more about are you looking for a new mate or just meet needs we all have. FWB or just meet and scratch. 
I am exactly where you are. It is so hard.  10 years now.  I often lie awake at night thinking here is a perfectly beautiful good man going to waste.   something has to change. I don't know how to split the difference between being a good man, a good person, and good to myself.

,Caregivers of person's with Alzheimer's,"
Greetings!


I’m a graduate student from Indiana University of Indianapolis. I’m trying to find people who are caring for loved ones with memory issues (or have in the past 5 years). When I looked at the current apps/tools  available to you, I found that they make a lot of assumptions about what you need. I want to change that. 


I’m hoping that through talking to you for 15-60 minutes, depending on your availability, I could learn more and we could discuss what your ideal technology would do (e.g. let you know what resources are available in your location, whether you would be interested in 5 minute meditation sessions).


If you or someone you know would be able to do this, it would be greatly appreciated! Please consider helping me to create a tool that could better service you and help me understand what technology can do to better serve you.


Sincerely,

,Is this a bad caregiver? How bad is too bad?,"Ugh.

Please believe that I gave you as much brevity as I possibly could.  (This is a real shitshow.)

I am not a caregiver--yet--although I'm sure in another 10-15 years I'll be taking care of my mother.  I'll have plenty of time to get ready for that and it doesn't bother me; I'm actually kind of looking forward to it.

I'm *seriously* bothered by the current situation with my boyfriend's brother and mother.  ""Boyfriend"" and I have been dating for a year; our relationship is built on love and trust and respect.  We are both eagerly looking forward to enjoying the rest of our lives together.  We have talked a little of marriage; we are taking things slow.  Due to our schedules we spend about 2 nights per week together, at his place.

""Boyfriend's"" mother and younger brother have been staying at ""Boyfriend's"" house--this time 5 for months; before that it was 10.   ""Brother"" is 40-something going on 12, with cerebral palsy, developmental/intellectual disability, seizures, and life-threatening allergies.  He's fully mobile and does not require ""round-the-clock *care*"" so much as round-the-clock supervision.  He does have some mild speech impairment, fine motor deficits and bladder/bowel control issues.  He's a sweet boy, fully innocent; he loves Lego Batman and football and his dog, and of course his Mom and brother.  

""Brother"" was not expected to live past 20.  Then 30.  His whole life, he was not expected to outlive anyone in his family.  It was just assumed that he would be cared for by one or both of his parents for the rest of his life.  I have no idea what his life expectancy is now.  

""Brother"" was closest to his father, who died some 5 or so years ago.  ""Mother"" is now his only caregiver.  ""Brother"" has never been in a group home, or any kind of program that I know of.  He's always been cared for by his father and/or mother, in the home.

The ""home"" part is the crux of all this.  ""Mother"", ""Father"" (RIP), and ""Brother"" were living in what is now ""Boyfriend's"" house, for some years prior to ""Father's"" death.  When ""Father"" died, ""Mother"" bought a house elsewhere and ""Boyfriend"" took over the rental house and has lived there for the past 4-5 years.  There is (and has historically been) no lease for this rental; ""Boyfriend"" and (according to her) ""Mother"" are both friendly with the landlord.  I don’t know what kind of agreement (if any) was established at the time “Boyfriend” took over the house.  I know that he loves the house, considers it his, and does not want to move (it’s close to his work).

""Mother's"" purchased house was lost somehow (I don't know the details and don't much care) and since that time she and ""Brother"" have been batching it in motel rooms, sleeping in the truck, or staying with ""Boyfriend"" or his other brother (who has since moved 2 hours away, and I'm not kidding when I say there's a grim joke about the reason why).

""Mother"" refuses to rent.  She has a P.O. box and that's the only address she'll give out.  (""Boyfriend"" is sure she's running from creditors.)  She has insisted *for years* that she's going to buy a house with the VA loan available to her--but either there are no houses, or they all have mold, or the realtors are intentionally screwing her.  And that's *if* she's actually been looking.  (""Boyfriend"" believes that she just sits around on Facebook all day.)  ""Brother"" and ""Mother"" both get some kind of monthly benefit (SSI? VA?) and according to ""Boyfriend"" it's plenty for meeting all of both their needs, including rent or mortgage.

Last September, ""Brother"" experienced such chest pain and shortness of breath that ""Mother"" feared he was having a heart attack and he was admitted to hospital.  Turns out he had serious pneumonia; he was in hospital for a couple weeks.  They had been doing several months of the motel/truck thing up to that point.  ""Boyfriend"" agreed to let them stay (again), for 1 month, after ""Brother"" was released from hospital.  That was 5 months ago.  

Prior to that, ""Mother"" and ""Brother"" had been staying with ""Boyfriend"" for 10 months (which also had started as ""1"").  That stint ended when ""Boyfriend"" and ""Mother"" exchanged harsh words and ""Mother"" up and left--then later claimed she'd been ""kicked out"".  

The harsh words were over the way ""Mother"" treats ""Brother's"" dog when I'm around.  ""Brother's"" dog is trained as a service animal (seizure alarm) but does not have the official certification; he's a smallish, somewhat excitable and very sociable dog.  I like him, and he likes me.  Whenever I come over, ""Dog"" gets very excited and barks and tries to jump up on me.  This has become a weird and uncomfortable sticking point.

I started visiting ""Boyfriend's"" house last spring, and ""Dog"" and I began to develop a routine:  I come over, the dog barks and jumps up and down; I tell the dog to chill out until I get my shoes and coat off, and then I pet the dog and he's ecstatic.  This was going great for a while, I thought--""Dog"" getting used to me and responding to my directions--until ""Mother"" started keeping ""Dog"" away from me completely.  She didn't say anything to me directly (not for a while), just wouldn't let the dog come near me at all, would yell at him punitively if he barked or ran toward me.  Anti-socializing, basically.  ""Boyfriend"" doesn't think ""Brother"" is strictly capable of being jealous as such, so he's convinced it's entirely about ""Mother.""  

""Mother"" did eventually later come out and say that ""Brother"" told her he doesn't want the dog to accidentally hurt me (with my fibromyalgia I frequently have slow and uneven gait, and in all fairness on a bad day the dog *could* knock me over).  ""Boyfriend"" says this is total BS, because ""Brother"" does not have the capacity to think of something like that.  I don't have enough experience with ""Brother"" to form my own conclusions on that.

Anyway, last spring as I was entering the house one day, the dog was running to greet me and ""Mother"" sprang up out of her chair and grabbed the dog by the hair (he's got long dreadlocks) so hard that he yelped.  I was shocked and upset.  ""Boyfriend"" had had enough (of all of her crap; that was just the last straw) and told her what he thought.  She ended up packing up and leaving in a huff.  They were on their own for several months (motel/truck) before ""Brother"" got sick and wound up in hospital.
 
These days when I visit I try to avoid the dog.  It makes me sad, but I don't want to incite anyone's jealousy or give ""Mother"" a reason to unfairly punish the dog.  (I'll pet him when no one's looking.)  She's still trying to keep the dog away from me completely, not just when I walk through the door.  I've told ""Boyfriend"" that if she again yanks him so hard that he cries, I'll probably turn on my heel and walk outta there.  He understands.

I just brought up the dog thing because it's a situation 1) in which I've had the most direct contact with ""Mother"" and 2) perfectly illustrates her crazy.  There's plenty more where that came from, and it gets much, much worse.

In our discussions, I get the impression that ""Boyfriend"" hasn't completely thought through the situation and would prefer not to.  ""Brother"" was never supposed to live this long; the thought that he would outlive both parents was not part of the initial picture.  After ""Father's"" death, ""Mother"" and ""Brother"" became an inseparable unit.  According to ""Boyfriend"", ""Mother"" is not only the *best* caregiver for ""Brother"", she is the *only possible* caregiver.  (And believe me I call BS on that.)

I started to question ""Mother's"" capability as a caregiver when I found out that she and ""Brother"" had been essentially homeless for 4 years.  I don't need to be an expert to know that sleeping in a truck or motel every other week is no bueno for someone with physical vulnerabilities, poor health, or a child's mentality--not to mention all three.  Then I started to have direct experience with ""Mother"", and her crazy became startlingly apparent in short order.

I don't think “Mother” is siphoning ""Brother's"" money, although I really wouldn't know for sure.  She's at the very least not providing him with a stable residence--and from I've witnessed of their interactions, I can imagine poor ""Brother's"" life is brimful of mental and emotional manipulation.  I consider it ""abusive"" to never give people choices or let them have their own voice and constantly groom them, but I'm not sure that would line up with a textbook definition of ""abuse""--especially in this case.  (He may be mentally a child and have some slight speech difficulty, but I have been around him enough to know that he has his own thoughts and opinions and therefore does *not* need someone to put words in his mouth or speak for him *constantly*, *at the expense of his own authentic voice*.)

I have told ""Boyfriend"" that I will help him take care of his brother should it come to that (I'm not working currently so it wouldn't mean a huge restructuring of my life and that's what you do when you love someone who loves someone).  I have even imagined a possible day in which ""Boyfriend"" and I get married (perhaps earlier than we'd intended) specifically so he and I can both be ""Brother's"" legal guardians.

""Boyfriend"" doesn't want to ""blow up [his] family"" or change the status quo in any way--other than getting the house-guests out.  He doesn't want to be responsible for ""Brother"" if ""Mother"" can hack it.  I get that.  But at what point do you look at the choices of a caregiver and say, ""You're doing a shit job.  You need to straighten up and fly right, or we're gonna fire you and get somebody to do the job right""?  

""Boyfriend"" won't have these kinds of conversations directly with ""Mother""--and from what I've seen, I understand why.  She's completely mental; you can't get a straight word out of her.  It's obvious that she's going to try and sponge off of ""Boyfriend"" as much as she possibly can.  She drives him bonkers with her narcissistic drama and manipulation.  And he, rather than taking a hard line with her, swallows his ulcers and puts up with it--extra month after extra month--for the sake of his little brother.

So I'm just sitting here waiting for the next catastrophe--and I kind of hate this but I'm hoping it's bad enough that the situation *must* be addressed head-on, instead of being swept under the rug yet again.

How bad is it to keep a vulnerable, fully-dependent disabled person basically homeless for a matter of years?  They always seem to have someplace to sleep--motel, couch, or truck--and food and medicine and everything else, which is why it doesn't seem to bother ""Boyfriend"" very much.  He still prefers to let this sleeping dog lie--though I fear no intervention may eventually mean a sleeping dog becomes a critically ill--or dead--one.

TL;DR #1  Is 4 years of “couch-surfing” homelessness sufficient cause to terminate (or even call into question) the guardianship of a developmentally and physically disabled adult?  Is it enough to put the guardian “on notice” in any legal way?

TL;DR #2  What does it take to challenge the guardianship of a disabled adult?  (The guardian in this case is the dependent’s biological mother.)  

TL;DR #3  Has anyone had custody/guardianship issues with a total narcissistic sociopath nutjob?  How do you deal?

edit: typo
","From what you've told us, it sounds like Boyfriend could probably gain custody of his brother, but knows the process may very well destroy his family. It's not surprising he is reluctant. This is his decision and his alone so I hope you respect that.

If you want to help him prepare by answering some preliminary questions, that is commendable. I would xpost this to /r/legaladvice and ask there too if you haven't already, but really what you need is a local family attorney for reliable answers to these questions.

The constant threats and demeaning comments used to roll of my back, but I have my down periods and this just makes it that much worse.

So no money, constant demeaning, trying to stay on track with my own health. I went to the store for food yesterday, maybe gone 25 minutes. She got up and fell, after she was told to sit and wait. She had everything right there, but she got up anyway. And no social life. You have no job? Live with your mother? Great dating resume!

Hope everyone has a good day!","There are bound to be social agencies where you live that can offer help. Where I live there's the League of Older Americans. They run the Meals on Wheels program and have groups where caregivers can meet to talk about our family member. They also offer a daycare program for people with dementia/Alzheimers. 

Our group for caregivers meets once a month. It is led by a psychologist who knows programs and doctors who can help. Plus you meet people who are going through the same thing and don't feel like you're all alone. I haven't managed to get my sister (who has dementia) to go to the daycare center but I'm working on it. I also see a counselor twice a month for depression. The counselor had so much information about aspects of dementia and how to deal with my sister that I don't know what I would have done without her. 

You don't have to face this alone. There is a large community out there who can help you. Just start looking!

,Looking for help with my wife,"Hi, a little back story im a 25 female with server illnesses leading to me being wheelchair and house bound most of the time, I met my now wife a little over a year ago, and weve been happily together since, but Im growing concerned about her with all the caregiving she provides for me.

Also I came in tow with a 4 year old son whom loves her now lile crazy but I can see its hard for suddenly becoming a mom and adult caregiver.

In additon her father is also sick and her sister is going through a personal crisis, and my wife is attempting to care and help everyone but i can see its completly draining her. 

I tried looking it up and it looks like she might have caregivers fatigue? Is there anything i can do to help?","Caregiver here. I'd say one of the biggest things you could do to help would be to convince her to take time for herself - get her to go on a trip, or even just a night out with other friends; something she can do to have fun and relax. And I know it's hard to see her go off and do fun stuff that YOU want to do; but whatever you do, don't make her feel guilty about it. That's the worst thing - my wife insists I need time to go do things, but every time I do, it's a massive guilt trip and envious comments. 

It breaks my heart that she can't do things with me; but now I can't do things on my own because of how she makes me feel afterwards. 

So... don't do that. Encourage her, take pleasure in her outings, try and live vicariously through her experiences. I know it sucks and isn't as good as if YOU could do them, but don't resent her for being able to do them. Encourage her to have some ""her"" time.
Kwip has the best advice. 

If you can do small things to help out around the house, that'll help too. Even if it only takes a few minutes, it's one less thing on her list.
[/u/LjAthrowawayy](https://www.reddit.com/user/LjAthrowawayy),

You're a great spouse and loving person to recognize your wife's gift of time, energy, and care. Caregiver fatigue -- also known as caregiver burnout -- is a very real condition. As a hospice nurse, I see caregivers gradually work themselves into sickness and ever-declining health due to their constant, selfless giving. 

Your wife must remember: In order to more richly care for you, others, and your children, she must first give to herself. It will sound and feel to her as if she's being incredibly selfish, but it's absolutely a requirement for her to exercise self-care.

I'd like to recommend some resources, if I may, that could help you show her that what she may be experiencing is very real, and that she needs to take time, slow down, and care for herself.

With home care increasing in demand but expenses being high on the client (avg $3,360-5,760/month), how can agencies/care giving services make these affordable?","I have been working for an agency for some time now, and the CEO was kind enough to show me the ropes on how she started and what goes on the back end.

That's a big chunk of someone's income. Now the agency is in a very wealthy area, where homes are 1mil+, but for the rest of society, how does one go about making these services affordable to the not so wealthy?

,Caregiver comes to house twice each week who pays for her meal?,"My recently widowed mom has mild vascular dementia, characterized by absent mindedness, not retaining short-term memory details, and can get confused if things are presented her too quickly. Other than that, she's fine (can bathe herself, dress herself, do household chores, doesn't wander, etc.). 2 days each week, we have a caregiver come by to keep my mom occupied so I can have some personal time and run personal errands, and look for work locally. This usually entails the caregiver taking my mom to things like the senior center, for walks, to an Asian senior club, etc. They take the family car. This involves my mom having lunch out, usually either at the senior center or at some place like McDonald's, and we have a petty cash fund to pay for this. She gets along great with my mom; we had a different woman, prior, who was a lot younger, and there would be times where my mom would become irate and difficult. This doesn't happen with the current caregiver; so things are fine in that regard. Something that we're curious about is; who pays for the caregiver's meals? I should mention, that my mom won't eat out if the other person isn't also eating. Currently, the caregiver has been putting both her's and my mom's on one tab, and paying for the whole thing out of the petty cash fund (we're paying for her lunch). We're not entirely comfortable with this. We told her, prior, that, once in a while, she can take our mom to a nicer place, like one of the brunch restaurants, and we'll pay for both, as long as it's arranged for in advance. Also, usually there are free movies at the senior club, but once in a while, she'll want to take my mom to a regular movie that she thinks my mom will enjoy. She'll clear this with us in advance, and we said we'd pay for both theater tickets. She's also putting her popcorn and beverage on a single tab, paid in total out of the petty cash fund. We don't want to be miserly, but this is coming out of the trust my dad set up for her, which is pretty healthy at this point, but we'd like to plan for my mom not passing away anytime soon, and spend accordingly. So, what we're wondering is what's the convention? What's customary? The agency we're going through is not an inexpensive one.

Edit - As the client, I'm on a bit on the fence because she does a pretty good job with my mom, where the previous caregiver wasn't so successful. However, we're paying her, through the agency, which is supposed to be one of the better ones, a rate that's commensurate with prices on the mid-Peninsula in the San Francisco Bay Area. I hope to get more input from caregivers, like /u/dontbetouchy.","It your mom won't eat if the caregiver isn't eating, I'd view the McD cheeseburger as a work expense that the caregiver shouldn't have to cover. It's part of the cost of feeding mom as much as your mom's food. However, I'd set a budget if it seemed like the caregiver was going overboard when ordering.
I would handle it through the agency directly if it seemed like it was escalating. While I understand not wanting to let funds dwindle too quickly, there is also the issue of how much is a caregiver, one that your mom likes and is comfortable with, worth. 

So maybe track the expenses for a couple months and see what it averages out to each week. Less than paying for another hour or two per week, I would let it slide. 
I hire private caregivers for a family member with dementia, as well. We pay for her meals, any have a discretionary budget (sounds like your petty cash fund- for movies, coffee, etc.). Anything over $30 we talk about in advance. Realistically, a good companion/caregiver is worth their weight in gold. I'm happy to pay for a few meals. It's also worth considering that while the agency might cost a lot, the caregiver gets maybe half of what they charge per hour. I'm of the opinion that the better you treat a caregiver, the more likely they are to be ethical, kind and open/honest. 

That being said, if you're going through an agency- follow their guidelines. 
According to my company policy a caregiver provides their own meal and pays for their own. I do have one client who practically force feeds me though and gets insulted if I bring my own lunch. Clients pay a lot of money for a caregiver and adding meals onto that is an expense that quickly adds up. When my client buys me lunch I will leave some cash in the envelope I keep receipts in for their guardian. 

Where do you live and what agency?
When I worked for an agency it was policy that clients paid for us to eat if they wanted us to take them to a restaurant.  It saves a lot of awkwardness for both the client and the CG.",2016-01-15 23:29:17,argyle47,416uc7
,Having mom move in with you?,"So - backstory - Dad died of cancer 15 years ago-my mother has enough money to support herself.  BUT she is completely dependent on my siblings and I to do almost everything outside of self-care.  We do all of the house maintenance (she does regular cleaning, i'm talking about lawn care, cleaning gutters, fixing anything that breaks, raking leaves, etc) and take care of paying all the bills, etc. She just goes to work and cooks and cleans for herself, not worrying about those things in life.  Fine. It's worked well for 15 years. She is also dependent on us for things like listening to the answering machine, reading mail, etc.
It is v. obvious to ME that everyone's time would be easier if she moved in with someone.  She hates being alone, but loves her home. Her ideal is that one of us move in THERE, which NOPE. Little things going wrong throw her for a loop and into a ""woe is me"" sort of flying into pieces.
so my question for you - what do I do? It is getting to be a pain to have to drive there because a telemarketer left a confusing message on her machine and she can't tell if it's legit or not?  Or to have to travel 19 miles to read mail or call a doctor for her.
She is resistant to this idea, which I get it. 
What do you think?  Suggestions? Am I missing some magic way to make this easier?  She's physically fine to be alone and driving and even working - but it's causing her to stress when she's alone but she won't move in with us.
We are looking at moving anyway - my idea is that since we need to move, if she sold her house, the portion I would get would go into buying  a place big enough that she could ALSO have her own space in the house (bedroom, kitchen, living area, bathroom) so it'd be her choice at any time to be WITH us, but she'd be close enough I can help her w/things. BUT if we move w/out her help, I can, obvs., only afford a space for us - no ""inlaw apartment"" - my fear is that we will move, get settled, then she'll be like, ""oh, ok now is when I would like to move in, let's go house shopping"".
Thoughts, suggestions, advice welcome!","I am only speaking on a personal level, most people's situations are very different and circumstances vary. But my mother passed away of cancer this last December, and there is not one minute that passes by where I don't miss hearing her voice.

,Looking for some information about caregiving.,"I am currently residing in Southern California and am living with my friend's family. Recently I have found myself out of work and spending most of my day around the house. My friend's grandmother has recently become increasingly unable to carry out daily duties, and I have been more than happy to help with cleaning, cooking, and any other needs she may have. The family has talked to me about becoming an actual caregiver for her, as I'm already performing the duties, and the payments I would receieve would help both myself and the family. My questions are basically centered around becoming a caregiver, such as the steps in the process to becoming one and any training or certifications I may need. I've attempted to look around on various sites for answeres to these questions, but many sites have been about hiring a caregiver rather than becomign one. Any information provided will be greatly appreciated.","This sub is generally for caregivers of family members (tho not very active). I would say that what *they* need to do is on them, as long as you're getting paid. Tell them to look into getting SSI or whatever for getting it paid for. If they are paying out of their own pocket, you don't need anything.

I have no idea what qualifications or certifications are required for SSDI or whatever. Have you thought about calling caregiving businesses in your area and asking them what they require?
It depends on what kind of care she needs and you want to give. If housekeeping, cooking and companionship is all, then you don't really need any certifications. But, that may vary with payment mechanisms. It is another matter if it involves bathing, toileting, and assistance with ambulation. ",2016-01-05 17:31:38,LonelyLemming,3zmlex

,Depression.,"Caregiver  here. I've cared for my mother for about 7 years. No family. No friends. No job. (Not for lack of trying) I've run out of ways to stay positive I believe. The stress is overwhelming and my health is deteriorating. I realize how hopeless this sounds (and actually may be) but, as a sole care provider, having stopped my own life years ago, what can I do? (Note: Not suicidal or anything like that. Just dangerously exhausted )","Have you looked into any funding/programs that may be available to give you a break? It's important to get time to yourself to avoid burnout!

I'm in Canada so I know it's vastly different, but my dad looked after my grandmother for several years and she was assessed and they had a nurse come a few days a week to give my dad a relief (he could go grocery shopping, to a movie, anything really).

I'm not sure what your mother is suffering from but you could try reaching out to your states Society for that disease and they can get you started in the right direction! Did the same for my mother who has MS and the MS Society was a wealth of knowledge 
We don't know much about you but you're doing an amazing thing caring for your mother, it's hard to here you are struggling. It sounds like you are really lacking a support network, and doing something for you as well. You mention deteriorating health - you're going to need to care for you and get the help you need if you can help to care for someone else.

As others have suggested try reaching out to any groups who may be able to offer any kind of support or break for you, and if that works out try and do something for you - feed a hobby or interest especially something that involves meeting up with other people, this could be a great way to meet new friends and hopefully build up some more support over time.

I really hope you find the support you need, hang in there and stay strong you sound like an amazing person!
I know how it feels. Is there a support group in your area? Before I moved, I belonged to one and it was a lifesaver.   God bless you. 
1. Contact your local senior center and find out how to get a social worker involved with accessing services to help you and your mother. 
2. Try to find some community that you can connect with. Are there support groups through the senior center? Maybe you don't think of yourself as religious so most churches would not be a good fit, but you could then look into Unitarian-Universalist Congregations or Ethical Culture Societies.

,Lonely and hoping for advice,"Hi everyone,
Throwaway account here.  I've been married to my wife of 15 years and have been starting to feel a worsening sense of caregiver burnout.  Before I met her, my wife was involved in a life-threatening accident.  This left her left hand very weak and nearly unusable and she also suffers from aphasia.  I naïvely believed when we got married that she'd be fully recovered by this point.  Almost every aspect of her is diminished compared to people who are healthy.  I can't engage in substantive conversations with her because she doesn't seem to be able to offer up more than canned responses like ""life is hard"" or the like.  Without belaboring the point too much, because I've married what feels like only a portion of a person, I end up feeling pretty lonely and isolated.

How do other people deal with this?  I crave that intellectual, emotional and spiritual connection with my wife, so I don't want to get this from other places (like friends and stuff).  ","sounds like you both need some fresh air. Have you talked to your state long term care and aging dept? You might be able to get some help with care and general assistance. 
I am sorry you both are going through this, I am sure your love for her will eventually find ways to get the fulfilled connection you seek with your wife. I am sure she feels trapped inside of her body and it's difficult to express how much she loves you back. Stay strong, as this life is only physical and temporary, your souls will forever if that's what you truly want ",2015-12-05 11:36:29,mockingperson,3vjyls
,How Do I handle Mom in Hospital & Dad's Ongoing Heart Condition?,"Mom is 83 and has been in hospital for more than thirty days (and is facing another 30 days in rehab hospital). She is not a good patient - perpetually whining about her condition & demands more than we can give.

Dad is 82 and his heart is giving out. I drive him everywhere as he is too sick to drive. Visits every day except yesterday when he collapsed. Rushed him to Doctor. He is somewhat better today, so back to hospital to visit Mom.

Did I mention that I haven't seen my wife for more than a week ... and that this is the third time I've had to move in with Dad temporarily to support? 

Can anyone offer some perspective that will help prevent me from a breakdown? ","Have they looked into home health aides to take some of the stress off of you?  Someone that does light housekeeping, cooking, helps with medical needs?  Whats the plan after your mom is released?  

Have they looked into a facility that has tiered levels of care?  I know there are some where they start as fully independent, and the care increases as their needs increase.  More a retirement community combined with nursing home options.

Sounds like you are getting burned out, so do some research into caregiver burnout and ways to alleviate it.  It's very important to try to find time for yourself during these visits.  Combined with finding some time for yourself, it may help to think about how you'd feel in the future if you didn't take this time now and help them.  The guilt you'd likely feel would stay around a long time.

Finally, it may not be possible, but you and your dad need to address your mom's attitude with her, get her to realize how much it negatively impacts the ones who love her (easier said then done I'm sure!)

For you and your wife, are you doing anything to keep connected, watching a movie in sync and chatting/texting during it, etc?

Anytime I'm feeling particularity stressed or put upon, I try to remind myself I can't control other people, or most situations but I can control how I react to them.  This helps me step back and realize a lot of my unhappiness is coming from how I let myself feel and react to events.   Usually a combination of some good music to help redirect my mood and this reminder helps me regain my center.  

I've been slowly learning more about stoicism and its modern interpretations and feel that's really helped.  There is a sub, /r/Stoicism if interested.  I'm not religious or spiritual at all so this philosophy is more attractive then the alternatives.  
hugs. No real advice. You can't break down because there's no one else, right? No siblings to take some of the weight off? Your parents either refuse to have caregivers (strangers) in their home (that's my mom), or you/they can't afford it/it's not covered?

What helped for me was simply telling my mom that I would not be visiting her ever day (of the 90+ days she was in rehab). And there's no way of getting around that guilt, it's just something you learn to deal with. But I'd rather deal with the guilt, and have some of my sanity.

(we settled on every other day. That worked for the most part, except when something really dire was going on, like she was out of chapstick. But you know, we all have lives. At least, I used to.) 

And I thought I had it rough with just 1 person to take care of.

The only thing I could suggest would be to try & find out if your state has any kind of visiting nurse or volunteer program. Before her dementia progressed my mom worked for one here in NH, mostly visiting for company but she would also do small housecleaning tasks & such if asked.",2015-12-01 12:37:26,Spin_Me,3v0trz
,Tips on developing a health care directive,"I need one, especially now that doctor-assisted euthanasia is going to be legal in Canada. I have a general idea of what I want, but it is far from complete. I am also having a hard time finding good resources on the net in regards to what to include.
I need ideas on scenarios where my proxies will have to make the right choices for me. I have the basics down, like terminal illness and intractable pain where I'm sedated to the point of unconsciousness... accidents, paraplegia vs quadriplegia, dementia, MS or ALS, etc. But imo a health care directive should be extremely detailed so that your loved ones don't have to make decisions, merely ensure your decisions are adhered to.
Any ideas/scenarios would be greatly appreciated. I can tailor them to fit our medical system and laws. ","My mother has one and I'm pretty sure it is a pre-set document (one page, double sided) and it is very detailed about in what scenarios they can provide what care for you.

I would recommend asking your doctor about it- she got one from her family doctor but also at one time was also able to have one done in the ER when she didn't have it with her.

It needs to be signed by a physician. 
Life is complicated and unless you have a specific illness already that is likely to be fatal in the near future, it is virtually impossible to specify every eventuality or imagine all the alternatives. So, what you can do is write about what you want to happen under the scenarios that you have imagined -- and be sure to write about how you arrived at those decisions. The more that your loved ones understand about how you made the decisions for the scenarios you consider the better that they will be able to follow the path you would like them to navigate. But, it is unlikely that life will turn out exactly as you imagine -- what ever does? ",2015-11-29 19:20:54,,3us5i3
,Caregivers... Do medical alert bracelets and devices work?,"Caregivers, do you find that electronic alert devices (bracelets, keychains, cards) are effective? 


There are several companies that offer medical alert technology. 


The basic rundown seems to be that if something happens, a helpful stranger or emergency medical teams can scan the device with their smart phones and obtain information. 


The information is loaded into the device by the patient or caregiver so it can be tailored to their ailments. This means that there is a higher likelihood of early correct treatment and less chance of dangerously mixing medicines or treating for the wrong issue.


It sounds nice but is it effective? Do people know to look for the bracelets or what to do when they find them? The technology relies on databases and some companies charge a monthly fee ($5 seems average). Is this too much? Do people want to wear the bracelets? To me it seems like there is no use in the thing if you can't convince someone to keep it on?


Just wondering if anyone has experience with these things and would they recommend them?","My mom has allergy to penicillin and the ER did notice her bracelet . I was with her, of course, to let them know. 
EMTs are trained to look for them. Strangers, well, they have no duty or training to. 

$5 seems pretty cheap to me, but it sounds like your real issue is getting the person to wear it.

(my mother threatened to replace me with a bracelet; I asked her if the bracelet was going to fetch her paper in the morning, or make her dinner :D)
So they do work because EMTs are trained to look for them, but strangers won't necessarily notice them. Hmmm... I guess that's not ideal but it's better than nothing.

Thanks.","this must be a sensitive topic since no one has commented but they've upvoted it :).  

I think it depends on the nature of the illness, it's so easy to fall into a platonic dynamic but intimacy in any form is really important for both of your well being.  The extent will depend on what you are both comfortable with and their physical limitations can handle.

I've seen plenty of articles on the need for human touch/intimacy in keeping old people mentally and emotionally happier.  It is probably even more important for the chronically ill.  They already feel like outcasts to an extent.  The whole ""no one wants to touch/be near me because I look/feel horrible"" train of thought.

We were married about 35 years when my wife had a hemorrhagic stroke while in her office going on 2 years ago. The morning of the stroke she worked out at the gym -- i.e. she was fit and very healthy until this very sudden change. She now has a left hemiplegia, can walk very slowly with a broad-based cane, has use of only one arm/hand, has not returned to driving (yet) and can only do minimal household maintenance. Fortunately, it was a non-dominant stroke so her ability to communicate was not impaired. But, EVERYTHING takes forever resulting in many frustrations for both of us. I want to maintain a very active work schedule - I love my work. She loved her work, but was forced to retire on disability. There is a lot of jealousy - and she wants me to retire. Sometimes I want to. But, we cannot really afford that without a massive downsizing. And, I'm really at the top of my game and am not ready to give it up.

Communication is one key. We've always been pretty good at that. But, now we have to be careful about talking over meals because she tends to choke if she tries to talk much while eating. Intimacy is another key -- but it is hard given her spasticity and weakness. Nothing is easy. But, we have taken up mindfulness meditation practice every morning together. 

Counseling was very helpful early on after the stroke. We had off and on over the years done some couples counseling. It really can help to get things out in the open when there are things that are hard to talk about -- where one or the other gets very reactive on a topic (e.g. livening up sex life).  It can make a huge difference in helping get back in touch with the love. It is probably time that we do some more as new decisions are coming up.

Caregiving is very isolating.  people care but they really don't know how to react in these types of situations, it's easier to distance themselves.  And as the caregiver/patient you are too damn tired getting by in life to maintain those relationships yourself.

,When to make the transition?,"Hi everyone. I just stumbled upon this sub - wow, do I ever need a support group. Hope y'all don't mind if I start right in with a question of my own.

Our situation is this - mom has had cancer (multiple myeloma) for about 9 years now. In remission now, actually, but with a whole host of complications from the chemo. Her body and immune system are destroyed. I spent most of this time caring for her while she lived alone, but moved her in with me about a year and a half ago because I noticed she was not taking care of herself at all anymore, not eating meals if I didn't bring them, losing lots of weight, her house was a wreck and I couldn't find the time to take care of her house and my own. It was a hard decision to make (especially because I had a 3 month old baby at the time) but I didn't know what else to do. She does not have a husband or other children.

Since she's moved in with us, she has had pneumonia 7 times and has been hospitalized 8 times, all for at least 2 week stays. When she comes back home, she needs full time care. We are currently about 3 weeks out from her last hospital stay (which was almost 2 months long and involved three surgeries to resect her bowel). This time her care is extremely high maintenance. She has a huge incision site that has to be packed with gauze etc, tons of medicines to keep track of, can barely do anything for herself. I am working from home about 45 hours a week and taking care of her at the same time, and taking care of my now almost 2 year old as well.

I am really reaching the end of my rope. I just don't know who to talk to about this or what to do to make it feel more manageable and less overwhelming. I am stretched so thin. My job is very demanding and I am constantly running back and forth between her and it all day long. As soon as work ends, my child is home and I want to spend quality time with her, but often find myself having to do more things to help my mom. Mom is an extremely high maintenance person on top of having lots of physical assistance needs. My daughter does not understand and has been acting out as a result, making it even more difficult to care for everyone and keep everyone happy. My poor husband has just been lost to the shadows at this point, I have no time for myself or him. By the time I'm finished tending to everyone's needs, it's past 8pm and I just crash into bed, only to start the next grueling day all over again.

I am so stressed out, and I am starting to feel incredibly trapped, angry, resentful. I just want it to end. At this point, death would almost be a relief for me after a decade of caregiving. I want my life back. I want to spend it with my family. And then, of course, I feel incredibly guilty for having those negative feelings, but I just don't know how much longer I can hold on.

So partially, I just really needed to vent, and I thank you for listening. But I do have a question now that I have laid this all out. I have been thinking a lot about a transition to a nursing home. It feels a lot like ""the end"" to me - like a death sentence or something - if I make her do this. She will be extremely upset. She hates those institutionalized environments and does not do well in them. I don't even know how to bring up the conversation with her. It will be a huge fight and she will likely never forgive me for it. But at the same time, don't I have a responsibility to my growing family? I feel like they are just getting lost in the shuffle and I do not want to miss the early years of my daughter's life. I just don't know what to do, who to prioritize. This is the hardest decision I have ever tried to make.

Has anyone been in a similar situation with your parents? What did you do?

Thanks for listening.","Howdy, and welcome (although sorry you're here!).

I can't speak towards being in a similar situation with my parents; however, I'm going through the nursing home thing with my wife. She's 39 and has pretty aggressive MS. She's been pretty much bedridden for about five years now. 

Obviously, this is not where we planned on being. We've been struggling and making adjustments to our lives to accommodate her progression, but it's gotten too difficult: although I only work about 1.5 miles away from home, she still can't be left alone for any amount of time. So we have aides with her during the day - but they're through an agency, making barely above minimum wage, and not exactly medical professionals. Their level of care varies from really good to pretty terrible - they've repeatedly screwed up the (numerous) medicines my wife has to take, she's had some falls in the hoyer lift (which I can't criticize them too much for, as I've also dropped her from it).

But with the advancement of the disease, I just don't feel it's safe for her at home any longer. Last month I made the decision to bring up the nursing home topic. Obviously, she is/was completely devastated. She's not even 40, but facing life in the nursing home. I did my research and found an amazing home - it's about 30 minutes away (the only real downside other than being a nursing home), but it's a beautiful place with top-notch care. We talked about it (a lot), and then went for a tour. The place is great, and our hope is that after a couple years there: A) they will engage her in physical/occupational therapy that will improve her condition, and B) in that time I will be able to make home improvements so we can sell this shithole of a house we bought - a fixer-upper we bought right before the market crashed, thinking we'd have time to get it in great shape together, only to lose our shirts and sanity to this goddamned money pit... Erm... where was I? Oh - fix up this house and maybe buy a condo that could be set up for caregiving.

I hate this disease, I hate this house, and I pretty much hate life right now.

But to your original point (sorry, lost myself in a self-pitying tirade there!): I absolutely understand about it feeling like ""the end,"" and the resentment you're going to experience. 

Realistically, a nursing home is going to provide the level of care and attention you cannot (well, if you find a good one, obviously). While a child absolutely has a duty to a parent, the greater responsibility is the parents' towards the child: it's hard-coded into nature that a parent sacrifices for their child. Some(often)times that is absolutely horrible, but it's what it is. If your mother were able to look at the situation objectively, she would agree. Put yourself in her position: if your daughter were taking care of you, wouldn't you want to make it easier on her and do what you can to allow her to take care of HER child? Your mother is doubtless frustrated, scared and depressed (and rightfully so, of course). This is going to cloud her judgement and make the situation more difficult, but you have to put aside your guilt and base your decision on what is going to be best for YOUR child (and, really, your mother): you cannot continue in this situation. Not only will your mother's care suffer, but you will both begin to resent the other, your daughter will resent YOU/your lack of attention, and I'm sure this is hard on your husband as well.

I'm so, so sorry that you are in this situation. But I think you know this is for the best - there's just a ton of guilt and feeling like your failing your mother that you have to deal with. Not only would I suggest going forward with nursing care for your mother, but look into counseling for yourself - this is going to be hard to deal with, and having someone ""outside"" the situation to talk with would also be a big help.

Soooooo... I hope this helps? Stay strong, and we're here for you any time (even if we're not always the quickest to respond!)!
I came here because I was feeling sorry for myself, having given up my career to care for my 88-year-old mother (who has Parkinson's disease and a genetic vision impairment) for 6 years largely alone, without respite or a support group.  

And then I read your story and kwip's and . . . wow . . . you two ARE AMAZING!!!

So many of the things you said resonated with me, SiaMaya, especially the husband lost to the shadows and the feeling of just wanting it to end and then feeling guilty.  I think these are feelings that anyone would inevitably have under the circumstances you've described, so please just accept them as natural and don't be hard on yourself for them!  

Because my mother is older than yours, my sister (who lives out-of-state and deigns to speak to our mother on the phone for 5 minutes once a week) has for the past four years aggressively tried to place her in a nursing home.  About four years ago, mother agreed to stay in a nursing home temporarily while she was getting some physical therapy and she called me every day of that 6-week period, begging me to get her out of there.  

Now, as my mother's condition continues to decline and her needs increase, the question has come up with more frequency, both in my mind and expressed by my husband, and the memory of those calls is one of the barriers.  We have a fine nursing home in our town, but I know that I could never have my mother begging me to get her out of there and ignore her pleas; it would be torturous for me.  As a result, I applaud the fact that you're talking openly with your mother about it and referring to ""we"" when it comes to the journey ahead of you.  I really think that, if it's at all possible, getting her on board and facing the decision as a family is key.  And since you have small children, I think discussing this with your mother in the broader context of ""family"" may be helpful to you; they are also her grandchildren and it seems likely that she would want the best for them and be willing to make reasonable sacrifces to ensure their wellbeing.  

I sometimes worry that the natural feelings of frustration, etc., that you outlined may color the decision of when to transition my mother.  I value myself as a person, love my husband and other family members as well as my mother, and realize that there are no guarantees with respect to my own lifespan or theirs.  In order to find the appropriate balance between mother's needs and the needs of the others that I love, I try to objectively ask myself whether, as her situation currently stands and given the limitations of what I can provide to her in the way of care, my mother is ""better off"" in her current situation or in a nursing home.  Our family's value system is such that we don't necessarily value quantity of life over its quality so her happiness -- as well as mine and my husband's -- are factors that weigh heavily into the determination of where she would be ""better off.""  By measuring it this way I think that when the answer is that she would be ""better off"" in a nursing home, we will be confident that we are making the right choice.

As you proceed on your journey to find an acceptable ""home"" for your mother, you may want to check out the automated Philips Medication Dispenser at http://www.managemypills.com to help keep track of the tons of medication you mentioned.  This has been a real Godsend for us -- and I have no relationship whatsoever to the company! -- and found it super easy to install so, even if you only use it for a couple of months, it may help you find a little extra time in your already incredibly busy day.  You can load 10 days' worth of medication into it and it will automatically dispense medication up to 6 times through the day on a schedule that you set up.  My mother, for example, takes 1 pill at 7:00 am, 2 pills at 8:00 am, yet another pill at 9:00 am, pills at 1:00 pm, at 5:00 pm and at 9:00 pm because that's the time schedule that works for her medication.  The machine could at least in theory be set up at your mother's bedside and all she would have to do is push a rather large button -- the machine calls out nicely whenever ""It's time to take your medicine"" -- for the cup with the appropriate medication to come out at the appropriate time.  The cost is about $90 a month and it's well worth it to us because it means that I only have to think about medication once every 10 days when I load the machine!

I'm so sorry you're faced with this challenging situation, but I know you're moving forward thoughtfully and carefully and that your decisions will therefore be wise.  ",2015-09-09 11:21:46,SiaMaya,3k949e

It can be very lonely and depressing.","My husband is still mostly self-reliant but since we don't have many friends left who are comfortable with his conditions, it's usually just the two of us.  He hasn't isolated himself from me, so I'm not sure how much advice I can give.

Do you know why he prefers to be alone?  Is he afraid of burdening your or feeling guilty about the illness effecting your life?  You don't give enough information about why he's closing you out.  He honestly could think he's doing it ""for your own good"" and talking it out would probably help (with or without a counselor).

,What can a power of attorney do?,"Okay, so long story short, my mom and aunt are very sure that my uncle is abusing his name as POA for my grandma and is just transferring all of her money into his account. She has not been deemed uncapable of making decisions yet and obviously isn't dead. 

Anyway, He has already tricked my grandma into signing her house over to him, and changing her will to allow him to get everything (when really my mom and aunt are the only ones who take care of her). He comes around when it involves him getting money. 

He also tells our family that we aren't allowed to receive money from our grandma (like if she wants to buy us dinner or something) and that if we borrow money, we have to give it directly to him instead of her (which we know he juts pockets it instead)..

This is the short version of it.. Basically, is there anything we can do about it? He is definitely abusing her and his power in order to get money. He already tried putting her into a nursing home so he can sell her house but my mom fought him on it. He has always been a greedy person and my grandma doesn't realize it... Is there anything we can do??","You could try [some of these hotlines](http://www.nccafv.org/state_elder_abuse_hotlines.htm) or finding Adult Protective Services to ask.

,Finally reached that point (venting - again!),"So today I spoke with someone from a nursing home. My wife has pretty advanced MS, and is mostly bedridden these days. We had been getting by with visiting aides when I'm not home, and they are able to transfer her to her wheelchair/shower using a hoyer lift. But recently that's become too dangerous - in her most recent fall, the leg of the hoyer was bent (not sure if that caused the hoyer to tip, or if her tipping caused the bent leg - whichever it was, the hoyer is now unusable). 

It's just too dangerous. I *have* to go to work, and I can't be there all the time. But one $10/hr bubble-gum popper sitting next to her reading their phone just isn't enough to care for her.

My hope was some sort of shared apartment we could both live in - I don't care how small it was, just so that we could live there together and she could get skilled care when I wasn't in. Today I learned that wasn't realistic (at least not with my income - if I win the lottery, all sorts of wonderful options open up for us). 

What is going to have to happen is I am going to have to pack up my wife - who isn't even 40 yet - off to a nursing home, where the average age is 85. And, barring any major change of fortune or miracles of medicine, she will never move out.

I don't know how I'm going to bring this up to her. She is going to be so incredibly hurt, scared, angry, and just feel so helpless. Pretty much how I feel.

After the last rounds of home modifications, I thought I was done. I thought no matter how bad she got, I would never let her go. She had been in a nursing home for two ""short"" stays (3-4 months each time). Although they helped her physically with rehab, they were horrific for her emotionally and spiritually. The people there were wonderful, but she was the youngest person ever to have been admitted there, most days when she wasn't at PT she was just lying in bed. But now our home had a hospital bed, a fully accessible shower/bathroom, we worked our way through Medicare/aide to get her set up with visiting aides, I hooked up her TV to be right over her bed on adjustable arm so it was close enough for her to actually see it (you know, the most important home modification!) - I thought that would be enough.

But now... Now it's not safe for her at home. I can't provide all the care she needs, even with an aide there when I'm not home.

Goddammit. Fuck MS.","I can't even fathom how hard this would be. From a strangers perspective - kudos for staying. My mom has advanced MS and is in the process of transitioning into a facility as well. I hear you on the lottery part for sure. 

My Step dad left her about a year and a half ago. The way it went down was absolutely the worst- but in a way i wonder if it was a blessing in disguise because I don't know how they would have ever figured out this transition. 

If it's not safe it's not safe. My mom has lived alone since he left and it stresses me to no end. She can no longer transfer herself and relies on her homecare aides who come 2-3 times a day. She's had falls. She's gotten sick in the night and had her homecare nurses find her in the morning.

Just today I got a call from her nurse that they sent her to the hospital in an ambulance. She's been admitted for pneumonia this evening. My husband and I are going to be starting our family soon because I honestly don't know how many years she has left.

So hell yes- FUCK MS.

Here if you need to vent. Good luck in your travels in this life. 
That's rough kwip.  I really hope it works out in both your and your wife's favor.  Are there no options for a place with more people in her situation?  Is there a facility near you so you can visit with her often, or, any options for having her do home visitations on a regular basis?

We've taken the caregiving here up a notch, doing home hemo-dialysis for the last 2 months.  It's been an adjustment.  They built an assisted care facility at the entrance to my neighborhood this year, I always ride by it and wonder if we'll ever have to use it (got a long way to go before we reach that point at least).

,So frustrated. And clumsy. And STUPID! And WEAK!,"My wife is bedridden with MS. I was picking her up to transfer her to her wheelchair to take her back to the bathroom and I forgot to lock the goddamned wheelchair wheels and it shot out of the way and I dropped her to the floor. She's about 240, so transferring her is tough - picking her up off the floor by myself is REALLY tough. I can usually get her up out of bed and pivot her to the wheelchair with very little trouble - IF I REMEMBER TO LOCK THE GODDAMNED THING. But a straight-up deadlift from the floor is tough - I'm trying hard to get stronger, but that's still a hell of a lift to get her butt from the floor all the way up to her chair.

So I got out the [hoyer lift](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Patient_lift) , got her up in that and started to head back to the bathroom. And the whole goddamned thing tipped over (as they're prone to do if you're an idiot), dumping her on the floor AGAIN.

She wasn't hurt, but it was scary, and so incredibly frustrating. And recently my friends/family have been trying to talk to me about the possibility of needing to put her in a home of some sort, which I refuse. And then THIS happens, making me feel like I'm doing more harm than good... Goddammit.

So sick of this fucking disease.","""Put her in a home,"" is usually not the admonishment that it sounds like. It feels like one, as though you are bad at this, but the meaning is intended as ""this is a lot to do, I couldn't/wouldn't do it myself, and I feel like a nursing home is the best way to handle the situation.""

Accidents happen, and that's part of the ""couldn't/wouldn't"" bit above. Most people can't handle the idea of dropping someone, injuring someone, mixing up medications, etc. And it happens just as much in nursing homes as it can your own home. 

And you have to approach it in the same way as a nursing home does, question it. What happened? Why did it happen? Is there a way to prevent it from happening again? Is there something we should do differently? Is there a better way to do this? 

Meanwhile, you're not the first person on the planet that has forgotten to set the brakes on a wheel chair. And you will DEFINITELY not be the last person that forgets to. But what can you do differently to make sure that you do set the brakes? Was this a moment that will stick with you enough to remember? Or do you need a sign beside the bed? How about painting the brake handles and arms lime green? Or nailing a 2x4 to the floor so the chair can't roll backwards?  Or... You think about it and see what you need to change. 

Yes, nursing homes are a option. Maybe this is the moment where you realize you can't do this any more (the final straw), and that you've been ignoring everything else that is wrong with the situation. But you have to open up to seeing what is happening, not just feeling bad about it.

MS had done enough to you and your wife, don't give it a fist to help beat you up.  
I can only offer sympathy for your situation and frustration. You obviously want to be doing so much, and to do it well. Try try try to forgive yourself, and know you are doing the best you can in a difficult time. I hope you find the help and answers you need. 
Sounds like a rough day! Any chance you get get help from homecare nurses or a visit from an occupational therapist? They helped my mom figure out the best ways to move around her home when she was still able. I've used the transfer belt with her a few times to get her on and off the toilet and it helped A LOT! 

sadly she will be moving to long term care soon. Or maybe it's not ""sadly"" but just the next step to give her the best quality of life.

Sending you good vibes. Eff u MS. 
That's a rough one, hugs.

Remember your family is concerned for you just as much as your wife, so they aren't saying you can't handle it, so much as they want whats best for both of you (in their eyes).  Don't look at is as anything judgmental about your ability to care for her.
do you have a gait belt? I would cinch her waist and sit her up and have a metal milk crate or short sturdy stool around. Then I would stand behind her bend my knees and yank her with the belt onto the stool. Since she is now off the floor I would do the same trick but from the front this time and get her into chair. Had an ms client that used an easypivot for lifting. Awkward but it does work. good luck",2015-05-04 15:14:09,kwip,34uth2
,Power of Attorney Question,"We need to file the power of attorney for our grandmother and I'm at a bit of a loss. While I understand that most things will remain the same, I gave a call to our insurance agency to see what this was going to mean for that (she has a home and vehicle in her name, insurance on both) and they acted like this situation had never happened before. Am I being more proactive than I needed to be, or am I just going about this bass ackward?  True, we could transfer/sell the vehicle and get it out of her name, but I didn't necessarily see the point in doing so. Additionally, has anyone gone through this with homeowner's insurance, what should we expect? Is this kind of like saying ""hi, I'm getting ready to create a hurricane on my property, can I get insurance?"" ","TL;DR Heard back from the insurance company and they just want a copy of the POA for the file so that if we need to make changes, the co-POA and I have the ability to do so.

On the home, since she is living in the home and is still the owner, there was no need for any change barring her death, moving out, or a change in ownership.

On the auto, since we are insured through the same company (separate policies on two different vehicles) they are fine with me driving her vehicle with the same kind of exception (loss of her licence, death, or change in residency for either of us).

So all in all, it was what I hoped it would be and didn't become a paper tiger. So far I've been a lot more impressed by the POA concept than I had been originally, after our attorney explained that contrary to what I thought, we (co-POA Fiduciaries, A and B, not A or B) do have to work in concert and have equal responsibility for our decisions, but we don't necessarily have to become joined at the hip. We can create or do things separately as long as that is born out of a joint decision. I was afraid we would need to both co-sign everything, and with a 1hr drive each way for the co-POA, that was starting to sound like a nightmare. 

Instead, we can decide how we want to handle things like day to day finances and create accounts with independent (OR) access, and fund them with a join decision to move money, with the understanding that we are essentially both responsible for how that money is subsequently used. This is a lot less of a burden than we thought we were going to be under, and means that we are going to be able to effectively move forward with a minor change to what was already happening. Currently, with the ability for my grandmother to sign, we have been using a single checking account where her various forms of income go in, and we maintain a simple household budget with a small excess that has compounded into a more than decent buffer. We have used this buffer as a savings account of sorts for either emergencies or yearly expenses (insurance, taxes, etc.). I have managed the register and written the checks for and my grandmother to sign, and all of her other accounts have remained untouched. 

Knowing that we can effectively make a joint decision to handle this single account independently means I can continue doing that, but sign the checks myself, or my co-POA to sign them, independent of the other. Meanwhile my grandmother's remaining accounts can be controlled with a joint ""AND"" (Co-POA AND I) decision. 

Devil in the details, but I think my biggest excitement is finally getting a debit card for that account and not having to deal with cash for big ticket expenses (appliances or car repairs) or worrying every time we take a trip that if the car breaks down we may not be able to get a hotel room, get the car fixed, or what happens if [insert horror scenario here] with a nothing more than a checkbook or the cash I have on hand (which maxes at the housekeeping that I pull once a week, or that and any extra that I pull for known trips, which I tend to limit to eating out and gas in the car).

Sorry, that was part answer the question of ""so what happened?"" and mostly ranting about the finer points of being a caregiver and the aggravation of trying to wisely spend someone else's money when taking care of them has left you without money or independent means of your own.
Sorry, I don't know about how POAs and insurance work together, but I'd love to hear how it turns out when you do find an answer.

Good luck with everything.
I have a PoA for my wife - I'm surprised you're insurance company hasn't dealt with this. I wouldn't worry about it - you're doing the correct thing.",2015-04-24 16:52:44,,33r4y6
,Funding in-home overnight care//caregiver for terminally ill parent,"Tried this over in /r/legaladvice and was suggested to try over here:

My mother is terminally ill and is prone to wandering at night. I have taken a semi-permanent leave of work to help care for her and organize appointments, medications, etc. When I arrived here I found that my mothers care, even with hospice, is deficient. The main priority is to keep my mother comfortable and within the home. What makes us so attached to her staying at home is that she is very mobil for a hospice patient, has a tendency for depression/paranoia, and is non-compliant with medical staff. Her animals are also something that keep her happy. She is indigent except for a well-guarded trust fund that was set up to protect the state services she receives. The trust will not pay for overnight care/caregiving and I am at my wits end on how to get her care without compromising her benefits. She currently receives IHSS, SSDI and Hospice care. My grandparents are willing to privately pay a caregiver to stay overnight which would not be out of her pocket. I have attempted to get in contact with her caseworker at IHSS, a city employee that specializes in these legal matters, her doctors, and hospice, but the system seems so large that they don't call me back promptly or don't contact each other. While I understand these things take time, I am currently clocking in 4-6 hours of sleep which is unacceptable for me. What I am seeking is any information that could explain the legal ramifications of an outside relative paying for overnight care or a caregiver. Would this compromise benefits?

","I'm sorry this got stuck in the moderation queue!

It depends on the size of your grandmother and your own size/strength. If she's small/light and you're strong enough, you can use a [gait belt](http://www.amazon.com/Prestige-Medical-621-wht-Cotton-Buckle/dp/B000V4SV5G). Here's a video on using it:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJHbUeIRC-g

Now this video demonstrates it's use on someone that can actually move. My wife is bedridden, and I actually pick her up completely using a gait belt, bearing all of her weight. She's not a small person, but I'm a SUPER STRONG GUY! Well, no - I'm a solid guy, but the gait belt makes it pretty simple to pick her up. I'm not bearing her entire weight, and I'm not picking her completely up.

If your grandmother is immobile/unable to assist at all, or if you don't feel comfortable supporting her weight, you can look into a [hoyer lift](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Patient_lift). There are a wide variety of them, several with open ""bottoms"" that would allow you to lift her right on to the toilet and back to her chair without having to take the harness off.

I hope this helps!

,Frustrations with travel,"Next week we're going on a cruise to the Bahamas. Which is awesome, except that Royal Caribbean couldn't give two shits about wheelchair travelers. Out of all their (ridiculously overpriced) excursions, there are only THREE that are accessible - one we had to ""invent,"" which basically involves paying $200 to get an accessible vehicle to take us 2.5 miles from the docks to a public beach (and back in four hours). But they won't do anything to help us get a beach wheelchair (I took to /r/bahamas for help!). Sooooo frustrating - I don't understand how a cruise line that supposedly ""caters"" to elderly/disabled travelers doesn't give a shit about travelers in wheelchairs? They make a bunch of noise about it on their website, but when it comes to people that can't take a few steps, it's like, welp, tough shit! Enjoy sitting on the boat while everyone else pisses off on tender boats to the private island for beach cookouts and frozen drinks!

,"(I just want to say, it sucks that I'm finally posting here) My brother is proclaiming ""she shouldn't be driving anymore!"", but he isn't the one who will be driving my mom around for the rest of her life. How do you know when to take the keys away?","(not to impugn all you good people, just that I'm one of you now. Even though I've been taking care of my mother for years, I guess I never thought I'd be the care giver that needs help for herself. If that makes sense?).

But yeah, now I see why people put this off for as long as possible.

(I only have the car I'm driving because they took it away from my FIL, when it became obvious he was driving by braille. It came pre-dented) (but with really low miles. 66k miles on a 16yo subaru, I'm not complaining).

I'm not sure what I'm 'comfortable' with, where that limit is. I'll drive her if she has to go on the highway (necessary for shoprite and home depot), and I never let her drive at night (not that she'd even want to).

But Stew's, Walgreen's, CVS, stuff that's pretty much 'around the corner' (not more than a mile or so), I'm not seeing a huge issue. She's a pretty careful driver.

It's the 'middle' stuff I have trouble with. Going to the library, post office, city dump (don't even ask me why she feels a need to go to the dump weekly.  I've lived years, decades, in places, and never once had an urge or ""need"" to visit the dump. She's just obsessive about 'cleaning up'.)

buuut... she's starting to get lost, on her way home from the PO or Goodwill. I guess this means, now is the time I have to be a bit stern and step up more?

(In the past few years, my guideline has been 'highway or after dark', yes of course I'll drive, otherwise no. But we live in such a convoluted town that it's nearly always more difficult to find her (anyone's) way on local roads, rather than the highway, *even to places she been going to for 50 years*.)

And tho I'm not sure whether my mother's own opinion should 'count' here (and how messed up is asking that?): sometimes she likes (insists on) the luxury of being driven around, sometimes she wants to feel she still has her independence. So that's absolutely no help :( 


fml, I hate this.","Arm chair quarterbacking aside, she sounds like she is in an early state of some form of cognitive ability loss, whether it is just the general decline from health and age, medications, or the beginning of an actual dementia only time and a doctor can tell. Important things to look for are when problems arise (time of day, medications taken, food and drink consumed, events) and to document what they are (aggitation, agression, forgotten words, confusion, disorientation,  blanking, and anything else that seems odd or different such as facial expressions, numbness, slushing, pupil dilation,  tremors, twitches, unusual mood swing, strange outbursts, and especially anything asymmetrical like one eye not the other), as it can help to point toward causes and narrow down to a root issue(s). 

As far as medications are concerned, those need to get on a fixed schedule, need to come from a single pharmacy, and need to be tracked, as well as any supplements or anything else she is taking or using. Even a simple multivitamin can bork the effects of some meds. As for scheduling them, it is a similar concept to vitamins and supplements,  as there are some foods that screw up meds, some that only work with food, and others that require an empty stomach. Take the meds wrong way, not at all, infrequently,  or supplement them, and you can mimic senility in a heartbeat. 

Try to find a single doctor with geriatric experience.  As we age our medical conditions compound, and the care needs coordination to avoid problems. Multiple hands in the pot spoils the soup, and can also make grandpa madder than a hatter. Again, much like supplements scheduling, health condiions, such as liver and kidney issues can change the effects of medications, or even create a toxicity in the body that is mentally altering, and may come and go. 

Driving is usually the watershed moment, and it is bad for everyone. But keep it focused on safey and concern for the damage and suffering that can go with an accident, and on the ability issues that exist. Slower isn't necessarily safer, if slower is because she cannot think, plan, or react faster than 20mph. Driving isn't about one car, it is like one of those horrible word problems where two trains leave a station, 20mph is only half of it. You still have t be able to react to the vehicle traveling at 45mph appropriately. 

And, in case it is the first cloud of something more, now is when you need to ask the ""death questions."" Will, living will, power of attorney, funeral arrangements, assets, accounts, keys, safety deposit boxes, insurance cards/policies (health and life), financial status, important papers, keepsakes, and any important questions. Frankly, most people don't get the opportunity and end up juggling (or trying to) when it all comes crashing don around them, at the point when a disorded mind or a dead body has no answers. Harsh, but true. Ask.
I haven't had to face that yet, but I have read that in a situation like yours, getting her doctor involved can help. If he agrees that it is time for her to stop driving, she might take the news better if it comes from him. It makes it a more objective decision.

Also, have you looked into the para-transit bus system in your area? Sometimes it can be very convenient and low cost for seniors.

Good luck!",2014-12-30 15:31:03,ChiliFlake,2quj09
,Ever been on a cruise as a caregiver?,"The wife (mostly bedridden, stuck in a wheelchair due to advanced multiple sclerosis) and I are headed on a cruise in March 2015. I'm pretty stressed - apart from the thought of having to dress up for meals (I offered to wear my ""nice"" shorts, but apparently that's not posh enough for this lot), NONE of the ports we're hitting have handicapped-accessible excursions. And while I DREAM of 7 days doing nothing but sitting, eating and reading my Kindle on an ocean-going ship (with an unlimited drink package!), no way is that good enough for the Mrs. - she's going to go insane with boredom and frustration. 

I'm really worried about this - and no, it wasn't my idea, the cruise was a 'gift.' Which I realize makes me sound like an ungrateful twat, and I certainly am - but the person giving the gift has NO idea what's involved being a caregiver. I don't get to relax - every 4 hours I need to cath my wife, every morning she gets an enema and the resulting cleaning (yaay!), then there's giving her a shower, rubbing her feet to help with the phantom pain issues, feeding her, etc, etc. Needless to say, I can't even get my drunk on, because I'm the responsible adult and have to be a caregiver 24/7.

Soooo...anyone have any experience to share with this ingrate?","It seems like someone had their heart in the right place but didn't think this gift through in terms of practicality.  How will the person react if you tell them the gift, while appreciated, is impossible to take?

Was the gift aimed at you, or, both of you as a couple?  Does your wife want to go?  

Couple of thoughts:

1. See if it's exchangeable with another cruise that might have better wheelchair access.  It looks like there are cruises specifically geared towards the disabled.

2. I'd be looking at the cabin sizes asap including the bath facilities, make sure you can actually do the tasks that need done in the probably very tiny space.

3. If the cruise is a bad fit, is a refund possible?  Put the money towards something that will give you (both) more enjoyment.  If not a refund, maybe you can parlay it into a different sort of trip that has a hotel room...or try to sell it outright via CL or something.


A quick google search does reveal that there are cruises geared towards caregivers and disabled partners.  If I were you I'd start by calling the travel agency or cruise line and explaining your situation and see how they respond.  They may have options you haven't considered, or, at least let you know how impractical it would be.


We haven't really traveled since my husband went on dialysis, but if the Home hemo-dialysis pans out we're going to try.  So, just brainstorming here without much experience.
You can certainly do it. Cruises suck anyway. Hygiene is the hardest part. You are able to do that, it is a cake walk.

,Early colostomy care,"Is there anyone who can give advice on helping a colostomy patient? My father had the procedure 3 days ago. He is still hospitalized and probably will be for the next few days. Afterwards we are excited to take him home. We are deciding whether or not a hospital bed in home will be necessary. I would also appreciate advice for a good reintroduction diet. My father is in his 50s, a little overweight, diabetes thrown out of wack due to steroid treatments. So far through recovery he has been a badass. Up and walking farther than expected, and bowels ""woke up"" this evening. Any advice you've got would be appreciated! Thank you.","A hospital bed is the most reliable bed you could have when it comes to cleaning his stoma and emptying his bag...changing the dressing and the bag entirely can be a mess and smell horrid!!!  

He should eat healthy as much as possible and avoid foods that cause flatulence. He won't enjoy the stomach pains I can assure you. 

I can't really recommend anything further than that. My only colostomy patient is on liquid foods through a g tube so his diet is pretty much vitamins and nutrients in a bag. 
Thank you. It looks like we'll be taking him home tomorrow. We're getting the house set up now and your comments have helped a great deal. 
I don't know about colostomy care, but a hospital bed is a HUGE help when you're dealing with any sort of patient care that involves you having to be bent over someone for any amount of time (insert joke here!). Being able to raise them up to your level makes it sooooo much easier on your back. The other benefits that are for the patient (raising the feet/head for more comfort) may not be as big a criteria as your father sounds pretty active, but raising the bed up for you/other caregivers to be able to better help him without killing your own back is a big plus.

Just like any other 'maintenance' care, I'd also suggest setting up everything you need near his bed to make it an easy rhythm of care to get into - gloves, wipes, bags, etc. It makes it a lot easier if you have everything right at hand and can go right down the ""stations"" using what you need at each step. I'm terribly absent-minded, so I HAVE to set each of the things out when I take care of my wife's mitrofanoff channel/bladder. It makes it a lot easier if I'm just going right down the line for each step and cuts down the chance of me forgetting something.

I work 16 hour shifts back to back on Saturday and Sunday so I'm Also a bit tired towards the evening and Sunday so I don't have the energy to take her on walks for hours and such.","Kwip had great suggestions.  


I'd also look at the local libraries and bookshops, they should have free events, author signings, etc.  If you are near a larger university you can also look for other activities that are free to the community, like maker space activities (a library might have this too).


I'd look into low cost crafts/arts.  Paper and a few paints/markers shouldn't be too expensive and would give an avenue for self expression. Stuff like friendship braclets only require a few dollars (or less!) worth of DMC floss.  There are 3-D paper crafts too.  I'd be happy to share a list of low cost crafts if you want more information.


If she doesn't enjoy being around kids, have you tried visiting retirement centers or other adult homes with people who'd enjoy a visit and chat?  Helping someone else may improve her self esteem.

Does she have a computer/internet access/tablet?  If so I can suggest some interactive stuff based on this access.
A lot of my suggestions depend on what's in your area, but here goes:
Community Theater?  That can be some awesome entertainment and cheap or free, depending on what's available. Our town has several free performances in the local parks.

Likewise, any community concerts? Another freebie that makes for a nice night at the park.

Do you ever read TO her? Going to the park with a picnic and reading from Harry Potter to her could be nice (if both of you are into that?).

People watching at the mall! 

Is there a community rec center in your area? A lot of them will offer fun free/cheap activities - tours, game nights, classes, etc - that are good to do and also help interact with more people.

,"Wife recovering from new procedures, info for people with bowel/bladder issues (long post, and link to gross pic!)","My wife is recovering from a couple of procedures I thought I'd write about to let anyone know who is looking for relief from bladder/bowel accidents:

The [Mitrofanoff appendicovesicostomy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitrofanoff_appendicovesicostomy), also known as the Mitrofanoff procedure, created an access ""port"" in her belly button that goes straight to her bladder. Ideally how this will work is that we can cath her straight through there into her bladder and empty it every 4 hours or so - as time goes on, we'll be able to wait longer, so she - and I - will be able to get a full night's sleep. As it stands now, I will have to get up every 4 hours to cath her. Tonight will be the first night for that - she had the surgery about 4 weeks ago, but there's been a suprapubic catheter installed that we've been hooking up a drain bag to overnight for now. The big concern has been the build-up of mucus, because her bladder was enlarged using tissue from her bowel, which produces mucus. So we've had to flush/drain the mucus out on a regular basis. While the doctor built up her bladder, he also added a ""sling"" to her urethra at the bladder to help her control her bladder better and prevent accidents.

Our experience with the Mitrofanoff has been a mixed bag. Granted, it's only been four weeks and we've been told it's going to take a lot longer for it to heal/function properly, but so far it hasn't impressed us. She still has accidents on occasions, especially when I'm flushing out her bladder with either the suprapubic cath or the belly-button cath. Almost every time we flush, in fact. The doctor has said as she heals this will happen less. I guess time will tell, but 4 weeks out, it hasn't impressed us.

The positive is, so far (knock on wood!) there's no sign of a UTI/bladder infection. And during the day, it's very weird to transfer her without having to worry about her catheter line (we still have to worry about the access ports that are ""tapped"" with temporary lines right now, but still way easier than the old catheter/bag combo).

The second part of the surgery was the [Malone antegrade continence enema](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malone_antegrade_continence_enema), which built a ""port"" into her bowels right at the spot where the appendix used to be (both of these procedures use the appendix to build the channels - luckily my wife had a long enough appendix to use for both of these channels, but they can also use parts of the bowel to build them). The idea with this is that you use the port to perform an enema once every other day (roughly). In the beginning, this didn't work very well. While the enema would always result in her moving her bowels, she would OFTEN have ""leaks"" with little or no warning. However, four weeks in, she no longer has surprise accidents - she still has urgent/unprepared bowel movements, but they usually come with enough warning to get her on the bedpan in time. There have been a few times when she's tried to ""squeeze"" her bladder during cathing the Mitrofanoff and wound up squeezing out some liquid/runny feces.

If her healing continues and her control/warning also continues to improve, this has HUGE promises for us - we've always had to worry about going out anywhere because we never know when we'll need immediate, URGENT access to a family-friendly restroom where I can transfer her to a toilet and/or clean up an accident.

While the doctor did a great job of preparing us for the physical changes/demands these procedures would require (almost 13 hours in surgery, long, painful recovery), we were COMPLETELY unprepared for the emotional demands that would come. My wife is bedridden with multiple sclerosis, and while we expected some exasperation from the trauma of surgery, there was a HUGE emotional/mental dip that accompanied it. It has been exhausting, physically and emotionally, for my wife and I (and family/friends) as we try and deal with this, and we're just now getting into the part where we have to get up every 4 hours to cath her bladder. We know about the interrupted sleep, but on top of the stress we're experiencing from everything else, it has us all pretty scared. We'll find out this afternoon if the other tubes come out (the ACE cath and the suprapubic bladder caths are stitched in place right now). We're really looking forward to that, but we're also worried about the demands of making sure she's cathed on time.

*IF* everything goes well, this is going to be great and absolutely worth it. But it's been such a major ass-kicker, if it does not live up to it's promise it's going to be a HUGE disappointment. But the doctor has told us that *everyone* that has had the procedure done has been completely happy with it, so in a year from now, I might be posting that we were worried over nothing. Let's hope!

,Dealing with Stress,"Hi all. I was wondering how you deal stress when taking care of someone. I have a wife who suffers from chronic pain and gastrointestinal problems. She has seen a million doctors over the years and we still don't have a diagnosis. Some days the pain is so bad that she can barely get out of bed. The hardest times though are when it comes to making decisions about how to pursue further treatment. Because we don't have a diagnosis and there are so many theories about what could be ailing her, there isn't always a clear next step. Sometimes we disagree about what the next step should be and this can be quite stressful. She can have very strong opinions about what doctors she should see next and when, and sometimes I feel like she is making the wrong decision. I try to remind myself that in the end it is her decision how to best to pursue treatment, but I do get angry and frustrated. I sometimes don't want to tell her about my feelings because she is in so much pain and just so overwhelmed that she can't handle anything else. I don't keep my feelings from her usually, but sometimes I feel guilty that I'm frustrated with her because she is the one in pain and suffering so much. How do you all deal with these sorts of situations? Thanks in advance!","I have a lot of empathy for you both and what you are going through. The stress of having no diagnosis must be infuriating. How long has she been seeking treatment? It must feel like you are in permanent crisis mode. 

Do you both research her ailments and discuss your theories about what's wrong? I do a lot of research and go with him to all his appointments, take notes on what the doctors say and do more research. Do you request copies of lab results and also keep a log of her daily symptoms and vitals?

It's her choice on which steps she tries next so you have to respect her decisions, it'll help if she is explaining why she's choosing one over another.  What's her goal at the moment?   Diagnosis or alleviating the symptoms? Do you both share the same goal? Have you discussed what's more important to her, quality of life or quantity? If you are focused on diagnosis and she is focused on getting the pain managed, you're going to have differing approaches. The more you discuss the more you'll feel like it's a partnership.  

One hard part was learning to advocate for ourselves in a system where doctors want the easy answers. You need to know when to find a new doctor. What's her primary care doctor like? Are they engaged and helpful?


On stress:  
This is very much an ongoing process....

I don't think any one answer works for every person but in my case the best way to manage the stress is through action, even if I don't make a lot of real progress, the feeling that there is forward momentum helps.

I read a modern introduction to stoicism which helped me refocus my thoughts. Basically what I walked away with was I can only control my own thoughts and reactions to events. It made me start paying attention to how I reacted to issues and begin to consciously choose how I responded. I am also more mindful of my mood and quicker to reject negative emotions and thoughts.  

Participating here is one of the steps I'm taking towards a more positive mindset.  

It's been a long path to get to where I am now.  I am just beginning to feel like negative emotions aren't driving my life, so not sure how much this will help.  
The stress is awful for caregivers. I have a chronic stomachache, I cry all the time and I jump at the slightest sound. My SO does NOTHING to take care of himself, insisting he can't handle it. But he insists on lots of very expensive treatments, despite I am the only provider of benefits. It's all very frustrating and I am exhausted.

It formed a large lesion on the motor control section of her brain, and she never really recovered. She's been getting progressively worse, and for the past couple of years has been mostly bedridden. She has bladder/bowel control issues, vision loss, mental issues (change of personality, memory loss, confusion, etc), and a great deal of difficulty with any fine motor control. As you can imagine, she suffers greatly from depression and every day is a real struggle for her. She has real problems with control - constantly reminding me/her aides to do things like turn on/off the outside lights, insisting on a specific way the towels get folded in the bathroom closet, etc. Things that she feels she can ""control,"" because so much of her life is out of her control. Needless to say, that leads to a lot of strife for us, as I really hate being nagged!

To say it's been a challenge is an understatement. But we love each other dearly and have been working on it. Hopefully I'll find some kindred souls to commiserate with here! Welcome!","Hi. I was looking for a subreddit for caregivers, and here you are. Well I am fairly new to this. My boyfriend of 7 years got into a car accident in October last year. He was discharged home bc of misread ct scans. Collapsed the next day. Mercy flighted (helicopter) back to hospital. Had spinal decompression and fusion. He is now a C7 quadriplegic.  We are obviously suing the hospital.He was in Icu till right before Christmas. He came home on April 13th. We had nurses and aides for the first couple of months. Now we doing everything ourselves. I'm working about 35 hours a week now. He still has a bed sore from the hospital we are working on. The medical expenses are unbelievable. since he gets a decent amount of $$ from disability we have to pay a bunch for Medicaid as a secondary ins. We are engaged now. No date set. So now there is 2. Would be nice to get some discussion going on here. I know we are not the only redditor caregivers. ",2012-07-31 17:18:19,kwip,xgy5h

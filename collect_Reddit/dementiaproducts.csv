,App to track dementia care well,"I’m very new to Reddit and came online after hearing about it from a friend. I’m researching care apps that you can use to track activities for your loved ones with dementia—to track medication, food, movement, etc while providing care for them. Any suggestions would be helpful. Thank you!",,2019-09-27 16:35:12,da65g4
,Children's workbooks to keep minds engaged.,"My grandmother is a sundowner.
My grandfather currently is  her main caregiver  with a nurse throughout the  week.

Lately when I go down to visit (I stay the weekend  as I live a few hours away) I've been having her work on basic skills.

Coloring,  spelling,  basic math, and kindergarten or first grade workbooks you can get at walmart.

Sometimes it  can agitate  her but I find that keeping her  mind engaged  for about and hr a day has been helping her sleep through out the night.

Anyone  else  have any experience or stories with mental stimulation?",,2019-09-02 01:50:19,cyl11h

,"Android Tablet App controlled by your iPhone that displays time, date, weather, photos, reminders and personal notes","I designed this Mango Display App that runs on any Android tablet to also help people with dementia and Alzheimers after seeing a family member suffer through it.

It is completely controlled via an iPhone App, so you can set it up for them and control it remotely as needed. 

Displays the Date and Time in a clear manner, displays Apple/Google photos, Personal notes and reminders, weather and much more. A beautiful dashboard of reminders for a beautiful life.

For more details check out the link below:

Compared to products like dedicated clocks sold for this purpose, this gives you a more personalized setup. It will also automatically reset the time during Daylight Savings time, and since the tablets have batteries it still functions during power outages. 

If you do try it out with your loved ones, please let me know what you think.

,Survey on carers dealing with or worried about dementia,"Hello,

We're trying to do a large scale survey on informal carers of people with early stage dementia. We're also interested in families who don't yet have a member with dementia but are concerned about it.

The survey takes less than 5' and would really help us better understand the users and how we can help them. Any share on social media is also very helpful.

Last but not least if you subscribe for the newsletter  you will get access to early bird launch in 2019.

The survey is at: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Z5B795G

Many thanks,
Alex",,2018-11-14 18:29:48,9x5gnb

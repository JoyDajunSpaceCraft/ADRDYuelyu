,Welcome :) And a few resources,"Hi, everyone. Thank you for joining me here :) (And sorry for not offering an introduction sooner, I started this sub late last night, and then thought ‚Äúhey, let‚Äôs get people in here to talk‚Äù.)

I‚Äôm not an expert or healthcare professional, just to be clear -  I‚Äôm a caregiver like many of you probably are. I just thought we could do with an Ontario-specific space to discuss the practicalities around getting help. (I sort of thought it‚Äôd be mostly caregivers who would be interested, but of course anyone who is themselves living with dementia is welcome üôè )

If anyone would like to help moderate, please message me :)  I can‚Äôt imagine we‚Äôll need much modding, really, so it‚Äôd be easy, I‚Äôm thinking.

I‚Äôm glad people have been talking already, that‚Äôs great -  we‚Äôre going to help each other here :)

I‚Äôll just start a list of some resources that I can think of for now. Please add anything you think will help, if you feel like it! I‚Äôll update the OP.

**Immediate help**

LHINs: http://healthcareathome.ca
I think LHINs are in the midst of being restructured, but for now they can help. If you‚Äôre not already in touch with a LHIN coordinator through a hospital, you can call them directly without a GP‚Äôs referral. 

[The Ontario Caregiver Organization](https://ontariocaregiver.ca). There‚Äôs a [helpline](https://ontariocaregiver.ca/find-support/helpline/) - available 24/7 by phone, M-F by live chat. The [resources](https://ontariocaregiver.ca/resources-education/caring-for-a-senior/) page is pretty good (I think).

**Homes; care at home**

Government of Ontario pages on [supportive housing](https://www.ontario.ca/page/long-term-care-options). Find a long-term care home [here](https://www.ontario.ca/page/about-long-term-care), get information on [home care] (https://www.ontario.ca/page/homecare-seniors), retirement homes [here](https://www.ontario.ca/page/find-retirement-home). 

[Results of LTC home inspections](http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/public/programs/ltc/home-finder.aspx) - as you may know from the news (or unfortunately, from personal experience), these may not fully represent potential issues. 

[Government of Ontario list of LTC homes with COVID outbreaks](https://www.ontario.ca/page/how-ontario-is-responding-covid-19#section-1) 

[Family Councils Ontario](https://fco.ngo/front) - for family members of people living in LTCs.

The [Patient Ombudsman](https://www.ombudsmandespatients.ca/Complaints/Before-you-make-a-complaint/Who-we-oversee) oversees long-term care homes, hospitals, and LHINS (and any care received in the community). If you need to make a complaint, you can do it [here](https://www.ombudsmandespatients.ca/).

For LTC homes, you can also make a complaint with the Government of Ontario, [here](https://www.ontario.ca/page/long-term-care-home-complaint-process).

**Financial help**

[Benefits for caregivers](https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/caring-someone-ill/benefits-tax-credits-caregivers.html) from the government of Canada. 
Government of Ontario page on obtaining [family or medical leave and the compassionate care benefit](https://www.ontario.ca/page/seniors-family-and-other-caregivers); [Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/caregiving.html) on EI. (Good [overview](https://elizz.com/planning/government-assistance-and-funding-for-caregivers-in-canada/) on these kinds of resources at Elizz.)

**Diagnosis-specific organizations** 

[Alzheimer‚Äôs Society of Ontario](https://alzheimer.ca/en/on). City chapters often work with LHINs; some offer respite care, day programs (outside of the pandemic, anyway), and additional support. (They are the go-to for most kinds of dementia.)

[The Association for Frontotemporal Dementia](https://www.theaftd.org/). American org. There is a private Facebook group. Apparently there‚Äôs a Toronto chapter, but I haven‚Äôt been able to make contact yet. Info on getting support [here](https://www.theaftd.org/living-with-ftd/aftd-support-groups/)

,Cross-Campus Capstone Classroom: Positive experiences in Ontario's long-term care,"Hi everyone!

I'm a member of a student team for this year's Cross-Campus Capstone Classroom (C4). Our project is about improving resident care and work conditions in Ontario's long-term care homes.

My team and I are collecting positive experiences family members of residents experience with long-term care in Ontario. If you are a family member who has gone through the process of admitting a loved one into long-term care in Ontario, and are interested in sharing positive experiences with long-term care with us, we want to hear from you! Go to this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/cADoEBsXVXGQUJ3DA) and tell us the good stuff! (There is a media release consent form included, and you must agree to that before sharing your positive experiences. Positive experiences will be posted with our project on a website along with resources.)

While working on this project, we came to understand that people trying to get their loved ones admitted to long-term care feel like they're the only ones going through this, and it's hard to find the information they need to know about long-term care after their loved ones are placed in a long-term care home. The largely negative stories in the news about long-term care don't help, though we understand why our long-term care system is perceived negatively. Our project is a toolkit website for families of residents with educational resources and sharing positive experiences, so that families who went through the process of getting their loved ones into long-term care will have a place to learn more about what they can expect to happen in long-term care homes , about the rights that residents have, and feel affirmed that they are not alone in this journey.

If you have questions about our capstone project, and/or the Google Form, you can reach me through direct messaging on Reddit, and through email at [tammyl80@my.yorku.ca](mailto:tammyl80@my.yorku.ca)!

Feel free to share this with others!",,2022-03-13 13:21:17,tdbn79

,Trying to find housing and/or care for my father? Suggestions please?,"Background: My father has early onset Parkinson‚Äôs disease. He had brain surgery two summers ago to get a DBS and it was disastrous. His tremor is less severe but it completely destroyed his cognition. He can‚Äôt think or remember anything and it‚Äôs just getting worse. I am 25, just finished my masters and am unemployed because of covid and my own issues. I can‚Äôt take care of him and he has no one else.

He has been living independently with his mother in a retirement village in Markham for a year and a bit, but she has advancing Alzheimer‚Äôs. They were coping for a while but at this point it is no longer safe for either of them. Her other adult children (in their 50s, married, educated, and established) refuse to acknowledge the severity of either of their diseases, and despite begging them they will not help their mother or brother.

He is on ODSP but has no savings and filed for bankruptcy about a year ago (he was able to work before the surgery, but it ruined his chance to ever work again). I live in Toronto and can‚Äôt drive so the only way he can be supported and visited is if he lives in the city. 

- Emergency housing? He would benefit from either full care or at least a nurse to help with food and cleaning a couple times a week. He doesn‚Äôt need to be monitored during the day but is less and less able to take care of himself
- Is there a different name for this? I have been researching a lot but there is a huge wait list for everything. There must be a service that is immediate? Do I need a doctor to access this or something?
- Where can I look for affordable housing without a huge wait list? He can manage that with a visiting nurse for a bit to wait for a spot in a long term care place. 

I am having a hard time figuring out what resources are available or how I can find a safe living situation for him. If anyone has any idea how I should proceed I would really appreciate any suggestions. Thank you so much!",,2021-08-19 00:49:40,p784wt

,Is it time to put her in a home? What are our options?,"Wondering if anyone out there might have any suggestions for us?

My mother is a very physically healthy and active 71 year old but is also very much in the grips of moderate dementia. She needs 24/7 supervision. She used to be easy to take care of but because of the closures of her day program, she has been acting out and making life very difficult for us for the past year. 

As the future of this pandemic is still up-in-the-air with no definite timeline, and no indication of when her day program or any other supports will open again ‚Äì we are now considering if it is time to put her in a home.

But our options seem so limited. I feel like we only have 2 basic options and neither suit us well: 

1) Continue to keep her home. Use the 20 hours-a-month caregiver respite + scrounge around for any private home care we can find and just try and hang on until the pandemic is over. Pro: Maybe it's just a matter of waiting until summer?? Con: We are so very tired of this and really are facing caregiver burnout.

2) Go in to crisis and get her into a home. Pro: We can finally live some sort of life again. Con: Correct me if I'm wrong, but going into crisis would mean that she goes into any nursing home they can find. We are on the waiting list for several good homes but my understanding is that she will not get into them for many years due to waitlists. So in order to get into a home at all, we will need to go into crisis.

Another problem is that she needs stimulation. This is the root of the problem. She needs specific dementia care. Which requires a lot of attention and some sort of social activity. I don't think these are things you get at a nursing home. In fact, my experience is that they basically just lock them in a room and give them the basic necessities of food, shower, etc. -- She is not ready for that. In fact, I'm certain it would make things worse.

How can we get her into a home that gives her dementia care? I remember the Alzheimer's Society mentioned a temporary respite place called Nora's House. This sounded amazing to us but it, too, has been closed since last year with no sign of re-opening.

Open to ideas or any information anyone has. Thank you.",,2021-04-27 16:00:25,mzx6ie

,COVID lockdowns and respite for caregivers. Any helpful advice?,"Hi there,

I'm not one to usually post things like this online but our situation is getting somewhat desperate and I don't really know how to get any more help in the short-term future. 

I'll try to keep this as short as I can.

My father and I are the sole caregivers for my mother who is in mid-stage dementia. Pre-COVID she would attend a day program 4 days a week. And she LOVED it. It really made her happy and subsequently, she was very easy for us to care for here at home. 

The day program has been closed due to COVID for almost a year now. It has never even tried to open again. All programs have been moved to online 30-40 minute sessions. We have tried them but it just doesn't work anywhere near as well for my mom. Given the right time, program and person, she can enjoy it for what it is. But 1) my father or I always need to sit with her during it and 2) it doesn't really help with her mood for the rest of the day.

This brings me to her deterioration. This once, previously happy woman, now sobs every day asking for her dead mother. She is anxious. She has had numerous temper tantrums. She demands to leave the house and go to her childhood home. She screams at us about things that don't make sense. She won't leave my father or I alone for one minute. 

It's not all terrible. There are better days than others but overall... to put it bluntly... after almost a full year of this, life is getting unbearable here.

To explain the avenues of assistance we are currently getting:

\- We regularly talk to her doctor's office. They have been helpful in prescribing medication to us. She now takes lots of Trazodone everyday. I'm pretty sure it is working and that, without it, she would be even worse.

\- We get a PSW that comes to our home. We have been getting some extra hours of late because of cancellations. But I find 1) They generally don't know how to engage my mother. They can't even take her our for walks because of liability. They constantly turn to us when mom is antsy. It's sort of a break but not really... 2) I'm more and more worried about COVID. We have already had to isolate once because we had a PSW who had it while she was here... and 3) we just don't enjoy having a stranger in our home. We're desperate so we'll do it but it's a small place and it doesn't really help us relax truly.

\- The virtual programs. Pretty much useless to us if I'm being honest. I only keep it so there's a chance she can keep recognizing some of the faces if, by some miracle, she can ever go back.

\- We are on waiting lists for several long term care homes. But, from what I understand, there's 100% no way we will move up the list for a long time. Before, we have wanted to keep her at home as long as possible so she can enjoy seeing her friends, being in the day program, taking advantage of short-term respite care when needed. But now, I think we are just at that point where if we get a call tomorrow, we will take it.

And that's it. We have no other family to turn to. We're exhausted, burnt out, and desperate for some relief from her. I'm worried for my father. He's not a young man and I fear what this is doing to his health. I have been lucky to be able to work from home but the assistance I can provide them is not enough. And I am getting depressed at the inability to have my own life (even if it is a COVID one in lockdown).

Anyways, I will stop rambling here. I just can't believe the position we're in and that there really is nothing out there that can help us right now. Is there anyone else out there in a similar situation? 

Thank you to anyone reading this.",,2021-02-22 17:56:46,lq2il8
,Need some help,"My mother was diagnosed with dementia in December 2019 after a car accident. We‚Äôve been navigating this but have been having a hard time due to covid restrictions. 
 
The issues we‚Äôre experiencing is that my mom refuses to do anything. We tried to get her into activities when she retired. Things like water fit etc. She went with my sister a few times but she refuses to go on her own. She complains about being bored, complains that no one calls her (she never calls them), and just wanders around the house doing absolutely nothing. She won‚Äôt clean, she barely reads, won‚Äôt watch TV during the day. However, she‚Äôs been like this for a long time (my lifetime). She hates cleaning and will use the excuse of arthritis not to clean, she likes to read but maybe can‚Äôt any more (she struggles reading things and speaking). She has zero hobbies and zero interest in the things we suggest. She will go out for walks, but she basically goes out so she can smoke cigarettes and check the mailbox (she walks to community box and back about 20 times a day). She‚Äôs not able to drive any more but refuses to sell her car. She literally has no interest in anything. She is definitely depressed and has been since my dad died in 2009. She also won‚Äôt ask for help. When she runs out of something she won‚Äôt ask for it, she‚Äôll just make passive aggressive comments or tell my cats she‚Äôs out of something (I‚Äôm usually in the room but she won‚Äôt say it to me). She fell when I was at work and cut her head open pretty badly where she was bleeding down her arm for hours (she fell around 1-2 and my sister called around 6 and found her to be strange so drove over and found her sitting in the driveway with blood all over) and still wouldn‚Äôt call for us. She drove to St. Thomas (we live in hamilton) and refused to let anyone know she was lost. We had to drive and get her and luckily she was near a restaurant that was unique as she was low on gas and refused to call for help. That was the final straw for letting her drive. 

I guess what I‚Äôm asking is what do I do? She refuses to listen to me, but her short term memory is completely gone so even if I ask her to do something she forgets it. I‚Äôm at my wits end and in over my head and I don‚Äôt know what to do. My doctor doesn‚Äôt really help and the only confirmation we have is what we see and that he did a quick test to initially diagnose her. What are my next steps? How to I do this?",,2021-02-22 20:33:47,lq5s56

I‚Äôm new to this sub but thought I would offer some tips for those who are caring for someone with Dementia.

My grandmother passed away a few months ago after complications due to covid. She had dementia and was in a LTC home. She was only in there for 2 months before covid hit. 
The waits for these homes are extremely long....I understand the frustration there. If you have someone who can care for your loved one at home, I recommend that. Especially during covid. If you do not have anyone to care for them and were stuck in a limbo such as my family....please find a LTC home that suits their needs. 
The home my grandmother was in was terrible. It was Humber Valley Terrace in Etobicoke. Even before covid hit, I had many concerns with that place. Please for the love of god do not send your loved one there. 
And please please do your research before sending a loved one to a LTC home. I‚Äôm sure there are good ones out there, but please research. 

As per dementia:
She was seeing a geriatric doctor every 6 months or so. He was great and prescribed her some medications. Although it wouldn‚Äôt stop the dementia, it slowed it down. He suggested doing word searches and cross words, etc... to keep her mind going.

She also recently lost a lot of weight (15-20 pounds) this past year and I'm very worried about her. Overall, she can still cook clean and take care of herself. I live with her and since I've been wfh I've noticed a bit of decline in her memory. I don't know if it's because she has me to rely on now that I'm at home to do more house chores but talks with her doctors has got me worried that she may actually have dementia.

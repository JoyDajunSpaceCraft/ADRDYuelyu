,Help us validate whether we have found the new best method to cope with Alzheimers," Hi everyone,

I hope you had a great weekend. At the moment we are working on an app to help make families who have a loved one suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's lives a lot easier! We want to bring more comfort to the families going through this and we believe our idea can truly help!

We would love to hear from you as personal insights from being involved within the health care system will help us make sure we address all areas necessary! I would really appreciate it if we if could have a really informal chat so I can get a better understanding and to see whether our app could help you. Message me if you are interested :):) As soon as the app goes live I will share it as I think its a really unique innovative idea to deal with aging parents :)",,2021-10-04 11:53:30,Krissy_8491,q1876i

I'm working on an idea for a technology app that will help caretakers of people with dementia. I'd love to get feedback on the idea from those who have a few minutes to spare :)  


Thanks","This is a great idea. 
Could you share how are you planing to help caregivers with your app?

While back ago I though of some tech to help support people with dementia remember their recent events. I believe there's much to do in this area, dementia that's it.

,Unmet needs," I am a health informatics masters student looking to develop a digital health solution idea for those with dementia. I want the solution to directly address the needs and wants of those living with dementia as well as those caring for those with dementia. To do this I want to better understand the needs of these two groups of people. These are the questions I have :

1. What types of services do people with Alzheimer’s/Dementia disease need?
2. What are the needs that caregivers find difficult to meet when caring for care recipients with Dementia/Alzheimers?
3. What are the barriers to accessing services that currently exist within your community?
4. What is the non-financial impact of Dementia/Alzheimer's disease on individuals and their caregivers?
5. What services have you found to be most valuable?
6. What factors isolate people with Dementia/Alzheimers (e.g., stigma)?
7. What factors work to support you and your care recipient?
8. Has technology played any role in meeting you and/or your care recipients needs?
9. What role can you imagine technology playing in meeting the needs of people with Dementia/Alzheimers in the future?
10. What would you say is/has been your greatest challenge?

I have a friend who is caring for her mother who was diagnosed in 2015 with Alzheimer’s. We both saw a need for a better way for family members to manage communications concerning the care of our loved ones. This friend is developing an app that all families involved with caring for a loved one can use to help manage communications between family members and daily tasks to help keep them healthy and alive.  We were tired of communications through texts and emails, and hope this tool will help all of us better manage our loved ones conditions by having their information in one place for families to access at any time from anywhere.  We need others like us (caring for family members with alzheimers and other chronic conditions) to help us test this app to see if it really meets the caregiving needs of our users.  There will be no charge for this app when it is released, hopefully in January of 2018.  We will be testing it in November and December.  Anyone will be able to use it to help coordinate care for their family members.  Let me know if you can help us, or go to vitalally.com and click on the beta invite button.

,"AMA Announcment: Author and Speaker, Judy Cornish, Sunday 19th, 11 a.m. EST –11 am Monday the 20th","
Hi, 
My name is Judy Cornish. I’d like to share something we’ve discovered at DAWN; there is very good news for families with someone experiencing dementia—that people with dementia can live happily and safely when we support their intuitive thought skills and experiential selves.  We’ve found that when we focus on and support the abilities rather than disabilities of dementia, our clients are happier and their families can postpone costly long-term care. 
I’m an elder law attorney who became involved with dementia. I’ve spent the past six years working with people with dementia, most of whom live in their own homes. I began to see a pattern in their functioning that medical science does not pick up: they were losing rational thought but not intuitive thought, and losing their remembering selves but not their experiential selves. 
I’ve written a book outlining my findings, which will be available on Amazon this spring. We’re trying to get the word out to families so that more people with dementia will be cared for in ways that support their autonomy and dignity, and more families will be able to avoid being bankrupted by institutional care. 
I’m hoping to take part in your AMA program.
Best regards,
Judy Cornish

,Some great opinions and options to help reduce risk... Diet,"Mr Ducky:  

There are many factors that go into alzheimers disease (Alzheimers disease), some of it cant be helped (the genetic component, late onset alzheimers is 60-80% according to twin studies) Another one not linked directly to the study but a news article with ~79% genetic risk, 95% CI of 68-88%

The biggest 2 are genetics and age. Mostly due to alleles known to confer risk of AD (ApoE is the big one, but there is also CLU, CR1 and PICALM known to change the amyloid beta protein into amyloid beta oligomers which result in the amyloid beta plaques)

Most sufferers of late onset AD are over the age of 65. Risk doubles every 5 years with 50% of people over the age of 85 having AD.

But yeah, apparently being healthy results in good health.

Sure... Now if we can all agree on what constitutes a""healthy diet ""...

From the research I've done, it seems like all the dietary recommendations for AD are backwards. It appears we're starving the brain of cholesterol and fat by either adhering to a low fat/low cholesterol diet and/or taking statin medications to keep cholesterol artificially low.

IMHO, people who are at risk for AD should be eating a high fat low carb diet and completely ditch the statins and also make sure they get some additional cholesterol in their diet. I have 2 copies of the apoE4 allel and adhear to a ketigenic diet most of the time as a preventive measure.





interesting, while I see the possible benefits of healthy fats, what, if any, benefits come from restricting carbohydrates?

 

Diets with carbohydrate restrictions to tend to be associated with greater longevity. Decreased IGF-1 secretion is the most well-known ""benefit"" here. Leads to a decrease in all-cell growth so is associated with lower mutation/cancer/inflammation.

  
What exactly constitutes restricted carb intake, gram wise on a per day basis.


Under 50g is a start, under 20g is the goal I think.




Keto is typical 20g or less a day, but up to 50g can keep you in ketosis depending on your body and level of exercise

""This is my jam!

The short story is pretty much that a restricted calorie diet (and exercise, to some extent) set off pathways that activate cellular repair. At the same time, those pathways also keep your cells from going into their cell-division cycle. Aging is tied to both the number of division cycles and cellular(genetic) damage, so the organism lives longer. This is true of nematodes on down to humans! Cool!

What is more fascinating to me is the... I guess you'd call it 'existential'?... aspect to this: diet (and to some extent exercise) are only good for you because they poke these pathways. The whole naturalistic ""in nature we didn't have cheeseburgers and we ran from lions more blah blah blah"" really boils down to some pretty ancient adaptations that we can probably rustle other ways. Biologically speaking there's not really a good reason an organism HAS to die. Death evolved! Ecology and epidemiology might demand it that good night, but basic cellular function does not.

(Side note: it's hard to build up a multicellular thing from a blob of cells unless some of them kill themselves to separate into specific functional stuff like organs)

Side side note/ PSA: exercise has other tangible benefits that don't really relate to those outlined above. Better living through shaking that ass.""

The about-face includes:

    Admitting that dietary fat is nothing to worry about.
    Acknowledging that salt intake is not usually a problem and doesn't need restricting.
    Realizing that added sugars are really, really bad.

They just need to take a teeny tiny peek in their biochemistry textbooks to realize that is is not just crystalline sugars which are bad, but also starch forms of sugars are, actually, effectively the same!

What I want is mandatory re-training of all licensed / registered dietitians and nutritionists who are members of the academy. Such a huge, 180 degree change in dietary advice is staggering, and unprecedented. This shouldn't just be swept under the rug.

> &quot;Instead of asking, &#039;How do we study the immune response of the brain?,&#039; &#039;Why do multiple sclerosis patients have the immune attacks?,&#039; now we can approach this mechanistically - because the brain is like every other tissue connected to the peripheral immune system through meningeal lymphatic vessels,&quot; said Jonathan Kipnis, a professor in U.Va.&#039;s Department of Neuroscience and director of U.Va.&#039;s Center for Brain Immunology and Glia.

> He added, &quot;We believe that for every neurological disease that has an immune component to it, these vessels may play a major role. [It&#039;s] hard to imagine that these vessels would not be involved in a disease with an immune component.""

> &quot;As to how the brain&#039;s lymphatic vessels managed to escape notice all this time, Kipnis described them as&quot;very well hidden&quot; and noted that they follow a major blood vessel down into the sinuses, an area difficult to image.

,QUESTION Can I have elevated blood sugar without having diabetes? Includes ANSWER,"Can I have elevated blood sugar without having diabetes?


Yes, a number of things can cause high blood sugar but most of the time it is due to having diabetes. But it can also be due to other causes. These include medications such as beta blockers, epinephrine, thiazide diuretics, corticosteroids, niacin, pentamidine, protease inhibitors and some antipsychotics. Illegal drug use of amphetamine can produce high blood sugar. Some of the newer, double action anti-depressants like Zyprexa and Cymbalta can also cause significant high blood sugar.

Another cause of high blood sugar is when the body is in a state of physical stress associated with critical illness like a stroke or heart attack. An active blood infection, known as sepsis, is often seen with blood sugar levels that are high. During these times of stress, the body releases its own hormones that can raise blood sugar. The level that the blood sugar reaches can change from person to person and should not be used as a diagnosis of diabetes. Further testing, such checking blood sugar levels after not eating for 8 hours or checking a special test of red blood cells can show if there really is a diagnosis of diabetes.

    Lifestyle is responsible for up to 76% of changes in the ageing of the brain, according to Age UK, with key lifestyle changes having the potential to reduce the risk of developing dementia by as much as 36%.

    The five actions that people can take to maintain brain health include regular physical exercise, a Mediterranean diet, not smoking, drinking in moderation and preventing diabetes.

    One large UK study, done over 30 years, found men aged between 45 and 59 who followed four to five of the identified lifestyle factors, were found to have a 36% lower risk of developing cognitive decline and a 36% lower risk of developing dementia than those who did not.

    Scientific Studies suggested exercising three to five times a week for between 30 minutes and an hour was beneficial.

,Cross Post on Support Groups from redditor,"I went to my first Alz support group today. What got out of it:

We're not alone. It's good to talk to others, if for no other reason then to vent. But I did get a lot of good tips & tricks from this group:

    Dad likes sweets, bribe him if we have to

    Lying is good. It's therapeutic lying - an alz patient will shut down & stop talking if you keep on correcting them that they're wrong.

    Instead of saying There's no one here but us, Dad say The other people here, are they bothering you when he's loopy at night. If they're not bothering him then fine. If so, say something like I'll ask them to leave

    Choose your battles. Wearing the same clothes you did yesterday is nowhere near as important as getting him to eat today

    Lower the heat setting on the hot water heater. Many elderly have lost their sense of pain where heat is concerned

    If he has a set of clothes he likes wearing, buy him several copies of it. It may be comfort, it may be an emotional bond to it.

    See if Dad can do specific things, like empty the dishwasher, fold clothes. He wants to feel helpful

    Maybe we should buy him tickets to the Opera again. He enjoyed that so much

    The movie Still Alice, We may want to check that out. It's about a college professor who goes through Alzheimer's

    MedicAlert - a way to track a wandering person. Something to research.

    There are support groups (on the Alz website) all over the place but they are not all alike. Some of them have lecturers, some are just caregivers talking, some have doctors there to answer technical questions that lay-people have. You have to check them out until you find a group you like

I'd love to see this subreddit collect all this information into one big helpful sidebar. Not just what I've found but what others have found too.

,Awesome Calming Suggestions from Redditor,"catswearhats 

I work with clients like this frequently. The Montessori tasks are great, such as the folding towels example. Some of the others I have found successful are in this article: 1. Prep tables with materials for activities such as puzzles, sorting exercises and other games. 2. Lay out a basket of clean towels to fold. 3. Have a basket of clean socks that need to be matched and folded. 4. Put out a bin of plastic plumbing tubes that can be connected and put together. 5. For advanced dementia patients who may take comfort in holding dolls, a series of dolls and doll clothes can make for a pleasurable activity. 6. For those who enjoy cooking or baking, a safe kitchen environment and baking ingredients. http://www.alzheimers.net/2014-05-27/montessori-method-dementia/ Depending on the client, talking about their childhood can be successful. Asking questions such as where were you born? did you grow up on a farm? And then go from there depending on their answers. Simple oral quizzes, keeping in mind their level of functioning, is great too! We have whole binders where I work, but I'll see if i can find an example online... K like this: 1 A cake named after a baseball play

2 President Carter’s favorite cake

3 Integrated cake named after a stone

4 Cake that is like a babies

5 A 16 ounce cake

ANSWERS # 1 Bunt cake # 2 Peanut cake # 3 Marble cake # 4 Bottom cake # 5 Pound cake

I find that when all else fails, everybody loves taking about food. Talk about what her favourite thing to cook is, does she like sweet or savoury? Things like that.

And in crisis moments, I find that validation therapy is effective. Live in her world. If she is concerned about something, try to help her with it, validate that those feelings she is experiencing are real, before trying to redirect her to something else. If you have any additional questions or anything, feel free to pm me! I just came off a co-op rotation working with Alzheimer's clients, and am still there on a part time basis while I compete my studies. It can be stressful at first in an environment like this, but you'll hit your stride and do great! :)",,2015-04-13 17:02:01,-Yeah-I-Said-It-,32hhm5

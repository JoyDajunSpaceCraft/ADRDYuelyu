,I want to help my mom help my gram,"My gram is getting bad and I want to help my mom help her.

My gram is getting progressively more confused, still lives home alone and we rely on nanny-cams. (In addition my mom is there DAILY managing ADLS and medications) my mom works full time, she‚Äôs a gram who babysits 2x a week. It‚Äôs just horrible to watch. My gram at the point where she‚Äôs saying ‚Äúwhat is wrong with me‚Äù because she knows something is wrong (ie couldn‚Äôt turn her tv off and we tried to redirect her she kept picking up every other object but a remote via nanny cam, she eventually got it while sobbing). She is aware enough to know she doesn‚Äôt want a CNA but it‚Äôs hard seeing her struggle/ it‚Äôs inhumane. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm writing here, I just am looking for support or suggestions to help my mom and my gram at this time of her disease progression where she‚Äôs aware, but not. I‚Äôm a full time nursing student and am basically helpless but trying. Any suggestions will help. Thank you.","Hello op. I‚Äôm in a similar situation with my grandma. As she progressed, a lot of family dynamics have come into play as some people just think she has ADHD (blows my mind but that‚Äôs another rant). I used to help out a lot but as the dynamics grew, I realized the best thing was just to sit and talk and engage with my grandma. Her kids have handled her living arrangements and care and whatever they decide,
I just provide support to my grandma anyway I can. I don‚Äôt get involve with answering any decision making as honestly That‚Äôs not up to.

It‚Äôs very difficult to watch, especially in the beginning but as time goes on, you‚Äôll figure out the best way to support her.
Thank u
Sometimes the best help is to help the caregiver. Just offer to visit with her. Allow your mom a day off. Make sure gran has taken her meds. Offer to take her some groceries. Go through a photo album and listen to her stories about people. It‚Äôs a great way to hear about her past, get some quiet time, and support your mom.",2022-02-21 22:45:03,Abbeyableto,sydgh9

,My little forgetful mother/Alzheimer's.,"üåûüåπüåü#1. She's forgetting what to do next when taking a shower, so I have her turn on her speaker phone and have to guide and walk her though one step at a time what to do to get in the shower and then I have to tell her again what to do when she gets in the shower while we're both on the speaker phone. She will ask questions what to do through the process, but when I tell her, I can tell she does it and says what next and what else. Sometimes I have to repeat two or three times, but sometimes I only have to repeat one time and she gets everything done while we're both on the speaker phone.  
#2. I notice when she eats any kind of berries like all species of birds eat all berries and fly hundreds of thousands or miles to get where they want to go. I do see she remembers more when she eats berries. Also take two to three ferrous sulfate iron tablets everyday. Especially drinking pure water, not beverages to keep the blood diluted and to keep hydrated. We are amazed of what she can do for herself while using the speaker on her cell phone all by herself. She even says I look beautiful when she combs her hair in the mirror and tell her to put on her lipstick! She even says wow, as I feel her looking in the mirror. 
I do believe if you think a relative or someone you know is getting Alzheimer's, our story of how to help them exercise their brain in this way, is definitely proof that it can be done. It could be better than anything else. We do this exercise for her brain everyday now. Even though she will be getting a caregiver, it's still important for your loved ones to do as much as they can for themselves, even though you can do it for them. üåà‚≠êüåô",,2022-02-09 15:05:26,Just4uwithlivevideos,somjzi

,Psychedelics and Alzheimer,"Several scientific data show that psychedelics help increase cognitive performance. Two recent reviews strongly suggest that psychedelics would benefit Alzheimer's patients. In summary, microdosing would increase synaptic plasticity, generate new neurons and decrease the amount of beta-amyloid after microdosing. These structural changes would help to alleviate the deficiencies that this disease produces. The microdoses for psilocybin would be 15mg per 70kg. This would be about 1g of psychedelic mushroom, if 1% of its weight is the psilocybin compound. I hope it helps those who wish to have an alternative option to the conventional one.

,My grandpa close to 90 is starting to show some Alzheimer‚Äôs symptoms. How can I help him with slowing it down?,"Sorry this is my first time posting in a while and please tell me if this is the wrong sub.
 
My grandpa who is 80 something is slowly showing signs of Alzheimer‚Äôs. He is forgetting the days etc. He also has extremely bad eye sight and has a hard time moving quickly. 

He is an intelligent and inquisitive man who also has a masters in biochemistry (back in the 50-60s in Japan which alone is an accomplishment), and during his working years travelled regularly. He was very active intellectually and loved learning new things and even speaks English quiet well. 

I am thinking maybe an audio book because he‚Äôs loved reading but can no longer use the laptop or read books due to his eyesight. I‚Äôm also thinking of 3d puzzles. He regularly plays solitaire and does sudoku alone.

Do these ideas sound good? And does anyone else recommend something else?

I am pretty sure he‚Äôs not getting the mental stimulation he used to through reading and through his research using the pc. He‚Äôs basically now just watching tv everyday and complaining.","I am sorry about your grandpa. My husband passed from Young-onset Alzheimer‚Äôs, and, sadly, not the only person in my family to suffer from that cruel disease. 

The truth is that there‚Äôs nothing currently available to slow the progression. Both over-the-counter & prescription meds do nothing but drain your bank account (please research this). 

Also the ‚Äúhelpful tips and suggestions‚Äù (such as doing puzzles, exercising, etc) that we hear about did nothing for my hubby. 

My husband was always healthy; ate well, exercised, active, etc, with no family history. The diagnosis was shocking (he was only in his 50s when diagnosed). 

However, what did help him was pot & music. He played his guitar & wrote music until the disease was quite advanced. He also started liking silly jokes. (The videos of him laughing out loud are the only videos I‚Äôve been able to watch of him that were taken during his illness). 
Marijuana helped a lot until it didn‚Äôt (it was obvious when it was no longer helping). Once it didn‚Äôt help anymore, I got him a vape pen (no nicotine) that he thought was pot, and puffing on it relaxed him. 

Your grandpa is lucky to have you. Everyone is different. Please try different activities, you never know what might help him feel more relaxed/comfortable. Also remember that things are always changing. While (IMHO) there‚Äôs nothing to slow down the disease progression, you can help him to relax, and help you both through the difficult days/nights. 

Wishing you both peace on this difficult journey ‚úåÔ∏è<3
Take him to his doctor. There are medicines that help to slow it down.",2021-12-29 09:59:08,moi24,rra1fi
,Grandmothers Sitter gave herself a $1500 Christmas present and I am unsure how to deal.,"Hello! My grandmother has Alzheimer‚Äôs and I am her health care proxy and power of attorney. This is all super new, I stepped in to this role in May and has been a wild ride I was unprepared for (but that‚Äôs life!). My grandmother has a 24 hour sitter service to allow her to stay in her home with her cats as long as it is possible. We have had this sitter service, ran by an individual, for almost 2 months. I really really like the person who runs it, and all the sitters. It has been a blessing. We personally had a family friend that had these sitters for years until she passed, so I definitely trusted them. 

All that as a back story, today I was checking on her account like usual, she there is a check for $1,500 written to the owner (who is her sitter a few days a week) with the memo saying, ‚ÄúMerry Christmas‚Äù.  

For certain bills, the head sitter has communicated with me and filled out the check for my grandma to sign. I thought this was fine, but maybe I was just thankful to have a break from handling everything?

I don‚Äôt know how to handle this $1500 check she wrote to herself without checking with me. I don‚Äôt think my grandma would ask her to do this, I suggested giving all the sitters $50 for Christmas, and my grandma thought that was too much. 

I have been so happy with this service, we are finally at good place, with routine and medicine (it was a few awful awful dark weeks) so I am hesitant to rock any boats. 

How to I handle this? It‚Äôs making me ask a weird sounding question, does the service work for me? Or my grandma? I want to bring it up, like hey if it‚Äôs not a normal bill you need to run it by me, but what if she says its what Granny wanted? Is it in my lane to question this?","That is way beyond improper. That‚Äôs theft. It‚Äôs also elder financial abuse. Nobody in their right mind gets a $1500 ‚Äútip‚Äù/gift for Christmas for being an employee for 2 months! Time to take away the check book and have a discussion with the owner.  You‚Äôll also need to take an inventory of your grandmother‚Äôs possessions and make sure that none disappear.
Edit to add, they work for you. Question everything, your grandmother has Alzheimer‚Äôs, she can‚Äôt make these types of decisions that‚Äôs why YOU have power of attorney and have hired these services.",2021-12-28 01:54:51,MarcelDuchampsToilet,rq9fyo
,What can I tell my mom when she thinks her kids are in danger?,"My mom often have episodes were she thinks her children are in danger and we need to go help them.

But when she thinks her kids are in danger I need to deal with a woman in full survival mode ready to jump in a fire to save her children.

My heart sank and I‚Äôm finally having to face how bad her memory has become.  This is brand new to me and I have no idea how to deal with this.  Please provide any and all advice you can; I would really appreciate it","I don't have any advice, but I feel for you. It was heartbreaking to get those calls from my mom too. Knowing she was scared. Can you ask her what you can do to make her feel secure? Do you live close to visit her very often?
Wish there was some real advice to give. But it seems like you're already doing it. Just being present and being her ""safe person"". My dad does the same with my mother, and unfortunately he thinks he's still married to his first wife. Generally when he gets like that my mom will just play along and tell him she's just there to keep him company and help take care of him. No matter what, correction is never an option. It can make them feel more insecure and become defensive. 

Sometimes the best thing to do is to just play along and for them to feel like they are in a safe space. 

PSA: this is not set in stone. Being a caregiver is hard and something that might've worked today won't necessarily work tomorrow. 

Wish you and your family the best.",2021-12-20 23:43:29,everybodywantsome,rl6ef1

,any advice?,"My grandmother has been living with Alzheimer‚Äôs for about 6 ish years now. 
It has become clear that she is entering her final stages of life, as she is no longer mobile.
The one question I ask is what to explain to her when she asks about my deceased grandfather? It breaks my heart, and she asks about him every few minutes during visits. 
Often she thinks that he has left her. 
I‚Äôve tried different approaches to answering her, but if anyone has experience I‚Äôd like to know what may be most comforting for her to hear.","I tell my mom, when she‚Äôs asking about her deceased parents and siblings ‚Äúoh she‚Äôs resting‚Äù 
She always asks, ‚Äúare you sure?‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm positive Uncle Tom/Grandpa/etc are having a good rest.‚Äù  It reassured her, and then I try to change the subject.

,what to expect from a mid-stage Alzheimer's patient about to get a diagnosis (clearly in denial),"My father's Alzheimer's has progressed to mid stage without ever getting a formal diagnosis. He is on all of the right medication and is working with gerontology, but he's only going to get a diagnosis in late September. My family has manipulated his environment to make him as comfortable as possible and as a result he either doesn't believe there is a problem of isn't aware of the gravity.  Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? How was the reaction? Part of me hopes that his decline will dampen the blow, but I don't know how the doctors will deliver the information or how he will receive it.","Denial. He‚Äôll tell you he‚Äôs fine, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with him. Forgetting stuff is just old age, everybody does it. 

He‚Äôll keep progressing, be stuck on stories from, if he‚Äôs like my Dad, when he was a teenager. His behavior becomes that if a young child. He‚Äôll forget people, forget the names of common things, and ultimately forget how to swallow. Some are happy and a joy to be around or they‚Äôre angry and violent. 

Join a support group. You‚Äôll need someone to talk to.
Part of it is the disease. Part of it is denial. Definitely join a support group (I‚Äôm in 2 on Facebook) that fits your time and needs. It‚Äôs a rough road. Anger and depression are two symptoms that can be made easier with medication - do NOT be afraid to mention anger, moodiness, agitation, or depression. Watch for exit seeking & instability, as both have various remedies & treatments. Please watch pill taking as this was a nightmare until we got a locked medication dispenser.
My mother started with symptoms around 11 yrs ago.  She was never formally dianosed.  At that point we moved to a mother-daughter home where she had her own apartment and she could still do things on her own. 6 yrs ago I had to move her with me and we made 2 rooms into 1 so she had her own bedroom and tv room. She could no longer cook for herself but could still do personal hygene wih me keeping an eye on her.  Aprox. 2 yrs ago she started not knowing where she was and kept wanting to go home to old home that we lived in she also started calling me mom and other times wanted me to take her to her mother who has been gone for many years.  She would get angry and lash out with words and sometimes fists. I finally had hospic come  in January and she  lasted about 2 weeks before she passed. She was in denial the entire time thinking I was lying to her about everything.  I did it all for her and kept her safe but it took a toll on me emotionally and physicaly.  Reach out for help through support groups sooner than later. I waited till the end when I couldnt mentally handle it and wish I would have gotten support sooner. Reach out if you need to talk. Best of luck with one of the hardest things you will ever have to deal with.
My mom just got diagnosed last week and is in complete denial but does realize she needs me a lot more..still won't admit it tho.

,Covid-19 procedures,I was wondering what procedures for visits other facilities have due to Covid-19. My mother is only allowed one visit every two weeks in a conference room with no more than two people.  The people have to wear masks (no problem) and have their temperature taken and a list of questions asked of them. Also wash hands before entering the building. I have no problem with any of this except  the frequency of visits. My mom is losing ground without contact with family for two weeks at a time. Any advice or comments would be appreciated. I‚Äôm vaccinated. But I don‚Äôt mind wearing a mask. I just don‚Äôt see why the 2 week delay.,"My folks are in a memory care in Colorado. We do the questionnaire and temp thing, but as of June 7th, have no restrictions on frequency of visits.
My mom goes to memory care an a needed basis. Normal temperature & health precautions. But we can see her as often as we like, in her room the garden or the group room. We frequently have her ‚Äúbestie‚Äù join us and they chatter away happily. Dad has joined her for meals.  We are in Indiana (their facility has had no cases of Covid-19)

,"Need advice, help, something","I'm at a loss of words. Actually I'm not, I'm pissed off. Quick backstory. My 90 year old grandmother suffers from severe Alzhemiers with delusions, hallucinations, aggression. My aunt has Power of Attorney and from the beginning, she said whatever money is not spent on my grandma, the more she and her sister get. That's her mindset. She's 'finally happy with her boyfriend and is just not going to stop everything.' My mom is disabled, so she is limited to help. We moved my grandmother in with us after she also picked up by police wandering around her neighborhood in her night gown at 2am, 20 degrees outside. She become violent. A new state, a new home, alot of sudden changes; which only helped her aggression and delusions. She would hit me, try to kick my pets, get passed all our extra security measures  and wander outside, she needed 24/7 care. We got her into a memory care assisted living. Everything continued to get worse. Now they are having her committed to some janky psychiatric ward for addicts and mental illness. The reviews are just horrid, cheapest around, obviously. I know this place is not going to do any good, drugging her and locking her away will have a detrimental snow ball effect. Does anyone have any suggestions. My aunt has control over everything, never even seen the will my grandfather left or the life insurance stuff he had set up to take care of my grandmother when this time came. I know alzhemiers care is a struggle, especially when its so far gone. They won't even take her to like a neurologist or someone who can help with the symptoms of Alzhemiers, just sticking her in a psych ward so it's less work for them. I just don't know what to do or where to go for help. Please help if any of yall have any personal experiences or advice.","I feel for you. The person with the Power of Attorney makes all the decisions, health and financial. My brother has power of attorney over my mom and won‚Äôt even get her the covid-19 vaccine. Sometimes all I can do is cry. I can‚Äôt give you any good advice other than talk to your Aunt about things. She is the decision maker. Also, visit as much as you can. Your grandmother needs interaction.

May your aunt follow in her mother's footsteps and suffer the same fate as her mother..The only thing you maybe able to do is talk to a lawyer and see if you can have the Power of attorney changed because she is not doing right by your grandmother.

,So I put the salt grinder in the fridge.,"So today I was making lunch, I went to put some salt on what I was making, I looked for the salt, nowhere to be found, not with all the other spices etc, I looked everywhere in the kitchen, for some reason I opened the fridge and there it is, been there a while, it's cold, I kind of freak out, I've been having memory issues lately, losing words, etc, my grandma had Alzheimer's, so I suppose it runs in the family, I'm only 39(m), I don't know what to think, this is the first real 'leaving stuff in weird places' experience.

And advice would be welcome.","Hello! I‚Äôm sorry to hear about this, I know it can be really scary. Personally I‚Äôve done stuff like this and so had my husband but if you are still worried I would see a neurologist. They will be able provide answers you need through scans or specific memory tests. They can also talk to you about how to recognize symptoms and more. I take take of my mom with Alzheimer‚Äôs and signs started 10 years before her diagnosis. I wish she went to the doctor sooner. I wish you the best of luck
First, it may be nothing. Maybe you had a distraction when you were holding the salt and looking in the fridge.
Second, have the doctor test you and find out for sure. There is medication now, to slow the progression down, and new breakthroughs are coming in the field of Alzheimer‚Äôs.
Ok here‚Äôs my story: if I am on the phone while multitasking, I can‚Äôt find whatever it was that I put away.  I don‚Äôt have Alzheimer‚Äôs.  I laugh at myself saying that I can‚Äôt be trusted to multitask any more. It‚Äôs probably a good thing.  Lol. Please do not freak out.   Just happens.

,Alzheimer's Word Vomit,"Just spilling my guts- we knew many years ago my  mother in law would end up with Alzheimer's or some other form of dementia. in 2004, while she was still healthy, we bought a very large home together with extended family so that when the time came, we could care for her together. Hoping that way it would be a load rather than a burden. So of her 5 children, 3 of them live in the house with her, 1 lives 3 hours away, and one lives out of state and I don't thing even calls once a year to check I on her (no bitterness there).  When she first really started to get sick  - all 3 sets of kids helped as able.  1 married couple  (us) worked full time out of the home and had children at home, so we were primarily respite care: every Friday/ Saturday 9pm-7am and every 3rd weekend Friday from 6pm-Sunday 9pm ish. One daughter is married, one is not, both have no living children, both are full time care givers for both of their parents and both are AMAZING - homecooked meals, separate special diets for each parent, physical therapy 6 days a week at home provided by them, a massage once a  week for mom. Home prepared body butter for Dad's skin condition; they are amazing! November 2020 - they call a family meeting and tell us that Momma has decided my husband (her son) and I are trying to kill her. We step back from care giving and basically go into hiding in our home, so that she doesn't see us. We still help in the only ways we can. We disinfect and vacuum the house at night after she has gone to bed. I no longer help at night on the weekends, we no longer do Parent Care every 3rd weekend. Huge physical addition to what my sister in law's already do. But they say it has been a huge emotional help because it alleviated a ton of fear, she stopped most of her wetting herself, etc. Knowing that you are they cause of someone else's genuine terror is beyond heartbreaking.  Then we slowly started to integrate into life just as a part of the home, not as care givers. Thought things were going well, even to the point that maybe we could do respite care just for a few hours on a weekend afternoon. She would see me and walk up to me and give me a big hug and tell me she loved me so much. Then  all of a sudden in the last 2 weeks, family dynamics have shifted  (aren't they fun) and all of a sudden she has taken a downturn with us again (is it naughty of me that I see a connection there?) I walked out on to the deck last week and she flinched when she saw me, flinched. I went inside and sobbed. So do we go back into hiding? Did I mention I work from home since Co-vid started, so I am here 24/7? A nursing home is not an option.  I went and priced 5th wheels yesterday, thinking that even though I can't put them where we live, I can  park one at my sister's house - my mom lives with her. then I can at least help with my mom. not even sure that is legal.  Literally spent all week crying  - asked my husband so what happens when Mama gets to the point that she says she doesn't want us here instead of she doesn't want us caring for her? Anyone else dealt with this? sorry for the length - hope it makes sense - thank you in advance.","I just found this sub, and though I know this post is nearly a month old, it didn‚Äôt have any responses so I wanted to say something. First I think your family has done an amazing job of planning and structuring her care. This is so hard, and it‚Äôs really impressive how supportive you are of each other. 

 Literally yesterday we moved my mom (and dad) into a bigger house so I could live with them and we‚Äôd be close to my sister. My mom doesn‚Äôt sound as far along as your mother in law, but we‚Äôre getting there. 

I am her scapegoat. I‚Äôm the person who took her car keys away. I‚Äôm the one who made her move. Whatever it is, it‚Äôs my fault. 

And she‚Äôs paranoid. Not About me. So far it‚Äôs just about people breaking into the house (this isn‚Äôt new to this house; she would barricade the doors at their old place), and about her purse. Just no trust in other people. 

Has your MIL seen a geriatric psychiatrist, or is that at all an option? Neurologists are great, but when they reach the stage you‚Äôre dealing with, a geriatric psych with dementia experience is better able to address their moods and fears. In our experience. (Mom is the sixth in our family to have dementia, the fifth with Alzheimer‚Äôs). 

The progression is so unpredictable. As likely as she could find herself not wanting you to live there at all, she could progress to a point where that particular paranoia disappears. I‚Äôve seen that, too. All of it is heartbreaking. I‚Äôm really sorry. You aren‚Äôt alone in your grief, fear, or frustration.

,My family is struggling to approach my mothers early onset symptoms. We have talked to doctors/specialists and have found stonewall after stonewall. I just want to help my mom and it kills me to hear a specialist tell me there is little to nothing we can do.,"My(28m) mom(63f) is showing signs of early onset dementia. She has stopped reading, forgets short term events and has begun to stutter/ lose her train of thought when conversing, both with her family and with friends. Her mother died after five years of battling Alzheimer‚Äôs at 65. My family wants nothing more than to help, but the doctors we have seen have given us no confidence in the path forward. That said, she has reluctantly accepted our concerns and it was quite difficult to get her to actually go to these doctors. Does anybody on this forum have experience with not only breaking the ice with said suffering loved one, but also, are there any courses of action that may not be addressed by specialists in this field. I trust most medical professionals, but right now my family and I feel like we have our hands tied behind our backs with no agency to mitigate the progressing issue. We have read up on how to approach this, and compassion from our end has been key, however, my mother is a strong personality and can get quite defensive when we try to broach the issue. Any and all help is appreciated.","Do you have a local memory clinic? You want to find an Outpatient specialty center that has social workers who specialize in Alzheimers and dementia as those clinicians know how to communicate best with early onset patients. It may also be important for her to start the process of working with a lawyer who specializes in elder care and can start to prepare your family for future financial logistics.

You can also ask about participating in clinical trials. That was something that was important to my mother when she received early onset diagnosis. 

Finally, there are some nutrition and lifestyle options that are not backed by a lot of research yet but some people swear that Ketogenic diets and focus on strength training really slow down progression. I wish my family had been open to such options. 

Tough situation for sure.
Wow, I‚Äôm so sorry.  My brother also has early onset
Ahlz.  He is 63.  His wife recently moved him in to an assisted living memory care facility.  It is so sad to visit him there with all those old people.  He‚Äôs been there since April 1 and seems to be content there.
He‚Äôs 2 hrs away but his daughters visit routinely as well as my sister and me.  His memory mostly takes him back 30 yrs ago.  We do what we can to talk and laugh and get him some outdoor exercise when we visit.   Mostly we show we love him, take him snacks or things we know he liked, watermelon or fruit.  I‚Äôm tearing up thinking of him now.  At times he thinks ladies in the facility are his wife and gets real protective of them.  He tells us the place is really nice, the food is good and they take good care of him.  I think he struggled to try and be around people and go places because his brain didn‚Äôt work 
In there, everyone is more like him and his world is small and routines are easier for him than in the outside world.  Good luck with your mother just don‚Äôt get frustrated with her, she is probably doing the best she is capable of doing.  It will only get worse.
Check out Dr. Dale bredesen's research and books. It might not be too late for her to make some changes that could really help.
I came here for that same answer lmao

We have to start paperwork so that our medical insurance can give us money to pay someone to take care of her in the future. We'll have to have an interview with people from the government and I'm terrified that they might say something that will upset her like ""Do you have Alzheimer?"" or something like that.

The doctors in general don't say the word in front of her. We don't say it either. We call it ""memory problems"" but I'm as lost as you on how to approach the patient.

We were told something that might help: with time patients become more docile. I wouldn't have been able to take her to a doctor 2 years ago and now she's thankful we are there with her in every appointment. So I hope doctors are right on this because I'm not sure how am I going to introduce a caretaker in her life without making her feel like..... well.... someone with dementia.
Sent PM. My mom also has early-onset Alzheimer‚Äôs and I constantly feel helpless about it too
there are Alzheimer's support groups all over the country..They can help steer you in the right direction. My partner has Alzheimers and it was me , not her children who has done the work. There are drugs that can be taken to slow the progression of the disease. There are supposedly new drugs coming out this year to also help the issues..I have been told that exercise and good eating will also help stem the tide somewhat...the exercise for more oxygen to the brain and good eating that some foods help..Right now my partner suffers mainly from short term memory loss..

,Support and resources for those caring for and those diagnosed with early onset Alzheimers?,"Hello all, I have stumbled upon this sub for some possible resources o can provide my family in regards to supporting my (age 55) step dads early onset Alzheimer‚Äôs. My mom is the only one around to help him at the moment and it pains me every time we talk and I hear about how fast he is losing it... I want to help them so badly but so far have just been told by those I have talked to that ‚Äúthat sucks, only will get worst....‚Äù 
I‚Äôm really looking for ways I can support my mom so she doesn‚Äôt lose her mind with depression and overwhelmed with living with someone who has Alzheimer‚Äôs and caring for him.
If there are any books or blogs/groups for EARLY onset Alzheimer‚Äôs I would deeply appreciate it.

Wishing all the best.","Look in to caregivers fatigue. Being a full time or part time care giver when we aren't trained for what is, a very demanding profession can come with alot of stresses we can't particularly deal with alone.

I am sorry that your parents are going through this. I took care of my mother for 10 yrs and watched the decline.  It took me a long time to talk to someone or should I say to find someone to talk to that I was close to the edge of loosing my mind. I accually found her on here. She has been helping caregivers cope for 20 yrs. She has some great ideas on how I could keep some of my sanity and she was my own personal cheerleader to remind me from the outside that I was doing all I could. Her name is Cathy_Braxton on here or her email is cathybrax26@gmail.com  I didnt think I could open up to someone but when I started talking and she listened without judgement it was the best thing I ever did. If you need anything please dont hesitate to ask. I hope this helps.
your welcome and I hope it helps. Best of luck to your mom it is a hard road to walk and just remember there is no right or wrong and the only good thing with this disease is that if something you try doesnt work they dont remember. It sounds harsh but that was sometimes the only thing that got me through.
My doc said I have caregiver fatigue just yesterday. It is exhausting to be here 24/7 
I love my parents, but this is draining the joy from me",2021-04-02 15:43:32,withinaglimpse94,mirxjw

,Alzheimer's,So my mum who has Alzheimer's was having respite care for 2 weeks to give my dad a break but we've just been told she's not coming home and staying in care as she has deteriorated so fast. I'm in bits. I feel like it's a bereavement. Is this natural to feel this way?,"Yes. I‚Äôve cried so many times as my mom declined. She just passed a couple days ago so she is not suffering any longer. Her body just forgot how to function. It‚Äôs normal. It‚Äôs just a way to try and come to terms with what is happening. Just let it out. Don‚Äôt hold any emotions in, that‚Äôs really not healthy. But lots of prayers to you and your family. I know what you‚Äôre going through it‚Äôs tough but you are not alone.
I just lost my mom in January and with this disease I felt like I grieved her over and over again as I lost her bit by bit over the years. Everytime she lost some of her memory or function to be able to do something I lost her all over again.  Always know that whatever you feel is ok just remember you have done all you can.
It‚Äôs altering your expected reality. Of course it should hurt. Grieve - and know you‚Äôre not alone.",2021-03-16 19:20:23,upsidedowninsideou7,m6maql
,Nana‚Äôs Books for engagement and nostalgic memories,"I highly recommend these books with large font and large photos for people living with dementia and caregivers. There are books for veterans, fishermen, cat lovers, faith-based, etc. I‚Äôve struggled for the past several years to find something to connect with my mom. These books have been the only thing lately to do the trick. Best part is? They don‚Äôt mention in the book they‚Äôre curated FOR people with dementia. My mother is prone to reacting (poorly) whenever she is reminded of the illness. I LOVE these books.

,Very aggressive i need support,"Hi everyone, my grandma has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's almost 3 years ago. In the family we take turns to keep her safe at home. Lately she started being very very aggressive fisically and verbally. She started stealing stuff around the house and she started eating A LOT. This is the first time something lime this is happening. She turned 180¬∞. The doctor that's followimg her case gave us an appontment for the 1st of March but i wanted to know if one of you has the same ""problem"". We love her to death that's why we are scared that she could hurt herself especially beacause when she steals stuff she puts it in her bra and the last time she put a pair of scissors in them. Thanks for the support and sorry for my english it's not my primary lenguage.","Has she had her bloods and urine checked lately? First thing a doctor would usually do when noticing a change of behaviour is rule out any signs of infection.
Also, I would be pushing for this to be done now and not waiting until the 1st march. Infection is serious in the elderly. Especially those with dementia and there is times where the person doesn't revert back to old self after the infection has cleared.",2021-02-14 12:08:40,SbroccoloauS,ljsefy
,Living with my mother,"Hi. I really don‚Äôt where to start, or how i can explain myself. My mother has been diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer‚Äôs recently but i‚Äôve noticing signs and symptoms since i was 15/16 (21 now). and the worse was when she was in a accident when i was 15. Things slowly started to get worse at first, not knowing where she‚Äôd misplace her keys, not knowing what time it was. then around 17 that‚Äôs when it began to more noticeable, leaving the store on at various points of the day. getting confused. my father didn‚Äôt know what was happening and my brothers would be confused. then so then we wouldn‚Äôt let her use the stove but only clean the house until she couldn‚Äôt. being the youngest out or the 3 left me taking care of her while also trying to attend college and work until i wasn‚Äôt able too since my one of my brothers would work nights while i attended school and my father would come at night. Now i‚Äôm 21 i had to drop out of school to take care of her full time, i hardly go to work as well. Living in a first gen hispanic household there‚Äôs more feeling towards bottle your emotions in fear of being seen as a lesser man. I don‚Äôt know if anyone has felt this way, not being to show your emotion. But for the past four months it‚Äôs gotten harder. I don‚Äôt really know how to describe my story that well. but how do people cope with this. and how can k try to myself feel better. (i‚Äôm sorry if my text doesn‚Äôt make much sense. i am very tired.","First off, I am so sorry that you are going through this at a young age. My mom, also diagnosed with early on-set Alzheimer‚Äôs at a young age. She was diagnosed around 3 years ago. Like you, I was very young, 22, living at home with my parents. It was definitely a very hard situation and still is, but you have to remember that you still need to live your life because that‚Äôs what your mom would want. Do you have support from other family members? If you do, please make sure you are asking for help because that does take a lot out of you. If you don‚Äôt, please look into caregiving. We actually just looked into the The Alzheimer‚Äôs Association and they helped us with a lot of sources, as well as state funded services that are available to us, I recommend you check that out. I know it may be difficult to do or to accept, but trust me, if you want to live your life (you‚Äôre so young!), you need to accept all types of help. Also, please try and get your family together and figure out ways to help each other, this shouldn‚Äôt fall all on you. Families need to come together during these times.

Also you mention being Hispanic and emotions, I am also a Hispanic and understand how emotions play out and how hard it is to show it. For me (a woman), I can show it more, but I do notice the stress they put on men, but please feel free to use your emotions, explore them, whatever you need to do. I was always told by my family that I am very emotionless to these things, but in reality, I just take time to myself, even if it‚Äôs just in the shower, and release all emotions if I need too. I recommend you do the same. Remember that your mental health is just as important. 

If you need anything, or someone to talk to, please feel free to reach out! I know exactly what you‚Äôre going through and I sympathize with you tremendously.
My family was in denial about my father (including myself) for a long time. He also had severe hearing problems so it was always hard to tell if he couldn't remember things or if he just hadn't heard you in the first place.

The only thing i can say is that it definitely won't help you to bottle up what you're feeling. I don't know your family and I don't know what you're up against, but talking with them to tell them how it's affecting you is important. Don't let everyone dump this on you because you're the youngest. 

Honestly though, I came here looking for help too so I really don't know what else I can say other than that I hope you find some support and maybe even some rest along the way.
I just lost my mom to this horrible disease and I was her only care giver till the end. We delt with this for at least 10 yrs. I finally reached out to a woman on here u/Cathy_Braxton  she has helped me so very much her email is Silverdawn.net@gmail.com she has been helping people for over 25 yrs try and deal and navigate through the rough times. She will talk to you and give you some tips on what to try since every person is different so will work for you and others will not so it is a try and try again disease. I personally know how very hard it was for me to reach out and when I finally did I cant believe how much I should have done it sooner. Hit me up if you have any questions but please if you really want someone to talk to and try to help she is the way to go.
glad that you got away for a while, while it is still ok for her to do that. You will find that as this advances she will get more overwhelmed when you take her out of her familiar surroundings. My mom got to the point that just sitting on the deck outside was too much for her even though she wanted to when she came back in she was disoriented.  Best of luck to you.
all you can do is be there for her and make her feel comfortable. just remember there is no right or wrong and if someone tells you that you should do something cause it works that if you try and it doesnt work for your mom, YOU DIDNT DO IT WRONG. Things that work for some wont work for you. That was one of the hardest things for me to accept. If something doesnt work and it makes her uncomfortable that there is always tomorrow cause she wont remember that what you tried was not good.  I had a really hard time with that and Cathy the lady that I told you about really helped me with that.  Feel free to ask me anything you need cause I went through the whole thing by myself in trying to figure it out. You are not alone. All you can do is love her and keep her safe and some days that will seem like the hardest thing you will ever do.
she is so willing to help. She is still helping me cope. I wish you the best. If you cant get intouch with her let me know. Best of luck and know that you are doing right by your mom.",2021-02-07 02:08:19,almostgreenlantern,lehmx8
,Grandmother obsessed with adopting a pet- need advice!,"I am living with my grandma while working remote. She is in the early stages of Alzheimer‚Äôs- but it is noticeable- and is OBSESSED with getting a dog. She calls shelters all day long, drives to them, and searches online. There is no way she is capable of taking care of a dog- especially when i leave to go back home. 

Does anyone have any recommendations on what to do?? This is a problem I didn‚Äôt expect to encounter! 

PS- she is lucid and WILL KNOW if an animal is fake or not.","Sounds like she wants companionship and I‚Äôd agree having pets for someone with alz or dementia can be dangerous for the animal. I live with my grandpa and we have 2 cats, I basically take care of them but if we run out of food he will try and feed them whatever he can find also in the summer he let them all outside to do whatever which isn‚Äôt safe. 

I‚Äôd try getting her to focus on something else, it‚Äôs hard to get them to break the obsession of certain things or tasks but it can help to distract. 
My grandpa has an obsession with mail and will flip through it for hours if you let him so to fix this I get the mail myself and take care of it all so he won‚Äôt be triggered into that loop.
My grandma also suffers from Alzheimer‚Äôs (stage 2/3). She is extremely sensitive to anything that involves her independence. She loves animals But she isn‚Äôt able to take care of them either. We talked with her prior but we bought her one of those fake cats. She genuinely likes it and realizes that it‚Äôs not a real animal. 

I‚Äôd agree that it sounds like your grandma may need an actual companion. Since she‚Äôs lucid, maybe she can attend virtual events or help her with a phone call to a friend? My grandma struggles using any technology (most recently unplugging TVs) so I understand if that‚Äôs out of the cards. My only last suggestion is documentaries about animals? No idea if that totally misses the mark but maybe you can suggest instead of owning animals we watching/learn about them together? My grandma loves any animal show we put one minus the surgeries haha I wish you luck
My father has Alzheimer's. This is the first time I even though to look on reddit for this sortof thing. 

My father loves dogs, and had one as a young man, but in his later adult life never had one.

I adopted a dog about 3 years ago, and when i bring her over, he comes to life. In fact one of the only times we can have a seemingly normal conversation, is when he's playing with her. 

Definitely am not advocating you have your Grandmother adopt an animal because she most certainly wouldn't be able to care for it, but the impact that my dog had on my father was significant to me, at least. 

Also having my dog there is one of the only ways I can spend time with him without feeling like crying all the rest of the day.
My mother had a dog when she was diagnosed. For a while hole the dog was a blessing. Since dogs will eat anything, I think it is dangerous to get her one. We believe my mother fed her dog a chicken bone or something that killed it. She now lives with me an I have to lock my dog up to avoid my mother feeding it. I am not always successful . I also need to hide my mother‚Äôs meds since she won‚Äôt take drugs. My dog has ended up eating a cookie with THC on it. Although my dog does give her comfort. I also have a cat that she loves. The cat is easier since it will not eat anything other than what we feed her. My mother has her comfort doll with her always.
See if there‚Äôs a therapy dog that could come visit? Or maybe at an adult daycare center, attend a group meeting with a therapy pet? Just throwing it out there. My mom sits and strokes their dog constantly, but I live with them and care for the dog. He is definitely a source of therapy for my Alz mom.
Poor grandma; I totally get it.  My dad has a dog that is the light of his life.  He seems to do well with feeding it, although we suspect that he occasionally feeds him twice or forgets to feed him at all.  We have a system in place to help keep tabs on this but sometimes I‚Äôm sure there is a glitch.  Fortunately, he lives in the back unit of a duplex and my sister and family live in the front (and I live down the block) so we have been able to mostly keep things safe for dad and the dog.  Walking the dog is the highlight of my dad‚Äôs day and also provides needed exercise.  That said, dad has gotten lost a couple of times walking the dog so now we have a gps tracker ‚Äújust in case‚Äù.  (LOL, as I was writing this, I got a notification that ‚ÄúDad left the house‚Äù - must be heading out on his walk!).  If he hasn‚Äôt made it home within an hour, we go on a search.  His dog is getting up there in years and I (kinda) hope he outlives my dad (unlikely) as it will be devastating for him when he loses his dog.  We will definitely get him another one, although the next one will be adopted by my sister and made available to dad.  Between dad, sister and me we have 5 dogs so he always has lots of canine companionship.  When he was more lucid, earlier in the disease, we promised that we would always make sure he had a dog in his life.

I like the suggestion about looking into a visiting therapy dog program.  As it happens, we are in the early stages of training my puppy to be a therapy dog.  Also, maybe you can see if you have any neighbors who have gentle dogs that grandma can walk (probably with someone accompanying her).
My wife was OBSESSED OBSESSED OBSESSED over numerous things these last few years. In the beginning her obsessions would last about six months until she would latch onto something else. Over the time as she declines the time frame is growing shorter for her new obsessions.

My wife also wanted a dog early on, my adult son who lives nearby has a dog so we would watch it for him. She would quickly get bored with the dog and when it went home she would ask me for days every few minutes - where is the dog?, when is it coming back?, why did it have to leave? etc. Now that she can't walk it or make it behave, she doesn't want the dog around.
The dog is my mother's and my savior.  It brings so much joy for her to have the dog around. If you can take care of the dog or cat get one.
My Dad is with me, my husband and our 3 dogs and 2 cats. My very old lady cat stays by Dads side day and night. I pray every day that the cat stays well while he‚Äôs here, she‚Äôs 20 and in end stage kidney disease. He enjoys the dogs, they adore him and have been very kind and gentle with him. But, I have to watch him like a hawk or he‚Äôll give them treats because they‚Äôre starving, nope, they‚Äôre in shape or fat, no happy mediums. There‚Äôs no easily accessible chocolate or harmful to pets food in the house. I give him a bag filled with treats to give them a couple times a day and that makes him happy. Having the cat be his constant buddy has stopped the night thrashing and yelling. Please look into therapy visits, it‚Äôll be so good for your mom.",2021-02-06 12:05:16,nyivy,le1qcs

,"Help, legal advice or any advice welcome and so appreciated","After many years of symptoms (bouts of violence, hiding mail, hoarding trash, forgetting what he was doing or how to do things in the midst of things), my dad was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer‚Äôs about a year and a half ago. He hasn‚Äôt wanted to take any medication, and as such has degraded at a faster rate than we could have expected (this seems pretty standard when reading the posts on here). 

We haven‚Äôt been able to get all of the information for our taxes because he burns any communication from his bank. He is very protective of his retirement money, but he doesn‚Äôt know what to do with it. My mother is thinking about divorcing him, especially because he has been violent for years and the abuse has taken its toll long enough, but will that ensure that we will be able to pay for his care with his own money? He is a veteran, but we don‚Äôt even know how to go about looking for a care facility. I want to help my mom, but it‚Äôs hard because I‚Äôm in dental school still and not as financially literate as I want to be. 

I really don‚Äôt know what to do. Maybe a psychologist to talk to him and help him? Maybe continue the divorce proceedings as planned? I just don‚Äôt know what to do, and every day he gets more violent (pushing me, threatening my mom, etc). 

I want to take care of him but I don‚Äôt know what to do. Should I find legal counsel? Will that be too expensive? Please, please help me help my mom.","I just lost my mom to this horrible disease. The only thing I can think of maybe trying is asking the dr to have something in writing that your mom could become power of attorney because he is not of sound mind to be making discision. You could call an attorney and ask questions on how and what you would need and then maybe they could direct you into how to go abou it. My heart goes out to you and your mom and even your dad cause he really doesnt know what he is doing. My mom got vioent towards the end also. I hope this gives you at least a little direction. Best of luck.
You need an estate lawyer and get powers of attorney drawn up ASAP. Do not let them talk you into a neutral guardian. Also, he‚Äôs a veteran and can be eligible for care at the VA hospitals and later buried at a national cemetery- you will need to get the paperwork for this, it‚Äôs online. You also need a support group, it‚Äôs going to get so much worse with his deteriorating.",2021-02-02 09:17:16,deliciousfieldgreens,lawf8v
,Am I Being Paranoid???,"I've suffered a lot from some anxiety driven paranoia and I need some help dissecting a situation with my dad to find out if it's my paranoia talking or if I should be genuinely concerned. A few nights ago my dad and I were watching Mork and Mindy starring Robin Williams and he was telling me about how Robin Williams killed himself because he had an undiagnosed degenerative memory desiese and be didn't know what was happening to him so he ended his life. It wasn't a conversation I looked too deeply into but this morning my mum said he put the kettle in the sink and wouldn't admit to doing it on the phone. At first I thought he was just being stubborn but now I wondering if maybe he didn't remember? After he got home this evening he was telling me about how he took 4 wrong turns on the way to work which is really unusual for him, he's always really good with directions. I'm starting to wonder if talking about Robin Williams and what happened to him was a hint. It seems ridiculous I know but my dad's a bit autistic and not great with feelings or saying when he needs something and I wonder if this is me overthinking the situation or if my dad is trying to tell me something about what's happening to him? I'm sorry if this is insensitive to people going through the awful experience of this desiese but I would really appreciate any advice or tips people could offer","He may be trying to hint...ALZ can be a very scary thing to come to terms with for the person struggling. I'm curious if you have any family history of ALZ? My grandmother had pretty severe Alz so my mother was always wary and looking for signs. When she started to forget things and noticed a decline she went to the doctor and got tested. She was diagnosed with early-onset Alz and has been participating in drug studies. Maybe try to bring it up to your father while still remaining positive talking about the new possibilities in medicine. 

I would definitely not ignore this but also don't worry too much. Just try to talk to him about it without being accusing. In the beginning, there is often a lot of denial and shame so I would be gentle with him. I hope things go well!
The first signs my mom showed was constantly forgetting things we told her, even if it was the day before. Then it became a problem in my parents‚Äô marriage because my dad thought she was being forgetful on purpose (they‚Äôve always had a rocky marriage). But it finally came down to my mom doing a few tasks the wrong way at work, because she was forgetting, and they fired her, which was so cruel on their part. 

Anyways I‚Äôve been just finding little things here and there. The definitely not remembering. Repeating stories. She doesn‚Äôt drive anymore because she gets lost. I‚Äôve noticed she doesn‚Äôt form sentences correctly. She was wearing the same shirt day after day. 

So just keep an eye out for things like this. And PLEASE understand that if your dad is diagnosed with ALZ, know that it‚Äôs probably way more frustrating for him than it will be for you, so make sure to show patience and grace. In the end it sucks, but your dad will need you if it comes down to it. 

Lots of love my friend üíï
It sounds like you need to get yourself educated. Don‚Äôt wait as it is such a difficult disease. You have a better chance getting legal stuff completed early in the disease and he still has some rational thought processes. It is really hard for victims of the disease to face it. Really, everyone associated with an Dementia patient is a victim of the disease. I am really sorry. Take good care of yourself.

,Hoping for experienced advice,"My mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer's around a year and a half ago. It's agressive. At the time of diagnosis, she was already in the care of my older brother. Our family is not wealthy and myself along with my four brothers were all struggling financially before any of this, so it's been stressful to say the least.
I have struggled to get sober from alcohol, but just hit a year, and I am here with mom to visit and to give my brother a break to take some time off and try to relax. I'm here for two weeks and arrived only two days ago. My brother and I have a tumultuous past to say the least, and there's a lot to unpack there but I won't do that here.
In the week before my arrival, social services was sent to the house after my brother described his anger levels with mom as well as some physical manifestation of it (not hitting her or abusing her, but screaming, snatching things from her, and pushing her into a seat). He's also said some troubling things to me in regards to her and how frustrated he is with her most of the time. Yesterday he said directly front of her that she makes his life miserable. He apologized later. 
About an hour ago, watching television, he got super combative with me for disagreeing with him--something about the inauguration. Accused me of mansplaining, and just generally attacked my character. He's sort of always like that with me, but on a few occasions has physically struck me. 
I'm a larger man and genuinely have no interest in fighting or hurting him or any of my brothers--Ive always been the biggest--especially in front of my mom.
My concern is that being the sole caretaker for our mom has him extremely on edge. I think he knows he is, but would never concede that point to me. But if his stability is threatened, and I feel my mom shouldn't be here, what is my recourse? No one else is capable of taking her in, she receives $1200 a month. My youngest brother and I send $3-400 each a month to help with care, but the truth is that he's in over his head. What do we do if we can't afford a facility? What do I do if I genuinely begin to believe either of their safety is a concern? Is there any resources available for situations like ours?","Caring for someone with dementia is incredibly difficult. Even the most loving patience person will hit their limit. I don‚Äôt know what state you are in, but check with social services to see what they offer. I was able to get my very difficult mother into a daycare. It saved my life. Unfortunately, Covid closed the daycare 14 days short of a year ago. It has been an incredibly difficult year. My family has deserted us. If you can do anything to work together as a family unit  and not fight or blame each other, that is what I‚Äôd recommend. Alzheimer‚Äôs/Dementia is an ugly disease and my life would be much better if the rest of the family understood the disease, how difficult it is and showed some kindness. Bless your brother‚Äôs heart. Until you do it full time you are pretty much clueless how very difficult it is.
Have you talked with social services? They might be able to help with resources. Also would there be a way he could talk to a therapist or even a pastor of some sort they could help him talk through some of it. Also is there any family friends near by that could possibly go over to give him breaks from time time? But social services best bet though.
This doesn't answer your question directly but it might help! Check out the ""Family Caregiver Toolbox"" by the caregiver action network. 

Also, if you want more in depth advice from online caregivers, visit the AgingCare Caregiver Forum. That may be the most active caregiver forum online. (I would provide links but not sure if that is allowed on this subreddit)

Best of luck!
We are going through the same. I would talk to the social worker and we just got hospice involved.
Thanks so much, the forums are awesome! He sees a therapist once a week(that was who notified social services) and I've been planning with him and our other brothers to budget having a person here part time. We can't afford much but it's a break for him that gives him some escape. She's still able to do many things so a nurse isn't absolutely necessary. The social worker suggested we use nextdoor to find someone who can basically just monitor her so he can ha e some freedom. I really appreciate the advice.
I see in the comments that you are looking for someone to come help and I think that's an amazing idea. Oftentimes frustration can erupt when the caregiver is trying to do everyday tasks and being continuously interrupted or distracted. I think taking away some of that pressure could definitely help. I suggest also looking at [Care.com](https://Care.com)!",2021-01-20 11:49:17,JtotheG85,l1cz00

,Next Step Help,"My grandfather has Alzheimer's and currently my grandmother is his main caregiver; they live in Texas and I live in WY. He is becoming violent and belligerent towards her and she is officially scared. I don't know what resources there are to help her. I don't know who she can call for help or what to do. They need to sell their house, I would like to move them up here so they can be close to us and we are better able to help but I don't know what steps to take. Any ideas for resources to help? Thank you.","Alzheimer‚Äôs association of Texas! Call straight away and gather resources. See if you can get some anti-anxiety meds for pops. You‚Äôll need an elder care lawyer if they don‚Äôt have one, but AA should be able to direct you to resources in their area. You can do it! They are lucky to have you.
The only reason i'm chiming in here is because I have very anecdotal experience in this. My father is in the later stages now. My mother is primarily taking care of him, but she does get some help fortunately, both from the rest of us, as well as from a part time nurse who comes by to keep him company.

For a while, the doctor had put him on a new medication, and literally all he would talk about was how he wanted to hit someone. He was always waving his fists at people. One time when he was holding a knife he 'mock-lunged' at his nurse and gave a scary ""Bah!"" She has a bad back, so she hurt herself a bit when she flinched. All of it was very upsetting and seemed to come from nowhere.

We spoke with his doctors and told them that we felt the medication was the issue. They switched his medicine and all of that behavior literally went away. 

I won't lie to you and tell you that the situation is really much better now, but he's not violent anymore. I don't know if this is food for thought or just a waste of your time, but either way I hope you find some help and support.
We had a similar experience. The neuro prescribed Prozac to help with sundowning. She responded horribly, having edgy/anxiety/anger issues. I mentioned it to her PCP who said that is one of the side effects for some users. Recommended we remove it from her regimen. She‚Äôs on something else now & was doing better.",2020-12-13 17:11:27,ulalume83,kck0qu
,Having difficulty dealing with moving my dad with Alzheimers to a memory care center,"In my family and in my culture, we take care of our elderly and disabled. We do not put them in nursing homes. Dad suffered a stroke back in 2013.  In 2017, he was diagnosed with having dementia. Now, we are dealing with full blown Alzheimers. It wasn‚Äôt too bad when we first noticed his memories going a few years back but now we are witnessing a quick decline in him, especially this past year. Besides the memory loss we are also experiencing everything from going to the restroom outside, burning trash in the backyard, throwing away important mail, incontinence to aggressiveness, stubbornness, impatience, paranoia, some hyper sexuality, turning on the stove and oven to cook microwaveable food and forgetting to turn them off, and threats to harm family members when he‚Äôs upset. We are at a point now where we‚Äôre having to make the tough decision of putting him in a home for his safety and those around him. I can‚Äôt seem to shake this guilty feeling causing me a lot of anxiety and depression. I feel Like I failed because I am unable to take care of him when he needs it the most. I look back at being a young child and my parents working their butts off to take care of me and my siblings and now we‚Äôre looking to put him somewhere he‚Äôs not going to be happy with. I know he‚Äôs going to go down even faster when he‚Äôs not surrounded by his loved ones he‚Äôs used to seeing everyday. I really need some help with how to deal with this. It‚Äôs extremely difficult.","I hope everything went well with your dad.. my dad was recently diagnosed with alzheimer and things are getting worse.. my dad is becoming very violent.. my father is on his 70s.. he is still very independent.. we also believe in caring for our elderly.. and we are not at  a point where we can consider for help to take care of him... but I'm very scared to think about it.. same reasons  as you.. I always thought that I will be there for them until the last minute.. and it makes me sad to think that.. that may not be possible. my father went on a trip on February and because of covid they couldn't come back until November.. I feel that when he left he was a whole different person than he is now.. he came back and is like something sucked the life out him.. is it possible that this was already happening and we just didn't notice it and it got worse while he was away? anyways.. I hope things are better for you and your family.
My husband is going through the same. He is working with a therapist, and we got hospice involved for more sedating medication to help with the agitation/aggression. I wish you and your family the best. It‚Äôs very challenging.
My family was going through a very similar predicament and a lot of what you've described was present in my father. Especially the violence. My mother literally said she would try one more visit to the doctor to see if there was anything they could do, and after that we would try to find a facility that could accommodate him. Honestly the very suggestion of it was so upsetting to me I could hardly even think of it.

We were extremely fortunate in that the doctor changed his medication and all of his unusual aggression and violence went away and he became... not his normal self by any means, but just more normal. 

He absolutely could not live alone for even a day. He would wander off and that would be that, but at least we are able to be with him and not worry for ourselves. 

I guess TLDR: maybe see if the doctors can either modify his dosage or suggest anything else he might take instead? 

&#x200B;

Either way i really hope you find some help with this.
My dad passed away last week. He went through all stages I have read here. We took the decision to take care of him by ourselves. After a respiratory disease on December, his situation turned worse. Diapers, moving him and seating, and finally dealing with the wounds proper from keeping him in bed. It is desvastating for the family. BUT, my dad passed away peacefully, with lot of love and caring, and  he felt that. Now,  although he is gone, I have an inner peace as result  that we have done  what had to be done for the person you love.",2020-12-13 00:39:38,Graceful80,kc56pj
,Phantom pains?,"Hi all, new here but curious if there‚Äôs a name for this or if it‚Äôs common? 

I help with my grandfather a few days a week and recently he‚Äôs bumped his arm and caused a bruise that we‚Äôre further investigating to ensure it‚Äôs nothing more.

But since then, he‚Äôs complained of pain in that arm, then it moves to the other, or a single leg.

It seems to move and sometimes in a matter of minutes.

He also says it makes it hard for him to get up or move about then, without talking about it, other times he‚Äôll get up and move around with a burst of energy, anyone else had this? Just making sure if it‚Äôs common?

We‚Äôll continue with the doctors for now all the same.",,2020-12-04 22:49:03,aesiroth,k70gjo
,Liquor Store request not to sell to my brother with Alzheimer‚Äôs in NJ,"  Hello. Does Anyone know of a legal procedure or way for me to get a NJ Shoprite liquor store to refuse sale to my brother with Alzheimer‚Äôs? He is 65 and is an epileptic. Alcohol puts him in a tailspin. My family and I just got him into assisted living and after COVID lockdown there is a bus to the shopping center where the liquor store is. 
 I spoke to the store manager and they were very understanding and could try not to serve him. I could provide them with a picture. 
It‚Äôs the only liquor store in the area and he wouldn‚Äôt be able to figure out how to get a cab or a delivery from another store.
Bottom line I was also told if he caused a scene they may need to sell to him because customers have rights. I understand. I also understand it is a business.
  He is barely walking at this point, confused and clearly has some health/mental issues going on. My sister and I currently have power of attorney not guardianship. Thank you for your help.","I‚Äôm in Victoria, Australia, when I worked in liquor industry we‚Äôd have people present by themselves or with support people, give a photo of themselves and request to be refused service for xx period, that only that support person would be allowed to revoke, and in person only.
We had the support persons contact in case the other person attended and could refuse them entry, considering g them a trespasser.
As far as I‚Äôm concerned that responsible service of alcohol if people have  identified they have an issue and requested that help.",2020-09-26 16:49:47,Sullyvision1,j0dkrn
,"I don‚Äôt have words, but here is my story so far.","As the title says, I just don‚Äôt know what to think or how to feel. Before we get there though, some background.

All through my adolescence, I struggled with anxiety and depression. Only a few months after graduating high school, I quit my job because I‚Äôd lost that structure and I couldn‚Äôt handle the stress any longer. That was in the summer of 2018. I spent most of a year stuck in that downward spiral. Around March of 2019, I noticed that something was seriously wrong with my mother. She had been having trouble for a few years, but there was always enough there to offer other explanations. 

I‚Äôm the youngest of 7 children, and all of my siblings had moved out by that point. My mother had been unemployed since 2008, and my father is always working nearly an hour away. So, I was the one with the most contact with her. For a while, she had been off. But it wasn‚Äôt until I confronted this, and tried to figure out what she was having trouble with, that I figured out something was wrong. 

It was simple. She was trying to make a bagel, and put cream cheese on it. It just didn‚Äôt compute. Even with everything there in front of her. It was like something just wasn‚Äôt clicking. 

Like 2+3=???

I tried to share this with my family, where I could, over the next few weeks. They largely blew off, or understated, my concerns. During Easter Dinner, I was trying to talk to my family when my mom overheard. She blew up at me for ‚Äòbad mouthing‚Äô her, and talking behind her back. She even threw what she new about my own issues back in my face. I didn‚Äôt escalate things, but nobody listened. 

I spent over a year with her. Watching her slowly decline. I learned a lot. I didn‚Äôt have the time to wallow in my own issues. I stepped up, and started taking on more responsibilities. Taking care of my mother as best I could, the animals, and the household. That was until 3 months ago.

As I said, nobody really listened or believed how serious it was. Aside from my father, who was only awake in the evenings for a few hours(leaving for work before anyone else woke up), I was alone. My two sisters made weekly visits, for a few hours. They brought their boys over, and she loved those times at first. But she just kept getting worse and worse.

She‚Äôd have a really bad break down once a week or so.

Then she started having episodes a few times a week.

They got longer and longer, starting earlier in the day, until it became a daily occurrence. 

I couldn‚Äôt calm her. I had no clue what I was doing, and I could only get help sometimes. She didn‚Äôt have a clue who I was, and wouldn‚Äôt believe a thing I said. One of the most common things that came up was prison. 

Sometimes, she said that she wasn‚Äôt supposed to be here and she was gonna get caught by the police and sent to jail. Other times, she would say that she‚Äôs already in jail. Lastly, on the worst days, she would tell me that the cops are coming to take me to jail. 

I couldn‚Äôt get her to eat anything besides breakfast. I couldn‚Äôt get her to drink anything besides at first thing in the morning. When she was having an episode, I couldn‚Äôt get her to sit down and stop wearing out her body. 

It got to the point where I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. Not just her episodes, that were so much worse, but the attitude of my family. Perhaps the worst is my oldest brother, and my father. My oldest brother liked to preach about family, and making sacrifices for your loved ones. He, maybe, visited once over the 13 months that I was caring for my mother. He only lives an hour away. My father, just didn‚Äôt help at all. He was the only person who could calm her down. On Friday evenings, after work, he took to running off with friends and drinking. He often did the same thing, for upwards of 12 hours, on Saturday. Two days back to back. Meaning my only days to unwind were Sundays. Even then, I didn‚Äôt have a way out of the house and he would bother me to give him help. (I have no license, and had no opportunity to get one during this time, and we live out in the country.)

As I said, that all ended about 3 months ago. My mom went running off, but luckily she wound up with the neighbors. The thing was, she was stopping cars in the road. Telling people that she was gonna be killed, and that she had no clue who I was. One of the people she stopped called the cops. Nothing came of it, aside from a lot of stress. None of my family members came around any more often. Whereas my dad set about finding ways to lock the doors, which she couldn‚Äôt unlock. That only lasted a few weeks. 

It was a Wednesday evening. She was having her daily breakdown. My dad was home, but he decided he needed to mow the grass. My mother was just... a total mess. She was having a breakdown, that‚Äôs the only way to describe it. I just don‚Äôt like remembering what it‚Äôs like to go through that. She was tearing the house apart, and yelling out of the windows. It got the point where she started being overtly aggressive towards me, and I even started to fear that she would attack me. I eventually had enough and told my dad as much.

He looked at me with a blank face, in contrast to my demeanor and declaration, and said,‚ÄùAlright, I just need to weed eat.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt really believe it, and I still sort of can‚Äôt. Despite that though, he took my mom to the hospital a few days later. They kept her with them, and she hasn‚Äôt been home since.

I just... even this much is hard. For months, my dad and I had been working with doctors trying to figure all of this out. It just wasn‚Äôt happening. Maybe it‚Äôs just the nature of Alzheimer‚Äôs, maybe it was because of COVID, but it just wasn‚Äôt going anywhere. Taking weeks to schedule any sort of appointment to do any testing. I don‚Äôt know if that was on my dad, on the doctors, or both. I just don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs easier not knowing. Like it‚Äôs been easier for me to not talk to her, and confront how much worse she‚Äôs gotten. 

I just don‚Äôt know how to deal with all of this. Mentally and emotionally. How likely is it that this will happen to me? Her mother died young, and we know nothing about her father. Can I ever take the risk of having kids? Could I ever put my own children through this? What about holding grudges with my family. Some of them have the excuse of being estranged before all of this. My brother though, he went on and on about being a Marine and all that other bullshit, but he did absolutely nothing in the end! What about how literally everyone I told, outright ignored my concerns about this over a year ago!?

I‚Äôve just been not thinking about it. Isn‚Äôt ironic that, focusing on my own life, I‚Äôm in the best state I‚Äôve ever been in my life? I‚Äôve now lost 43 pounds, and my depression and anxiety are at their lowest. I‚Äôve kept up a consistent dieting plan, and have even stuck to the exercise plan I started introducing. 

I just can‚Äôt think about this stuff, though. I feel like letting my thoughts linger on this is liable to break what I‚Äôve built. Like, it‚Äôs so much easier if this just remains ephemeral. Like a bad dream, like it isn‚Äôt real. Right now though? I want to scream, I want to cry, and I want to hit something. It‚Äôs hard to keep my breathing steady, and my hands are faintly trembling. I‚Äôve got this mess of emotions in me, and I don‚Äôt know how to deal with them. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs possible to deal with them. To confront them, and make sense of it all. 

I had to let something out though, this is the first time I‚Äôve laid everything out like this.

My mother turned 58 this year, and I turn 20 in a few months.","First of all, I am so sorry you are handling this practically by yourself. You are so strong, I know how hard it is to see the one who raised you turn into someone else basically. My grandfather raised me, he‚Äôs 78 now. I‚Äôm 23, so I live with him and my grandma so I can help her take care of him. Did your family ever apologize or mention the fact that you were right before your mother‚Äôs signs increased? Sending as much positive energy as I can. I‚Äôm glad your mother has you, but I hope she can get more help for the both of you.
although i cant speak on dealing with thoughts about your mother, just from reading this ur a role model for us, at least for me. as throwras mentioned, u are one damn strong individual. in dealing with your bundle of emotions i would not recommend ignoring it, as im sure it is like putting a bandaid over a shitty tattoo: u might not always see it, think about it, or feel it; but it comes off during your shower, revealing that grievance to you, building up over time as you just stick another bandaid on it. rip the band aid off get that fucking tattoo removed: dissect your emotions on paper, unfinished problems, ill concepts, and rationalize your state. you KNOW that you did the right thing when everyone wasn't. you KNOW that if it wasn't for your resilience, strength, and altruism your mother wouldn't have had anyone. Keep that altruism: internalize what i just mentioned so that you don't need anyone else's validation. let your story be that validation... because it simply is. your unjust and culpable ""family"" wasnt there when your mother AND you needed it, so why pay any attention, waste any breaths, thoughts, or tears over the lack of their appreciation or conscientiousness?  have you turned 20 yet? let that be the big number that marks your shift to not giving a fuck about people who dont give a fuck about you or their mother.
I'm so sorry ... 
My (26) mother (58) got diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's last March. 
I can say that finally getting that diagnosis is hard, even out of covid. They basically need to rule out EVERY other possibility which is... Emotionally strenuous to say the least.
Specialists drag their feet because this dx is depressing and there's not much they can do about it other than slow the progression maybe. 

Even though she doesn't realize it, your mum is so lucky to have you. 
I wish I had more to share. Something to let you know that it gets easier. 
All I can say is that you are NOT alone & I'm glad that your physical and mental is doing well. Please please please continue to take care of yourself first.

I‚Äôm 24 and my father was diagnosed two years ago. I won‚Äôt lie it‚Äôs increasingly more difficult to deal with. I cry constantly and I lose my patience with him and I become guilt ridden. But even though his condition is worsening, I gain new skills and new ways to deal with it. When he has his lucid moments, I quickly realize that even though it doesn‚Äôt seem like it, he‚Äôs still my father. I recall how brilliant he was and the full life he‚Äôs lived, and I feel better. Make sure to have someone to talk to. Always have a support system. It‚Äôs better when you meet people who are in the same boat as you or people that have dealt with grief. When I feel like I‚Äôm going to burst at the seams I walk away, do something relaxing, and I talk to my boyfriend. I immediately feel better and when I have my energy back I go back to the caregiver role. Also, make sure to spend a couple of days a week away from your mother. Even if it‚Äôs just for a couple of hours. You need to realize that you still have your own life and that it‚Äôs not over or anything. Be strong. You‚Äôre not alone. Millions of other families are also trying to navigate this awful illness. Don‚Äôt forget that you‚Äôre NOT alone!
Highly recommend you seek out a therapist or counselor to talk to. Are you taking your mom to doctors appointments, etc.? They can help you too! I got connected to a social worker who is employed by my mom's primary care office and it was SO helpful to just talk to someone about my mom and get support and know I was on the right track (or help pointing to the right one, etc.). In addition to the social worker at the doctor's office, I've sought therapy out with a LPC (licensed professional counselor). My friends were supportive but no replacemen for professional help for myself. 

You're definitely young and it's going to suck - your friends will have absolutely no concept of what you're going through. You might even want to ask any of your friends you're especially close to if their grandparents went through something similar, and ask to speak to their parents if you didn't find that weird (I didn't, with my close friends who I might've already met their parents). It's helpful to talk to someone else who's going through it (like on this board, great job!). 

Take the time to mourn - your mom hasn't died but things will be different moving forward and it's ok to mourn your relationship and how she was before illness set in. Take the time you need to care for yourself (see above about getting therapy). You'll get mad at her and have bad moments but on the plus side she will soon forget and a positive attitude goes very far with people with Alzheimer's.
I‚Äôm 24 and my mother was diagnosed when I was 13/14. I know it‚Äôs terrifying and saddening. I would reach out to your local Alz Org, they are wonderful people and advocates and they can link you up with other local people just like you! If you ever need to chat, feel free to reach out.

,It‚Äôs so hard,"Honestly. She isn‚Äôt with me anymore. My great grandmother passed in 2014. On her birthday. It was also the last time I saw her. This seems like something that should have faded with time but it hasn‚Äôt. She honestly probably comes to mind every 2-3 days if not everyday. I didn‚Äôt deal with it when I was younger. I was 14 at the time. 
I have spent a good deal of my life with my grandparents. If not now my grandfather. 
He loved her too much to put her in a place that could take care of her but was unfamiliar. Or get her a proper nurse. He tried to do it himself but he was approaching 80 and wasn‚Äôt as strong or quick as he was 5 years previously. I was usually there so he really leaned on me to help take care of her. 
It‚Äôs really a mentally exhausting thing to see someone deteriorate like that. It went from one day she couldn‚Äôt remember where the ice cream was. To she started to forget who her sister was. To having to carry her to bed and feed her soft foods because she could no longer chew. I think by that time she had 5 great grandkids. I was the oldest by 6 years. Today she has 13 great kids she‚Äôll never know. Kids that I myself have babysat, fed, changed, and taught to read. My uncle had a baby around the time she was sick. We introduced him to her. He was only a month old. And there was absolutely no recognition on her face. She was blank and empty. Just stared at him not registering who he was. I never had thought about how I‚Äôm the only grandkids who remembers how great she was. My brother is the oldest after me. But he was maybe 10 when she passed but was only 5 or 6 when she started to forget who he was. He doesn‚Äôt have any memory of who she was. 
I wanted to help my grandpa so much. Now when I look back I imagine how hard it would be and how sad that a 14 year old would have to take care of someone in that condition. I had to take her to the bathroom, feed her, put her to bed, take her on walks, or push her wheelchair when she couldn‚Äôt anymore.  
And I wanted to spend time with her while I could. I sat and watched her favorite movie with her on repeat everyday. Cinderella. I still have her copy. She got so much smaller. She shrank so much. You‚Äôd touch her and be afraid she‚Äôd break. And wonder why she would have tears coming out of her eyes. 
My cousin is just a few years younger than me. She never visited but still cried anyway. One thing I never did was cry. Not when she died. 
I remember we all came on her birthday and she laid in bed. Staring at the corner of the ceiling. She barely moved then. The doctors told us it was time to pull the plug. So we said our goodbyes in turns. You can‚Äôt talk to them and get you want to say everything. You just stare at them and try to memorize their face and the way their hands feel because that‚Äôs the last time you‚Äôll see them. Yet you don‚Äôt want to remember them that way. 
It was only a few hours after we went home that they called and said she passed. We went back and it‚Äôs surreal because now she‚Äôs not there. My dad was silent and wouldn‚Äôt talk. My mom was sobbing asking why I wasn‚Äôt. My brother was crying. Everyone was. And we spent the whole day going through photo albums and songs to put up and play at her funeral. 
I ended up sitting next to my grandpa. I couldn‚Äôt look at his face but I could see his hands shaking. I‚Äôll always remember someone who loved shopping. Not for her but for everyone else. You could lose her for hours because she was so short. You had to look under the racks to find her Mary Jane shoes running across the aisles. Her long striped socks. T shirts with honey bees and sunflowers on them. Or her collection of brooches. Who would spend everything on you and tell you not to tell grandpa. Spoiled us rotten. Cooked everything in the cupboard. 
I remember she told me how she met my grandpa. He was born in ‚Äò38 and her ‚Äò42. She was 16. Roller skating on the street and he stopped her. Said she was beautiful and asked her on a date.

,What were the first symptoms?,"My half sister is 75.  She has always been a little difficult to deal with but lately she seems so much more obstinate and defiant than usual.  She is a bit of hypochondriac and takes a lot of medication including pain killers and diazepam.  

In addition, we have different mothers and her mother was placed in a mental hospital many years ago.  I am not sure what I am dealing with here.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a nonreversible type of dementia that progressively develops over many years. It is most likely to occur in clients in their 60s and 70s although, it can be diagnosed as early as 40. AD is characterized by memory loss, problems with judgment, and changes in personality. As the disease progresses, severe physical decline occurs along with deteriorating cognitive functions. 

Mild stage: memory lapses, losing or misplacing items, difficulty concentrating and organizing, trouble remembering names when introduced to new people

Moderate stage: forgetting events of one's own history, difficulty with complex mental arithmetic, changes in sleep pattern, can wander and get lost, can be incontinent, difficulty performing tasks that require planning and organizing

Late stage: losing ability to converse with others, assistance with ADL's, incontinence, losing awareness of one's own environment, eventually loses all ability to move; can develop stupor and coma

The progression of AD can be different for each client. There is no universal scale for stages and manifestations, these that were mentioned are examples.

,"Need with with unique situation: Mother, late 70s with pre Alzheimers, sister 40s with learning disability, Father, late 70s Not helping the situation, all under one roof....with another sister not doing much and pretending everything is ok.","Wanted to share my story, vent, ask for help.... I will try to keep this short. At home, my mom is showing signs of early stage Alzheimers (AD) and she is starting to need constant care. She cannot finish a single task, no taking care of bills, no cooking, doesnt take her meds (for high blood pressure and diabetes), lies and makes up stories that cause more issues, cant remember any short term... the typical for AD list goes on. 

I live 2 hrs away from home, I am doing my best to take care of my mom and family, but run into the usual issues I'm sure many caregivers see, however on top of this, I have a mentally disabled older sibling who needs care too. She can do very basic tasks, skills like a 3rd or 4th grader level, but at the end of the day, needs assistance.   
My dad is very calm and easy going, but he is already maxed out and cannot take living with my mom because all she to him is repeat herself and tell her made up stores and they argue because of something she did (or did not do) and my dad just cant convince her. (we are planning to separate them in the future) 

I think the main question for me is what to do with finances in the future. I have another older sibling that has Power of Attorney (PoA), but she is really not there for my mom or parents. Feels to me she will just be there until something bad happens and she can control whatever in the end. Every time I tell her about something new in my moms behavior or if I see her condition is getting worse, all my sister tells me is ""oh Mom is just tired"", like she doesnt care.  I am home every weekend taking care of my family, I am here now during the Covid-19 crisis taking care of them everyday, I did their 2018 taxes and our business taxes, I cook and clean for them. I am helping prepare the house removing all the old junk they dont use, clean the house. I Pay bills for them, lets just say, im around about 6 times as much as my sister and do 10 times a much work in helping, yet at the end of the day she has control and does nothing.   


Typically my mom has always taken care of finances, now she cannot. at all. What can i do to start helping in getting the finances done. I tried to pay for some late bills, but couldnt access the account because im not my mom. I asked customer service what if I have PoA, and they referred me that I need to submit paperwork so that when that time comes I can have control (something im sure my sister doesnt even know about because again, she doesnt do anything or care)   


We have bills and taxes we need to settle soon, I think my dad has taken care of them while my mom was away for 3 months (went to visit my aunt who is stressed and fed up with my mom now). what can i do in order to gain access to these accounts? do I need PoA too? there was talk that two people can have PoA but my sister said that her friend though it was a bad idea, too much hassle, but if my sister is not doing squat, and im at least helping my family with finances, i feel its better than nothing getting done and getting penalized later. 

What do yall think? any comments would be helpful. There are so many smaller details I want to share, but I can in sub thread. Thank you for reading up until now. 

Im also considering some how moving home? idk how that can help me though, I just got married and my wife has been so awesome through this, never loses her cool when talking to my mom about the same thing over and over. My job has benefits for now, (healthcare for me and wife, dental vision, 401k) not much pay, but the freedom to take care of any person matter is golden right now. If i leave and move home or closer to home, i think it would be harder to find a job, and my career wouldnt go anywhere. but i have trouble dealing with the fact that one day im going to lose my parents and will need to move back home for a bit anyway. Idk... anyone else feel or in this situation can give me some pointers? Thank you in advance, much appreciated.","Hi. I have many of the same thoughts, feelings and frustrations that you do. 

I guess the first thing to say is, you're not alone. Millions of people suffer annually from AD, which means millions more are family that have to cope with it.

I(F33) am currently living with my mother(F63) who has early onset. I have three brothers, and we have been seeing signs for a few years. I said years ago that she should get tested and find any treatment possible to slow down the disease. She is semi-independent, but she needs in person attention almost daily. So I moved back in for covid. 

This is hard. Really hard. Constantly having the same conversation. Following her around so she's safe in the kitchen. Calling doctors, plumbers, mechanics for her. The point is, there are people here who understand. 

The only advice I can give right now about bills is that companies want their money. What I did recently that was helpful, was have my mother call on speaker, say her name and say she had a question. Then I got on the phone and said, ""I'm knucklehead4you, I'm \[my mom's\] daughter. And I was able to talk with her on the line, so to speak, but I was able to schedule, pay, ect.

,Literature on Alzheimers,"Hello everyone, 
A friend of mine has a family member with Alzheimers and is going through a rough period. Any recommendations on some literature about Alzheimers would be really helpful. Thank you!","There‚Äôs a great blog called diary of an Alzheimer‚Äôs caregiver that is full of great information. There is even a downloadable PDF. It‚Äôs very practical. 

A book called contented dementia will help with maintaining quality of life for everyone

Read up on validation therapy

As far as research-type literature, it‚Äôs helpful to learn the stages to know what to expect. 

A good support group can be the best thing ever. Alzheimer‚Äôs association has a number you can call to find one near you. That‚Äôs where the real support is. 

I would also recommend finding a geriatrician MD if at all possible - they really GET IT. Regular MDs kinda don‚Äôt, usually.  A good MD can get you OT and PT when needed. PT to stay strong and flexible, OT is good for continuing to find meaningful activities and also helpful equipment and useful strategies to help everyone. 

I wish your friend the best of luck. It‚Äôs a really hard journey that is full of surprises - but not all of them are bad. My loved one is in later stages but in so many ways she is still SO herself.
It‚Äôs a pleasure to share! It‚Äôs hard work learning everything as needed. I soaked it up when I was trying to pick it up. OH YEAH an estate or elder are lawyer would be very worth consulting to arrange for Medicaid coverage. Will make a HUGE DIFFERENCE later on when it comes to getting the right care and potential long term care facilities. Sooner better than later. Also line up the health care proxy, power of attorney, and will if needed. It‚Äôs a bunch of stuff, but some people get a lot of peace knowing that everything is squared away. Of course I would recommend you don‚Äôt do it all in a day lol",2020-01-25 15:44:10,IM_N,etwbg5
,Transitioning to a Memory Care Community: How You Can Help Your Loved Ones,"When your mom or dad‚Äôs [dementia](https://thekensingtonfallschurch.com/dementia-care-community/) or [Alzheimer‚Äôs](https://thekensingtonfallschurch.com/alzheimers-care-community/) care requires more than you can reasonably provide, it might be time to start thinking about transitioning to a [memory care](https://thekensingtonfallschurch.com/memory-care/) community. [A variety of memory care levels](http://thekensingtonfallschurch.com/senior-living-memory-care/) exist, from providing simple medication reminders to full care communities assisting residents with bathing, dining, and ensuring they won‚Äôt get lost. Before considering a move like this, be sure to verify your loved one matches behavior associated with [the early signs of Alzheimer's and dementia,](https://thekensingtonfallschurch.com/signs-alzheimers/) and consult a trusted physician.

## Transitioning to a Memory Care Community

The first thirty days can be the most difficult as you and your parent work through the shift from independent living to a memory care community. In many cases, your loved one may not always remember why the move is a good idea and might become upset or argumentative. Being patient but firm, and leaning on the staff and administration at your chosen community for help, can aid you through this process and make your mom or dad feel at home.

## Explore Before the Move

Taking your mom or dad to enjoy lunch or recreational activity at their chosen memory care community can help give them familiarity with the building, grounds, staff, and other members of the residence. Associating positive feelings and memories with the community can make it easier for them to feel at home once they move in. You can also discuss various Alzheimer‚Äôs care options with the staff, and see how other residents enjoy their lives in the community setting.

## Share Information with Staff

The caregivers at your loved one‚Äôs chosen senior living community should have as many questions for you as you do for them. Be prepared to tell them as much as you can about your parent‚Äôs life and interests. Knowing which foods they like and dislike, what things they were passionate about when they were young, and other personal pieces of information about your mom or dad can help staff personalize your parent‚Äôs care.

## Initiating the Actual Move

The chaos of moving can be even more confusing and disorienting to a loved one living with dementia or Alzheimer‚Äôs. Having one friend or family member spend the day with your parent while the rest of you arrange the setup of their new room can help.

Choose belongings carefully to create a space that feels familiar as well as offering staff insight into your parent‚Äôs personality and interests. Focus on items with personal value and sensory input, like a soft quilt or family photos.

## Take Time to Visit Frequently

Years ago, the standard recommendation was for family and friends to stay away for the first week or after transitioning to a memory care community. At The Kensington Falls Church, we encourage family members to visit our[ memory care communities](https://thekensingtonfallschurch.com/memory-care/) frequently, and even have a pet-friendly policy so you can enjoy time with the entire family while your loved one adjusts.

By planning visits for a specific time of day, you can create a defined routine helping your mom or dad get used to the idea of you coming, leaving, and reliably coming again.

## Adapt your Interactions

Understanding memory loss can help you learn how [Alzheimer‚Äôs](https://thekensingtonfallschurch.com/alzheimers-care-community/) and [dementia](https://thekensingtonfallschurch.com/dementia-care-community/) affect behavior.

You may need to adapt the way you interact with your loved one. If they insist an impossible event took place, or that a fact (like the year) is different than what you know to be true, realize that this is their reality. Arguing may only lead to unnecessary unhappiness. Instead, enjoy listening to their stories and find small, meaningful activities to do together, such as sharing a meal or going for a walk around the grounds.

## Practice Self-Care

It‚Äôs important to take care of yourself to make the most out of your time together. If you are experiencing grief or frustration, there is a good chance they will also pick up on your emotions and become upset. You may want to consider talking with a friend or therapy professional about your feelings as a way to work through your role in the transition.

The better you care for yourself, the better you‚Äôll be able to help take care of your mom or dad.

## Know that it Gets Easier

The initial transition into a memory care community can be challenging, and at times your loved one may say or do things that are hurtful. But remember, it isn‚Äôt personal.

They are coming from a place of uncertainty, confusion, and frustration. Accept that their unhappiness is temporary. They will have good days and difficult days.

By attending to their care with compassion and love, you are ensuring that they are safe and will continue to have every opportunity for a fulfilling life beyond dementia.

Find out more about how The Kensington Falls Church can help your mom or dad transition to the highest level of independence without compromising their safety.

,My Dad is making everything worse.,"I genuinely don't know what on Earth to do anymore. Before I get into everything, let me give you a little background on myself. I'm 18 years old living in a household with my Mother, my Father, four cats, and recently my Grandmother. I'm in my last year of highschool so I've been super busy with school and basically getting ready for college. But besides that, I'm having a problem that I literally have no clue how to fix. My Grandmother has been diagnosed Alzheimer's for a little over 5 years now, and she's only been living with us for about 9 months. She hasn't been too bad or anything, she actually has been doing amazing lately, but my Dad sees her as this burden. He always makes it seem like my mother and I never help him out with her (even though he leaves me for a day or two while he's hanging out with a friend at a brewery or something) and he constantly says how he is frustrated with life. The worst part is that it is now influencing my grandmother, having her say ""I want to die"" and ""No one wants me around"". What am I supposed to do in this situation? I know I'll be leaving for college soon, but I don't want to leave my mother in a toxic environment like that. How do I make him see that he is effecting the whole house with his attitude?","I suggest you contact the Alzheimer‚Äôs association. They will be able to direct you to support groups in your area as well as what services are available for your grandmother.

,Ever have a moment of ptsd years after caring for an individual with alzheimers?,"I was changing my daughter‚Äôs diaper and got some of her poop under my fingernail. When I looked down and saw it, it was like having a vietnam flashback. 

My sister and I did a majority of the day time caretaking for my grandmother while we were in college and my mother took over before work and after she‚Äôd get home at night. 

I used to pick up my grandma from her adult day care (only way to have someone at least watch her while we had class) and her fingernails would be full of poop. She‚Äôd put her hands out to try and touch my face when she noticed me finally but i‚Äôd always have to duck and move to not get poop face until I could wrangle her into the bathroom and scrub her nails. 

Well when I saw my daughter‚Äôs poop under my thumbnail, I instinctively did my little duck under and put my hand up to cover my face. After a second I realized what I did and cried a little. 

This sub isn‚Äôt active and I just wanted to type out my feelings right now. If anyone out there is caring for a family member or has cared for one my heart goes out to you.  ",Hello,2019-02-07 09:33:38,Chokezilla,ao4bdq
,what a rough day,"Typing this out just to vent. It's been a hell of a day. Quick background. My dad died suddenly almost 2 years ago and we found out mom was farther along with Alzheimer's than we'd known. I've spent the last two years helping as best as I can, and we finally got her moved into Assisted Living a month ago. But I feel terrible. I've taken here out of a familiar house (~45 years), taken her dogs away (she really couldn't care for them properly) and the new place is great with awesome staff and good food, but it's just not what she's used to. The transition is not going well. Today we've been called by nursing staff twice. First time, I was already on my way up with her dog and we had a great afternoon. She seemed in great spirits and we walked the dog, talked, everything seemed good. Late tonight we got a call again. she's upset, bad headache, talking about wanting to kill herself. I feel like I had to get her out of a 'living alone' situation. But I can't help feeling like I've messed everything up. We've sunk like 15K into the assisted living so far. I'm trying to sell her house to help fund things for the next several years. But if it's not working then I have no idea what to do. Part time home care, live in home care, moving in with me or siblings, me or siblings moving in with her... all these options were weighed and I thought we made the best choice.
How do you stop yourself from despair when the plans you make don't seem to work out? I feel like I've messed everything up and there is no hope. What a terrible disease. It just eats up everything and everyone. I can't believe how few options there seem to be and how bloody expensive it all is. Most days all she wants to do is end it all and we can't even help her go out on her own terms. I feel like I've tried my hardest and failed spectacularly. How do you all do it?",I don‚Äôt know but perhaps at the two month mark things will be better? ,2018-12-15 22:49:02,negativetrajectory,a6lyhr
,Mum seems to have Alzheimer‚Äôs and I don‚Äôt know what to do!,"TLDR: mums getting further into Alzheimer‚Äôs and I have no family to ask for help - what steps do I take? Ps it‚Äôs awkward cause mum and I aren‚Äôt that close...

So I‚Äôm 24 female and my dad past away last year. Mum‚Äôs (62) been developing early symptoms of alzheimers in the last 3-4 years but is now getting worse. 

I don‚Äôt have any family I can contact to help me - I don‚Äôt know what to do in terms of getting her assessed or anything! I‚Äôve been trying to research but I‚Äôm scared off because if I act too soon she might rage at me and threaten to kick me out. 

My parents were in a domestic abusive relationship for my entire life - my mum being the abuser - I cop a lot of the shit now that dads passed but what use to be cruel is now just bizzare behaviour coupled with really bad memory loss and basic functioning on the decline - so I‚Äôm not so much being abused as I am concerned for her own wellbeing and sanity. 

She has plenty of money so she‚Äôs been able to get by with just sitting around for years doing nothing - meaning no outside pressure or responsibility for her condition to be tested by others. 

I‚Äôve got no idea what to do, it‚Äôs so awkward and weird considering my relationship with her is only just started to improve. 

She can‚Äôt even remember core elements of my teen years or things she use to do everyday in routine! She can‚Äôt remember big holidays we went on, no memory of visiting other countries or birthday parties we had. Some days she will say ‚Äúwas it yesterday that you walked the dog or today‚Äù when I walked the dog only two hours ago. 

She‚Äôs extremely negative, will constantly look out the windows and verbally judge the neibours in a very creepy way. A few days ago she told me she waited till the neibours left home so she could go have a ‚Äústicky beak‚Äù at their yard - she hopped their fence to get in.... Then explained how horrible and dirty their house was. The next day she went up the back of our property and said she was looking down into their house to watch what they do at night....she also mentioned watching the man of that household leave to go do groceries asking suspiciously ‚Äúwhere does he go that idiot‚Äù.

My mum has always been negative and horrible but she has never been THIS stalkerish...sigh I feel like this is crossing the line into a stage that I need to get checked but I really don‚Äôt know what to do or where to start :( 

P.s. she does this really strange thing where she laughs for 10mins at a time really loud and it doesn‚Äôt even sound like a laugh. When I ask her what is so funny she won‚Äôt tell me...it‚Äôs scary :( 

I hope what I have written does not offend anyone - I‚Äôm not trying to be insensitive I‚Äôm just feeling really alone and helpless in this situation. I‚Äôm dealing with someone who has never really been a mother to me so it‚Äôs hard to connect to her in good health let alone bad.

,Switch flipped,"My mom has Alzheimer‚Äôs. She‚Äôs 83. I am her only  caregiver, mentally, physically, financially. I‚Äôve taken care of my mom my whole life.  She was married to Satan and had his 3 spawns.  Monday she was put in hospice for major anxiety. My mom is a type B personality. Happy, always smiling. Shes has episodes of sleepless, Some as long as 5 days but this episode was different.  She‚Äôs between stages 7 & 8. Monday she woke up paranoid that ‚Äúthe man‚Äù was trying to kill her. The CNA  saw it right away.  The hospice nurse gave her enough meds to be in a semi coma state. She slept and usually after sleeping and her mind resting she is back to her ‚Äúnormal‚Äù self.  This time, I don‚Äôt recognize her. Her eyes are glazed over, she‚Äôs talking, holding conversations and speaking in Cajun French.  She no longer recognizes me (which has devastated me) I‚Äôm so lost! I‚Äôve only lost 1 other person in my life that has devastated me to my core.  On top of all of this, in May I lost my work from home job and my unemployment finished last week.  All my savings is gone! My mom collects $36 in food stamps and without unemployment insurance the money I collected paid the bills. Now with just her as SSI to pay rent, her medical insurance and electricity, I‚Äôm financially at $0 in my bank account. In order to survive I need at least $750.  That would pay my car insurance, gas, cellphone bill & provide me with the necessities to take care of my mom when she‚Äôs back home.  Satan‚Äôs 3 spawns have their own liv s to lead and don‚Äôt help. They know the situation and don‚Äôt care.  They don‚Äôt care that I‚Äôve given up my life to take care of her!! The even bigger crap is That she makes $700 a year too much in social security to qualify for Medicaid which would allow me to get someone to watch her while I work or put her in a nursing home, where she‚Äôll be sedated every day until she passes! 
My head hurts, my heart is devastated and I don‚Äôt have money to buy a soda!!  Our government has failed my mom.

Not saying that this will work but have you tried calling some nursing homes? I know some bigger chains have a policy against turning people away. Hope this helps! 
Try talking to the social security office. They helped me by adding a bit to my dads SS to help pay for prescriptions or have his Medicare supplemental ins come right out of the SS. ",2017-11-23 00:21:02,blumarg,7exbzg
